    "Rich Hiden's voice was shaking as he spoke to BBC Radio Scotland in June 2021.\nJust two days before, the Scottish Crannog Centre on Loch Tay had lost its key artefact, a recreation of an Iron Age dwelling house.\nBuilt by archaeologists 25 years before, it was consumed by fire in just six minutes.\nRich, the centre's operations manager, said at the time: \"It's devastating and heart-breaking for all the staff but we will go forward from this.\n\"The timescale is hard to say. We need to get past these first few days but we will rebuild, and we'll need a thousand hands to help us.\"\nLess than three years on, the Scottish Crannog Centre has risen again from the ashes. The site is 12 times the size of the original, further along the loch side in Dalerb in Perthshire.\nThe museum collection - which was untouched by the fire - is now housed in a new single storey building, next to a caf\u00e9 and bookshop and it all opens out into the main attraction: a living, working Iron Age village. \nStaff and volunteers worked against the clock, ahead of the Easter weekend opening but this museum will never be completely finished. That's part of the design.\n\"It always will be a work in progress,\" says Mike Benson, the director of the centre.\n\"We used local materials like reeds, hazel, turf, heather and stone and that should last a number of years but once they're worn, we'll put them back into the ground and gather new materials which we are already growing across the road from the site.\n\"That's how we keep the skills alive. That's how we keep the place alive.\"\nThe plight of the centre caught the imagination of people from around the world.\nIn the days after the fire, many got in touch to donate money or to offer practical support. Volunteers were back on site within days and the museum continued to operate on a reduced scale.\n\"I went to the Crannog Centre one morning three years ago to buy a book as a present for someone and walked out a volunteer,\" says Maureen Kerr.\n\"It was a total shock to me as I know nothing about the Iron Age.\"\nThree years later, like everyone else who has worked on this project, she has amassed a huge knowledge of the era. Staff and volunteers are encouraged to try out every skill.\nToday blacksmith, Tom Timbrell is showing two staff members how to make cloak pins and belt hooks.\n\"I'm teaching them how to forge, how to be blacksmiths, but doing this all in an Iron Age setting. So we've got a set of hand pump bellows on an Iron Age forge to recreate items from archaeological finds.\"\n\"It's not just making something for the sake of making something. They can keep developing their skills and start making tools that can be used on site by other craftspeople.\"\nThat sustainability is important to the Scottish Crannog Centre. And it's what's allowed their \u00a34m project to be up and ready in under three years.\n\"People talk about crowd funding, but it was more than that,\" says Mike Benson, who was a steel worker for 28 years before joining the museum sector.\n\"It was a wave of support, and it gave us momentum. It put the wind in our sails to make this happen.\"\nThe one thing missing from the new museum is a crannog. Three thousand years ago, scores of the stilted dwelling houses would have been found on Loch Tay.\n\"We plan to start building a crannog in May, and visitors can see it in progress,\" says Mike.\n\"Eventually, we hope to have three crannogs but I think we've done enough now to let folks come in and see what we've been up to.\"\n And what would the original Iron Age villagers have made of this 21st century community?\n\"A key question we ask volunteers is what would you like your ancestors to think of you?\" says Mike.\n\"And I think they'd have been chuffed and proud. \nThey'd probably tell us we got a lot of things wrong but I think we've done them justice.\"",
    "A cafe set up to help homeless people in Liverpool is feeling the strain the cost of living crisis has put on people's ability to support it. \nThe Paper Cup Project's cafe in Liverpool city centre runs a pay it forward scheme for customers to donate food and drink for rough sleepers.\nBut founder Michelle Langan said as customers had been feeling the pinch, donations had suffered.\nShe said the cafe's utility bills had risen 300% since it opened in 2022.\nDemand, however, was increasing.\n\"It's understandable that people have not got as much money to spend, which is having a bit of a knock-on effect on the pay it forward,\" she said. \n\"There's also the fact that we are seeing more people who are experiencing homelessness, and they want to access the services we provide.\"\nMs Langan said \"all we can do is hope that people will still be able to find that extra little bit of money to help us\". \nAs well as providing hot food and drinks, the cafe offers people who have been living on the streets the opportunity to work and potentially boost their chances of finding long-term employment. \nBut Ms Langan said one of the most important things about the cafe, in Queen Square, was that it was \"a place where they can come and sit for a bit and have space where they can relax\".\nEmma, who is homeless, told BBC News the cafe was \"amazing\".\nShe said: \"The first time I was homeless I was dead scared of coming here but they made me feel so welcome.\n\"People don't know how hard it is being on the streets, how terrifying it is being homeless, being hungry and dirty.\"\nEmma said the \"basket in the corner with clothes in\" meant homeless people like her were able to find something fresh to wear. \nDavid, who also visits the Paper Cup Project cafe, described it as \"absolutely brilliant\", adding: \"Homeless people can come in in the morning for toast and a coffee and a bit of warmth and stay here for a few hours.\"\nHe said he was thankful to the people who took part in the pay it forward scheme.\nMs Langan said she hoped the cafe and the service it provides would weather the storm.\nShe said: \"I hope we'll still be able to do all this in another year. \n\"We'll just have to take the next few months as they come.\"\nWhy not follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X and Instagram?

    "A senior Ulster University academic has said sending information on LGBT Pride to students at its Qatar campus is \"highly problematic\".\nProf Odette Hutchinson said that while the university should celebrate Pride, it needs to be \"cognisant of different cultural expectations\".\nHuman rights campaigners urged the university not to have \"double standards\" on freedom of expression.\nUlster University said it is committed to \"equality, diversity and inclusion\".\nThe university established a partnership in Qatar with City University College in 2020 to offer a range of degree courses to students in its capital city Doha.\nThe link-up has faced criticism due to the Middle Eastern country's record on human rights. Homosexual acts are illegal in Qatar because they are considered immoral under Islamic Sharia law.\nProf Hutchinson, Ulster University's pro vice chancellor on academic quality and the student experience, made her remarks during a committee meeting in February.\nA pro vice chancellor is a senior role which is effectively a deputy head of a university.\nThe committee was discussing the idea of tailoring communications to staff and students to be more specific to each campus.\nA transcript of the meeting, seen by BBC News NI, recorded that Prof Hutchinson said Doha has \"some very different cultural norms and expectations\" and some emails sent to all staff and students had caused \"political and cultural sensitivity\".\nProf Hutchinson said that \"sending things that relate to Pride, for example, to Doha as you can probably imagine is highly problematic now\".\nShe said that while the university should celebrate Pride, \"we do need to be cognisant of different cultural expectations\".\nAnother staff member responded, saying the university's communications system was \"clunky\" and she would \"fully agree\" there were \"areas of concern with some messages\".\nPatrick Corrigan from Amnesty International said the university appeared to be \"unwilling to even mention Pride in its communications with students and staff at the Doha campus\".\n\"This looks very much like double standards - with a commitment to human rights and equality at home which then apparently gets jettisoned as soon as these come into contact with the harsh reality of discriminatory laws in Qatar,\" he said.\nMr Corrigan urged the university to explain how it \"safeguards the freedom of expression of its staff and students in Qatar\".\nProf Hutchinson and Ulster University (UU) were approached for comment.\nIn a statement, a university spokeswoman said: \"In all our communications we are mindful and respectful of religious and cultural differences.\n\"Student communications tend to be related to events and activities on campuses so they are segmented to be shared with students on the relevant campus. For example, an event in Coleraine would not be relevant for comms to all students on all campuses.\"\nThe spokeswoman added: \"We are clear on our commitments to academic freedom and freedom of expression.\n\"LGBT+ rights are central to Ulster University's commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion.\n\"All UU students, regardless of location, are welcome to access mental health, wellbeing, disability and/or financial support through the Student Wellbeing team, who have been trained in LGBT+ awareness and work in partnership with a variety of LGBT+ organisations to ensure that UU students can access any specific support they might need.\"\nIt is not unusual for universities in the UK, including Northern Ireland, to establish campuses or partnerships with universities elsewhere.\nAll universities have to have an eye on their worldwide links, as a way of sharing research and attracting expertise as well as international students, who pay much higher fees than local students. \nQualifications from universities here like UU and Queen's University are also in demand globally. \nQueen's, for instance, had previously established a partnership with a university in Saudi Arabia and has a longstanding medical campus in China.\nA number of other UK universities also have campuses or university partnerships in middle eastern countries like Qatar, Dubai, Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates.\nBut practices or campaigns that are fairly routine on campus in the UK can sometimes clash with different cultural expectations elsewhere.",
    "Israel's military has pulled out of al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City after a two-week raid that has left most of the major medical complex in ruins.\nGaza's Hamas-run health ministry said dozens of bodies had been found and locals said nearby areas were razed.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had killed 200 \"terrorists\", detained over 500 more and found weapons and intelligence \"throughout the hospital\". \nThe IDF said it raided al-Shifa because Hamas had regrouped there.\nThe two-week operation saw intense fighting and Israeli air strikes in nearby buildings and the surrounding area. \nWards were attacked because Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad operatives were using them as a base, the IDF said, accusing them of fighting inside medical departments, setting off explosives and burning hospital buildings. \nImages published following the Israeli withdrawal showed Palestinians walking near the charred main buildings with chunks of wall missing and carrying bodies wrapped in blankets. Graphic photos showed corpses partially exposed on the churned ground.\nThe health ministry said dozens of bodies, some decomposed, had been found in and around the medical complex, which was now \"completely out of service\".\nA doctor told AFP news agency more than 20 bodies had been recovered, some crushed by withdrawing vehicles. \nA spokesperson for Gaza's Hamas-run civil emergency service said Israeli forces had used bulldozers to dig up the grounds of the complex and exhume buried bodies.\nThe Hamas government media office said Israeli forces had killed 400 Palestinians in al-Shifa and the surrounding area, including a female doctor and her son, who was also a doctor. \nIn an update, IDF Spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said the IDF had taken \"special efforts not to harm any patients, any medical staff, or any civilians in the area. \n\"Patients who remained in the compound were provided with medical supplies and water.\"\nHe added that 200 people he described as \"terrorists\" had been killed. Over 900 people were detained, of whom more than 500 were, he said, subsequently found to be affiliated with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad - which Israel, the UK and other countries proscribe as terrorist organisations. Interrogation of the suspects had yielded \"significant intelligence\", he added.\nEarlier, the IDF said \"forces found large quantities of weapons, intelligence documents throughout the hospital, encountered terrorists in close-quarters battles and engaged in combat while avoiding harm to the medical staff and patients\".\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said on Sunday night that 21 patients had died, with patients moved a number of times and held without medical care. \nDr Amira al-Safady at al-Shifa told the BBC's Gaza Lifeline radio that about 16 people who were in the intensive care unit died after being moved, because she and other doctors no longer had the equipment to treat them. \nThree days later, troops told medical staff to bury them outside, she said. \nThe IDF has been asked for comment. It says troops set up temporary infrastructure for medical treatment at al-Shifa, with video showing troops setting up a small number of beds.\nPatient Barra al-Shawish told Reuters news agency that the Israeli troops had allowed in a \"very small amount of food\". \"No treatment, no medicine, nothing, and bombing for 24 hours that didn't stop and immense destruction in the hospital,\" he said. \nSome of the patients were being moved to al-Ahli hospital, about 3km (1.8 miles) to the south-east, a medic at al-Shifa told Reuters.\nGaza's hospitals have been a main focus of the current war, with thousands of Palestinians seeking shelter from Israeli bombardment in their grounds and Israeli forces storming the facilities because they say Hamas fighters are present there.\nIsrael has long accused Hamas of using civilian health infrastructure as a cover to launch its operations, which the group denies. \nTwo weeks ago, it took hundreds of Israeli forces just a few hours to approach and enter the Gaza Strip's largest hospital. That was in marked contrast to their first controversial raid there in November, when it took several weeks for large numbers of tanks and vehicles, backed by heavy air strikes, to close in on the site.\nFor supporters of the Israeli military, this has been evidence of the gains it has made during the war and its tactical success, launching a surprise attack on the enemy to strike it hard. An IDF spokesman previously referred to the operation as \"one of the most successful of the war so far\" because of the intelligence gleaned, as well as numbers killed and detained.\nHowever, some commentators suggest the second al-Shifa raid highlights flaws in Israel's military strategy for the war. They argue that it shows the ease with which Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters were able to regroup after Israel pulled its forces out of northern Gaza and the urgent need to come up with a convincing post-war plan to govern the",
    "An unearthed collection of Viking combs is \"extraordinary and unique in the UK\", according to archaeologists.\nThe antler and bone finds were discovered in Ipswich, Suffolk, during 40 excavations over the course of 20 years.\nAuthors Ian Riddler and Nicola Trzaska-Nartowski said they included \"an extraordinary sequence of Viking combs unmatched elsewhere in the country\". \nThey indicate the presence of Vikings in Ipswich in the late 9th Century.\nRiddler and Trzaska-Nartowski are among the authors of a recently published analysis of 1,341 finds and 2,400 fragments of waste unearthed during digs between 1974 and 1994.\n\"It was always our intention that the book had a European outlook and placed Ipswich in the centre of a developing early medieval world for one particular craft,\" they said in a statement about the analysis.\n\"There are several items that indicate links abroad, particularly northern France, Frisia (what we now know as parts of the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark) and southern Scandinavia.\"\nIpswich was founded as an Anglo-Saxon trading port in the wake of the collapse of the Roman Empire and prospered through maritime trade with Europe.\nThe combs were made in Scandinavia and they indicate the presence of Vikings in Ipswich in the late 9th Century - it fell under Viking rule in AD869.\nCombs were also made in the town and had \"distinctive local forms\", according to the Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service.\nMost were made from fragments of red deer antler, although some were made from bone, including whale. \nBrooch moulds, pins, strap-ends, weaving and textile-making equipment, as well as some gaming pieces - reflecting Viking enthusiasm for board games - were also examined.\nMelanie Vigo di Gallidoro, Suffolk County Council's deputy cabinet member for protected landscapes and archaeology, said: \"With one collection of finds in isolation, we might not have the confidence to recognise their importance. \n\"But in this case, with around 40 excavations in Ipswich over 20 years, we can build a convincing picture of the role that the town played in medieval life.\"\nWill Fletcher, East of England development advice team leader, Historic England, said it was a \"fascinating insight into Ipswich's medieval history... and its reach across the North Sea\".\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Turkey's main opposition party has claimed big election victories in the main cities of Istanbul and Ankara.\nThe results are a significant blow for Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who had hoped to regain control of the cities less than a year after he claimed a third term as president.\nHe led the campaign to win in Istanbul, where he grew up and became mayor.\nBut Ekrem Imamoglu, who first won the city in 2019, scored a second victory for the secular opposition CHP.\nMr Erdogan had vowed a new era in Turkey's megacity of almost 16 million people, but the incumbent mayor of Istanbul secured more than 50% of the vote, defeating the president's AK Party candidate by more than 11 points and almost one million votes.\nThis was also the first time since Mr Erdogan came to power 21 years ago that his party was defeated across the country at the ballot box.\nIn the capital Ankara, opposition mayor Mansur Yavas was so far ahead of his rival on 60% that he declared victory when fewer than half the votes were in. Supporters blocked all the main roads in the city, waving flags and sounding their car horns.\nThe CHP - the Republican People's Party - won again in Izmir, Adana and the resort of Antalya. Significantly it also gained control of Turkey's fourth-biggest city Bursa and Balikesir in the north-west, as well as Adiyaman, which hit hard by last year's double earthquake in the south-east.\nPresident Erdogan, 70, acknowledged the election had not gone as he had hoped, but he told supporters in Ankara it would mark \"not an end for us but rather a turning point\".\nHe has always relied on the \"people's will\" for his authority and he told supporters he would respect the electorate now too.\nUnder Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's presidency has amassed sweeping powers, replacing the prime minister. But in the cities, directly elected mayors still have considerable influence.\nDuring the election campaign, Mr Erdogan said this would be his last, because his presidential term ends in 2028. \nBut critics believed that victory would have encouraged him to revise the constitution so he could stand again. After such a dramatic defeat that is looking very unlikely.\nPolitical scientist Berk Esen said the opposition CHP had delivered the \"biggest election defeat of Erdogan's career\" and come up with its best results since 1977.\nThe outcome was a big success for the chairman of the CHP, Ozgur Ozel, who praised voters for deciding to change the face of Turkey in a historic vote: \"They want to open the door to a new political climate in our country.\"\nCrowds in Istanbul gathered outside the town hall in Sarachane, one of Istanbul's oldest districts. \nThey waved Turkish flags and banners showing Ekrem Imamoglu's picture alongside Turkey's founding father Kemal Ataturk, whose poster was draped down the walls of the local authority building.\n\"I can say that our citizens' trust and faith in us has been rewarded,\" said Mr Imamoglu.\nBoth he and Mansur Yavas are seen as potential candidates to run for the presidency in 2028. \n\"Everything will be fine,\" Imamoglu supporters chanted as they danced to drums and clarinets in Sarachane, one of Istanbul's oldest districts. \nIstanbul's incumbent mayor had first used the slogan when he won the city from Mr Erdogan's party five years ago. Some of the banners in Sarachane used his current slogan, \"Full speed ahead\".\n\"They're only local elections but the opposition's victory in big cities is a significant show of force against the ruling party,\" Imamoglu supporter Yesim Albayrak, 25, told the BBC.\nMehmet Bankaci, 27, told the BBC there was a need for change in Turkey: \"If Imamoglu or Mansur Yavas had been the CHP candidate in last year's presidential election, they definitely would have won.\" \nIstanbul hosts a fifth of Turkey's population of nearly 85 million people. Control the city and you control a significant portion of Turkey's economy including trade, tourism and finance.\nFive years ago, Mr Imamoglu overturned years of AK Party rule in Istanbul with the backing of other opposition parties. But that opposition unity fell apart in the wake of last year's presidential election defeat and the AK Party had high hopes of overturning his 2019 victory.\nAhead of Sunday's election, the vote had been seen as too close to call, with a strong challenge from AK Party candidate Murat Kurum.\nBut the ruling party has been unable to shake off an economic crisis that has seen inflation rates of 67% and interest rates at 50%. \nWhile broad swathes of the west, south and north of Turkey are now under the control of the opposition CHP, the pro-Kurdish Dem party has won control of much of the south-east. \nMr Erdogan's AK Party continues to dominate central Turkey and had more success in areas of the south-east devastated by the February 2023 double earthquake, including the cities of Kahramanmaras and Gaziantep, although it did lose control of Adiyaman.\nSpeaking from the balcony of his party headquarters in Ankara, he promised to use the fou",
    "Police have said they saw evidence of youths preparing petrol bombs before an illegal dissident republican parade in Londonderry.\nA van was set on fire and motorists were advised to avoid the area after the parade in the Creggan area on Monday.\nSeveral hundred people marched through Creggan, led by about a dozen masked men in paramilitary-style uniforms.\nIn a statement Derry City and Strabane Area Commander Chief Superintendent Gillian Kearney said she believed petrol bombs would have been used to attack police \"had the opportunity arose\".\nPolice said the youths seen preparing petrol bombs also took part in the parade along Central Drive.\nCh Supt Kearney added: \"It\u2019s incredibly sad, and really disheartening to see young people, including children, involved in this. \n\"Using young people in this way, risking their safety and encouraging them to engage in criminality is reprehensible.\n\u201cA local person\u2019s van was set on fire for no reason, just next to a local community hall on Central Drive in Creggan, while a number of petrol bombs were also thrown in the area.\"\nAt about 19:30 BST, missiles were thrown at a fire appliance sent to the area to deal with rubbish that had been set on fire across a road at Creggan Heights.\nThe appliance was not damaged but turned back, left the area and police went to the scene, according to the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS).\nThe parade, marking the anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising, began at 14:00 BST on Monday at Creggan shops before making its way to the City Cemetery.\nThe event was organised by the Derry 1916 Committee, which is supported by the Saoradh organisation, considered by the police to be linked to the New IRA.\nThe PSNI said it was also aware of reports on social media that petrol bombs had been thrown at members of the press.\nA police helicopter observed the event and a drone flying overhead relayed a message reminding participants that the gathering was \"unnotified\".\nSupt Kearney said officers had received an 11/1 notification form on Saturday March 30 in relation to an event in the City Cemetery on 1 April. \n\"This did not include notification of a parade from Central Drive to the City Cemetery in Creggan,\" she added.\n\"Police engaged with the event organiser and, on the day, issued several warnings from a drone to make participants aware they would be taking part in an unnotified parade on Central Drive.\n\u201cDespite several warnings, participants proceeded along Central Drive and into the City Cemetery.\"\nThe PSNI said officers would review footage from their \"evidence gathering operation\" as part of an investigation into a breach of the Public Processions Act and offences under the Terrorism Act.\nIn 2023 petrol bombs were thrown at the police during a similar march through Creggan.\nViolence also broke out after an Easter parade in the area in 2022.\nSDLP Leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood said those responsible for throwing petrol bombs had \"nothing to offer\".\nHe said: \u201cThis is the last thing that our community wants or needs. \n\u201cThose responsible for this only want to drag us back. They have nothing to offer the people of this city and they need to understand that we all want a better future. The people of Derry want to live in peace with their neighbours. \n\"We won\u2019t have that peace threatened by anyone, let alone cowards that send kids out to throw petrol bombs.\u201d\nSinn F\u00e9in MLA and policing board member Linda Dillon said Easter commemorations \"should be conducted with dignity and respect\".\nViolent scenes in Derry were \"disgraceful, unacceptable and have no place in our society,\" she added.\nS\u00e9amus Dooley from the National Union of Journalists said there was \"no place\" for such behaviour. \n\"Journalists and photographers must be free to cover public events without intimidation or risk to life,\" he said.",
    " Lulu is someone who likes to talk. \nSo much so that she wears a mobile phone (in a designer case) around her neck. Sir Elton FaceTimed her on that very device, shortly before the start of our interview, an interview which would run a full 15 minutes over our allotted slot, such were the length of Lulu's answers.  \nBut then comes the revelation: \"I don't speak before 12 noon. I can understand why you think I'm lying,\" she laughs. \"But no. I'm very disciplined.\"\nWhat she is referring to is her strict \"on tour\" regime, which means that she can't whisper, let alone shout, before midday on show days. \n\"I try not to come out of my room until 12. It makes it easier. I take care of my instrument. It allows me to sing.\"\nHowever, after seven different decades on stage, this Saturday Lulu heads out on her last ever tour.\nIt is exactly 60 years since Marie McDonald McLaughlin Lawrie swapped four names for four letters and became Lulu. Her debut single, Shout, took the 15-year-old out of her Glasgow tenement and into the charts. \nFew singing careers have been so established by the very first word they ever recorded, but that war cry of \"Weh-yeh-yeh-ell-ay-oh-ah-ellll\" is still Lulu's defining moment. \nAnd soon it is blasting out around the basement rehearsal room in London's Little Venice, where we meet. She is here to practise vocals with her sister Edwina, ahead of hitting the road for one last hurrah. \n\"To be honest with you, if when I was 15 years old and someone would have suggested I'd be doing a farewell tour when I'm 75, I'd have said 'You are having a laugh.' \n\"You almost need an army to go on the road and I don't want to do it like this anymore,\" explains Lulu, who had to cancel more than 30 dates of her 2023 UK tour, due to the lingering effects of long Covid. \nThe tour is described by Lulu as a \"celebration\" which will feature all her best-known songs, and she has called the run of shows Champagne for Lulu after the line uttered by Eddie (Jennifer Saunders) in the episode of Absolutely Fabulous in which Lulu made a cameo.\nThe singer says she will be joined by \"special friends\". \nGiven the number of Take That concerts she has turned up at over the years to belt out Relight My Fire, it would be a major surprise if she has not been on the blower to Gary Barlow. \nA sign of Lulu's longevity is that her number one single with Take That was 31 years ago, placing that event in the first half of her career. \n\"They were very, very, respectful is the word,\" reminisces Lulu. \n\"Because of course they were then in their teens and I was in my 40s. But I've had many reinventions in my life and that was a big one.\" \nThere have indeed been many Lulu landmarks over the last 60 years.\nIn 1967, she not only starred opposite Sidney Poitier in To Sir With Love, but sang the theme song, which topped the US charts, making her the first female Scottish solo act to do so. In the decades since, Sheena Easton and Lewis Capaldi are the only Scottish-born solo singers to have managed this feat.\n\"Oh I love Lewis,\" beams Lulu. \"And so does my grandson Teddy. Maybe you don't know just how much I really like you Lewis,\" she giggles, in a \"would you like to duet with me?' manner. \nThen in 1969 she would win Eurovision with Boom Bang-a-Bang, which is boom back-a-back in her set-list after years when she avoided playing it. \n\"As I say to my audience, I didn't choose the song, you did,\" she chortles, referring to how Boom Bang-a-Bang was selected from six tracks that she performed on her BBC TV show. \nAn interesting footnote - the tune which came dead last in the public vote was I Can't Go On written by two then unknowns called Elton John and Bernie Taupin.  \nWho is the only Eurovision winner to also do a Bond theme? That would be Lulu. In 1974 she pipped Alice Cooper to sing The Man with the Golden Gun. \nShe very much enjoys being part of Bond history and hopes that Christopher Nolan will direct one of the films in the future. \nAs for who should be the next Bond, Lulu's backing Jack Lowden, best known for Slow Horses and Dunkirk: \"He's Scottish so it would take it a little bit back to Sean Connery.\"\nThe same year that she did Bond, Lulu returned to the charts with David Bowie. He produced, played saxophone and sang backing vocals on her version of The Man Who Sold the World. \n\"Bowie was a very special moment in my life,\" says Lulu wistfully. \n\"He made that single and we were going to do much more together. We had planned to do an album and I went to New York and did a couple of recordings.\n\"But David was on a certain trajectory in his life and he was over there and I was here doing my TV series and it didn't quite work out. Not that we didn't want it to.\"\nSuddenly Lulu is apparently transported back to a recording studio in mid-70s New York, as she belts out the chorus to Can You Hear Me? from David Bowie's Young Americans album.\n\"That was one of the songs I did with him, and it disappeared. Lost in his management changeover. His whole life cha",
    "Israel's military has pulled out of al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City after a two-week raid that has left most of the major medical complex in ruins.\nGaza's Hamas-run health ministry said dozens of bodies had been found and locals said nearby areas were razed.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had killed 200 \"terrorists\", detained over 500 more and found weapons and intelligence \"throughout the hospital\". \nThe IDF said it raided al-Shifa because Hamas had regrouped there.\nThe two-week operation saw intense fighting and Israeli air strikes in nearby buildings and the surrounding area. \nWards were attacked because Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad operatives were using them as a base, the IDF said, accusing them of fighting inside medical departments, setting off explosives and burning hospital buildings. \nImages published following the Israeli withdrawal showed Palestinians walking near the charred main buildings with chunks of wall missing and carrying bodies wrapped in blankets.

It says troops set up temporary infrastructure for medical treatment at al-Shifa, with video showing troops setting up a small number of beds.\nPatient Barra al-Shawish told Reuters news agency that the Israeli troops had allowed in a \"very small amount of food\". \"No treatment, no medicine, nothing, and bombing for 24 hours that didn't stop and immense destruction in the hospital,\" he said. \nSome of the patients were being moved to al-Ahli hospital, about 3km (1.8 miles) to the south-east, a medic at al-Shifa told Reuters.\nGaza's hospitals have been a main focus of the current war, with thousands of Palestinians seeking shelter from Israeli bombardment in their grounds and Israeli forces storming the facilities because they say Hamas fighters are present there.\nIsrael has long accused Hamas of using civilian health infrastructure as a cover to launch its operations, which the group denies. \nTwo weeks ago, it took hundreds of Israeli forces just a few hours to approach and enter the Gaza Strip's largest hospital. That was in marked contrast to their first controversial raid there in November, when it took several weeks for large numbers of tanks and vehicles, backed by heavy air strikes, to close in on the site.\nFor supporters of the Israeli military, this has been evidence of the gains it has made during the war and its tactical success, launching a surprise attack on the enemy to strike it hard. An IDF spokesman previously referred to the operation as \"one of the most successful of the war so far\" because of the intelligence gleaned, as well as numbers killed and detained.\nHowever, some commentators suggest the second al-Shifa raid highlights flaws in Israel's military strategy for the war. They argue that it shows the ease with which Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters were able to regroup after Israel pulled its forces out of northern Gaza and the urgent need to come up with a convincing post-war plan to govern the",

    "The Israeli parliament has approved a law giving the government the power to ban broadcasts of TV channels including Al Jazeera, the Qatari-owned network. \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would \"act immediately\" to close the network's local office.\nThe US expressed concern over the move.\nWith foreign journalists banned from entering Gaza, Al Jazeera staff based in the strip have been some of the only reporters able to cover the war on the ground. \nThe Knesset, Israel's parliament, approved the bill allowing foreign networks considered a threat to national security to be \"temporarily\" banned.\nThe ban would be in place for a period of 45 days at a time, which could be renewed. The law would stay in force until July or until the end of significant fighting in Gaza. \n\"Al Jazeera will no longer be broadcast from Israel,\" Mr Netanyahu wrote on Twitter/X, calling the network a \"terrorist channel\". \nFor years, Israeli officials have accused the network of anti-Israeli bias. But their criticisms of the broadcaster have intensified since the Hamas attacks of 7 October. Authorities claim it has close links with Hamas, which Al Jazeera vehemently denies.\nIn a statement, Al Jazeera said: \"Netanyahu could not find any justifications to offer the world for his ongoing attacks on Al Jazeera and press freedom except to present new lies and inflammatory slanders against the Network and the rights of its employees.\n\"Al Jazeera holds the Israeli Prime Minister responsible for the safety of its staff and Network premises around the world, following his incitement and this false accusation in a disgraceful manner.\"\nThe channel has accused Israel of deliberately targeting its staff. Journalists including Hamza Al-Dahdouh, the son of Al Jazeera Gaza bureau chief Wael Al-Dahdouh, have been killed by Israeli strikes. Israel denies targeting journalists. \nQatar, where Al Jazeera is headquartered, is mediating talks between Israel and Hamas over the now almost six-month long conflict. Previous negotiations mediated by Qatar led to a temporary ceasefire and the release of 105 Israeli hostages. \nIt is not clear, though, if the move by Israel will affect the ceasefire talks.\nIsrael has previously banned a smaller Lebanese channel, Al Mayadeen, from operating in the country.\n\"If it is true, a move like this is concerning,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said when asked about the proposed ban.\nThe war began when Hamas fighters stormed into southern Israel on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. About 130 of the hostages remain in captivity, at least 34 of whom are presumed dead.\nMore than 32,800 Palestinians have been killed and 75,000 injured in Gaza since Israel launched its military campaign, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It says 70% of those killed were women and children.\nAl Jazeera first launched in 1996 and shook up the media landscape in the Middle East by airing criticisms of governments and rulers in the region. \nBut some governments in the region have taken issue with the network's coverage. It has been closed or blocked in countries including Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt. \nAl Jazeera says it was the first Arabic channel to feature Israeli politicians and commentators on the air.",

She pledged to show fans a \"more mature and hardworking side\" in future.\nSome fans drove a \"protest truck\" to her management agency when the news broke. \n\"Is the love given to you by your fans not enough?\" blared an electronic billboard on the vehicle.\naespa, which debuted in 2020 with the single Black Mamba, is expected to release a new full-length album this quarter. Lee, 25, gained prominence after starring in the hit fantasy period drama Alchemy of Souls.

    "A BBC presenter whose 83-year-old mum was scammed out of \u00a347,000 while she was being treated for cancer said it was a \"terrible, terrible\" time.\nMichael Collie said his mum Jo fell victim to a widespread phone scam just months before she died last year.\nMr Collie said he had \"absolutely no idea\" it was going on, despite seeing her through the period.\nMrs Collie was registered as vulnerable with her bank, but payments were still approved. They refunded all the money.\nAge Concern say 41% of people aged over 50 have had some kind of scam happen to them within the last five years.\nMr Collie, a presenter for Midlands Today, told BBC Radio Gloucestershire that he and his wife were taking his mum, who lived in Prestbury, Cheltenham, out for the day when they discovered the fraud. \n\"She lived in a sheltered home near me and I was able to pop in quite a lot and I felt I knew what was going on,\" he said.\n\"We were driving along and mum said 'I hope you're feeling better' and I said 'I'm fine'.\n\"Then she said 'I'm glad I was able to help you. I'm glad I was able to give you some money to help out'.\"\n\"At that moment, I knew something was wrong,\" he said, \"because I knew mum had not been lending, or giving me money.\"\nMr Collie pulled into a Sainsbury's car park so they could talk, and his mum told him about a text message she received.\n\"It said 'hi mum, just to let you know, I've changed my phone number, you can delete the old number, use this one'.\"\nIt was as simple as that, he said.\n\"So she changed my number and she wrote, 'OK, that's fine, hope you're well'.\" \nOver the next couple of days, messages were sent to Mrs Collie, as if from her son, to establish a relationship.\n\"Then came the message a couple of days later that said 'oh, can you help me out. I'm just changing my bank account at the moment and I've got a bill to pay.'\"\nIt was for around \u00a31,800 and she agreed to pay it.\nOver the next couple of weeks, the scam rolled on.\nMr Collie said: \"You might think, why did my mum not mention it to me? Why did she not phone up?\n\"And the reason she didn't phone me was obviously because [she thought] I was having difficulties and she didn't want to raise it with me.\n\"And she felt she was talking to me, because [to her knowledge] she was texting me on the phone.\"\nHe said his mum was registered as vulnerable with the bank, so she had a special number to call there.\nShe called this number numerous times asking them to pay 'her son' money, Mr Collie said, and although questioned, she was sure it was him, so the bank did not investigate further or flag the activity.\nHowever, Mr Collie said as soon as he found out about the scam and called the bank, staff apologised for their \"huge error\" and assured him they would pay the money back, which they did. \nMr Collie said his dad was a vicar, so did not earn much and had saved \"for years\" to make sure his wife, who was around 13 years younger than him, had enough to \"see her through\". \nAnd the scammers took it.\nAs a son, Mr Collie said he felt \"absolute shock and horror\" and felt he hadn't \"protected\" his mum.\nHe said the scammers were \"100% to blame\", but with less and less people living with, or close to, relatives, \"we all have to take some responsibility\" and look out for mums, dads, families and neighbours.\n\"Especially knowing things can go so horribly wrong,\" he added.\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Florida's top court has paved the way for the state's six-week abortion ban to take effect, but is allowing voters to have their say on the issue.\nThe justices have upheld the state's 15-week ban on abortion, in a ruling that means a subsequently passed six-week ban can soon begin.\nBut the court will also let Floridians decide in November if abortion rights should be sealed in the state charter. \nMost Americans back legalised abortion, but most also favour restrictions.\nThe abortion ballot initiative could energise liberal voters in a presidential swing state that has been trending conservative in recent election cycles.\nOn Monday, Florida's Republican-appointed justices decided by 6-1 that the state's constitution - specifically its privacy protections - did not apply to abortion access.\nThe ruling upheld Florida's existing 15-week abortion ban, passed in 2022.\nA year ago Florida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law a six-week abortion ban, but that bill was written so as to be placed on hold until the 15-week ban had cleared legal challenges.\nFollowing Monday's ruling, the six-week ban can take effect within 30 days. Many women do not realise they are pregnant at six weeks.\nPlanned Parenthood, which runs clinics that provide abortions, and the American Civil Liberties Union were among groups that filed the lawsuit challenging the ban.\nIn a separate ruling on Monday, the Florida Supreme Court decided 4-3 that a proposed constitutional amendment that would protect access to abortion in the state could be included on ballots this November, when the US general election is held. \nThe ballot question will ask Floridians to vote 'yes' or 'no' to a statement that reads: \"No law shall prohibit, penalize, delay or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient's health.\" Viability refers to when a foetus, or unborn child, might survive outside the uterus, which is usually around 24 weeks.\nIt adds that \"this amendment does not change the Legislature's constitutional authority to require notification to a parent or guardian before a minor has an abortion\".\nThe ballot question was opposed by Governor DeSantis and Florida's Attorney General Ashley Moody, also a Republican. \nOhio, Michigan and Kansas are among states that have passed ballot measures in favour of abortion rights since the US Supreme Court in 2022 overturned a longstanding nationwide right to abortion.\nA constitutional amendment in Florida needs to be approved by 60% of voters - a higher threshold than in other states.\nIf it does pass, voters could effectively reverse both the 15-week and six-week bans on the procedure.\nUS President Joe Biden, a Democrat, reportedly believes Florida's abortion debate could offer a path to victory for him in that state this November.\nIn a memo shared with NBC News, his campaign said Florida is \"winnable\" for the president if he campaigns on the issue. \nMr Biden's Republican challenger, former US President Donald Trump, won Florida in 2016 and 2020.",

    "Google has agreed to delete billions of records and submit to some restrictions on its power to track users, under the terms of a proposed legal settlement.\nThe deal aims to resolve a class action lawsuit brought in the US in 2020, which had accused the tech giant of invading people's privacy by collecting user data even when they were browsing in \"private mode\".\nThe suit had sought $5bn in damages. \nGoogle is supporting the deal, though it disputes the claims.\nIt has already made changes in response to the lawsuit.\nThe data deletion will also apply outside of the United States.\nIn January, shortly after the two sides announced plans to settle the case, the company updated its disclosures to make it clear that it still tracked user data even when users opted to search privately or using its \"Incognito\" setting.\nThat mode provides some increased privacy because it does not save the browsing activity to the machine being used. \nThat same month, the firm said it was starting to trial a feature that would automatically block third-party cookies, which help track user activity, for all Google Chrome users.\nIt had made that block automatic for Incognito users shortly after the lawsuit was filed in 2020 and has agreed to ensure that limit is in place for five years, according to the terms of the settlement deal, filed on Monday in federal court in San Francisco. \nOn Monday, Google also agreed to delete \"hundreds of billions\" of private browsing data records it had collected, the court filing said.\n\"We are pleased to settle this lawsuit, which we always believed was meritless,\" Google spokesman Jorge Castaneda said in a statement, noting that the company would not be paying any damages. \n\"We are happy to delete old technical data that was never associated with an individual and was never used for any form of personalization.\" \nGoogle is still facing lawsuits from individuals over privacy violations, which could lead to financial penalties.\nLawyer David Boies of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, who represented users in the fight, called the deal an \"historic step in requiring honesty and accountability from dominant technology companies\". \nThe lawsuit had claimed that despite its suggestions to the contrary, Google had tracked users' activity even when they set the Google Chrome browser to \"Incognito\" mode and other browsers to \"private mode\".\nThe legal battle revealed documents in which Google employees described Incognito as \"effectively a lie\" and \"a confusing mess\", according to Monday's court filing. \nLast year, Judge Yvonne Rogers rejected Google's bid to have the case dismissed, saying she could not agree that users consented to allowing Google to collect information on their browsing activity.\nThe deal will now go to the court for approval. \nThe settlement comes as big tech firms are facing increased scrutiny of their practices in the US and beyond.\nIn the US, Google and its parent company Alphabet are facing two separate monopoly cases brought by the federal government. \nIt has also recently settled a number of other suits. \nIt paid nearly $400m (\u00a3318m) in 2022 to settle claims brought by US states that it tracked the location of users who had opted out of location services on their devices.\nIn December 2023, it also agreed to a $700m (\u00a3557m) settlement to resolve a lawsuit brought by a group of US states that had accused it of quashing competition to its Play Store on Android devices.",
    "Scotland's new hate crime law has come into force, with JK Rowling and Elon Musk among its critics.\nThe Harry Potter author and the owner of social media platform X both claim the legislation could harm free speech.\nSenior police officers say they expect a flood of complaints about online posts.\nBut the Scottish government insists the law provides protection from hate and prejudice without stifling individual expression.\n\"I think there has been a lot of misinformation,\" about the legislation, said the Victims and Community Safety Minister Siobhian Brown, before going on to claim, inaccurately, that it was \"passed unanimously\" by MSPs in 2021.\nIn fact the law was approved by 82 votes to 32 with four abstentions after heated debate about its contents. \nThe Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act 2021 creates a new crime of \"stirring up hatred\" relating to age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity or being intersex. \nThe maximum penalty is a prison sentence of seven years.\nA person commits an offence if they communicate material, or behave in a manner, \"that a reasonable person would consider to be threatening or abusive,\" with the intention of stirring up hatred based on the protected characteristics.\nStirring up hatred based on race, colour, nationality or ethnicity was already illegal in Great Britain under the Public Order Act 1986 but, in an attempt to streamline the criminal law in Scotland, that too is now part of the Hate Crime Act. \nThe bar for this offence is lower than for the other protected characteristics, as it also includes \"insulting\" behaviour, and as the prosecution need only prove that stirring up hatred was \"likely\" rather than \"intended\".\nIn England and Wales stirring up hatred over race, religion or sexual orientation by threatening behaviour remains illegal.\nThe hate crime law in Scotland includes more protected characteristics.\nSupporters of the new law point out that it contains safeguards designed to protect freedom of speech.\nFor example, it states that it is a defence for a person charged with stirring up hatred to show that their actions were \"reasonable.\"\nIt also references the right to freedom of expression in Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which includes protection for \"ideas that offend, shock or disturb.\"\nTo be convicted of a hate crime, \"you have to be really threatening and really abusive, and there has to be reasonable assumption from others that that is the case,\" said Ms Brown.\nAs well as the offence of stirring up hatred, the Hate Crime Act also consolidates the existing law on crimes which are \"aggravated by prejudice.\"\nThese are where an offender demonstrates malice or ill-will towards their victim based on a protected characteristic, which can be taken into account by a sheriff or judge with a longer sentence or a higher fine than would otherwise have been the case.\nFor example, if an assailant punched someone in the face while also making a hateful comment about their age, that might be assault aggravated by age-related hatred.\nThis is the first time that age has been included in the list of protected characteristics for aggravated offences, a move welcomed by some campaign groups.\n\"It's going to be a positive thing for the country,\" said Adam Stachura of the charity Age Scotland.\nOthers are less enthusiastic.\nAdam Tomkins, professor of public law at Glasgow University, and a former Conservative MSP, voted against the bill because it could see someone convicted of stirring up hatred for a comment they make in private in their own home, not just in public, \"and I just don't think that's where the criminal law belongs.\"\nHowever, Professor Tomkins said he believed the law only posed a risk to free speech \"if it's misunderstood,\" adding, \"if it's properly understood, I think this is a fairly safe piece of legislation now.\"\nSusan Smith of For Women Scotland, which campaigned against recent proposed changes to gender law, is not convinced. \n\"The tests are quite woolly and we don't know how people are going to interpret this,\" she told BBC News.\n\"We do anticipate that there will be a lot of malicious complaints, a lot of rather trivial complaints and potentially people who are investigated will see their lives upended.\n\"I imagine there will be many complaints, for example, made against JK Rowling,\" she added.\nMs Rowling, a prominent critic of some transgender activism, described the law as \"ludicrous\" in a defiant post on X (formerly Twitter) last month. \nMr Musk has cited discussion about the legislation as an \"example of why it is so important to preserve freedom of speech.\" \nVic Valentine of the charity Scottish Trans said the organisation supported the law because of the \"serious impact that hate crime can have on LGBTI people.\" \nIt would not, Vic added, criminalise behaviour which transgender people might simply find upsetting, offensive or even transphobic.\nThe SNP-led Scottish government has tried to soothe concer",
    "Women from the Bangladeshi community in the UK say their lives are being ruined by a TikTok troll, a BBC investigation has found.\nDespite reporting threats and abuse to police forces in the UK and France as well as social media companies, many said they have been left feeling suicidal and desperate because no-one was taking any action to stop it.\n\u201cI felt like the sky had fallen in on me. I was in tears. I could not eat, I struggled to sleep.\n\"I felt like I did not want to be here anymore.\u201d\nSultana (not her real name) lives in Yorkshire and used TikTok to speak out about issues important to her like misogyny and toxic relationships.\nShe said she became a victim of this troll on the social media platform in 2021 after she defended a friend on TikTok who was also targeted by him.\nWarning - this story contains details which readers may find distressing.\nSultana was at work when some of her followers on TikTok messaged her and asked if she had seen the videos that he had posted about her.\n\u201cPeople were commenting on the post and laughing at me,\" she said.\nThe abuse carried on sporadically for two years and she said it was something \"you never get over\".\n\u201cI have always struggled with my mental health and I have had intense therapy to get over this but it triggered my PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder),\" Sultana said.\n\"I felt that all of the hard work I had done to get better went down the drain.\u201d\nTikTok is big among the Bangladeshi community in the UK, especially women.\nTypically a conservative community, the social media platform gives them a voice to speak out.\nBut it also appears to make them a target as those who have been abused said some men in the community do not agree with women voicing their opinions online and seek to silence them.\nThe troll targeting Sultana and others - many of whom told the BBC they were afraid of speaking out - is a man called Hasan Syed, a Bangladeshi national who lives in the suburbs of Paris and has thousands of followers on TikTok.\nHe torments and terrorises people by stealing personal photographs and information from their social media feed and puts them on a \"green screen\" in videos.\nMr Syed then goes live on TikTok, sometimes makes fun of their appearance and makes threats to rape and kill.\nThe BBC has contacted him several times by email and attempted to call him but has had no response.\nMasuma lives in Wales with her family, works in higher education and hosted live cookery demonstrations on TikTok and ran a shop on the platform.\nShe was live on it one day when Mr Syed appeared and asked to be invited on as a guest but when she refused he threatened to \"hang her\".\nMasuma shared a video and urged others to report him but said she became a target.\n\u201cHe made videos of me saying that I was a sex worker,\u201d she said.\nHer followers reported the video to TikTok and it was eventually taken down but Masuma said it damaged her life.\n\u201cThe repercussions were severe, I had to remove all of my photos, my business phone number and reduce my live sessions, due to my heightened anxiety,\" she said.\n\"I received inappropriate calls and faced embarrassing inquiries from students.\u201d\n\u201cDespite reporting the situation to the police with substantial evidence, their inability to take effective action left me feeling helpless.\u201d\nKamrul Islam's first encounter with the TikTok troll was in January 2023 when he came across Mr Syed's channel and said he was appalled by what he saw.\n\u201cAt first I thought the videos were fake but friends told me that Mr Syed had been targeting people in the UK for a number of years,\" he said.\nMr Islam, who lives in Staffordshire with his wife and two young children, said Mr Syed had a large following on TikTok and \"people think he is untouchable\".\n\u201cThe Bangladeshi community are very conservative and these videos bring great shame to families, as well as fear. I knew I had to do something to try and stop it,\" he said.\nMr Islam made contact with Mr Syed online to ask him to stop but it immediately put him and his family in the firing line.\n\u201cHe started making videos about me, he got some pictures of my son [from when he was a year old], my mum and my wife from my Instagram account and openly threatened to rape them,\" he said.\nMr Islam\u2019s wife, Rukthan, was seven months\u00a0pregnant at the time with their second child and he told her everything and decided to call the police.\n\u201cIt was very stressful for me. I was crying my eyes out and I felt scared because many of [Syed\u2019s] followers live in the UK,\" his wife said.\n\"I love walking and I used to drop my son off at school and go for a stroll. After [his] followers said they were going to attack my family, I became too scared to go out.\n\"I can no longer work because of my mental health and I still have sleepless nights.\u201d\nAfter reporting Mr Syed to Staffordshire Police, the father-of-two got in touch with TikTok to demand they take down the videos.\nHe said he was shocked to be told they found \"no violation\" of their community guidelines.\nUnd",
    "Energy bills are taking a step in the right direction but prices remain well above pre-pandemic levels.\nWholesale natural gas prices have fallen sharply since they peaked after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nThis reduction in cost is now starting to feed through to consumer prices.\nHowever, many households and businesses in Northern Ireland will still be struggling with cost pressures.\nFrom 1 April, Northern Ireland's largest electricity supplier Power NI is cutting its prices by 6.3%. \nThe company says this will save the average household \u00a363 per year. \nIt serves 500,000 household customers and cut its prices three times during 2023. \nLast month, the second largest supplier SSE Airtricity cut its price for Northern Ireland customers by 6.3%.\nThe move affected about 141,000 homes with the company saying it will save the typical household about \u00a374 a year.\nBudget Energy also cut its electricity prices by 9% in March.\nThe company, which has about 80,000 customers across Northern Ireland, cited the reduction in wholesale energy costs.\nIt added that this would mean a saving of around \u00a3110 a year for household customers.\nSSE Airtricity, Northern Ireland's largest provider of natural gas, will cut its prices by 22.8% from April.\nThe company says it will save a typical household customer \u00a3320.47 per year.\nFirmus Energy has also announced it will cut its prices by 15.6% from April.\nThis move means household customers will save on average around \u00a3220.82 per year.\nIt is the fourth price cut for households in the Ten Towns Network area and the third reduction in Greater Belfast since December 2022.\nThe Ten Towns area includes Antrim, Armagh, Banbridge, Ballymena, Coleraine, Craigavon, Newry, Londonderry and many other towns.\nPeter McClenaghan from the Northern Ireland Consumer Council said the price cuts were \"good news for consumers\" but warned \"we're still in a relatively high cost environment\".\n\"It's not great news, but it's good news,\" Mr McClenaghan told BBC's Evening Extra programme.\nHe said energy prices in Northern Ireland remain \"significantly higher\" than before the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\"I don't think we'll be there for a while.... [it's] not great for consumers that are still feeling the pinch.\"\nMr McClenaghan added it was \"really important that people don't take their eye off the ball\" by continuing to compare energy suppliers.\n\"Consumers should consider switching,\" he said. \"You can save hundreds of pounds.\"\nHe has advised householders to compare energy prices on the Consumer Council's website.\nThe Utility Regulator said these latest price cuts will mean a typical annual electricity bill at Power NI is \u00a3951, which is cheaper than both Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland.\nA typical annual gas bill of \u00a31,079 for SSE Airtricity and \u00a31,151 for Firmus energy is more expensive than the average bill in Great Britain (\u00a3891), but less expensive than the Republic of Ireland (\u00a31,359).",
    "The release of Netflix's series 3 Body Problem has been watched millions of times around the globe since its release late last month.\nIt has even found an audience in China where Netflix is unavailable, sparking much chatter among viewers of the series.\nBut many fans of the three-book series, credited with propelling China's nascent science fiction genre after its publication in 2008, have also been paying attention to a court room in Shanghai where one of the key players behind the adaptation was sentenced to death just a day after the show's release.\nHis crime? Murdering a man sometimes dubbed China's \"billionaire millennial\" - the gaming tycoon Lin Qi, whose company Yoozoo Games owns the rights for film adaptations of the Chinese science fiction epic.\nAccording to the court, Xu Yao, who was known as a distinguished lawyer, became consumed by professional rivalry after Lin sidelined him shortly after he helped land the Netflix deal in 2020.\nWithin months of this apparent slight, Lin was dead - the victim of a poisoning plot described as both \"premeditated\" and \"extremely despicable\" by the court last week.\nFor fans of The Three-Body Problem, which features an alien civilisation and is set against the backdrop of China's Cultural Revolution, the parallels were clear.\n\"At least we know that Xu Yao and Lin Qi have read The Three-Body Problem thoroughly. Lose your humanity and you lose a lot; lose your animal nature and you lose everything,\" said one comment on China's Weibo.\nLin and Xu were reportedly on good terms at the start: Lin had appointed Xu to spearhead a subsidiary called The Three Body Universe a year after he joined Yoozoo as the company's chief risk officer in 2017.\nThe subsidiary was in charge of securing intellectual property rights for the film adaptations, and the two had worked closely together in brokering the deal to adapt the novel into a Netflix original series.\nBut they fell out when Lin - who founded Yoozoo in 2009 - decided to put other executives in charge of business operations, local reports said. Xu, authorities allege, began to plot.\nSome reports said he set up a company in Japan to acquire the lethal substances and even tested them on animals. Xu then disguised the substances as probiotic pills and gave them to Lin.\nLin checked himself into the hospital when he felt unwell after taking the pills, and was initially in stable condition. But his condition took a dramatic turn - he died 10 days later, on Christmas Day 2020, at the age of 39. At the time, he was believed to have had a net worth of around 6.8bn yuan (\u00a3745m; $941m), according to the Hurun China Rich List\nFour other people fell sick from drinking poisoned beverages in the Yoozoo office but survived, the court heard.\nFollowing his death, Yoozoo issued a statement on its official Weibo microblog which read: \"Goodbye youth... We will be together, continue to be kind, continue to believe in goodness, and continue the fight against all that is bad.\"\nHis death shocked China's gaming and technology sectors and sparked widespread speculation, but it took years for the full details to emerge - despite Xu being detained within days.\nThe Three-Body Problem is the first book in a trilogy called Remembrance of Earth's Past, by Chinese author Liu Cixin. The novel has been translated into close to 30 languages since it was published in Chinese.\nThe Netflix show, stylised as the 3 Body Problem, debuted with 11 million views in its first four days and has remained among Netflix's most-watched programmes since its release on 21 March. \nThe series is one of the most expensive projects undertaken by the streaming giant, with a reported budget of $160m for eight episodes. Its co-creators include Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weis and the book's author Mr Liu. Lin is posthumously credited as an executive producer. \nIt earned positive reviews in China but has also drawn some criticism for its detailed portrayal of the Cultural Revolution and for allegedly shortchanging the Chinese themes in the original work. \nYoozoo also owns rights to the Chinese television series Three-Body, which premiered last year, as well as animation and stage adaptations of The Three-Body Problem.",

    "Across parts of Greater Manchester and Merseyside there are still many buildings emblazoned with the word Cheshire.\nAnd in Southport, some businesses include Red Rose - the emblem of the county of Lancashire - in their names.\nBut 50 years ago, people living on the Wirral, or in Altrincham, or on parts of what was once the Lancashire coastline, suddenly found themselves denizens of new places entirely. \nThe changes that came on 1 April 1974 created the new metropolitan counties of Merseyside and Greater Manchester and the borough of Sefton. \nWhile each area still had a borough council, they were under the umbrella of new county councils - in some cases, counties that the towns were previously not part of. \nThe effect was that towns and villages were pulled into the gravitational field of the larger towns or cities nearby and to this day, the shift continues to provoke a debate that has local identity at its heart, as much as it does local politics.\nAt his home in Southport, 74-year-old Brian Birch is still appalled at being wrenched from Lancashire when he was 24.\nHe believes the town has lost funding and influence to Bootle, in the south of the Sefton borough.\n\"Our roots are in Lancashire,\" Brian says. \n\"We would have been much better off as a town in Lancashire because we would have had more control over what happens in Southport.\"\nBut the issue is not just about politics for retired printer Brian, but identity.\n\"Certainly, my identity is as a Lancastrian. \n\"I am a Lancastrian - born in Southport, Lancashire, and still live in Southport, Lancashire.\"\nThe debate over where places actually are was reignited in 2020, in the midst of the introduction of the coronavirus pandemic tier system, when Altrincham and Hale - as parts of Greater Manchester - were placed under more severe restrictions than neighbouring Cheshire.\nSocial media was briefly ablaze with jokes about renaming a popular TV show The Real Housewives of Greater Manchester, and how people living in the affluent suburbs were \"realising they live in Greater Manchester, not Cheshire, as their estate agent advertised\".  \nJoanne Goodwin, the editor of Cheshire Life magazine, which firmly includes former Cheshire enclaves of Greater Manchester and Wirral in its coverage, has some sympathy with the complaints.\n\"Fifty years on, it's still a massive issue of controversy,\" she says. \n\"I wouldn't say it's snobbery, but it's the kudos a Cheshire address still holds.\"\nShe said in those places now considered Greater Manchester, there is \"still very much an aura of Cheshire\".\n\"The old money and new money combined to make a county that is probably, of all the English counties, the one that people like to say they come from.\"\nThe tussle over county identity became headline news in Bolton last year, when 3,000 people signed a petition calling on the town to be returned to Lancashire.\nBolton Council ultimately rejected the idea.\nSome Boltonians to whom BBC News spoke said they firmly identified with Lancashire, while others considered themselves to be from Greater Manchester.\nWhen the plans for the 1972 Local Government Act were still being hatched, ahead of them coming into force two years later, they provoked much debate in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords.\nMichael Fidler, who represented Bury and Radcliffe, told the Commons the proposed and later abandoned merger of Bury and Rochdale was a \"shotgun marriage\" that might as well be given the unfortunate portmanteau name \"Botchdale\".\nThe name would in the end be consigned to the annals of the parliamentary record Hansard, but around the country - from Merseyside to the newly-created Humberside region - new counties with new names were popping up. \nSo, what was the point of these changes, brought in by the Conservative government of Edward Heath, if they were not just a rather unimaginative rebranding exercise? \nJon Tonge, professor of politics at the University of Liverpool, says the idea was to make local government more efficient.\n\"There were 1,200 councils across the country,\" he says. \n\"The government argued that a smaller number of councils would be more efficient, and they wanted to replace geography with demography.\n\"Local government took no account of the fact we had these huge city-based populations, these huge conurbations, particularly here in the North West.\"\nHe says the changes were \"hugely controversial because it was chopping up our historic counties\", and adds the changes paved the way for the metropolitan-based local government powerhouses of today. \nAnd it could be argued that those cities were, in the end, the winners.\n\"If you go to [Manchester city centre] it's been transformed,\" says Gareth Downing, an economics expert at Manchester Metropolitan University. \n\"That's where you have seen all the economic growth, but there was a study a few years ago looking at Manchester as a whole and, actually, it has got one of the highest levels of regional inequality in the UK.\n\"So you can unde",
    "An Iranian TV host stabbed in London has been discharged from hospital and says he is now staying in a safe place. \nIran International presenter Pouria Zeraati, 36, was repeatedly stabbed in an attack by a group outside his home in Wimbledon, south London, on Friday afternoon, his channel said. \nThe London-based station said it had faced \"heavy threats\" for 18 months.\nCounter-terrorism officers are leading the investigation. The Iranian regime has denied any involvement. \nMr Zeraati thanked well-wishers for their \"sympathy, kindness and love in the past few days\". \n\"Fortunately, I am feeling better, recovering and I have been discharged from the hospital,\" he posted on X. \n\"My wife and I are residing at a safe place under the supervision of the Met Police.\"\nMr Zeraati claimed the suspects in the attack had purposefully planned it.\nA neighbour, who wanted to remain anonymous, told BBC News an officer had spoken to them and said there were three attackers who ran up the road and were picked up.\nIran International says it provides independent coverage of events in the country, but the regime in Tehran has declared it a terrorist organisation.\nThe channel's spokesman told BBC Today programme on Saturday the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) had been targeting journalists and their families.\nAdam Baillie said: \"It was a shocking, shocking incident, whatever the outcome of an investigation reveals.\n\"But for him as a leading presenter, as with our other presenters and journalists, yes, it is a great shock.\n\"It's the first attack of its kind.\"\nIran's charge d'affaires in the UK, Mehdi Hosseini Matin, said \"we deny any link\" to the incident.\nMr Zeraati posted a picture on Instagram on Saturday, showing him smiling from his hospital bed. \nNo arrests have been made, the Metropolitan Police said. \nThe force said it was not yet able to provide further information about any motive behind the attack, but Mr Zeraati's occupation coupled with recent threats towards UK-based Iranian journalists meant the investigation was being led by specialist counter-terrorism officers.\nCdr Dominic Murphy, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said: \"I appreciate the concern this incident has caused, for local people as well as for those in similar lines of work and from Iranian communities.\"\nIn January, the Foreign Office announced sanctions against members of the IRGC's Unit 840 following an ITV investigation into plans to assassinate two of Iran International's presenters in the UK.\nAt the time, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron said \"the Iranian regime and the criminal gangs who operate on its behalf pose an unacceptable threat to the UK's security\".\nIran International resumed its operations in London last September after temporarily moving its broadcasting studios to Washington DC in February 2023 because of a \"significant escalation in state-backed threats from Iran\".\nIn a separate case in December last year, Magomed-Husejn Dovtaev, a Chechen-born Austrian national, was jailed for three-and-a-half years for spying on Iran International before a \"planned attack\" on UK soil.\nThe Met Police said last year that since the start of 2020, 15 plots to either kidnap or kill UK-based individuals perceived as enemies of the Iranian regime had been foiled.\nNearly 18 months ago, Iran International became one of the main providers of news during a wave of anti-government protests in Iran.",
    "Members of a rural golf club say a river is reducing part of its course by 16ft (5m) each year. \nThe erosion is happening on a 328ft (100m) stretch of the River Coquet in Northumberland, which borders Rothbury Golf Club. \nThe club fears a new river route will be formed in as little as five years, which could cut off part of the course.\nOne of the club's directors, David Blakeburn, said: \"It's an expensive problem with no easy solution.\"\n\"It all started about 10 years ago when we started getting more storms and more water coming down the river,\" Mr Blakeburn explained. \n\"A new gravel bank was formed, which is pushing water onto a sandy bank and each year the erosion seems to be speeding up.\"\nA meeting was held on-site in 2017 with the landowner, the Duke of Northumberland, and Natural England, which advises the government on the environment. \n\u201cWe thought it would be easy enough to get a couple of diggers and move the gravel bank, but the costs and bureaucracy involved in solutions suggested by Natural England are way beyond the financial means of a club like ours,\" Mr Blakeburn said.\nNatural England (NE) says the Coquet is a nationally important river, and designated a Site of Special Scientific Importance (SSSI).\nIn a statement, it added: \"NE previously advised that although it would potentially be possible to move some of the gravel bar, this would only be a temporary fix.\n\"It advised that the best potential option was to develop a soft engineering solution with a low impact on the river and submit a Flood Risk Activity Permit to the Environment Agency (EA).\n\"NE is not aware that any such application for erosion control works was submitted by the club\".\nLandowner Northumberland Estates said it was \"sympathetic\" to the club's problems, but added: \"Given the river's dynamic nature and its designation as a SSSI, mitigation work would be complex with no guarantee of success.\n\"As far as we understand, the situation remains unchanged with the instruction not to interfere with the river's natural flow.\"\nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "A mum on the affordable housing list is among villagers asking retail giant Tesco to reconsider a refusal to share an access road so a \"life-changing\" housing development can be built. \nEmma Hookway is backing Braunton Community Land Trust (CLT), a not-for-profit in north Devon, which hopes to build 25 homes for affordable rent. \nMembers said the supermarket chain was blocking the use of a 100m (328ft) access road by its site. \nTesco declined to respond. \nBut the BBC has seen correspondence from Tesco denying access to the road. \nIt said access would create a right of way over the land and this would \"preclude our ability to reutilise this part of the site in the future\".\nTesco also suggested alternative access points, but the CLT said these were not viable due to their positioning and geography. \nEmma Hookway, who has been on the affordable rental waiting list in Braunton for two years, has demanded Tesco \"thinks again\".\nMs Hookway, who lives with son Louis, nine, above a busy pub, added: \"It would be life-changing to live somewhere like this - to have somewhere we can feel safe and solid and not have to leave. \n\"I'd like to sit down with the bosses of Tesco and their community leaders and have them explain the reason they can't help with this.\"\nShe added: \"If I were to lose our home now, I'd be terrified - I think we'd end up in emergency accommodation because we just can't afford what's out there.\n\"And there are so many people out there in my position.\"\nRoy Tomlinson, from the Braunton CLT, said their proposed housing would be ringfenced for people from the area and rented at 60% of market value.\nThis, he said, could help some of the 125 people on the housing waiting list in Braunton and neighbouring Heaton Punchardon.\nThe affordable rental status, meanwhile, would be protected \"in perpetuity\".\nA landowner on the outskirts of the village has offered to sell them the field for an affordable price, he added, but access is needed to unlock funding. \nMr Tomlinson said: \"We are very frustrated. When we started this process over two years ago, we thought we were making progress.\n\"If Tesco had told us two years ago it was a no, we might have been able to try other methods.\"\nAccording to North Devon Council, there were no affordable homes built in Braunton in the financial year 2022/23, while nine were built in 2021/22 and 10 in 2020/21. \nThere are more than 2,000 households registered as being in need of affordable housing in north Devon, it added. \nVal Cann, from the land trust and a former teacher in Braunton, added: \"The local schools have dramatically falling rolls because young families just can't afford to live here.\"\nMark Cann, also on the trust's board, said: \"We are ready to go - the landowner is prepared to sell at the right price. We could make this happen very quickly.\n\"Come on, Tesco - grant us access to the road.\" \nThe BBC has asked Tesco for a comment. \nThere are now more than 548 Community Land Trusts in England and Wales.\nThese democratic, non-profit organisations look to own and develop land for the benefit of communities - often bypassing the big developers.\nThe CLT Network said those in Devon and Cornwall were helping to provide desperately-needed affordable housing across the region. \nThere are now 587 projects by CLTs, which have completed more than 1,800 homes, with 7,100 in the pipeline, it added.\nFollow BBC News South West on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "South Korea is seeking to arrest two men for allegedly helping a YouTuber to install dozens of spy cameras at voting stations.\nThe authorities believe the pair are the accomplices of the social media influencer, who was seeking to confirm his unfounded election fraud claims.\nThe influencer, who is in his 40s, was arrested late last week. \nEarly voting in South Korea's parliamentary elections is due to take place on Friday and Saturday.\nAccording to police in the western city of Incheon, illegal cameras were found at approximately 40 locations nationwide - including polling stations and vote counting centres.\nMany of these were disguised as telecommunications equipment, Singapore's Straits Times newspaper reported. \nOn Monday, the head of the National Office of Investigation said that a search was underway for two men, one in his 50s and one in his 70s.\nCharges against them include unlawful entry of properties and violating security laws, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. \nThe influencer is said to hold far-right political views and had previously spoken of concerns over potential election manipulation in this and earlier elections on his YouTube channel. \nWhen questioned by the media following his arrest, the man said he had \"wanted to check the number of early voters\", the Straits Times reported.\nHe also spoke of \"feeling suspicious about the significant disparities between (the outcomes) of early voting and the main voting\".\nThe publication said he was found to have installed cameras at early voting stations in South Korea's capital, Seoul, during a by-election last year. \nThe authorities are continuing to search for further hidden cameras and said they will carry out additional inspections ahead of voting. \nThe Korea Times reported that more than 3,500 polling stations will be opened for early voting and that four times this number will be in operation on 10 April - the day of the election. \nThe vote is being held to select members of the National Assembly, which is made up of 300 seats.\nThe last parliamentary election was held in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic.

    "I'm handed an elegant pear-shaped bottle with an intricate leaf pattern reaching up around the neck. \nDespite being empty, it's heavy. \nI ask how much the bottle costs. \"About \u00a3270,\" I'm told. I hand the bottle back - very carefully. \nThe bottle, designed for a rare whisky, is one of the creations of Stoelzle Flaconnage, based in Knottingley, West Yorkshire. Glassware has been made on this site since 1871.\nIn 1994 the factory was taken over by Austria's Stoelzle Glass Group, which has focused the plant on making bottles for the spirits industry. \nIt can handle the design, bottle making and decoration all on one site. \nDemand is strong, helped by the boom in gin making and demand for whisky in Asia. When I visit, the plant is busy, lumps of molten glass are dropping into dozens of moulds, the glass still glowing orange from the heat of the furnace.\nTo stand out in a crowded market, customers want distinctive bottles, with patterned and sometimes coloured glass, elaborate labels and artwork.\n\"What our clients are looking for is to have their product presented in an outstanding - sometimes iconic - way,\" says Thomas Riss, chief executive of Stoelzle Flaconnage.\nWhile business is brisk, Stoelzle Flaconnage - and other glassmakers - are having to make some big decisions about the way they make glass containers.\nThe European Union is cracking down on packaging waste. It wants packaging to be lighter so less material is needed and less fuel is needed for transportation. \nIt has been working on the Packaging & Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR), which is in the final stages of approval.\nUnder the rules, member states would have to cut back on packaging weight and would have to introduce measures to meet targets.\nThere is concern in the glass container industry that it will be unfairly targeted as glass is relatively heavy, compared with plastic or aluminium. \n\"Light doesn't mean sustainable,\" points out Vanessa Chesnot, from FEVE, the industry body which represents European glass container makers.\n\"Glass is 100% and infinitely recyclable... so, you can recycle a whisky bottle into another bottle, forever basically.\"\nWhile it's true that glass recycling is an established process, making glass, even using recycled materials, is energy intensive. \nMost glass making involves burning natural gas to heat the raw materials in a furnace to 1,500C. Burning gas and heating the raw materials both produce CO2.\nThe furnace I saw in action at Stoelzle Flaconnage uses about 191,000 kWh of energy per day - that's enough to supply the average UK household with energy for 12 years, the company says.\nIt is considered a relatively small furnace; bigger plants would have furnaces twice the size.\nWhat's more, glass furnaces are never turned off, as it takes 12 days for a furnace to reach its operating temperature. Essentially a furnace will run all day, every day for its operational life - typically between ten and 12 years.\nSo the glass industry is looking at switching from gas-fired furnaces to electricity.\nIf the electricity comes from a sustainable source then the carbon footprint is slashed, which could go a long way to helping glass firms meet their goal to become net zero by 2050.\nUntil recent years, running a furnace on electricity was considered too expensive. But electricity prices have become more competitive, so glass makers are looking at making the switch.\nStoelzle Flaconnage, plans to have an electric furnace running in Knottingley by 2026.\n\"When I talked with my engineers, five years back, none of them would have ever come up with the idea of electric furnaces, because the mathematics didn't make sense. But this has changed now,\" says Mr Riss.\nHowever, electric furnaces might not be an option for companies that mass produce containers, like beer bottles. Even if electric furnaces can be made big enough, the extra expense of electricity will be off-putting for them.\n\"For the time being it [electric furnace tech] is mainly being developed for niche markets or small furnaces producing high added value products,\" says FEVE's director of environment, health and safety, Fabrice Rivet.\nAn extra challenge for electric glass furnaces is plugging them in. Connections to the electricity grid often have to be upgraded, to cope with the extra electricity supply.\nBut the glass industry is attempting to clear some of those hurdles.\nIn Obernkirchen, in northern Germany the world's most advanced hybrid glass furnace is undergoing trials, at Ardagh Glass Packaging (AGP).\nPartly funded by the German government and the EU, and made by Germany company Sorg, it is a large furnace with a capacity of 350 tonnes - enough to make about a million beer bottles a day.\nWhen fully operational it will run on 80% sustainable electricity and 20% gas, which AGP says will save 45,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.\nEngineers at AGP are giving the furnace the ultimate test - making amber-coloured glass, which involves tricky chemistry and is more difficult to contro",
    "More than 250 patients a week could be dying unnecessarily, due to long waits in A&E in England, according to analysis of NHS data.\nThe Royal College of Emergency Medicine analysed the 1.5 million who waited 12 hours or more to be admitted in 2023. \nA previous data study had calculated the level of risk of people dying after long waits to start treatment and found it got worse after five hours.\nThe government says the number seen within a four-hour target is improving.\nThis is despite February seeing the highest number of attendances to A&E on record, it adds.\nThe Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) carried out a similar analysis in 2022, which at that time resulted in an estimate of 300-500 excess deaths - more deaths than would be expected - each week.\nThe analysis uses a statistical model based on a large study of more than five million NHS patients that was published in 2021. \nAt the time NHS England disputed the figures, but it's roughly what you get if you multiply the number of people waiting long periods in A&E, with the extra risk of dying estimated to come with those long waits (of between five and 12 hours).\nThis latest analysis is more detailed following a Freedom of Information request, this time asking for a breakdown of the number of people who waited for more than 12 hours and were subsequently admitted for treatment.\nThat does not include the time that many people spent waiting outside hospitals in ambulances before they were transferred into A&E - meaning the full figures will be even higher, experts say. \nNHS data for England shows more than 1.5 million patients waited 12 hours or more in major emergency departments in 2023, of which around one million were waiting to be admitted to a hospital bed as a decision had already been made to treat them but a bed was not available at that stage.\nThe RCEM has calculated that, when looking solely at patients awaiting admission, an average of 268 excess deaths are likely to have occurred each week in 2023.\nRCEM president Dr Adrian Boyle said long waits were continuing to put patients at risk of serious harm. \n\"In 2023, more than 1.5 million patients waited 12 hours or more in major emergency departments, with 65% of those awaiting admission,\" he said.\n\"Lack of hospital capacity means that patients are staying in longer than necessary and continue to be cared for by emergency department staff, often in clinically inappropriate areas such as corridors or ambulances.\n\"The direct correlation between delays and mortality rates is clear. Patients are being subjected to avoidable harm.\"\nSir David Spiegelhalter, emeritus professor of statistics in the Centre for Mathematical Sciences, University of Cambridge, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It sort of seems intuitive that if you wait a long time in a corridor or somewhere else waiting to be admitted, an average of six hours now, that that's going to harm people.\"\nHe added: \"They are not identifiable people, you can't count people who died because of this. It's an estimate based on past analysis, that this does increase your risk, but it does seem plausible.\"\nAn NHS England statement said : \"We have seen significant increases in demand for A&E services, with attendances in February up 8.6% on last year and emergency admissions up 7.7%.\n\"The latest published data shows our urgent and emergency care recovery plan - backed by extra funding with more beds, capacity and greater use of measures like same day emergency care - is delivering improvements.\"\nThe Department of Health said it was making progress in reducing waiting times and had added an extra 5,000 permanent staffed beds this winter to increase capacity and help patients be seen as quickly as possible.\n\"Thanks to our Urgent Care Recovery Plan backed by \u00a31bn in 2023-24, A&E four-hour performance improved in February compared to January, despite the highest number of February A&E attendances on record and the impact of industrial action.\n\"We are committed to ensuring people get the emergency care they need, when they need it, and all patients attending A&E are assessed by a doctor or nurse before any treatment takes place, to ensure the most seriously unwell people are treated first.\"",
    "Almost nine months after a two-and-a-half year-old boy disappeared in a tiny village in the French Alps, some of his bones have been found by a hiker in an area that had already been searched.\nDetectives now have to find out whether Emile Soleil's death was an accident or if he was the victim of a crime.\nHis unexplained disappearance in Haut-Vernet shocked France last July. \nThe discovery of his remains more than 1km away came days after police returned to re-enact what had happened.\nA communique from local prosecutors did not specify which bones had been found, but they were understood to include Emile's skull and some teeth. Forensic teams are now searching for the rest of his body.\nLocal Mayor Fran\u00e7ois Balique said he was very sad at the discovery and his thoughts were with Emile's parents. \"It will take a long time to recover from this disappearance and death,\" he told French radio.\nEmile had only just been dropped off to stay at his grandparents' holiday home when he vanished in the Alpine hamlet on the slopes of the Massif des Trois-Ev\u00each\u00e9s mountain range. Only 25 people live in Haut-Vernet, at an altitude of 1,200m (4,000ft), and his parents were not there when he disappeared.\nThe last sighting of the child, wearing a yellow t-shirt and white shorts, was at 17:15 local time on 8 July by two neighbours who saw him walking by himself in the only street in the village but then said they had \"lost sight of him\".\nPolice were alerted by his grandmother shortly afterwards. Hundreds of people joined police with sniffer-dogs in a search the following day and two investigating judges were quickly appointed to the case, which was by then a major national story. \nEmile's disappearance soon became a criminal inquiry into a potential abduction, although detectives did not have any further leads into what had happened.\nThe boy's parents, who are religious Catholics, said they feared the worst but told a Christian website they still hoped for a miracle.\nHis mother made a public appeal in November, marking what would have been Emile's third birthday. If he was still alive, she appealed for his safe return, but if he was dead, she asked that he be handed back for burial.\nLast Thursday investigators returned to Haut-Vernet, summoning 17 people including members of Emile's family, neighbours and witnesses, to reconstruct the last sightings of the boy.\nFrench reports have focused on the boy's 58-year-old maternal grandfather, but his lawyer said she hoped investigators would not \"waste too much time on him to the detriment of other lines of inquiry\".\nThen, on Saturday, a woman found the bones in an area that police said had been searched several times by local residents, police and helicopters with thermal cameras. Forensic scientists announced on Sunday that the DNA matched Emile's.\n\"This heart-breaking news was feared, and the time has come for mourning, contemplation and prayer,\" the child's parents said in a statement.\nPolice are investigating why the small skull had not been detected earlier. A local woman is said to have made the find while walking in a steep, wooded area that is not easy to access and then handed it over to local gendarmes (military police).\nMarie-Laure Pezant, a spokeswoman for the gendarmerie told French TV that the bones could have been placed there by a person or even an animal, or they could even have been shifted by changing weather conditions.\nEqually, police are not ruling out the possibility that his remains were missed during searches last summer because of the dense undergrowth at the time.\n\"Is that where he disappeared? Is that where he took his last breath, nobody knows,\" said Mayor Fran\u00e7ois Balique. \"In any case I have no idea, but the judicial inquiry will no doubt be able to find that out.\"\nSniffer-dogs have been searching the area for more remains and dozens of police are guarding the site to prevent a potential crime scene being contaminated in any way by hikers.\n\"We're looking for any trace and any clue,\" police commander Pierre-Yves Bardy told reporters on Monday, adding that the search would go on for as long as necessary.\nA source told Le Figaro newspaper of their frustration that the woman had picked up the skull: \"It would have been better if she hadn't touched anything.\"",
    "Laura Crane, 29, from north Devon is the first British woman to surf the 60ft waves of Nazare in Portugal, and it has been quite a journey. \nOn the way she had an eating disorder, sepsis and self-doubt.\nHere she charts her return to the sport she loves.\nLife was a \"dream\" for Laura Crane at the age of 12, says the surfer from Croyde in north Devon.\nWith big-name sponsorships and a string of surfing titles under her feet, the world was her oyster.\n\"I was whisked away and travelled to places that I could have kind of only dreamed of as a grommet [young surfer],\" she said. \n\"I moved then to France when I was 15, to really just push in the European zone and after that Australia to work with a surfing brand\n\"Sport was definitely my superpower.\n\"Being from the UK, having this dream to be a professional surfer was kind of frowned upon as just a bit of an unattainable goal, but that definitely didn't stop me.\n\"In fact, I think it kind of just gave me more fuel to the fire to prove to people that I could do this.\nBut at the age of just 21 she quit her sponsors and retired.\n\"It was purely down to the fact that I had put so much value into my image rather than the value I had as an athlete, and I think that really hit home,\" she said.\n\"For a long time I wasn't honest with who Laura actually was because from the age of 12 it had been hammered out of me, and just been told that my value was how I looked in a bikini.\n\"I needed a break. My mental health really struggled and I struggled with an eating disorder.\"\nIn 2018 she joined the guests on ITV's Love Island reality TV show.\n\"I did feel I felt very lost in that time, I think,\" she said.\n\"If anything, it made me lose even more of who I was, but in the long run it made me find who I was probably quicker than I would have, had I not gone in there.\"\nAs well as continuing problems with an eating disorder, in the summer of 2019 she was admitted to hospital with sepsis, also known as septicaemia or blood poisoning.\n\"It was absolutely terrifying, I think it was a real cry by my body telling me you're in the wrong place,\" she said.\n\"I was living in London, I was trying to kind of pursue this TV career and my body just said, 'No, this is not our place to be'.\n\"I think it inspired the discovery of who Laura really was, and I then decided that I wanted to get therapy for the eating disorder, and for the next, probably three or four years. I really just focused on me.\"\nShe then returned to surfing in Croyde.\n\"It's always been a safe place of mine to be able to go into the water and to allow my board catch a few waves,\" she said.\nThen she and her brother took on the Cribbar, one of Cornwall's most intimidating big waves.\n\"I've always been somebody that kind of just throws caution into the wind and just goes for it anyway. \n\"So in that moment I really felt that I was living into my values.\n\"I found the Laura she was always meant to be.\"\nAfter pictures from the session went viral she got a call from big wave surfing legend Eric Rebiere to learn to take on the challenge of Nazare, where waves the height of 10-storey buildings roll in.\n\"And I was like, okay, like, if this guy really believes in me for the first time ever a male in this industry believes in my physical power like this is awesome,\" she said. \n\"I'm gonna just jump in headfirst and just go for it.\"\nHer first lesson was in tow surfing, a practice used in big wave surfing in which a surfer is towed into waves by a personal watercraft.\n\"It sucked me in straight away, I absolutely loved it,\" she said.\nWhat followed was weeks of training to condition her body to withstand the demands of surfing Nazare, including wiping out on huge waves that hit 60ft (18.3m).\n\"I felt a lot of pressure myself and what I wanted to achieve by surfing these waves, but also I felt pressure for just women's sport in general and to inspire others.\n\"There is one thing that matters, and it is just not to doubt yourself. As soon as you start to doubt yourself it's all over.\"\nShe said: \"To be the first British female to surf there was a really nice feeling, and I hope that it inspires other young female British athletes in their sports, too.\"\nShe said she wanted to \"inspire people to be stronger than they think they can be\". \n\"I've doubted myself a lot in the years, and whether that's through society telling me that I couldn't do these things or not.\n\"Wherever your 60ft wave is, you can get it if you don't turn your back on it and you don't allow somebody else to tell you that you can't achieve it.\n\"You've just got to have enough fight in you to keep going.\"\nListen to an interview with Laura Crane on BBC Sounds.

    "South Korea is seeking to arrest two men for allegedly helping a YouTuber to install dozens of spy cameras at voting stations.\nThe authorities believe the pair are the accomplices of the social media influencer, who was seeking to confirm his unfounded election fraud claims.\nThe influencer, who is in his 40s, was arrested late last week. \nEarly voting in South Korea's parliamentary elections is due to take place on Friday and Saturday.\nAccording to police in the western city of Incheon, illegal cameras were found at approximately 40 locations nationwide - including polling stations and vote counting centres.\nMany of these were disguised as telecommunications equipment, Singapore's Straits Times newspaper reported. \nOn Monday, the head of the National Office of Investigation said that a search was underway for two men, one in his 50s and one in his 70s.\nCharges against them include unlawful entry of properties and violating security laws, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. \nThe influencer is said to hold far-right political views and had previously spoken of concerns over potential election manipulation in this and earlier elections on his YouTube channel. \nWhen questioned by the media following his arrest, the man said he had \"wanted to check the number of early voters\", the Straits Times reported.\nHe also spoke of \"feeling suspicious about the significant disparities between (the outcomes) of early voting and the main voting\".\nThe publication said he was found to have installed cameras at early voting stations in South Korea's capital, Seoul, during a by-election last year. \nThe authorities are continuing to search for further hidden cameras and said they will carry out additional inspections ahead of voting. \nThe Korea Times reported that more than 3,500 polling stations will be opened for early voting and that four times this number will be in operation on 10 April - the day of the election. \nThe vote is being held to select members of the National Assembly, which is made up of 300 seats.\nThe last parliamentary election was held in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic.

    "Women from the Bangladeshi community in the UK say their lives are being ruined by a TikTok troll, a BBC investigation has found.\nDespite reporting threats and abuse to police forces in the UK and France as well as social media companies, many said they have been left feeling suicidal and desperate because no-one was taking any action to stop it.\n\u201cI felt like the sky had fallen in on me. I was in tears. I could not eat, I struggled to sleep.\n\"I felt like I did not want to be here anymore.\u201d\nSultana (not her real name) lives in Yorkshire and used TikTok to speak out about issues important to her like misogyny and toxic relationships.\nShe said she became a victim of this troll on the social media platform in 2021 after she defended a friend on TikTok who was also targeted by him.\nWarning - this story contains details which readers may find distressing.\nSultana was at work when some of her followers on TikTok messaged her and asked if she had seen the videos that he had posted about her.\n\u201cPeople were commenting on the post and laughing at me,\" she said.\nThe abuse carried on sporadically for two years and she said it was something \"you never get over\".\n\u201cI have always struggled with my mental health and I have had intense therapy to get over this but it triggered my PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder),\" Sultana said.\n\"I felt that all of the hard work I had done to get better went down the drain.\u201d\nTikTok is big among the Bangladeshi community in the UK, especially women.\nTypically a conservative community, the social media platform gives them a voice to speak out.\nBut it also appears to make them a target as those who have been abused said some men in the community do not agree with women voicing their opinions online and seek to silence them.\nThe troll targeting Sultana and others - many of whom told the BBC they were afraid of speaking out - is a man called Hasan Syed, a Bangladeshi national who lives in the suburbs of Paris and has thousands of followers on TikTok.\nHe torments and terrorises people by stealing personal photographs and information from their social media feed and puts them on a \"green screen\" in videos.\nMr Syed then goes live on TikTok, sometimes makes fun of their appearance and makes threats to rape and kill.\nThe BBC has contacted him several times by email and attempted to call him but has had no response.\nMasuma lives in Wales with her family, works in higher education and hosted live cookery demonstrations on TikTok and ran a shop on the platform.\nShe was live on it one day when Mr Syed appeared and asked to be invited on as a guest but when she refused he threatened to \"hang her\".\nMasuma shared a video and urged others to report him but said she became a target.\n\u201cHe made videos of me saying that I was a sex worker,\u201d she said.\nHer followers reported the video to TikTok and it was eventually taken down but Masuma said it damaged her life.\n\u201cThe repercussions were severe, I had to remove all of my photos, my business phone number and reduce my live sessions, due to my heightened anxiety,\" she said.\n\"I received inappropriate calls and faced embarrassing inquiries from students.\u201d\n\u201cDespite reporting the situation to the police with substantial evidence, their inability to take effective action left me feeling helpless.\u201d\nKamrul Islam's first encounter with the TikTok troll was in January 2023 when he came across Mr Syed's channel and said he was appalled by what he saw.\n\u201cAt first I thought the videos were fake but friends told me that Mr Syed had been targeting people in the UK for a number of years,\" he said.\nMr Islam, who lives in Staffordshire with his wife and two young children, said Mr Syed had a large following on TikTok and \"people think he is untouchable\".\n\u201cThe Bangladeshi community are very conservative and these videos bring great shame to families, as well as fear. I knew I had to do something to try and stop it,\" he said.\nMr Islam made contact with Mr Syed online to ask him to stop but it immediately put him and his family in the firing line.\n\u201cHe started making videos about me, he got some pictures of my son [from when he was a year old], my mum and my wife from my Instagram account and openly threatened to rape them,\" he said.\nMr Islam\u2019s wife, Rukthan, was seven months\u00a0pregnant at the time with their second child and he told her everything and decided to call the police.\n\u201cIt was very stressful for me.

    "Nearly a week after Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed, almost two dozen sailors remain stranded on-board the vessel involved in the accident.\nMost of the crew of the Dali, a 948ft (289m) container ship, are from India. One was slightly injured when the ship collided with the bridge.\nSix people were killed in the collapse.\nInvestigators are working to determine exactly what caused the collision, and it is unclear when the crew will be able to leave the vessel. \nHere's what we know about the men on-board the Dali and their current situation. \nIn total, 21 crew members were on-board the Dali at the time of the accident, which happened just minutes into the ship's 27-day journey to Sri Lanka. \nIndia has confirmed that 20 of them are Indian citizens. Government statistics show that 315,000 Indians are employed in the global maritime industry, about 20% of the total. Indians are second only to Filipinos in the sector. \nOne crew member is from Sri Lanka, according to the US Coast Guard.\nAn Indian official said last week the crew are all in good health, including the one member with the minor injury, which required stitches. \nLittle else is known publicly about the crew, their background or their experience. \nAmong the few people to have been in contact is Joshua Messick, the executive director of the Baltimore International Seafarers' Center, a non-profit organisation that works to protect the rights of mariners.\nMr Messick told the BBC that he has exchanged WhatsApp messages with the crew after arranging delivery of a care package that included WiFi hotspots. \nHe described them as \"rattled\" and largely keeping quiet about their situation as the investigation unfolds. \n\"They're not saying much at all to anyone who has been in touch with them,\" Mr Messick said. \n\"They didn't have WiFi until Saturday and they didn't really know what the perception of the rest of the world was. They weren't sure if they were being blamed, or demonised. They just didn't know what to expect.\"\nHe added: \"They are also in a very sensitive situation. What they can say can reflect on the company. I would imagine that they've been advised to keep a low-profile for the time being.\" \nAndrew Middleton, who runs Apostleship of Sea - a programme that ministers to ships coming through Baltimore - said he has been in touch with the crew \"several times a day\" since the collision. \n\"They say that they are all well,\" he said. \nAuthorities have said that - for now - there is no plan to disembark the Dali's crew, who are still working to maintain the ship. It is unlikely they will leave the vessel until it is moved - a complicated and potentially long process. \nOn Friday, Coast Guard Admiral Shannon Gilreath said that moving the Dali is a secondary priority to re-opening the port of Baltimore and the shipping channel. \nEven in normal circumstances, disembarking crews of foreign nationals from ships in US ports requires significant paperwork. \nIn addition to visas, the mariners need to have valid shore passes that allow them to get off the ship. They also need escorts to take them from the ship to the terminal gate, although that function can be performed by the various non-profits that work with mariners in the area.\nIt is unclear whether the Dali's crew have the required paperwork to disembark. \nThe unified command overseeing the response to the Baltimore accident told the BBC on Monday that it is unclear how long the investigation will last and \"until the process is complete, the crew will remain on board\". \nChirag Bahri, a veteran Indian seafarer who now serves as the international operations manager of the UK-headquartered International Seafarers' Welfare and Assistance Network, said that he believes it will likely be a matter of months until all the mariners are able to return home.\n\"Maybe after a few weeks, some of the junior ranks may be repatriated home,\" he said. \n\"But it may be that the senior ranks are still required to complete the formal investigation and are kept in the US.\" \nThe crew of the Dali is well-supplied with food, water and other supplies originally intended for their voyage to Sri Lanka. \nThe crew will also be able to receive packages from the non-profits that work with mariners, which Mr Messick said would include baked goods and other treats.\nThe more pressing needs are psychological, say Mr Messick and Mr Bahri. \nThe former said that combating tedium and boredom when not working is among the greatest challenges when seafarers are isolated for long periods. Many of the mariners - who are often young - will turn to video games and social media to pass the time. \n\"The happiest [ships] are the ones where the crew can come together and enjoy each other's company,\" Mr Messick said. \"But that's not always the case.\" \nMr Bahri said he expects the crew will need mental health support in the wake of the incident and the intense media attention over what went wrong and who, if anyone, is to blame.  \n\"Everyone is now trying",
    "Adidas has banned football fans from buying German football kits customised with the number 44, after media raised their resemblance to the symbol used by World War Two-era Nazi SS units. \n\"We will block personalisation of the jerseys,\" an Adidas spokesman said.\nSS units were the most responsible for the crimes against humanity committed by the Nazis.\nThe newly released kit has also caused controversy with its choice of pink for the away colours.  \nThe symbolism issue was first raised by historian Michael K\u00f6nig, who said the design of the kits was \"very questionable\". \nThe SS rune was designed in 1929 for use by the Nazi units. Members of the SS ranged from Gestapo agents to concentration camp guards. SS duties included administering death camps where millions of Jews and others were put to death.\nAdidas spokesman Oliver Br\u00fcggen denied that the kit's resemblance to the Nazi symbols was intentional. \n\"We as a company are committed to opposing xenophobia, anti-Semitism, violence and hatred in every form,\" he said.\nAdidas separately told the BBC that the German Football Association (DFB) and its partners had designed the numbers on the shirts.\nIn a post on Twitter/X, the DFB said the shirt designs had been submitted to UEFA for review during the design process and that \"none of the parties involved saw any proximity to Nazi symbolism\".\nThey added that an alternative design for the number 4 would be developed.\nThe same kit has met additional controversy for its choice of bright pink as the away colour. Supporters say the colour represents the country's diversity. But critics claim it is untraditional and has been introduced in order to raise money for the DFB. \nAdidas has manufactured German jerseys since the 1950s. \nBut a decision by the DFB to drop German company Adidas in favour of American giant Nike as the manufacturer of German football kits from 2027 has been blasted for lacking \"patriotism\" by Economy Minister Robert Habeck. \nGermany will host this year's European Football Championship, which will be held in 10 different cities.",
    "Across parts of Greater Manchester and Merseyside there are still many buildings emblazoned with the word Cheshire.\nAnd in Southport, some businesses include Red Rose - the emblem of the county of Lancashire - in their names.\nBut 50 years ago, people living on the Wirral, or in Altrincham, or on parts of what was once the Lancashire coastline, suddenly found themselves denizens of new places entirely. \nThe changes that came on 1 April 1974 created the new metropolitan counties of Merseyside and Greater Manchester and the borough of Sefton. \nWhile each area still had a borough council, they were under the umbrella of new county councils - in some cases, counties that the towns were previously not part of. \nThe effect was that towns and villages were pulled into the gravitational field of the larger towns or cities nearby and to this day, the shift continues to provoke a debate that has local identity at its heart, as much as it does local politics.\nAt his home in Southport, 74-year-old Brian Birch is still appalled at being wrenched from Lancashire when he was 24.\nHe believes the town has lost funding and influence to Bootle, in the south of the Sefton borough.\n\"Our roots are in Lancashire,\" Brian says. \n\"We would have been much better off as a town in Lancashire because we would have had more control over what happens in Southport.\"\nBut the issue is not just about politics for retired printer Brian, but identity.\n\"Certainly, my identity is as a Lancastrian. \n\"I am a Lancastrian - born in Southport, Lancashire, and still live in Southport, Lancashire.\"\nThe debate over where places actually are was reignited in 2020, in the midst of the introduction of the coronavirus pandemic tier system, when Altrincham and Hale - as parts of Greater Manchester - were placed under more severe restrictions than neighbouring Cheshire.\nSocial media was briefly ablaze with jokes about renaming a popular TV show The Real Housewives of Greater Manchester, and how people living in the affluent suburbs were \"realising they live in Greater Manchester, not Cheshire, as their estate agent advertised\".  \nJoanne Goodwin, the editor of Cheshire Life magazine, which firmly includes former Cheshire enclaves of Greater Manchester and Wirral in its coverage, has some sympathy with the complaints.\n\"Fifty years on, it's still a massive issue of controversy,\" she says. \n\"I wouldn't say it's snobbery, but it's the kudos a Cheshire address still holds.\"\nShe said in those places now considered Greater Manchester, there is \"still very much an aura of Cheshire\".\n\"The old money and new money combined to make a county that is probably, of all the English counties, the one that people like to say they come from.\"\nThe tussle over county identity became headline news in Bolton last year, when 3,000 people signed a petition calling on the town to be returned to Lancashire.\nBolton Council ultimately rejected the idea.\nSome Boltonians to whom BBC News spoke said they firmly identified with Lancashire, while others considered themselves to be from Greater Manchester.\nWhen the plans for the 1972 Local Government Act were still being hatched, ahead of them coming into force two years later, they provoked much debate in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords.\nMichael Fidler, who represented Bury and Radcliffe, told the Commons the proposed and later abandoned merger of Bury and Rochdale was a \"shotgun marriage\" that might as well be given the unfortunate portmanteau name \"Botchdale\".\nThe name would in the end be consigned to the annals of the parliamentary record Hansard, but around the country - from Merseyside to the newly-created Humberside region - new counties with new names were popping up. \nSo, what was the point of these changes, brought in by the Conservative government of Edward Heath, if they were not just a rather unimaginative rebranding exercise? \nJon Tonge, professor of politics at the University of Liverpool, says the idea was to make local government more efficient.\n\"There were 1,200 councils across the country,\" he says. \n\"The government argued that a smaller number of councils would be more efficient, and they wanted to replace geography with demography.\n\"Local government took no account of the fact we had these huge city-based populations, these huge conurbations, particularly here in the North West.\"\nHe says the changes were \"hugely controversial because it was chopping up our historic counties\", and adds the changes paved the way for the metropolitan-based local government powerhouses of today. \nAnd it could be argued that those cities were, in the end, the winners.\n\"If you go to [Manchester city centre] it's been transformed,\" says Gareth Downing, an economics expert at Manchester Metropolitan University. \n\"That's where you have seen all the economic growth, but there was a study a few years ago looking at Manchester as a whole and, actually, it has got one of the highest levels of regional inequality in the UK.\n\"So you can unde",

    "Laura Crane, 29, from north Devon is the first British woman to surf the 60ft waves of Nazare in Portugal, and it has been quite a journey. \nOn the way she had an eating disorder, sepsis and self-doubt.\nHere she charts her return to the sport she loves.\nLife was a \"dream\" for Laura Crane at the age of 12, says the surfer from Croyde in north Devon.\nWith big-name sponsorships and a string of surfing titles under her feet, the world was her oyster.\n\"I was whisked away and travelled to places that I could have kind of only dreamed of as a grommet [young surfer],\" she said. \n\"I moved then to France when I was 15, to really just push in the European zone and after that Australia to work with a surfing brand\n\"Sport was definitely my superpower.\n\"Being from the UK, having this dream to be a professional surfer was kind of frowned upon as just a bit of an unattainable goal, but that definitely didn't stop me.\n\"In fact, I think it kind of just gave me more fuel to the fire to prove to people that I could do this.\nBut at the age of just 21 she quit her sponsors and retired.\n\"It was purely down to the fact that I had put so much value into my image rather than the value I had as an athlete, and I think that really hit home,\" she said.\n\"For a long time I wasn't honest with who Laura actually was because from the age of 12 it had been hammered out of me, and just been told that my value was how I looked in a bikini.\n\"I needed a break. My mental health really struggled and I struggled with an eating disorder.\"\nIn 2018 she joined the guests on ITV's Love Island reality TV show.\n\"I did feel I felt very lost in that time, I think,\" she said.\n\"If anything, it made me lose even more of who I was, but in the long run it made me find who I was probably quicker than I would have, had I not gone in there.\"\nAs well as continuing problems with an eating disorder, in the summer of 2019 she was admitted to hospital with sepsis, also known as septicaemia or blood poisoning.\n\"It was absolutely terrifying, I think it was a real cry by my body telling me you're in the wrong place,\" she said.\n\"I was living in London, I was trying to kind of pursue this TV career and my body just said, 'No, this is not our place to be'.\n\"I think it inspired the discovery of who Laura really was, and I then decided that I wanted to get therapy for the eating disorder, and for the next, probably three or four years. I really just focused on me.\"\nShe then returned to surfing in Croyde.\n\"It's always been a safe place of mine to be able to go into the water and to allow my board catch a few waves,\" she said.\nThen she and her brother took on the Cribbar, one of Cornwall's most intimidating big waves.\n\"I've always been somebody that kind of just throws caution into the wind and just goes for it anyway. \n\"So in that moment I really felt that I was living into my values.\n\"I found the Laura she was always meant to be.\"\nAfter pictures from the session went viral she got a call from big wave surfing legend Eric Rebiere to learn to take on the challenge of Nazare, where waves the height of 10-storey buildings roll in.\n\"And I was like, okay, like, if this guy really believes in me for the first time ever a male in this industry believes in my physical power like this is awesome,\" she said. \n\"I'm gonna just jump in headfirst and just go for it.\"\nHer first lesson was in tow surfing, a practice used in big wave surfing in which a surfer is towed into waves by a personal watercraft.\n\"It sucked me in straight away, I absolutely loved it,\" she said.\nWhat followed was weeks of training to condition her body to withstand the demands of surfing Nazare, including wiping out on huge waves that hit 60ft (18.3m).\n\"I felt a lot of pressure myself and what I wanted to achieve by surfing these waves, but also I felt pressure for just women's sport in general and to inspire others.\n\"There is one thing that matters, and it is just not to doubt yourself. As soon as you start to doubt yourself it's all over.\"\nShe said: \"To be the first British female to surf there was a really nice feeling, and I hope that it inspires other young female British athletes in their sports, too.\"\nShe said she wanted to \"inspire people to be stronger than they think they can be\". \n\"I've doubted myself a lot in the years, and whether that's through society telling me that I couldn't do these things or not.\n\"Wherever your 60ft wave is, you can get it if you don't turn your back on it and you don't allow somebody else to tell you that you can't achieve it.\n\"You've just got to have enough fight in you to keep going.\"\nListen to an interview with Laura Crane on BBC Sounds.

I felt like I was the one in charge.\u201d\nBut Liam\u2019s drug use was ruining his life, and his family's.\n\u201cI was meant to be the man at home because my dad isn\u2019t in the picture,\" he said. \"But I put my mum in dangerous situations.\"\nHe said dealers came to their door once and demanded to see him, as he owed money.\n\u201cMy mum had a way with words and made them go away.\u201d\nLiam borrowed money off his mum over and over, and each time would promise it would be the last time.\nHis bedroom at home was his own private drug den, with blood from his nose smeared on the walls and bottles of urine scattered around.\nIn 2022, Liam was approached by someone with their own lived experience of drug use, who worked for the County Lines Informed Cumbria project - known as 1CLIC. \n1CLIC is a Cumbria Constabulary initiative and is in partnership with the Well Communities.\nLiam attended rehab and has now been \u201cclean\u201d for more than a year.\nThe Well Communities is led by Dave Higham, who is originally from Liverpool, but moved to Cumbria in the early 2000s.\nMr Higham is a former addict and reformed criminal, who turned his life around after one last stay in prison for aggravated burglary when he was in his mid 30s.\nNow aged 53, Mr Higham says he uses his own experiences to show people like Liam that they can have a \u201clife beyond their wildest dreams\u201d.\n\u201cI\u2019m no one special, I just committed to the process,\" he said.\n\u201cNine times out of 10, I\u2019ve been worse than them.\"\nMr Higham said if he could turn his life around, \"anyone\" could.\nThe 1CLIC project identifies vulnerable people who are most at risk of being recruited by drug gangs and supports them to move away from potential criminal behaviour.\nThe funding for the expansion of the project will be provided through the government's Serious Violence Duty, which requires local authorities, integrated care boards, police, fire and rescue, and probation to work together address root causes of violence.\nSince its introduction in February 2022, 1CLIC has conducted more than 2,300 vulnerability visits in the same way that Liam was approached.\nIn Barrow, active county lines have been reduced from six, with moments throughout the project when there were no active lines.\nIn Kendal, there was a three-month period with no active county lines, a reduction from the two lines that had been operating long-term in the town.\nCumbria Constabulary's Det Sgt Kevin Milby, the 1CLIC project manager, said the partnership allowed them to help \"the people most in need\" and show them that \"support\" was there.\n\u201cBy disrupting those involved in county lines, we are preventing illegal drugs getting into our communities, which in turn prevents the associated detrimental impact drug supply has,\" he said.\nFor Liam, now 14 months \"clean\", he is looking forward to a \"beautiful\" future, free of drugs and drug dealers. \nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), external, Facebook, external and Instagram, external.

    "Calls to make an 80-pitch campsite in East Sussex permanent have been rejected by the local council over concerns about its impact on nature.  \nWealden District Council's (WDC) north planning committee refused the application to make permanent an existing temporary planning permission at the site near Wadhurst, East Sussex, despite it being recommended for approval. \nThe site, on the shores of Bewl Water, has been operating since November 2020. \nCritics had raised concerns about the impact of camping on wildlife at Bewl as well as the High Weald National Landscape, the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) said. \nBewl Water is an 800-acre parkland and reservoir on the border between East Sussex and Kent. \nCouncillor Johanna Howell told the committee permanent permissions would bring a \"Center Parcs type development to Sussex\" and amount to \"thuggery\" against natural habitats.\nMs Howell said: \"We are told we will benefit from tourism; no we won\u2019t. That will go to Kent. \n\"We don\u2019t need the pressure on nature and habitat. This will be corporate business winning over nature. This will be thuggery and I for one want no part of it.\u201d\nThe temporary permission allowed the site to operate between May and September each year. \nApproval of the permanent application would have seen this extended to between April and September.\nHowever, Councillor Gareth  Owen-Williams told the committee that in three years since the temporary application was given there had been \"very little complaints\" \nHe added: \u201cFamilies are struggling.\n\"I think if there is cheap accommodation which enables ordinary people to have access to the beautiful natural environment we are lucky enough to have, I don\u2019t see a problem with that, as long as it is not causing a problem.\u201d\nCouncillors also refused an application to erect four yurts  (two of which are already in-situ) and to retain a portacabin containing toilet and wash facilities at Bewl Water.\nThe site can still be used for camping, as under planning law land can temporarily be used for camping for up to 28 days a year without planning permission. \nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "A woman left paralysed from the waist down after giving birth is supporting a fundraising drive for a rehabilitation centre in the north of England.\nIrrum Jetha, 43, was treated at Neurokinex in Hertfordshire after she suffered a spinal cord injury in 2014.\nAfter moving to York, the journey became impractical and she is now backing plans for a centre in Leeds.\nNot-for-profit Neurokinex says it has raised \u00a3450,000 but needs a further \u00a3200,000 by 1 June to secure the funds.\nMs Jetha said she spent the first few months of her daughter's life in hospital after a hematoma caused by an epidural during labour. \n\"Afterwards, I had no movement from my waist, so I was bound to a wheelchair,\" she said.\nHowever, since using the centre in Hemel Hempstead she said she had begun to feel a \"little twitch\" in her knee and had progressed to being able to walk with a frame. \nShe had been making the almost 360-mile round trip from York but had to stop once her daughter started school.\nHaving a clinic in Leeds would make a \"huge impact\", she said. \nShe added: \"Neurokinex provided me with an essential service and gave me hope.\n\"With it nearer to home, it would be very beneficial to me, especially in the way of using equipment that only a specialised centre would have.\"\nNeurokinex also treats people who have suffered strokes, traumatic brain injuries and who are living with MS and has been \"delivering life-changing community-based rehab in Bristol, Hemel Hempstead and Gatwick for 10 years\". \nIt has secured \u00a3450,000 for the new centre from the National Lottery Community Fund, People's Postcode Innovation\u00a0Trust and Edward Gostling Foundation but said the donations were \"time-limited\" and if it could not raise the additional funds in time \"the opportunity will be lost\".\nDaniel, 17, from Newcastle, who was left paralysed in 2020 due to a rare neurological autoimmune disease affecting one in a million people, and Tara Stewart, also from York, both currently travel to the clinic at Gatwick for treatment.\nMs Stewart, who was injured at neck level in a horse riding accident in 2014, described the situation as a \"race against time\" to get the necessary funding in place.\nSpinal injury expert Professor Ronaldo Ichiyama, from the University of Leeds, said: \"The window of opportunity is not very large, so, without the missing amount we won't be able to provide not just this service but the opportunity for research and development.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire n Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "The family of a cyclist who died in a crash on a guided busway said they were \"delighted\" that new safety measures have been installed in the wake of his death. \nSteve Moir, 52, fell into the path of an oncoming bus when he clipped the kerb separating him from the busway in Cambridge in September 2018.\nOn Saturday the busway, between Cambridge railway station and the Cambridge Biomedical Campus, fully reopened after it closed for six weeks while fencing was installed. \nCambridgeshire County Council, which manages the route, said it \"would not be appropriate to comment further\" because it faced legal action by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).\nThree people have died in separate busway incidents in Cambridgeshire between 2015 and 2021, with a fourth suffering life-changing injuries.\nIn a family statement, released by Rob Moir, Steve's brother, he said: \"The Moir family is delighted that, finally, action has been taken to install fencing ensuring that other families do not have to endure heartache and grief due to the completely unnecessary death of a loved one.\"\nHe said his brother was unable to avoid a collision \"due to the design of the system\". \n\"The outcome would have been completely different if a fence separating the busway from the maintenance track had been in place at the time.\"\nHe said only after another pedestrian, Kathleen Pitts, 52, was struck on the same section, as Steve, in October 2021, was action taken. \n\"From the many comments received since Steve\u2019s death, we know how much the people of Cambridge will appreciate feeling safer when using the maintenance track, especially parents of the many children who journey along that stretch,\" he added. \nThe authority said work on the last section of the busway started on 25 February and returned to two-way operation on Saturday. \nThe maintenance track from Hills Road bridge to Long Road bridge, which runs alongside the busway for cycling, walking and running, is not due to open until 6 April.\nIn May 2023, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said it planned to start legal proceedings against the county council amid safety concerns.\nThe authority could see legal costs of \u00a31.6m as it faces prosecution over the deaths of three people on the busway.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson has a plan for getting new military assistance for Ukraine approved by Congress - and for keeping his tenuous hold on power.\nWith Democrats wary and a Republican right flank eyeing open rebellion, however, Mr Johnson may find that even the best-laid plans could quickly unravel.\nThe Louisiana congressman told Fox News he would push the House - which has the narrowest of Republican majorities - to structure new Ukraine support in the form of loans.\nTo help cover the costs he suggested authorising the US government to seize and sell Russian assets frozen since the start of the Ukraine war.\n\"If we can use the seized assets of Russian oligarchs to allow the Ukrainians to fight them, that's just pure poetry,\" said Mr Johnson.\nAn estimated $300bn (\u00a3239bn) in Russian central bank assets have been frozen - although most of this is under European, not American, control.\nAs an additional sweetener for his Republican colleagues, he also proposed tying the passage of Ukraine aid to legislation ending a hold on new liquefied natural gas export authorisations. The hold was imposed by the Biden administration in January at the behest of environmental activists.\nThis wouldn't be the first time Republicans have tried to tie Ukraine assistance - which is opposed by a growing number of conservative voters and a small but vocal group of legislators - to an unrelated political priority for the party. In February, Senate Republicans negotiated with Democrats to construct a legislative package that included funding for Ukraine along with conservative immigration reforms and resources for border security.\nThe deal collapsed, however, after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump voiced his opposition and his supporters in Congress - including Mr Johnson in the House - followed suit.\nThe White House says approved Ukraine aid ran out at the beginning of the year and has repeatedly warned that the nation is losing ground in its war against Russia because of a lack of continued American backing. \nIn the House of Representatives, pro-aid legislators have been gathering signatures for a parliamentary procedure that would trigger a vote on a Senate-approved measure that authorises new aid for Ukraine and Israel - essentially forcing Mr Johnson's hand.\nThe House speaker's latest proposal may be a way to forestall such a direct erosion of his power to set the legislative agenda.\nAs Mr Johnson grapples with how to help Ukraine, however, he stands on unstable ground. The man who assumed the speakership after his predecessor was ousted last year by a right-wing rebellion is facing similar unrest from his party's hard-core right. \nHis negotiated deal with Democrats to avoid a government shutdown two weeks ago prompted one conservative firebrand, Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, to file a motion for his removal. While she has not taken steps to force a vote on the matter, she has warned that she will if Mr Johnson isn't ultimately replaced.\nLater this month, Republican membership in the House will drop to 217 - meaning it would only take two Republicans to join the chamber's 213 Democrats to launch an attempt to oust Mr Johnson.\nOn Sunday night, Mr Johnson tried to reset expectations for his party - and buy himself some breathing room.\n\"We have the smallest majority, literally, right now in US history,\" he said. \"So we're not going to get the legislation that we all desire and prefer.\"\nThis mathematical reality puts the speaker in a delicate situation. If he angers even a handful of Republicans, such as by striking a deal to help Ukraine, it may trigger an uprising. And if he doesn't do enough to placate Democrats, they may once again help the rebellious conservatives execute their plot.\nWith national elections to decide the presidency and control of both chambers of Congress set for November, Mr Johnson - and his fellow Republicans - can ill afford to appear rife with internal divisions and incapable of governing.\n\"This is not an easy job right now,\" Mr Johnson said.",

    "Iran has vowed to respond to what it said was an Israeli strike on Monday that destroyed an Iranian consulate building in Syria's capital, Damascus.\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Israel would \"regret this crime\", while President Ebrahim Raisi insisted that it would \"not go unanswered\".\nIranian state TV reported that seven Revolutionary Guards, including two generals, and six Syrians were killed.\nThe Israeli military said it did not comment on foreign media reports.\nBut an unnamed senior Israeli government official told Reuters news agency that those killed had \"been behind many attacks on Israeli and American assets and had plans for additional attacks\". They also insisted that the embassy \"was not a target\".\nThe New York Times also cited four Israeli officials as confirming that Israel had carried out the strike but denying the building had diplomatic status.\nIsrael has acknowledged carrying out hundreds of strikes in recent years on targets in Syria that it says are linked to Iran and allied armed groups which are armed, funded and trained by the Revolutionary Guards.\nThe strikes have reportedly been stepped up since the start of the war in Gaza in October last year, in response to cross-border attacks on northern Israel by Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups in Lebanon and Syria.\nIran has so far avoided direct confrontation with Israel during the conflict, but Monday's attack is seen as a serious escalation.\nOn Tuesday, Iran's president said the Revolutionary Guards commanders had been in Syria \"as senior advisers in defending the holy shrine\" - an apparent reference to a revered site on the outskirts of Damascus believed to house the tomb of Sayyida Zeinab, the daughter of the first Shia Muslim imam.\n\"Having failed to destroy the will of the resistance front, the Zionist regime [Israel] has put blind assassinations back on its agenda to save itself,\" Mr Raisi added. \"It must know that it will never achieve its goals and that this cowardly crime will not go unanswered.\"\nLater, Iran's supreme leader also vowed to avenge the Revolutionary Guards' deaths, which he described as a \"heavy loss\" for his country.\n\"The evil regime will be punished by the hands of our brave men. We will make them regret this crime and others like it,\" Ayatollah Khamenei said.\nIran's mission to the United Nations in New York also said the strike constituted a \"flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter, international law,  and the foundational principle of the inviolability of diplomatic and consular premises\".\nOne of Ayatollah Khamenei's advisers, Ali Shamkhani, meanwhile claimed that US \"remains directly responsible, whether or not it was aware of the intention to carry out this attack\".\nUS National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said it \"had no involvement in the strike\" and \"did not know about it ahead of time\".\nSyria's defence ministry said Israeli aircraft launched missiles at the Iranian consulate building, which was located next door to the Iranian embassy on a highway in the western Mezzeh district of Damascus, from the occupied Golan Heights on Monday afternoon.\nThe entire building was destroyed, \"killing and injuring everyone inside\", it added, without providing further details.\nIran's ambassador, Hossein Akbari, said the strike was carried out by Israeli F-35 fighter jets and \"targeted my place of residence and the consular section of the embassy, along with Iran's military attaches\".\nOn Monday evening, Iran's Revolutionary Guards put out a statement saying that seven of its officers were killed, including Brig-Gen Mohammad Reza Zahedi and Brig-Gen Mohammad Hadi Haji-Rahimi. \nIranian media said Zahedi, 63, was a senior figure in the Quds Force - the Revolutionary Guards' overseas operations arm - and served as commander in Lebanon and Syria between 2008 and 2016. Haji-Rahimi was meanwhile identified as Zahedi's deputy.\nZahedi is one of the most high-profile Iranian figures believed to have been killed by Israel in the country's long campaign of targeted assassinations. \nOn Tuesday, Iranian state TV reported that the death toll had risen to 13, with six Syrian nationals killed along with the Revolutionary Guards.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported that 11 members of Iran's so-called \"Axis of Resistance\" were killed. They comprised eight Iranians, including seven commanders, two Syrians and one Lebanese national, it said.\nLebanese security sources also told Reuters that one member of Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement was killed.\nLast week, suspected Israeli strikes on Damascus and the northern city of Aleppo reportedly killed 53 people, including 38 Syrian soldiers and seven members of the Iran-backed Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.\nIran has said Revolutionary Guards have been sent to Syria to \"advise\" President Bashar al-Assad's forces in the country's civil war, but it has denied they have been involved in combat or established bases.",
    "A UN official says the Israeli attack which killed seven staff of the charity World Central Kitchen (WCK) is either a \"dreadful failure of deconfliction\" or evidence that the system that exists now is not fit for purpose.\nThe official, who has extensive experience in Gaza and asked not to be identified, said that the greatest fear of aid workers is that the Civilian Liaison Administration, the branch of the Israeli military tasked with co-ordinating with humanitarian organisations, \"doesn't really have a grip\".\nWhat's known as \"deconfliction\" is a system that allows aid organisations to work in some of the world's hottest conflicts, including Yemen, Ukraine, Syria and Gaza.\nIt generally takes two forms. One is \"notification\" - making sure that the relevant military powers know where humanitarian organisations are located (including providing GPS co-ordinates of all facilities) and where vehicles are expected to be moving at any given time on any given day.\n\"Co-ordination\" is a more detailed level, involving real-time communication with the CLA while humanitarian teams are actually on the move.\nIt's designed to make sure that all military personnel along the route know exactly where vehicles are.\n\"The whole apparatus, whether it's a drone operator, a radar operator, a guy in a tank, a guy at a checkpoint, a sniper on the roof, they're all aware that in the next 20 minutes, five white cars are going to come down the road. So no-one is surprised,\" Giorgios Petropoulos, head of the Gaza sub-office of the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) told me. \nA trip from Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip to Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, he said, could involve as many as eight conversations to make sure the journey goes smoothly.\nJan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, told the BBC the relationship between aid groups and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) needed to be reset.\n\"If they shoot at anything moving as it seems here, with a deconflicted and notified convoy, there has to be a complete reboot in the relationship between the Israeli war machine and all of us aid groups,\" he said.\nIsrael has acknowledged it killed the WCK staff. \"We will do everything so that this thing does not happen again,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.\nAid workers in Gaza agree that the area is one of the most challenging places in the world for humanitarian workers to operate.\n\"Gaza is a shitty place to work,\" one told me. The aid worker said the existing deconfliction system was not working properly.\n\"The notification system essentially doesn't work,\" they added. \"It's not a disciplined system from the Israeli side.\"\nThe aid worker said there had been \"some pretty dramatic failures\", including an incident on 5 February in which Israeli naval fire hit an UNRWA convoy (carrying food from World Central Kitchen) as it headed up the coast road towards the north. The incident forced the UN to suspend aid convoys to the north. \nThe IDF said at the time that it was looking into the incident, in which no-one was hurt.\nHowever, Monday's deadly incident is a disaster: for WCK, the people of Gaza, and Israel's image.\nAs Israel moves to ban UNRWA - the main UN organisation responsible for the welfare of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip - it has come to rely heavily on other humanitarian organisations.\nMr Netanyahu's government has accused UNWRA of employing more than 2,000 members of Hamas, the Palestinian armed group which attacked Israel on 7 October last year.\nWCK, which has been on the ground for months and which had just brought in a second 400-tonne shipment of aid by sea from Cyprus, had been playing an increasingly prominent and important role in preventing Gaza from sliding into famine.\nIsrael has trumpeted the role of WCK and other aid organisations as proof UNRWA is no longer needed.\nAt a recent briefing, Israeli diplomats said WCK had \"come out of nowhere and has become around 13% of the food story inside Gaza\".\nIsrael also says it is doing everything in its power to facilitate the distribution of aid throughout the Gaza Strip. \nBut WCK has now suspended its operations in Gaza. Meanwhile, Mr Egeland said that movement between Gaza's south - where most aid enters, via two crossings from Israel and Egypt - and its north \"will again be completely paralysed. And that is extremely serious, because it's in the north that famine is already taking a grip.\"\nHe added that the WCK suspending operations \"means more famine, more dead children, more epidemic disease because people are so malnourished\". \nMr Egeland urged Israel to open more crossing points into Gaza.\n\"Let me remind all that there are two border crossings minutes away from the north, they are called Karni crossing and Erez crossing, and Israel has refused to open them for aid convoys,\" he said.\n\"Israel can open the borders for organised relief and safety. They are not willing to do that.\"",
    "International food charity World Central Kitchen (WCK) is suspending its operations in Gaza following the death of seven of its workers in an Israeli air strike. \nThree of the killed aid workers were British citizens, WCK said.\nThe charity said those killed were part of an aid convoy that was leaving a warehouse in central Gaza on Monday.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has acknowledged that Israel's forces hit \"innocent people\". \nGaza's Hamas-run media office also blamed Israel.\nWCK is one of the main suppliers of desperately needed aid to Gaza. It said that it would \"be making decisions about the future of [its] work soon\". \nAccording to the charity, the aid convoy was hit while leaving the Deir al-Balah warehouse, \"where the team had unloaded more than 100 tons of humanitarian food aid brought to Gaza on the maritime route.\"\nThe convoy was made up of three vehicles, including two that were armoured. The BBC understands that all three were hit in the strike. \nWCK said it had co-ordinated the convoy's movements with the IDF when it was hit.\nA Palestinian medical source told the BBC the workers had been wearing bullet-proof vests bearing the WCK logo.\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society said it had recovered all seven bodies from the scene of the incident following a \"challenging operation spanning several hours\".\nThe humanitarian group added that the bodies had been taken to the Abu Yousef al-Najjar hospital in southern Gaza in preparation for their evacuation through the Rafah border crossing into Egypt. \nMr Netanyahu released a video message on Tuesday in which he said Israeli forces were behind the attack.\n\"Unfortunately, in the last 24 hours there was a tragic case of our forces unintentionally hitting innocent people in the Gaza Strip,\" he said.\n\"It happens in war, we check it to the end, we are in contact with the governments, and we will do everything so that this thing does not happen again.\"\nThe IDF had earlier said it was conducting a thorough review at the highest level to understand the circumstances of the \"tragic incident\".\n\"We will get to the bottom of this and we will share our findings transparently,\" IDF spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari vowed.\n\"The work of WCK is critical; they are on the frontlines of humanity.\"\nMr Hagari added that the IDF had been \"working closely with the World Central Kitchen to assist them in fulfilling their noble mission of helping bring food and humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza\".\nAccording to WCK, the workers who died were Australian, Polish, British, Palestinian and a dual US-Canadian citizen. \n\"I am heartbroken and appalled that we - World Central Kitchen and the world - lost beautiful lives today because of a targeted attack by the IDF,\" the charity's chief executive Erin Gore said in a statement. \n\"The love they had for feeding people, the determination they embodied to show that humanity rises above all, and the impact they made in countless lives will forever be remembered and cherished.\"\nAccording to Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body in charge of co-ordinating aid deliveries to Gaza, the charity is responsible for 60% of the non-governmental aid getting into the territory. \nWCK said in a recent statement that it had served more than 42 million meals to people in Gaza since October and had been ready to provide more than one million more. \nThe charity recently made headlines for providing hundreds of tonnes of food for Gazans that was transported on the first aid ship in March.\nAid agencies have started delivering aid by sea in order to increase the amount getting into the territory, which the UN says is on the brink of famine.\nBut following the deadly strike, a second US-based charity, the American Near East Refugee Aid (Anera), which was working closely with WCK, told the BBC it was also freezing its operations in Gaza.\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has confirmed that aid worker Lalzawmi \"Zomi\" Frankcom was among those killed and has offered his condolences to family and friends. \nIn a statement, he said: \"This is someone who was volunteering overseas to provide aid through this charity for people who are suffering tremendous deprivation in Gaza. And this is just completely unacceptable.\"\nHe said Australia expected \"full accountability\", adding that it was a \"tragedy that should never have occurred\".\nWojciech Bakun, the mayor of the Polish city of Przemysl, said that Damian Sob\u00f3l, who was from the area, was also among those killed.\nMr Bakun described Mr Sob\u00f3l as a \"fantastic boy\", adding that no words could describe the feelings of those who knew him. \nThe Polish foreign ministry said it had received reports of the incident and was seeking urgent official confirmation from the Israeli government about the victim's identity. \n\"We extend our deepest condolences to the family of the Polish volunteer who was providing aid to the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip,\" it wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\nThe UK Foreign Office ",
    "Guadeloupe-born author Maryse Cond\u00e9, who was renowned for epic novels tackling the legacy of slavery and colonialism in Africa and the Caribbean, has died at the age of 90.\nOne of the most celebrated voices in the French-speaking world, Cond\u00e9's works included 1984's Segu and 1986's I, Tituba: Black Witch of Salem.\nShe also wrote plays and non-fiction.\nIn 2018, she won an award set up in place of the Nobel Prize in Literature, which was engulfed in scandal.\nCond\u00e9 was the first and remains the only winner of the New Academy Prize in Literature, whose judges praised the way she \"describes the ravages of colonialism and post-colonial chaos in a language which is both precise and overwhelming\".\nShe wanted to be a writer since she read Emily Bront\u00eb's Wuthering Heights as a child, but didn't publish her first novel until she was in her 40s.\nThat book was 1976's Heremakhonon, which means \"waiting for happiness\" in the the west African Malinke language. It followed a woman from the Caribbean who lived and taught in Paris, and who travelled to Africa to trace her identity.\nBut what she discovered did not match her expectations. The author described it as \"a novel about disenchantment and pain\".\nShe said it was not autobiographical, but there were parallels with her own story. Cond\u00e9 moved to study at the Sorbonne in Paris, where her eyes were opened to the history of colonialism, slavery and her own African roots.\n\"When I was a child I was very spoilt by my parents. I was oblivious to the outside world,\" she told the Guardian in 2020.\n\"I was convinced that I was one of the most beautiful girls in the world and certainly one of the most intelligent, but when I came to study in France I discovered people's prejudices. People believed I was inferior just because I was black.\n\"I had to prove to them I was gifted and to show to everybody that the colour of my skin didn't matter - what matters is in your brain and in your heart.\"\nAfter marrying Guinean actor Mamadou Cond\u00e9, she moved to his home country, then to Ghana, Mali and Senegal, before returning to teach at the Sorbonne.\nHeremakhonon's depiction of the flaws of African socialism proved controversial, with three West African countries ordering copies to be destroyed.\n\"In those days, the entire world was talking of the success of African socialism,\" she later wrote. \"I dared to say that... these countries were victims of dictators prepared to starve their populations.\"\nAmong her subsequent books, Segu depicted the fortunes of a historical kingdom in modern-day Mali, which was torn apart by the arrival of the slave trade and Islam.\nIn I, Tituba: Black Witch of Salem, Cond\u00e9 told the story of a slave who was one of the first women to be accused of witchcraft during the 1692 Salem witch trials.\nReviewing the book, US author Howard Frank Mosher wrote in the New York Times: \"It is impossible to read her novels and not come away from them with both a sadder and more exhilarating understanding of the human heart, in all its secret intricacies, its contradictions and marvels.\"\nHer other works included Windward Heights - which relocated Wuthering Heights to Cuba and Guadeloupe - as well as volumes of essays and autobiography.\nCond\u00e9 had four children. She and her husband divorced in 1981 and she went on to marry British teacher Richard Philcox, who was also her translator. They lived in the US for two decades, where she was professor emerita of French at Columbia University in New York.\nCond\u00e9 was awarded France's Legion of Honour in 2004, and was twice nominated for the International Booker Prize - first for her entire body of work in 2015, then in 2023 for her final novel, The Gospel According to the New World.",
    "A child has been killed and two others seriously wounded in a shooting at a school in Finland, police say.\nPolice said all three victims were 12 and that a suspect, also aged 12, had fled but was later detained.\nParents told Finnish media that the shooting had taken place in a classroom at Viertola school in Vantaa, to the north of the capital, Helsinki.\nPolice said they arrived at the school within nine minutes at 09:17 (06:17 GMT) and tended to the three victims.\n\"One of the victims died almost immediately at this location in the school,\" said the head of local police, Tomi Salosyrja. The other two children have been taken to hospital and their condition is described as very serious.\nIn common with other Finnish schools, children had just returned to classes in Vantaa, just outside Helsinki, after the long Easter weekend. All of those involved are in the sixth grade.\nThe suspect ran off as soon as police arrived and was eventually detained \"in a calm manner\" in the northern Siltamaki district of Helsinki at 09:58. A video taken from a passing car shows the suspect being pinned down beside a road almost 4km (2.5 miles) from the school.\nPolice said he had been holding a firearm which they had taken from him and he admitted carrying out the shooting.\nAuthorities have now opened an investigation into murder and attempted murder. \nChildren under the age of 15 are not criminally liable in Finland, so the suspect has not been remanded in custody and will be placed in the care of social services after further questioning.\nThe suspect is understood to have used a gun licensed to a close relative. Gun ownership is widespread in Finland and children over 15 can have licences to use other people's firearms.\nPrime Minister Petteri Orpo described the shooting as deeply upsetting and said it was evident too many young people struggled with their mental health: \"We have to be able to tackle these issues sooner.\"\nPresident Alexander Stubb spoke of his shock. A day of mourning will take place in Finland on Wednesday.\nEducation Minister Anna-Maja Henriksson was on the verge of tears when she told a news conference that what had happened was a great tragedy. Her thoughts were with the \"12-year-old who will never come home from school again\". \nIt was shocking that a child of 12 could get hold of a gun, she said, and once the government had a complete picture, it would consider whether further measures needed to be taken to protect Finland's schools.\nChildren at the school were told to stay in their classrooms after the attack, while other schools and kindergartens nearby were also instructed to lock their doors.\nThe shooting brought back memories of earlier deadly attacks, including two shootings and an attack on a vocational school four years ago involving a man wielding a sword.\nIn 2007, an 18-year-old student shot dead six pupils, the school nurse and his head teacher in the small town of Jokela, north of Helsinki, then the following year another student shot dead nine pupils and a teacher with a semi-automatic rifle at a polytechnic in the western town of Kauhajoki.\nThe shootings prompted a tightening of gun laws, requiring gun owners to be at least 18, but anyone over 15 can apply for a permit to use someone else's weapon if they have their guardian's permission. Eighteen-year-olds must be considered fit to possess a firearm before being granted a permit.\nNational Police Commissioner Seppo Kolehmainen said police relied on intelligence to prevent school shootings and in this case were unable to stop it.\nFinland is widely known as a country of hunters and gun enthusiasts and has 430,000 licensed gun owners in a population of 5.6 million, according to government statistics. There is no limit to the number of guns that can be owned and the interior ministry says more than 1.5 million are in circulation.\nAs news of the shooting emerged, parents gathered at the school to pick up their children, although the building where the incident took place remained cordoned off. \nVantaa is Finland's fourth biggest city with some 240,000 residents. Viertola school has 800 students aged seven to 16 of both primary and middle-school age on two separate sites, with some 90 staff. The shooting took place at at the school's Jokiranta site where pupils aged 9-13 are taught. \nInitially police said everyone involved was 13 but then revised their ages down to 12.\nAre you in the area?

    "A 12-year-old girl has been placed under police protection in Ghana after it emerged she had been married to a 63-year-old traditional high priest.\nThere was public outrage after footage of Saturday's customary wedding was shared on social media.\nThe office of the influential priest, who serves an indigenous community in the capital, defended the marriage, saying it was only ceremonial.\nThe legal minimum age to get married in Ghana is 18.\nThe prevalence of child marriage has declined in recent years, but it continues to happen. \nPolice say they have identified and tracked down the girl and she is now under their protection, along with her mother.\nContact had been made with the government's children's minister and the social welfare department to ensure the 12-year-old gets the necessary support while investigations continue, their statement added.\nThe story is huge news here - and the move by the police has elicited some praise, though others are questioning why there have been no arrests.\nThe priest in question, Nuumo Borketey Laweh Tsuru XXXIII, is a much-respected member of a community that lives in the Nungua area of the capital, Accra.\nAs a spiritual leader, the priest - known as a \"Gborbu Wulomo\" - performs sacrifices on behalf of the community, prays for their protection, enforces cultural practices and leads traditional rites during events such as the installation of traditional chiefs.\nVideos and photos of the elaborate wedding show it was attended by dozens of community members and in the footage women are heard telling the girl to dress teasingly for her husband.\nThey also advise her to be prepared for wifely duties and to use the perfumes they gave her to boost her sexual appeal to her husband.\nCommunity leaders say such duties would not be expected for another six years, when she would be 18.\nHowever, civil society groups continue to condemn the marriage.\n\"The perceived acceptance of child marriages and the open brazen approval or defence of the practice by influential leaders of the community have the potential to embolden certain deviant behaviours like paedophilia,\" the Paediatric Association of Ghana has said in a statement.\nAccording to the UN 's children's agency (Unicef), the West African nation has two million unions in which the wife was a child bride at the time of the marriage.\nMore than nine out of 10 married girls are not attending school, it adds.\nAnother recent study showed one in five young Ghanaian women aged between 20 and 24 years were married before the age of 18.\nThe members of the community in Nungua are part of the Ga people, who live along the south-eastern coast of Ghana.\nIn Ga culture, the selection of chiefs, high priests and wives of the high priest is believed to be a spiritual process.\nSpecific families are responsible for nominating someone for these roles to serve the gods.\nIn this case, the 12-year-old comes from one of the families who by tradition must provide a bride for the high priest.\nFor the family, it is an honour - though in most cases the chosen candidates for these roles are adults.",
    "A temporary route for ships has opened near the collapsed Baltimore bridge, as part of what officials call an \"enormous\" recovery effort. \nSix people died after the Dali cargo ship struck the Francis Scott Key Bridge last week. Four bodies remain lost in the wreckage.\nShipments have also been suspended at the port, one of the busiest in the US. \nMaryland Governor Wes Moore said: \"We need to do more work clearing the channel in order to move forward.\"\nAt a press conference on Monday, he emphasised the urgency of moving the debris - which he said was a prerequisite for rebuilding the bridge - and outlined the hazards of the operation. \n\"Every time someone goes in the water, they're taking a risk,\" he said, after describing water \"so murky\" that divers could barely see beyond a foot in front them. \n\"Every time we move a piece of the structure, the situation could become even more dangerous. We have to move fast but we cannot be careless.\"\nGovernor Moore said that after a 10-hour operation, Unified Command was able to cut and lift a 200-tonne span of the bridge \"almost the size of the Statue of Liberty\". \n\"It's a small piece of what we're talking about,\" he said. \"The scale of this project, to be clear, it is enormous, and even the small lifts are huge.\" \nThose involved in the clean-up have been cutting debris from the bridge into smaller pieces that can be removed and taken to a disposal site.\nCranes have been erected on the site to help lift debris from the bridge. That includes the Chesapeake 1000, the largest crane on the eastern US seaboard. \nThe temporarily channel that opened on Monday would help officials get more vessels into the water around the site of the collapse, Governor Moore said. \nThe taskforce set up in the wake of the disaster said the temporary route was for \"commercially essential vessels\", and had been opened as part of a \"phased approach to opening the main channel\".\nCurrently, a 2,000-yard (1,828-metre) safety zone exists around the wreckage, preventing all vessels and people from entering the area without permission from port officials. \nRoughly 80-90% of the bridge wreckage is currently underwater, according to officials. \nUS President Joe Biden is scheduled to visit the site on Friday, the White House has announced. \n\"As the president said within hours of the collapse, this administration will be with the people of Baltimore every step of the way,\" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Monday.\nThe Port of Baltimore is a key economic generator for the state of Maryland and a vital artery for imports and exports of US and global trade.\nExperts say it could take a month before it reopens, and years to rebuild the bridge. It is thought an investigation into last week's incident may take years.\nThe US government last week approved $60m (\u00a347m) in initial emergency funds requested by Maryland. Mr Biden has said he hopes the government will entirely fund the bridge's reconstruction. \nBut that proposal was met with almost immediate backlash from conservative Republicans who aim to curb government spending.\n\"The very thought of having the Federal Government pay for the Baltimore bridge is TOTALLY ABSURD!!\" South Carolina Republican Ralph Norman told The Hill by text message. \nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in an MSNBC interview on Wednesday that she expected insurance payments to cover some of the costs to rebuild the bridge.\nThe Dali container vessel - which is nearly as long as the Eiffel Tower - remains on the water. Its crew, all Indian nationals, are reportedly still aboard and unharmed.\nLittle is known about them, and it remains unclear when they will be allowed off the stranded ship.\nThe recovery has been further complicated by the amount of debris in the dark waters of the Patapsco River. Divers have been unable to see more than a foot or two in front of them.\nEight construction workers were repairing potholes on the Key Bridge when the Dali cargo ship veered into one of its columns, forcing most of the structure into the water. \nTwo were rescued and the bodies of two others have been recovered. The search for the remaining four - who are presumed dead - has been put on hold due to the challenges posed by the bridge debris.\nIsabel Franco, the wife of Jose Mynor Lopez, who is still missing, told CBS News that the 35-year-old had a \"good heart\" and always \"worried\" about his family.\nFour vehicles are also unaccounted for. Sonar scanning is ongoing for vehicles, human remains and debris that could potentially dislodge underwater. ",
    "A Nationwide advert featuring actor Dominic West that claimed the building society was not closing branches has been banned.\nThe Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said in fact that Nationwide had been closing branches.\nIt was also not clear enough that a Nationwide promise not to close any more would end in 2026, the watchdog added.\nOne of the complaints against the ads had been made by Santander.\nThe bank had been referenced in the ads, but said it had closed fewer branches than Nationwide in the year before the ad campaign.\nBanks have been closing branches for a number of decades. In the mid-1980s there were more than 21,000 branches, but this had more than halved by the 2020s.\nMore recently, banks have been saying that changing customer habits and increasing use of online banking have meant less demand.\nHowever, branch closures have hit many groups of people, including those with disabilities, older people, those living in rural areas, and small businesses, according to a recent House of Lords report.\nThe Nationwide ad campaign featured Dominic West as the boss of a fictional big bank who mocks customers while planning branch closures. Mr West has previously played Jimmy McNulty in popular series The Wire and Prince Charles in Netflix's runaway hit series, The Crown. The ads ran on TV, the radio, and in the press.\nIn the ad, the fictional bank is contrasted with Nationwide, with the slogan: \"Unlike the big banks we're not closing our branches.\"\nThe ads called out Lloyds Banking Group, which includes Bank of Scotland and Halifax, as well as Natwest, Barclays, Santander and HSBC. \nThe ads had 281 complainants, including from Santander, which said that Nationwide had recently closed or reduced opening hours at a number of branches, and challenged whether the ads were misleading.\nSantander closed six branches in 2023.\nBy contrast, Nationwide closed two branches in 2023, but had closed 14 branches in the 12 months prior to the campaign.\nOver a 10-year period, Nationwide closed 152, or 20% of its branches. Although this was a smaller percentage than the competitors it called out in its ads, it was still a \"significant number\", the ASA said.\nIn addition, Nationwide made a \"branch promise\" in 2019 not to leave a town or city where there is a branch, unless there are \"circumstances outside of our control\".\nThe building society updated this in 2023, committing to not close any branches until at least 2026. It then extended that until 2028.\nThe ASA found the ads had not made it clear enough that this promise was potentially only short term.\nNationwide said: \"The investment we have made to keep branches open means we now have more than any other brand and are the last one standing in more than 90 communities.\"\nA spokesperson added that the building society was \"delighted to have the opportunity to make even clearer our now extended branch promise to keep every branch open until the start of 2028\".",
    "The last surviving crew member from the USS Arizona battleship - which was sunk in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii - has died. He was 102.\nLouis Conter was on watch when the US Pacific fleet was bombarded on 7 December 1941 off the island of Oahu.\nThe surprise assault propelled America - which had been neutral - to enter World War Two, joining Allied forces.\nConter went on to carry out bombing missions in the Pacific as a US Navy pilot during the conflict.\nHe died at his home in California on Monday after heart failure, his daughter said.\nThe news leaves only 19 survivors of the Pearl Harbor attack still living, according to the AP news agency, citing an organisation representing descendants of those caught up in the assault.\nConter, who was then a 20-year-old quartermaster, later described himself as lucky to have survived the attack on the Arizona - which lost the majority of its crew after sinking just minutes into the attack.\nMore than 2,000 Americans were killed during the raid at Pearl Harbor and elsewhere off Oahu - more than half of whom had been on the Arizona. \nMany bodies were never retrieved.\nIt was those personnel who were the true \"heroes\" of the day, Conter told AP in 2022. \"And we've got to honour them ahead of everybody else.\"\nIn a separate interview in his later years, Conter recalled how a bomb had ignited a store of gunpowder below deck - causing an explosion that lifted the Arizona 30 to 40 feet (9 to 12 metes) out of the water.\nDescribing the chaos in the moments afterwards, he said: \"Guys were running out of the fire and trying to jump over the sides, and oil all over the sea was burning.\"\nHe described in his memoir how he and other survivors helped the injured and performed rescues before abandoning ship.\nConter's subsequent service as a pilot in the night-time Black Cats squadron in the Pacific proved to be eventful. \nHe was shot down in a 1943 mission - recalling that he managed to get his crew into a lifeboat. The group were said to have drifted through shark-infested waters to an enemy-occupied island - New Guinea - where they successfully hid before being rescued.\nConter also flew missions during the 1950-53 Korean War. He later served as a military adviser to Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson. \nHe was described by his daughter in an interview with Reuters as \"a survivor\" who swore by the mantra of \"never give up\".",

A video taken from a passing car shows the suspect being pinned down beside a road almost 4km (2.5 miles) from the school.\nPolice said he had been holding a firearm which they had taken from him and he admitted carrying out the shooting.\nAuthorities have now opened an investigation into murder and attempted murder. \nChildren under the age of 15 are not criminally liable in Finland, so the suspect has not been remanded in custody and will be placed in the care of social services after further questioning.\nThe suspect is understood to have used a gun licensed to a close relative. Gun ownership is widespread in Finland and children over 15 can have licences to use other people's firearms.\nPrime Minister Petteri Orpo described the shooting as deeply upsetting and said it was evident too many young people struggled with their mental health: \"We have to be able to tackle these issues sooner.\"\nPresident Alexander Stubb spoke of his shock. A day of mourning will take place in Finland on Wednesday.\nEducation Minister Anna-Maja Henriksson was on the verge of tears when she told a news conference that what had happened was a great tragedy. Her thoughts were with the \"12-year-old who will never come home from school again\". \nIt was shocking that a child of 12 could get hold of a gun, she said, and once the government had a complete picture, it would consider whether further measures needed to be taken to protect Finland's schools.\nChildren at the school were told to stay in their classrooms after the attack, while other schools and kindergartens nearby were also instructed to lock their doors.\nThe shooting brought back memories of earlier deadly attacks, including two shootings and an attack on a vocational school four years ago involving a man wielding a sword.\nIn 2007, an 18-year-old student shot dead six pupils, the school nurse and his head teacher in the small town of Jokela, north of Helsinki, then the following year another student shot dead nine pupils and a teacher with a semi-automatic rifle at a polytechnic in the western town of Kauhajoki.\nThe shootings prompted a tightening of gun laws, requiring gun owners to be at least 18, but anyone over 15 can apply for a permit to use someone else's weapon if they have their guardian's permission. Eighteen-year-olds must be considered fit to possess a firearm before being granted a permit.\nNational Police Commissioner Seppo Kolehmainen said police relied on intelligence to prevent school shootings and in this case were unable to stop it.\nFinland is widely known as a country of hunters and gun enthusiasts and has 430,000 licensed gun owners in a population of 5.6 million, according to government statistics. There is no limit to the number of guns that can be owned and the interior ministry says more than 1.5 million are in circulation.\nAs news of the shooting emerged, parents gathered at the school to pick up their children, although the building where the incident took place remained cordoned off. \nVantaa is Finland's fourth biggest city with some 240,000 residents. Viertola school has 800 students aged seven to 16 of both primary and middle-school age on two separate sites, with some 90 staff. The shooting took place at at the school's Jokiranta site where pupils aged 9-13 are taught. \nInitially police said everyone involved was 13 but then revised their ages down to 12.\nAre you in the area?

    "Few political turnarounds can match the last month in Senegal. \nJust over two weeks ago, Bassirou Diomaye Faye was a little-known opposition leader languishing in jail, detained without trial on charges including inciting insurrection, who had never held elected office. \nOne week ago, he defeated the governing party's candidate, Amadou Ba, in the country's presidential election, winning 54% in the first round. \nOn Tuesday, the 44-year-old has been sworn in as the fifth president of Senegal, becoming Africa's youngest elected head of state. \nIn a region where a large majority of the population are under 30, his victory offers hope to those young people frustrated by a lack of economic opportunities, with old elites seemingly clinging to power.\nMr Faye's spectacular rise is a powerful reminder that elections still represent the best way to remove a failing government for many citizens in Africa. \nNot only has his win removed an unpopular government from office, it has strengthened the country's democratic institutions and reinvigorated popular confidence in democracy at a time when coups in other West African states have done the opposite.\nThe story of Mr Faye's victory will also inspire other leaders across the continent, who have experienced years of rising repression, intimidation and censorship.\nAccording to long-time Ugandan opposition leader Kizza Besigye, who has recently worked with his younger counterpart Bobi Wine to campaign for democracy in his country, \"Senegal's extraordinary electoral process has demonstrated, again, that with a well-mobilised, resilient and well-led population, it's possible to non-violently achieve the desired democratic transition in Africa\".\nThe inspirational impact of Mr Faye's success will be magnified by the fact that it did not come easily. \nAhead of the election the government of President Macky Sall took a number of undemocratic steps in what was seen as an attempt to try and hold on to power against a backdrop of growing popular discontent. \nThis included the sustained persecution of opposition leaders and critical voices and a last-ditch attempt to delay the elections in a desperate bid to avoid defeat, which led some commentators to ask whether we were seeing the death of Senegalese democracy. \nMany of these measures were aimed at undermining the momentum behind the popular opposition party, the African Patriots of Senegal for Work, Ethics and Fraternity (Pastef).\nThis included detaining the party's popular leader Ousmane Sonko and Mr Faye, who was Pastef's secretary-general. There was also widespread intimidation of Pastef supporters.\nThe jailing of Mr Sonko - for allegedly acting immorally towards an individual younger than 21 after allegations by a massage therapist - along with a number of inflammatory moves, sparked some of the biggest protests Senegal has seen in recent years. In turn, a heavy-handed response from the security forces led to numerous deaths.\nMr Sonko described the charges as trumped-up and aimed at barring him from running for president. \nPastef itself was dissolved by the authorities last year after it was accused of stoking violence in the country - but its leadership continued operating.\nIt took incredible bravery and hard work from opposition leaders, civil society groups, journalists and those working in some of the country's democratic institutions to ensure that this bleak situation ended in an election that Mr Faye was in a position to win. \nIt was the members of the Constitutional Council, Senegal's top court, that ensured the election would go ahead as scheduled when they stood up to the president and ruled that his attempt to change the date was unlawful.\nThe Pastef leadership also played an important role, standing firm in the face of great intimidation. \nDespite his firebrand reputation, Mr Sonko also proved to be willing to be flexible and put his personal presidential ambitions to one side to give his colleague the greatest chance of success. \nIndeed, without this Mr Faye would not have even been on the ballot.\nMr Sonko expected to be barred from the polls due to his convictions, and his application to be a candidate was subsequently rejected by the Constitutional Council on the grounds that it \"was incomplete\". Despite efforts to get him back on the ballot, Pastef's leaders came to the conclusion that it was unlikely that he would be allowed to run.\nThis realisation made it clear that choosing Mr Faye, who was never actually put on trial, was a safer option - even though it meant Mr Sonko, the party's figurehead, taking a backseat.\nCivil society groups and journalists also played an important role, continuing to report on government repression and human rights abuses, despite being attacked, detained and tear gassed. \nThrough their work, they ensured that Senegalese citizens and the rest of the world knew what was happening in their country, increasing the pressure on President Sall to back down. \nIn the end, these efforts, and",
    "Parents in England are now entitled to 15 hours a week of free childcare for their two-year-olds.\nThe UK government hopes the scheme, which will cover all under-5s by 2025, will get more parents back to work.\nBut the situation is not the same in Wales, because childcare is a devolved issue. \nParents in Wales have previously called on the Welsh government to mirror the additional support being rolled out in England.\nHowever, critics of the new system in England have said there are not enough places.\nThe Welsh government has two funded childcare schemes for children aged two, three and four.\nUnder the Childcare Offer, parents and guardians of three and four-year-old children can claim up to 30 hours of free childcare each week, for up to 48 weeks of the year, provided they meet certain criteria.\nThe 30 hours is made up of at least 10 hours of early education, with the precise figure dependent on each local authority, and up to 20 hours of free childcare.\nTo be eligible for the 30 hours, each parent must:\nThe second is the Flying Start Scheme, which provides 12.5 hours of free childcare to some two-year-olds living in more deprived areas of Wales.\nThis scheme is currently undergoing a phased expansion, and will eventually be available to all two-year-olds in Wales as part of a co-operation agreement between the Welsh government and Plaid Cymru.\nExtra help with childcare costs in England is being rolled out in stages. Some free hours were already available.\nThe help you can get depends on the age of your child, and whether you are working, or receiving certain benefits.\nWorking parents can get:\nWhen the UK government decides to spend more or less on things such as health and education in England, the Barnett formula is used to decide how much money the other nations receive.\nThe \u00a34bn expansion of childcare support in England, announced last year, meant \u00a3180m was made available to the Welsh government.\nFinance Minister Rebecca Evans said at the time that the Welsh government was \"already rolling out a phased expansion of our childcare offer to two-year-olds\" as part of a co-operation agreement with Plaid Cymru. \n\"We will consider how best to use the consequentials from this announcement as a cabinet, to best meet the needs of people in Wales,\" she added.\nIn January, First Minister Vaughan Gething promised to expand free childcare in Wales if he was elected.\nMr Gething's promise followed a petition calling for the Welsh government to match the UK government's childcare pledge, which received more than 400 signatures and was debated in the Senedd.\nIn England, Labour has commissioned a review of the UK government's expansion of free childcare.\nShadow Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said her party would not commit to the plan, as she said the system was not equipped to deal with extra demand.",
    "Caroline Sutherland never imagined she would have to lay her father to rest twice. \nNorrie Kennedy died in 2018 and was buried in Ayr Cemetery but just four years later his family faced the heartache of him being exhumed. \nHis body was removed along with 125 others after graves within the site became waterlogged. \nHis daughter now says the family has been let down by South Ayrshire Council over reburial arrangements.\nThe council said it was working closely with families to ensure that all of their wishes were met for the care of their loved ones. \nAffected families were told of the drainage issues in 2022. \nRestoration work at the cemetery began that August and involved the exhumation of 126 bodies.\nThey were taken to a specialist facility near Prestwick Airport to be prepared for re-interment. \nIn that time the lairs - or plots - were repaired, and work was completed last December. \nThe head of South Ayrshire Council previously told BBC Scotland News the families' wishes when it came to the reburial of their loved ones was his \"number one priority\".\nBut Ms Sutherland said she felt \"let down\" by the council. \nShe said that on the day her father was reburied, she arrived at the cemetery to find his gravestone was covered in mud.\nMs Sutherland told BBC Scotland News: \"It was just a building site, there was mud and muck all over the gravestone and it was an icy, cold day in December.\n\"We had to try to clean his gravestone but because it was so icy, tissues would not work. Baby wipes didn't work either. \n\"A gravedigger had to come over and use water from his lunch to clean the gravestone before we could rebury him.\"\nMs Sutherland said: \"The compassion wasn't there. It was a conveyor belt. That's not how you treat people. \n\"At the end of the day, we are people who have lost dads, mums, brothers, sisters and kids.\n\"We're trying to do the best we can to honour their lives and it's just muddied. That's what we're going to remember, it supersedes all the good memories.\"\nSouth Ayrshire Council said it had spent \u00a3284,000 in total on re-interments, floral displays and the services of funeral directors. \nThe council leader previously promised to cover all costs and meet \"any request\" the families wanted in regard to reburials.\nBut Ms Sutherland said her family were told only certain coffins and floral tributes were allowed.\nShe said: \"There was a limit on what you were allowed to spend, regardless of what anybody else at the council said.\n\"For all this heartache, stress, sleepless nights, crying you know, fighting even within the family and that's it - coffin and some flowers.\"\nThe local authority told BBC Scotland News it understood that it had been a distressing time for families.\nThe council also said it had been in regular contact with relatives and lair owners throughout the process. \nA spokesperson said: \"Initial contact was via letter and subsequently telephone calls, and face-to-face meetings have also taken place.\n\"We have been working closely with families to ensure that all of their wishes are met for the care of their loved ones. \n\"Each family has individual requirements for their loved one and we have, where possible, fully absorbed those costs. \n\"The council has also provided support for families through bereavement counselling and will continue to offer support and liaise with them directly.\"\nMs Sutherland said she had been left \"traumatised\" and, despite being offered mental health support by the local authority, she believed \"no amount of counselling\" would help. \nFurther drainage issues have also been discovered 10 miles away at Troon cemetery. \nThe council has identified flooding within 87 lairs there.\nOf the total 51 are occupied and the bodies inside will also now need to be exhumed. \nWork at Troon cemetery began in January.\nSouth Ayrshire Council has promised to \"liaise directly with families\" impacted.\nMs Sutherland said she could only sympathise with families who had loved ones in the affected graves at Troon cemetery.\n\"There's nothing I can say that will help them in any way, apart from keep fighting, make sure you get what you want. \n\"Don't take no for an answer. \n\"They just need to try to get through it the best they can.\"",
    "Scotland could become the first part of the UK to ban egg companies from keeping chickens in cages.\nThe Scottish government has announced a new consultation on outlawing the use of cages to house hens involved in egg production.\nAgriculture minister Jim Fairlie said if it was implemented Scotland would be \"leading the way in improving the welfare of animals\".\nThe use of battery cages for birds was banned in the UK in 2012.\nBut there are still more than 1.1m chickens in Scotland kept in \"enriched cages\", which provide birds with more room to nest, roost and scratch than the smaller battery cages.\nA survey in 2020 found that almost nine out of 10 people (88%) in the UK believed that using cages in farming was cruel.\nAnd more than three quarters (77%) supported a complete ban on their use.\nThe Scottish government's preference is for a ban on the installation of new cages from 2033, followed by a complete ban on keeping birds in enriched cages from 2034.\nMinisters believe this option \"most effectively balances improvements in bird welfare and ensures sustainability for the laying hen sector\".\nBut the consultation also seeks views on banning the use of enriched cages from 2030.\nAnd it proposes a non-regulatory option, which would see shops and caterers commit to stop selling and using eggs from birds kept in enriched cages by 2034.\nMr Fairlie said the Scottish government's most recent programme for government had included commitments \"to improve the welfare of laying hens to ensure their confinement does not negatively impact their normal behaviours\".\nHe added: \"Significant progress has already been made in recognising the importance of animal welfare - both in government policies and the demand from the public in the choice they make when shopping.\n\"If implemented, the ban would be another example of Scotland leading the way in improving the welfare of animals by being the first UK nation to ban the practice.\"\nThe minister said the European Union had put forward legislation to prohibit using cages for all farmed livestock, with Luxembourg and Austria already banning them and others phasing them out.\nAnd he said the Scottish government would also call for evidence, in due course, on the use of cages in the gamebird, quail egg and meat sectors.\nMark Borthwick, World Animal Protection policy manager, welcomed the news and said: \"We're pleased to see Scotland leading the way in consulting on the ban of cages for laying hens which are still in use in the UK.\n\"Enriched cages for laying hens will be banned in other countries including in Germany in 2025, in Czechia by 2027 and in Slovakia by 2030.\n\"France has banned the installation of any new cages. The UK is behind, and the other nations are slipping behind even further.\n\"It is time to end the use of cages which restrict animals' natural behaviours and cause great suffering.\"",
    "Three days after remains of a French boy were found along an Alpine path not far from where he disappeared nine months ago, police have found some of the clothes he was wearing close by.\nHowever, prosecutors say the mystery of Emile Soleil's disappearance in July last year has still not been solved.\nA hiker found a skull and some teeth on Saturday, about 25 minutes' walk from the village where he was last seen.\nThe skull was quickly matched to the missing boy's DNA.\nNow a T-shirt, shoes and shorts that Emile was wearing on the day he vanished have been recovered, scattered over a small area about 150m (500ft) from where his remains were found.\nDetails of the new find came from local public prosecutor Jean-Luc Blanchon, who said Emile's death was still unexplained. It is still unknown if Emile Soleil was the victim of an accident or a crime.\n\"These bones by themselves do not allow us to say what the cause of Emile's death is,\" he told reporters. \"Between a fall, manslaughter or murder, no theory can be treated as more likely than another.\"\nEmile, who was two-and-a-half, had been in the village of Haut-Vernet in south-east France for just a few hours when he went missing. His disappearance has been a cause celebre in France ever since.\nHe had gone to stay at his grandparents' holiday home in Haut-Vernet, a village of 25 people at an altitude of 1,200m (4,000ft) on the slopes of the Massif des Trois-Ev\u00each\u00e9s mountain range. He was last sighted by neighbours walking on the only street in the village in a yellow T-shirt and white shorts at 17:15 on Saturday 8 July.\nDespite long and widespread searches of the entire area, no trace of the boy was found.\nTwo days after a re-enactment of his disappearance last Thursday involving 17 people, a local woman out walking just over a kilometre from Haut-Vernet stumbled on some of his remains.\n\"This heart-breaking news was feared, and the time has come for mourning, contemplation and prayer,\" the child's parents said in a statement.\nThe child's skull was sent away for analysis by forensic teams. Sniffer dogs, soldiers, police and firefighters scoured the area for more evidence. \nJean-Luc Blanchon told a news conference on Tuesday that the skull had sustained \"small fractures and cracks\" after the boy's death, as well as bites from one or more animals.\n\"No trauma has been observed [on the skull] ante-mortem,\" he stressed, adding that it was clear the remains had not been buried in the ground.\nWhat remains a mystery is why the boy's skull and clothing had not been detected earlier. The rest of his remains are yet to be found.\nA spokeswoman for France's gendarmerie (military police) has already suggested the bones could have been placed there by a person or an animal, or they could have been shifted by changing weather conditions. Or they could have been missed entirely during the extensive searches of the area last summer.\nThe public prosecutor said the female hiker had found the bones between 12:00 and 14:00 on Saturday afternoon on a \"narrow, forest path\" which she remembered walking on more than a month earlier. The clothes were found further away, close to a stream, he explained.\n\"We cannot be sure Emile's body was already present in the search area,\" said the prosecutor, or \"that every square metre was covered by a member of the search teams\". He also made the point that because the original search took place when the undergrowth was especially thick, it was possible the summer temperatures could have affected the sniffer-dogs.\nHe accepted that his conclusions would not satisfy anybody, including Emile's family and investigators, and said the search would resume on the ground, probably on Wednesday.",
    "A UN official says the Israeli attack which killed seven staff of the charity World Central Kitchen (WCK) is either a \"dreadful failure of deconfliction\" or evidence that the system that exists now is not fit for purpose.\nThe official, who has extensive experience in Gaza and asked not to be identified, said that the greatest fear of aid workers is that the Civilian Liaison Administration, the branch of the Israeli military tasked with co-ordinating with humanitarian organisations, \"doesn't really have a grip\".\nWhat's known as \"deconfliction\" is a system that allows aid organisations to work in some of the world's hottest conflicts, including Yemen, Ukraine, Syria and Gaza.\nIt generally takes two forms. One is \"notification\" - making sure that the relevant military powers know where humanitarian organisations are located (including providing GPS co-ordinates of all facilities) and where vehicles are expected to be moving at any given time on any given day.\n\"Co-ordination\" is a more detailed level, involving real-time communication with the CLA while humanitarian teams are actually on the move.\nIt's designed to make sure that all military personnel along the route know exactly where vehicles are.\n\"The whole apparatus, whether it's a drone operator, a radar operator, a guy in a tank, a guy at a checkpoint, a sniper on the roof, they're all aware that in the next 20 minutes, five white cars are going to come down the road. So no-one is surprised,\" Giorgios Petropoulos, head of the Gaza sub-office of the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) told me. \nA trip from Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip to Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, he said, could involve as many as eight conversations to make sure the journey goes smoothly.\nJan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, told the BBC the relationship between aid groups and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) needed to be reset.\n\"If they shoot at anything moving as it seems here, with a deconflicted and notified convoy, there has to be a complete reboot in the relationship between the Israeli war machine and all of us aid groups,\" he said.\nIsrael has acknowledged it killed the WCK staff. \"We will do everything so that this thing does not happen again,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.\nAid workers in Gaza agree that the area is one of the most challenging places in the world for humanitarian workers to operate.\n\"Gaza is a shitty place to work,\" one told me. The aid worker said the existing deconfliction system was not working properly.\n\"The notification system essentially doesn't work,\" they added. \"It's not a disciplined system from the Israeli side.\"\nThe aid worker said there had been \"some pretty dramatic failures\", including an incident on 5 February in which Israeli naval fire hit an UNRWA convoy (carrying food from World Central Kitchen) as it headed up the coast road towards the north. The incident forced the UN to suspend aid convoys to the north. \nThe IDF said at the time that it was looking into the incident, in which no-one was hurt.\nHowever, Monday's deadly incident is a disaster: for WCK, the people of Gaza, and Israel's image.\nAs Israel moves to ban UNRWA - the main UN organisation responsible for the welfare of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip - it has come to rely heavily on other humanitarian organisations.\nMr Netanyahu's government has accused UNWRA of employing more than 2,000 members of Hamas, the Palestinian armed group which attacked Israel on 7 October last year.\nWCK, which has been on the ground for months and which had just brought in a second 400-tonne shipment of aid by sea from Cyprus, had been playing an increasingly prominent and important role in preventing Gaza from sliding into famine.\nIsrael has trumpeted the role of WCK and other aid organisations as proof UNRWA is no longer needed.\nAt a recent briefing, Israeli diplomats said WCK had \"come out of nowhere and has become around 13% of the food story inside Gaza\".\nIsrael also says it is doing everything in its power to facilitate the distribution of aid throughout the Gaza Strip. \nBut WCK has now suspended its operations in Gaza. Meanwhile, Mr Egeland said that movement between Gaza's south - where most aid enters, via two crossings from Israel and Egypt - and its north \"will again be completely paralysed. And that is extremely serious, because it's in the north that famine is already taking a grip.\"\nHe added that the WCK suspending operations \"means more famine, more dead children, more epidemic disease because people are so malnourished\". \nMr Egeland urged Israel to open more crossing points into Gaza.\n\"Let me remind all that there are two border crossings minutes away from the north, they are called Karni crossing and Erez crossing, and Israel has refused to open them for aid convoys,\" he said.\n\"Israel can open the borders for organised relief and safety. They are not willing to do that.\"",
    "Oregon has approved a state law that recriminalises drug possession.\nThe law rolls back an experimental policy - the most liberal drug measure in the US - that made possession for personal use a ticketed offence with a fine up to $100 (\u00a376).\nThe new legislation penalises those possessing small amounts of drugs with probation, and up to 180 days in jail.\nThe governor said the state still aims to provide a path for drug treatment, rather than punishing drug users.\nTina Kotek, the Democratic governor, signed the bill on Monday. It goes into effect on 1 September. \nRehabilitation and destigmatisation was the intention of the original law, known as Measure 110, when it was passed in a 2020 voter measure, but a spike in the number of overdoses caused lawmakers and supporters to backtrack.\nMeasure 110 was seen by many as the most liberal effort in the US to decriminalise drugs like cocaine, heroine and methamphetamine. \nState leaders admitted, however, that there were several implementation issues. Roadblocks to rehabilitation remained, and the upswing in fentanyl overdoses caused an uproar in the state. \nIn cities like Portland, sightings of people openly using drugs on streets, sidewalks and in front of stores increased and images appeared in national media.\nPortland Mayor Ted Wheeler told the New York Times: \"The truth is that addiction rates and overdose rates skyrocketed.\"\nThe mayor, who remained supportive of Measure 110, accused the state of failing to implement the law effectively. He said they decriminalised the use of drugs before putting the proper treatment services in place.\nIn addition to enhanced penalties for personal use possession, the new law still establishes ways for treatment to be offered as an alternative to criminal penalties. \nGovernor Kotek said the law's success will depend on coordination between multiple layers of government on the state and local level, as well as health care providers, all of whom she described as \"necessary partners\".\nA few of those who originally supported Measure 110 voted for the new law during this year's legislative session, as there appeared to be signs of a new voter effort to overturn it. The state's more progressive Democrats opposed the change, however.\u00a0\nThey remained concerned that increased criminal penalties would only lead to more arrests and fail to address the root cause of the state's drug problem.\u00a0\n\"Research is consistently showing that (for) people who are incarcerated in jails and prisons, overdose has gone up substantially,\" Kassandra Frederique, the executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, told USA Today. \n\"And the fact that when people leave jails and prisons, the likelihood of overdose deaths also goes up substantially in comparison to the general population.\"",
    "Ask 72-year-old farmer Huanchun Cao about his pension and he reacts with a throaty cackle.\nHe sucks on his home-rolled cigarette, narrows his brow and tilts his head - as if the very question is absurd. \"No, no, we don't have a pension,\" he says looking at his wife of more than 45 years.\nMr Cao belongs to a generation that witnessed the birth of Communist China. Like his country, he has become old before he has become rich. Like many rural and migrant workers, he has no choice but to keep working and to keep earning, as he's fallen through a weak social safety net. \nA slowing economy, shrinking government benefits and a decades-long one-child policy have created a creeping demographic crisis in Xi Jinping's China.\nThe pension pot is running dry and the country is running out of time to build enough of a fund to care for the growing number of elderly. \nOver the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. This is the country's largest age group, nearly equivalent to the size of the US population. \nWho will look after them? The answer depends on where you go and who you ask.\nMr Cao and his wife live in the north-eastern province of Liaoning, China's former industrial heartland. \nVast swathes of farmland and mined hills surround the main city of Shenyang. Plumes of smoke from smelting factories fill the skyline, alongside some of the country's best-preserved world heritage sites from the Qing dynasty. \nNearly a quarter of the population here is 65 or older. An increasing number of working-age adults are leaving the heavy industries hub in search of better jobs in bigger cities. \nMr Cao's children have moved away too but they are still close enough to visit often.  \n\"I think I can only keep doing this for another four or five years,\" Mr Cao says, after he and his wife return from collecting wood. Inside their home, flames crackle beneath a heated platform - called a \"kang\" - which is their main source of warmth. \nThe couple make around 20,000 yuan (\u00a32,200; $2,700) a year. But the price for the corn they grow is going down and they cannot afford to get sick.\n\"In five years, if I'm still physically strong, maybe I can walk by myself. But if I'm feeble and weak, then I might be confined to bed. That's it. Over. I suppose I will become a burden for my children. They will need to look after me.\"\nThat is not the future 55-year-old Guohui Tang wants. Her husband had an accident at a construction site and their daughter's university education drained her savings. \nSo the former digger operator saw an opportunity in elderly care to fund her own old age. She opened a small care home about an hour from Shenyang.\nThe pigs and geese both honk a welcome at the back of the single-storey house surrounded by farmland. Ms Tang grows crops to feed her six residents. The animals are not pets - they are also dinner. \nMs Tang points to a group of four playing cards as the sun shines through the small conservatory. \n\"See that 85-year-old man - he doesn't have a pension, he's relying entirely on his son and daughter. His son pays one month, his daughter pays the next month, but they need to live too.\"\nShe is worried that she too will have to depend on her only daughter: \"Now I will pay my pension every month, even if it means I cannot afford to eat or drink.\"\nFor generations, China has relied on filial piety to fill the gaps in elderly care. It was a son or daughter's duty to look after ageing parents.\nBut there are fewer sons and daughters for ageing parents to rely on - one reason is the \"one-child\" diktat which prevented couples from having two or more children between 1980 to 2015.\nWith rapid economic growth, young people have also moved away from their parents, leaving a rising number of seniors to look after themselves or rely on government payments.\nBut the pension fund could run out of money by 2035, according to the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. That was a 2019 estimate, before the pandemic shutdowns, which hit China's economy hard.\nChina may also be forced to raise the age of retirement, which has been on the cards for years. It has one of the lowest retirement ages in the world - 60 for men, 55 for white-collar women and 50 for working-class women. \nBut economists say this is just tinkering around the edges if China is to avoid what some fear could become a humanitarian crisis in 25 years.\nMeanwhile, more and more elderly have been dipping into their pensions.\n\"Welcome to my home,\" beckons 78-year-old Grandma Feng, who only wanted to use her last name. \nIt's hard to keep up with her as she races along the corridor to warn her husband that guests are on the way to their room at the Sunshine Care Home.

    "A gold nugget that is thought to be the largest found in England has failed to sell at auction.\nThe 64.8g lump had a guide price of up to \u00a340,000 placed on it, but bids reached just \u00a312,000 before the online auction closed on Monday.\nUnearthed in May 2023 near Much Wenlock, Shropshire, the nugget was found by Richard Brock from Somerset.\nAuctioneer Ben Jones, of Mullock Jones, said negotiations would now start with prospective buyers in an attempt to increase the price.\n\"I'm sure we'll have an influx of people coming in, which is usually the case post-auction anyway,\" Mr Jones told BBC Radio Shropshire.\n\"You always take a gamble with these things, and sometimes you just have to see how they ride and play it out, really.\"\nEven the bid price was significantly in excess of the current market value of gold.\nThat stood at about \u00a357.80/g on Tuesday, which would only value the nugget at about \u00a33,800.\nMr Brock made his discovery on farmland, during an organised dig for which he had turned up an hour late, using a machine that was \"pretty much kaput\".\nHe said he had only recently learned that it could be the biggest found in England, which was \"quite incredible really\", and he planned to split the proceeds with the landowner.\nThe previous largest English nugget was 54g, but one found in Scotland in 2017 weighed more than 85g.\nAn old track or road and a railway line are thought to have run through the farmland where the nugget was discovered, and the site contained stone understood to have originally come from Wales, said the auctioneers.\nOn the day of the organised dig in May 2023, other people had up-to-date kit, said Mr Brock, while he \"bowled up with three old machines\", one of which immediately stopped working.\nMr Jones said his hopes of a sale had been raised by last-minute bids: \"There was a sort of scurry at the end.\n\"[In the] last couple of minutes there were a few bids being placed, and you sit there thinking, 'This could go a bit more'.\n\"We'll have a chat to the bidders and speak to the vendor, and see if there's something we can do.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A man who was left homeless while struggling with addiction has said he would \"probably be dead\" if not for a nurse specialising in homeless healthcare and the Simon Community.\nInclusion health nurses are now in every health trust across Northern Ireland.\nThey work in hostels and with community organisations to provide essential healthcare to those who are homeless.\nThis way, these nurses can reach some of the most vulnerable in society.\nPaddy, who is in his 60s, arrived at the Simon Community hostel in Armagh in December 2021 after being evicted from his home in Kilkeel, County Down, due to excessive drinking.\nHe had struggled with alcohol addiction for over 20 years. \nWith the help of the Southern Health Trust's inclusion health nurse and those working in the hostel he was able to manage his addiction and has been sober since June 2022. \n\"I've been in many bad places with drink and I didn't care if I ever got a bite to eat,\" he explained. \"As long as I had drink and cigarettes, that was it.\"\nHe has described the intervention by the hostel nurse and staff  as life saving.\n\"I'd probably be dead with the way I was drinking,\" he added.\nOn top of his addiction, Paddy had developed health issues which worsened as a result of his drinking including a broken arm which went untreated for over a year. \n\"I told the nurse my arm was broken, I think it was broken for years,\" he said.\n\"She found out all about it and got me talking to a doctor again and I got it operated on. I needed 14 pins in it. \n\"I couldn't have done that without her.\"\nThe Public Health Agency developed a regional inclusion health model in 2018 with the aim of supporting the complex needs of people who experience homelessness and bridging the gap between community and hospital care.\nAn inclusion health hub was first set up in Belfast in 2019, followed by two new mobile clinics in the city and in the north west. \nDedicated nurses were appointed in the Southern, South Eastern and Northern Health Trusts in 2022, targeting those in smaller, rural communities, and another inclusion health hub was launched in Londonderry in June.\n\"There are now eight homeless health nurses - four in Belfast that work as part of a multi-disciplinary team and one in each of the other trusts.\"\nLisa Ewart is a nurse in the South Eastern Health Trust and holds weekly and monthly drop-in clinics at various hostels, Women's Aid shelters and community organisations.\n\"Every day is different,\" she told BBC News NI. \n\"You would see people who have very poor access to health services due to their transient lifestyle so the first port of call is getting them GP registration. \n\"You could be looking at trying to manage someone's diabetes and they maybe don't have insulin. Prescription management is a huge thing and medicines.\n\"It's really important to catch those service users and to try and get them engaging with services locally.\" \nThe Belfast and Western Health trusts also have support staff to provide podiatry and dental services.\nAccording to the most recent statistics from the Department for Communities (DfC) 5,316 people were accepted as statutorily homeless between July to December 2023.\nThe top three reasons for presenting as homeless were accommodation not reasonable, sharing breakdown/family dispute and loss of rented accommodation. \nAs of January 2024, there were 4,556 households living in temporary accommodation.\nMs Ewart said she was seeing more and more people becoming homeless because of issues such as family breakdowns.\n\"There's a huge number of people now who have lost their tenancy and ended up homeless and I guess with the cost of living crisis that's accelerated things,\" she said.\n\"Homelessness is in every aspect of your community, it's everywhere and it's important to open people's eyes to the prospect that it's around their corner and it's in their communities.\" \nGeorgie McCutcheon, the well-being practitioner with the Simon Community, said the nurses went \"above and beyond\". \n\"So many clients have felt stigmatised as marginalised members of the community and the nurses coming directly to them breaks down those barriers and shows that they are worthy of being cared for and treated,\" she said.\n\"It also reduced the likelihood of small ailments becoming bigger health issues with their medical intervention.\"\nPaddy is now living in fold accommodation and remains in contact with the inclusion nurse in the Southern Health Trust. \nHe said he could not find enough words to express his gratitude for the help from the nurse and the Simon Community.\n\"Words couldn't say it,\" he continued.",

    "Taylor Swift has joined Elon Musk as ranking among the world's wealthiest people, according to a new rich list.\nThe American pop star entered the Forbes World's Billionaires List for the first time with $1.1bn (\u00a3877m), along with Sam Altman, creator of the AI chatbot ChatGPT on $1bn (\u00a3800m).\nLVMH French luxury goods titan Bernard Arnault and his family topped the chart with an estimated $233bn (\u00a3185bn). \nForbes said there were a record 2,781 billionaires for 2024.\nThe figure is 141 more than last year and 26 more than the previous record set in 2021. Forbes added the elite were richer than ever - with a collective wealth of $14.2tn (\u00a311.3tn).\nSinger-songwriter Swift entered the rich list after achieving megastar status. She stole the show at this year's Grammy Awards, becoming the first performer to win the prize for album of the year four times.\nHer album 1989 (Taylor's Version) was also the best-selling vinyl LP of last year.\nSwift's success is not just confined to the world of music. Her mere presence at American football games to watch her boyfriend Travis Kelce has been credited with raising NFL viewing figures.\nWhen it comes to the top 10 richest people on the planet, eight listed were from the US - six of whom had made their money in technology industries.\nAfter Frenchman Mr Arnault and his family, Mr Musk, the owner of Tesla and X, formerly Twitter, is listed second, with an estimated net worth of $195bn (\u00a3155bn).\nHe is followed in third by Amazon owner Jeff Bezos.\nMr Musk's riches are up 8% from last year but down on his net worth in November 2021, when he became the first person ever to be worth $300bn (\u00a3239bn).\nAlso joining Forbes's list is basketball legend Magic Johnson with wealth of $1.2bn (\u00a3950m) and TV producer Dick Wolf, behind the US Law and Order and Chicago PD series, also on $1.2bn. \nChase Peterson-Withorn, senior editor on wealth for Forbes, said it had been an \"amazing\" year for the world's richest people. \n\"A record-breaking 14 centi-billionaires have 12-figure fortunes. Even during times of financial uncertainty for many, the super-rich continue to thrive,\" he added.\nForbes said the class of billionaires for 2024 were 255% richer than a decade ago, now worth $2tn (\u00a31.59tn) in all, meaning just 0.5% of the world's 2,781 billionaires hold 14% of all billionaire wealth.\nGeographically, the US still has more billionaires than any other country, with a record 813 on the list. China remains second, followed by India. \nIn the UK, hedge fund manager Michael Platt is the richest person, followed by part-owner of Manchester United Sir Jim Ratcliffe and inventor Sir James Dyson.\nForbes said 189 people had fallen off the list including 129 from mainland China, where weak consumer spending and a collapse in the real estate market wiped billions off portfolios. \nAnother 32 billionaires died, including Egyptian tycoon Mohamed Al-Fayed, former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, former Chilean President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era and Margaritaville singer Jimmy Buffett.",
    "Hollywood star Kirsten Dunst has said she grew up at a time when there was \"major pay disparity\" between herself and her male co-stars. \nShe said she was paid less than male co-stars, even though she had more box office success, with films such as Jumanji (1995) and Bring It On (2000).\n\"I was very young and it just felt like at the time, what do you do?\" she said.\n\"I was 17, I was still learning my taste in film. I didn't even think to ask,\" she added.\nDunst has previously referred to the pay gap between her and actor Tobey Maguire, who she starred alongside in Spider-Man in 2002, as \"very extreme\".\nAlex Garland, who directs Dunst in his latest film, Civil War, agreed it had been a major issue but \"nobody questioned it, male executives didn't question it, these were all inherited opinions. They weren't thought about.\" \nDunst plays a war photographer documenting the United States in the grip of conflict and falling apart.\nThe star says the dystopian movie is \"very much a warning\" about what can happen. \nThe film \"leaves people with so much to think about\" and \"is a very moving, realistic piece about journalists\", the actress adds.\nDunst, 41, says it is refreshing her character is the lead in an action film and not a \"damsel in distress\". \nShe drew inspiration for the role from the famed war correspondent, Marie Colvin. \nIn the film, US government forces are fighting the separatist \"Western Forces\" led by Texas and California.\nThe civil war of the film's title appears to have been sparked by the president, played by Nick Offerman, who has ripped up the constitution by serving a third term in office (no-one is allowed to serve as president more than twice).\nParallels have been drawn to current US politics and events such as the 6 January insurrection, when supporters of Donald Trump attacked the Capitol Building in Washington DC. \nBut Garland, who also wrote the film, says the themes are not just about the US. \n\"The film is set in America but really this film is about two things. It is about journalists and it's about polarisation. Populist politics and polarisation which lead to extremism and extremist thinking.\"\nGarland, who wrote 28 Days Later and Ex Machina, adds: \"That's happening in America but it's happening here in this country [the UK] and it's been happening here for a long time and it's happening across Europe, the Middle East, Asia. I could list the countries where that would be true.\" \nHe adds that journalism is \"under attack\" which he finds \"strange, scary and dangerous\". \n\"You get people saying 'Do not trust the BBC' and you will be in places where you would be attacked and criticised for saying the unbiased news reporting organisation that you belong to.\" \nThe director says he was trying to showcase \"old fashioned journalists\" who document what is happening, without bias or opinion and leave other people to interpret what they do.\nThe film has garnered largely positive reviews, with The Telegraph's Robbie Collin awarding it five stars.\n\"Civil War moves in ways you'd forgotten films of this scale could,\" he wrote, \"with compassion for its lead characters and a dark, prowling intellect, and yet a simultaneous total commitment to thrilling the audience at every single moment. \n\"Each leg of the journey toggles between pin-drop suspense and rivetingly frantic firefights, often staged with a mesmerisingly surreal edge.\"\nEmpire's John Nugent, giving it four stars, added: \"It never lets up, always gripping, always pummelling your senses, always ghoulishly compelling. Whatever your response to its political prevarication, this is undeniably confident, intense, sweaty-palmed filmmaking at the highest level.\"\nBut the Guardian's Adrian Horton was less keen, awarding it three stars overall. Civil War is \"decidedly anti-war but firmly unspecific\", she said, \"assiduously avoiding any direct correlation to current politics or, it turns out, any politics at all\".\n\"The distance,\" she concluded, \"makes for an at times frustrating watch - stimulating on the level of adrenaline, not emotions.\"\nDunst grew up in front of the camera, beginning her career when she was three years old.\nShe says pay disparity isn't the only issue when it comes to sexism in the movie industry.\nOne of Dunst's leading roles in her early 20s was in Sofia Coppola's 2006 Marie Antoinette biopic.\nShe played the titular role and says the movie \"was panned\" by film critics.\n\"The people that were watching that movie were my age, they weren't movie reviewers. Movie reviewers were old men. So to me, the people that enjoyed Marie Antoinette have now grown up and are like 'We loved this movie' but they weren't the people writing the reviews.\n\"We grew up in a world where it's man-kind, man-made, man this, man that, that's how we grew up.\" \nBut Dunst does think times have changed: \"Hopefully, the way I carve my path will help other actresses.\"\nCivil War is released in the UK, US and Canada on 12 April.",

    "The Fairy Pools are among Skye's best-known landmarks, but few of those who visit may be aware of its real name - or bloody past.\nThe series of waterfalls and rocky pools at the foot of the Black Cuillin hills are a tourist hotspot today.\nRecent improvements to paths and crossings in the area were designed to better accommodate up to 200,000 visitors a year.\nBut, according to research, the location's original name is at risk of being lost.\nCatherine MacPhee, of Skye and Lochalsh Archive Centre, says the first written reference to the location as the Fairy Pools appears to be in a 1930s tour guide.\nShe said before then it was referred to by its original Gaelic name, Coire na Creiche, meaning corrie of the spoils.\nA corrie, or coire, is a hollow in a mountainside.\nMs MacPhee said: \"There is a book in 1921 that makes no reference to the Fairy Pools.\"\nShe added: \"The problem with the use of the Fairy Pools is that it has now become known as that and the original names are being lost.\n\"I have not found any fairy stories in the records relating to the river or the glen.\"\nWhile there are no records of tiny, winged mythical creatures there are of a battle fought between Skye's MacLeod and MacDonald clans more than 420 years ago.\nThe violent clash followed years of feuding and rival cattle raids - and the collapse of a trial marriage between members of the two clans.\nIt is said the partnership came to an end after Margaret MacLeod did not become pregnant. \nIn an act of humiliation, Margaret, who had lost sight of an eye, was said to have been tied up and sent home on a one-eyed horse.\nThe history of Skye's Armadale Castle tells of Margaret's horse being led by a one-eyed servant while a one-eyed dog walked behind them.\nThe battle that followed was violent.\nMs MacPhee said: \"There is reference in the records of the rivers running red with blood and tartan.\"\nDecker Forrest, a piper and tutor at Skye's Sabhal M\u00f2r Ostaig Gaelic college, said traditional pipe tunes still played today recalled the clans' rivalry.\n\"There are many songs and stories about the feuds between the MacLeods and the MacDonalds,\" he said.\n\"It was a really brutal time.\"",
    "Scotland could become the first part of the UK to ban egg companies from keeping chickens in cages.\nThe Scottish government has announced a new consultation on outlawing the use of cages to house hens involved in egg production.\nAgriculture minister Jim Fairlie said if it was implemented Scotland would be \"leading the way in improving the welfare of animals\".\nThe use of battery cages for birds was banned in the UK in 2012.\nBut there are still more than 1.1m chickens in Scotland kept in \"enriched cages\", which provide birds with more room to nest, roost and scratch than the smaller battery cages.\nA survey in 2020 found that almost nine out of 10 people (88%) in the UK believed that using cages in farming was cruel.\nAnd more than three quarters (77%) supported a complete ban on their use.\nThe Scottish government's preference is for a ban on the installation of new cages from 2033, followed by a complete ban on keeping birds in enriched cages from 2034.\nMinisters believe this option \"most effectively balances improvements in bird welfare and ensures sustainability for the laying hen sector\".\nBut the consultation also seeks views on banning the use of enriched cages from 2030.\nAnd it proposes a non-regulatory option, which would see shops and caterers commit to stop selling and using eggs from birds kept in enriched cages by 2034.\nMr Fairlie said the Scottish government's most recent programme for government had included commitments \"to improve the welfare of laying hens to ensure their confinement does not negatively impact their normal behaviours\".\nHe added: \"Significant progress has already been made in recognising the importance of animal welfare - both in government policies and the demand from the public in the choice they make when shopping.\n\"If implemented, the ban would be another example of Scotland leading the way in improving the welfare of animals by being the first UK nation to ban the practice.\"\nThe minister said the European Union had put forward legislation to prohibit using cages for all farmed livestock, with Luxembourg and Austria already banning them and others phasing them out.\nAnd he said the Scottish government would also call for evidence, in due course, on the use of cages in the gamebird, quail egg and meat sectors.\nMark Borthwick, World Animal Protection policy manager, welcomed the news and said: \"We're pleased to see Scotland leading the way in consulting on the ban of cages for laying hens which are still in use in the UK.\n\"Enriched cages for laying hens will be banned in other countries including in Germany in 2025, in Czechia by 2027 and in Slovakia by 2030.\n\"France has banned the installation of any new cages.

    "House price growth was \"subdued\" last month as higher mortgage rates affected affordability, the Nationwide has said.\nProperty prices rose 1.6% on average from March 2023, but fell 0.2% compared with the February, the UK's largest building society said.\nWhile mortgage rates have fallen from peaks seen last summer, they remain well above the low levels seen in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe Nationwide said affordability was still stretched, but was improving.\nRobert Gardner, the building society's chief economist, told the BBC's Today programme that affordability pressures on buyers was \"weighing down\" on activity in the housing market and price growth.\nFor someone on an average wage of about \u00a335,000 per year buying a typical home, mortgage payments currently take up nearly 40% of their take home pay.\n\"That's well above the 30% which is the long-run average,\" Mr Gardner said.\nIn Northern Ireland and the North of England house price growth was stronger than other areas, rising 4.6% and 1.7% respectively compared with last year.\nThis was mainly due to house prices in those regions being less expensive compared with other places in the UK and more affordable for buyers, leading to higher demand.\nThe annual house price increase of 1.6% was the fastest rise since December 2022, although it was a smaller increase than economists had been expecting.\nPrices fell by 0.2% in March alone, the first drop since December 2023, after a 0.7% increase the month before.\nIn a statement, Nationwide said mortgage approvals in January were 15% lower than before the Covid pandemic, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates, which are at a 16-year high.\nHowever, Mr Gardner said income rises were outpacing the house price increases, gradually making houses more affordable.\n\"But it's going to take time to make a big difference,\" he warned.\nMr Gardner said many people were expecting the Bank of England to lower interest rates this year, which would have a knock-on effect of lower mortgage rates.\nThe Bank of England decided to keep its main interest rate at 5.25% last month, but announced that rate cutes were \"on the way\".\nFinancial markets are predicting a first cut in June or August, with rates forecast to drop to around 4.5% by the end of the year.\nThe number of mortgage approvals rose in February to the highest level since the month the mini-budget was delivered under former prime minister Liz Truss.\nMore than 60,380 mortgage approvals were recorded, the highest figure since more than 65,340 deals got the go-ahead in September 2022, according to Bank of England figures.\nThe launch of the mini-budget on 23 September 2022 led to mortgage rates rocketing after financial markets reacted badly.\nIn compiling its figures, Nationwide looks at its own mortgage lending and does not include cash buyers or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales.\nRob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said mortgage rates were likely to \"gradually tick down\" and that house prices would continue to rise.\nChief executive of Foxtons estate agents, Guy Gittins, added that there had been a \"notable uplift in the volume of sales enquiries, viewings requests and the number of offers being submitted\" in recent months.",

    "One of the UK's biggest flight simulator businesses has closed blaming a lockdown voucher sales surge.\nVirtual Aerospace Limited, based in Stockport, said a \"huge backlog\" of 2,500 vouchers bought during the pandemic had been a factor in its demise. \nThe company has entered liquidation and shut all branches, including its Greater Manchester headquarters. \nCustomers with vouchers will have their details passed to liquidators. \nVirtual Aerospace, which was set up in 2011, operated six simulators across its main Stockport site and two other locations in West Sussex and Northamptonshire.\nMore than 40 flight instructors were employed at the business, which gave visitors the chance to replicate flying in popular planes including a Vulcan bomber and World War Two Spitfire.\nDemand on the operation caused by customers buying the vouchers to support the business during its 15-month pandemic closure \"massively affected new sales\", a statement on its website said.\nThe statement added staff had \"tried everything\" to reduce the backlog and \"keep us alive\".\nThe company ceased trading on 23 March on their website.\nDavid Waddington, from Burnley, who was due to use the Spitfire simulator, said he only found out about the liquidation on the morning he was supposed to visit. \nMr Waddington, 67, said: \"I went to check my emails before we set off and found two emails, one from 23 March saying it had closed.\n\"It'll probably be six months before I get any of the \u00a3100 back, and then it'll only be a percentage.\"\nThe award-winning flight simulator firm flew more than 50,000 customers over an 11-year-period.\nIt said it accepted customers would be \"mad\" following the news.\nThe firm said despite \"thousands\" of hours of good will from engineers, pilots and the VA team, it \"was not enough to fend off\" the impact.\n\"We know many of you will be mad at us and that you invested in us in good faith and we feel awful and cannot apologise enough to anybody that has lost money in this situation,\" the statement read.\nVirtual Aerospace Ltd appointed Andrew Ryder from insolvency specialist JT Maxwell Limited on 13 February.\nLiquidators are now in the process of closing the premises, auctioning assets to pay outstanding creditors, and will be in touch with customers \"in due course\".\nThe business telephone is directing customers to an email and its website appears to only show the statement online.\nWhy not follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X and Instagram?

    "A cancer research centre dedicated to early detection has been gifted \u00a311m by an anonymous donor.\nThe Early Cancer Institute in Cambridge focuses on hard-to-treat cancers, such as lung and oesophageal, and acute myeloid leukaemia.\nThe donation will fund the redevelopment of the Hutchison Building, which has been renamed in honour of one of the original donors - Sir Ka-shing Li.\nHe opened the current building in 2002.\nThe institute is based at the Cambridge Biomedical Campus, which brings together expertise in research and development and computer science, as well as two leading hospitals, Addenbrooke's and Royal Papworth.\nIt has now been renamed the Li Ka Shing Early Cancer Institute, and redevelopment will enable it to scale up and expand its work with cutting-edge laboratory space and attract scientists and clinicians to join its teams.\nDetecting and treating cancers earlier dramatically increases survival rates and reduces healthcare costs.\nHowever, detection and treatment methods have changed very little for lung, liver and oesophageal cancers over the past few years, and outcomes are often poor, researchers say. \nThe institute's director, Prof Rebecca Fitzgerald, said the \"extraordinary gift\" would \"provide the cutting-edge research facilities necessary to help our researchers develop pioneering early cancer detection innovations and take these from bench to bedside with even greater speed and focus\".\nProf Fitzgerald's team is behind the \"cytosponge\" test for Barrett's oesophagus, where patients swallow a pill that dissolves into a sponge.\nThe device can detect early signs of oesophageal cancer, which is the seventh most common cause of cancer deaths in the UK, with symptoms often mistaken for heartburn.\n\"We must ensure that as many people as possible are able to benefit from our cancer research,\" said Prof Deborah Prentice, vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge, adding that the \u00a311m gift \"allowed us to make extraordinary progress in understanding this terrible disease.\" \nSir Ka-shing said the renaming in his honour \"fulfils my lifetime commitment to build the good of science\".\n\"I am greatly encouraged that much advancement has been made towards cancer diagnosis, treatment and prevention,\" he said.\n\"It is also evident now that early detection of cancer will yield the best chance of successful treatment and quality of life for the patient.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a call on Tuesday in an effort to keep tensions between the two countries at a simmer. \nThey discussed avenues of co-operation, including recent shared efforts to combat climate change and narcotics, according to summaries of the call.\nBut there was significant disagreement on Taiwan and economic issues.\nMr Biden stressed support for Taiwan, but Mr Xi called US interference in the South China Sea a \"red line\".\nMr Xi also took issue with sanctions the US has put on China and Chinese-owned companies, calling it an \"endless stream of measures to suppress China's economy, trade, science and technology\".\n\"If the United States insists on suppressing China's high-tech development and depriving China of its legitimate right to development, we will not sit idly by,\" the Chinese leader said, according to a state media summary. \nDespite the areas of disagreement, the White House and Chinese state media described the conversation as \"candid and constructive\". The conversation ranged from AI concerns to military communications.\n\"I look forward to responsibly managing our relationship in the weeks and months ahead,\" Mr Biden wrote on X, formerly Twitter, after acknowledging points of tensions.\nWhile the discussion did not significantly alter the status of the countries' relationship, experts said that may not be the point. \nThe call was \"largely performative and an attempt to show the rest of the world that in fact the countries are committed to managing the relationship well - even though the negative dynamics in the relationship has not changed,\" Robert Daly, director of the Wilson Center's Kissinger Institute on China and the United States, said.\nBut that does not mean that the divisions expressed on the call, which lasted an hour and 45 minutes, were inconsequential.\nMr Xi stressed that Washington's support of Taiwan and pursuit of sanctions against China was \"not 'risk reduction' but risk creation\", the summary says. \nPresident Biden did not shrink from his administration's backing of the Taiwanese government, according to the White House summary. \nThe American president stressed the US view that it was essential to maintain \"peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait\" and \"the rule of law and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea\". \nBut Mr Biden also challenged Mr Xi on China's continued support for Russia's defence industrial base, its trade policies, and national security threats to the United States, the White House readout said.\n\"For China, there is no other issue more important than Taiwan,\" Yun Sun, senior fellow and co-director of the East Asia programme at the Stimson Center, said of the call. \"But for the US, there are other issues as well.\"\nMr Daly emphasised that despite both readouts placing a focus on co-operation and conversation, \"this is not a sign of a thaw\" between the two superpowers.\n\"Both leaders have an interest in demonstrating responsible management of what they both know can be a very contentious relationship in the long term,\" Mr Daly said.\nThis is all about damage control and doing what you can,\" he added. \"But neither leader is looking for an opening to change the tenor of the relationship.\"\nThe two presidents  previously met in November at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in San Francisco, California, where they agreed to address climate change and fentanyl trafficking. \nThe meeting was widely viewed as an effort to cool tensions between Beijing and Washington after an American warplane shot down an alleged Chinese spy balloon off the US coast last year.\nThe two leaders' discussion, which the White House said again touched on climate change and drug trafficking, comes ahead of several events that could prove crucial to US-China relationship.\nNext month, Taiwan will inaugurate its president-elect, William Lai Ching-te, whom Beijing has called a \"troublemaker\" and \"separatist.\"\nThe event probably loomed over the Biden-Xi call, said Ms Sun.\n\"The inauguration of the Taiwan president is coming up, so there is a need for China to emphasise that the US must tread carefully,\" she said.\nThere are several key diplomatic meetings for the US and China on the horizon. \nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will soon visit China - after an American business delegation met Mr Xi last week - and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to make a trip in the coming weeks.",
    "Roman Kemp has said hosting the Capital breakfast show over the past four years was like reliving the \"horrible day\" of the death of his friend and producer \"over and over again\".\nKemp was in the middle of an edition of his radio show in August 2020 when he found out Joe Lyons had killed himself.\n\"I went through such a horrible moment in that room, in that studio,\" he said.\n\"Four years on and I've been living that same day over and over again, without the awful event.\"\nKemp presented his final show on the station on Thursday.\n\"For me, I'm quite ready to go, 'OK, close that door now, don't keep going back living that horrible day over again',\" he told the Mirror.\n\"That's sad that obviously affects me, but it does. Every day I walk in there and I see Joe. That's a weird thing to do.\n\"I think it's going to be really good for me to move on with my life. I had an opportunity in my life, I can go and enjoy my life for a bit and I want to enjoy what I have achieved.\"\nKemp joined Capital in 2014 and moved to the weekday breakfast slot in 2017. Alongside Sian Welby and Chris Stark, he attracted almost 2.5 million listeners a week, according to the latest figures.\nSpeaking to the paper, he said he had been trying \"to spin the plates\" of hosting a daily show but it was \"getting in the way of my life\".\n\"You can't enjoy your own life,\" he said. \"If you think of a radio show, every day you've got to go out in front of the public and dance and every now and then you've got to give yourself a rest and I've not been doing that for myself. It came to that point of 'I need to leave this behind now.'\"\nA big part of the decision to leave was so he could \"close this chapter\" following Lyons' suicide, he said, adding: \"Imagine a tragedy happened in your house, you're going to want to move.\"\nAt the time of Lyons' death, Kemp described him as \"my best friend\".\nThe following year, the presenter made an acclaimed BBC documentary about men's mental health, titled Our Silent Emergency.\nHe joined BBC One's The One Show last August, co-hosted this year's Brit Awards, and appears on Celebrity Gogglebox with his parents, 1980s pop stars Martin and Shirlie Kemp.\nRoman will also take part in celebrity football match Soccer Aid in June.",
    "A Venezuelan YouTuber who uploads travel videos has been released after being held for 32 hours following his arrest at Caracas airport on Sunday.\nVenezuela's Attorney-General Tarek Saab said US-based YouTuber Oscar Alejandro P\u00e9rez had been arrested over a video he uploaded last year.\nMr Saab alleges that in the video, the influencer urges blowing up a financial building in Caracas.\nAfter his release, Mr P\u00e9rez said he would never disturb the public order.\nThe YouTuber, who has close to two million followers, said the sentence Mr Saab had referred to had been taken out of context.\nIn the video, he points to a high-rise building housing and says: \"That lit-up building behind us is Credicard Tower. \n\"Curious detail: all the servers for Venezuelan credit and debit cards are in there. If a bomb were to be thrown at that building, the whole national banking system would collapse.\"\nIn a message uploaded after he was freed, Mr P\u00e9rez said he was sorry if the clip had been misconstrued.\nHe insisted he loved his home country and said that any attacks on a financial institution would harm his family as well as him, something he would never entertain. \nMr P\u00e9rez was arrested as he was about to board a flight to Canaima, a national park in the south of Venezuela which is home to Angel Falls.\nHe was freed on Monday on condition he make himself available to prosecutors and the courts if they summon him, Attorney-General Saab said. \nThe YouTuber's arrest was the latest in a wave of arrests of individuals which have included human rights advocates and political activists. Most of them have been charged with \"terrorism\" or inciting hate. Mr Saab did not clarify exactly what Mr P\u00e9rez was arrested on suspicion of.\nIn most cases, those arrested have been active members of the opposition coalition or outspoken critics of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government.\nIt is more unusual for Venezuela's attorney-general, who is a close ally of President Maduro, to accuse a YouTuber of trying to destabilise the country.\nHowever, tension has been on the rise in the run-up to July's presidential election, in which Mr Maduro is running for a third consecutive term.\nThe previous election in 2016 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair, and the opposition leader, Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, has accused the president of trying to handpick who will stand against him in this election.\nMs Machado has been barred from running for political office and her replacement has been blocked from registering as a candidate.

    "The judge overseeing Donald Trump's criminal hush money case has expanded a gag order on the former president after his online attacks against his daughter.\nJustice Juan Merchan has banned Mr Trump from criticising his family members or those of Manhattan prosecutor Alvin Bragg.\nThe Trump campaign has called the gag order unconstitutional.\nIn the case, Mr Trump denies concealing hush money payments to an adult film actress ahead of the 2016 election. \nThe original order last week barred Mr Trump from attacking court staff, potential jurors and witnesses.\nBut Mr Bragg, the district attorney, argued on Monday that the restriction should be widened following Mr Trump's singling out of the judge's daughter.\nIn a post on Truth Social after the gag order was expanded, Mr Trump said the judge should be removed from the case.\n\"They can talk about me, but I can't talk about them??? That sounds fair, doesn't it?\" he said.\nThe expanded order comes after earlier posts by Mr Trump, on 28 March, saying Justice Merchan's daughter was a \"Rabid Trump Hater\" who \"admitted to having conversations with her father about me\".\nHe has also claimed that Loren Merchan \"makes money by working to 'Get Trump'\", and accused her of sharing social media posts that showed him behind bars.\nA New York state court system spokesperson told the Associated Press that Mr Trump's claim was false and that a social media account that made the posts no longer belonged to Ms Merchan.\nMs Merchan runs a digital marketing agency that works with Democratic candidates among other clients.\nMr Trump's lawyers strongly opposed the gag order expansion on Monday, saying it would violate his free speech rights.\nIn his ruling, Justice Merchan wrote that \"it is no longer just a mere possibility or a reasonable likelihood that there exists a threat to the integrity of the judicial proceedings. The threat is very real.\"\nHe acknowledged that Mr Trump had the \"constitutional right to speak to the American voters freely, and to defend himself publicly\".\nJustice Merchan said, however, such attacks \"serve no legitimate purpose\".\n\"It merely injects fear in those assigned or called to participate in the proceedings, that not only they, but their family members as well are 'fair game' for Defendant's vitriol,\" the judge wrote.\nMr Trump denies 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the case. The trial is due to begin on 15 April in Manhattan.\nTrump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung slammed the judge's order.\n\"The voters of America have a fundamental right to hear the uncensored voice of the leading candidate for the highest office in the land,\" he said in a statement.\nThe former president has made attacks on judges, prosecutors and court staff involved in his cases.\nJustice Merchan is not the first judge to issue a gag order preventing the ex-president from attacking court staff.\nIn a civil fraud trial last year that resulted in a $464m fine against Mr Trump, the judge issued a gag order on the former president after he repeatedly attacked the court clerk.\nMr Trump violated the order, leading to two separate fines and an impromptu grilling on the witness stand.\nThe former president posted a $175m bond in that case on Monday night, leaving enforcement of the penalty in limbo while he appeals against the judgement.\nHe is also under a gag order in a separate federal criminal case centred on his effort to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election. \nA federal appeals court upheld most of that gag order in December, writing that his remarks \"pose a significant and imminent threat\" to the judicial process.",
    "When Kyrah Gray first got into comedy, she says she struggled to find an audience.\n\"I started doing shows and then everyone was on lockdown,\" she tells BBC Newsbeat, about timing her career with the coronavirus pandemic.\nBut since then, the comedian has been honing her craft and on Monday night was one of eight acts on stage for the first ever 1Xtra Comedy Gala, celebrating voices underrepresented in the industry.\nThe event hosted established talents like Thanyia Moore, Kane Brown, Babatunde Al\u00e9sh\u00e9, and Slim while also introducing fresh talents like Gbemi Oladipo (Bemi), Ola Labib and Michael Odewale as well as Kyrah.\nRepresentation and highlighting black talent is an issue close to Kyrah's heart.\n\"The industry has kind of made black women feel like there isn't a place for them in the comedy circuit,\" she says. \n\"And if there is a space, it's like one-in-one-out.\"\nKyrah says she likes to use her sets to joke about her family and relationships - subjects she feels are relatable for everyone.\n\"Just because I make a specific joke and I look a certain kind of way, doesn't mean that everyone can't enjoy my comedy,\" she says.\n\"It's really important that people focus on the jokes and the writing and not on the person that's delivering those jokes.\"\nOne person who knows that only too well is fellow comedian Ola Labib, who was also on the line-up for the event at the Hackney Empire.\n\"A lot of people say, 'you comedians only get to where you are because all you do is talk about race',\" Ola says.\nBut actually, it's jokes about Lord of the Rings which have become her calling card.\nShe's a practicing Muslim with Sudanese heritage and says before she started out in stand-up, she'd never been to a pub.\n\"The first time I ever went into a pub was when I did an open mic,\" says Ola.\nShe didn't know it then, but the event's promoter was as much of a Lord of the Rings fan as she was. \n\"I made an off comment, saying, 'I bet you've never seen a hijabi in a pub before. \n\"I think the last time anyone saw hooded figures going into a pub was Frodo at the Prancing Pony'.\"\nEven though she caveats the joke saying \"only nerds and losers will get it\", it got lots of laughs and has been included in her sets since and will also feature in her tour this summer.\nBut Ola thinks even though it's funny, what's funnier is audiences not expecting it to be a joke someone who looks like her would tell.\nOla says she was the only African Muslim in her school and now she's in her 30s, she still doesn't see many people like her on the circuit.\nSometimes, she says, that adds a pressure to speak out about issues affecting her community.\nComedian and presenter Eddie Kadi, who hosted the event, says talking about race is something young comedians \"can't avoid\".\n\"I think what comedy needs to do is actually say that we should embrace our differences,\" he adds.\n\"Our differences are what make us all special.\n\"But you will be shocked the moment you open your mouth, how much similarity there is in the stories, and we should be able to tackle it head-on.\"\nEddie says the gala has been an important platform for the black comedy scene because \"other platforms are really hard to get on to\".\nBut more than a platform, he says events like the gala can act as a \"trampoline\" for underrepresented talent.\n\"There are just so many amazing, talented, young black women that are fighting to get their spot and fighting to be seen,\" adds Kyrah. \n\"There's always space for us and it's important that we keep highlighting that.\"\n1Xtra Comedy Gala with Eddie Kadi and Friends is now available to watch on BBC iPlayer or listen on BBC Sounds.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",
    "Squeezed between a hospital and a busy dual carriageway heading to France's Mediterranean coast is a discreet, sprawling walled compound that serves as a remarkable haven.\nThis is an orphanage that has a unique role - and one of a network of three, called Orpheopolis. \nAll the orphans have lost a mother or father who were serving police officers. Some have lost both. \nAround 70 children are housed in each one of the three orphanages. But in total, Orpheopolis provides care for some 1,000 orphaned children. Many are living with a surviving parent or relatives, but still need constant psychological care or financial support.\nTheir parents have died from numerous different causes: illness, gun and bomb attacks, accidents related to their work, and often from taking their own lives following depression or post-traumatic stress. Between 50 and 70 officers die by suicide each year in France.  \nSome 20 children aged 10-18 live in one of the orphanages on the outskirts of the town of Agde.\n\"Despite their tragic personal situations, it's vital that they are integrated into wider society, and that's why they go to local schools and have lunch in the canteens like everyone else,\" director Christophe Bart told the BBC.\n\"They can even invite friends back to the centre. It's crucial to break their social isolation.\"\nOne boy called Alexandre was celebrating his birthday while the BBC was there and nine of his friends from school had been invited over. Boyfriends and girlfriends are allowed to visit, although none are allowed to stay overnight.\nWhat is remarkable about the orphanage is the safety net it provides.\nThe equivalent of 28 full-time staff look after 20 children, including round-the-clock social workers, psychologists, housekeepers, sport coaches and after-school support teachers.\nThey live in four separate housing blocks where they cook, eat and socialise together. Upstairs they have individual bedrooms. \nThere are common play areas, a garden, and a well equipped outdoor sports facility. There are strict house rules on bedtime and mobile phone use that wouldn't be out of place at a British boarding school.\n\"For sure what unites these children is mourning, and an overwhelming feeling of sadness. So we work on that - it's about dialogue,\" says 30-year-old social worker Louis Rodriguez.\n\"A strength for these kids who are missing one or both parents is that they can speak amongst themselves, as they are all in similar situations and facing common experiences.\"\nFor three days the BBC was able to speak to the children, first in Agde and then at another centre in Bourges in central France.  \nSeventeen-year-old Elena has been at the orphanage for four years. Her father was one of the first police officers to arrive on the scene of the attack on Paris's Bataclan concert hall in November 2015. \nSome 130 people were killed in simultaneous gun and bomb attacks across the city that night, including 90 at the concert venue. \nElena says she does not know if her father took his own life later because of the harrowing experience he witnessed that night, but the orphanage has allowed her to heal too. \n\"After my father's death it was very difficult for my mother and myself. I couldn't stay at home and coming here provided me with some stability,\" she says.\n\"I would be a lot angrier today if I didn't have all this support structure around me. Now I can move on, I will soon leave to start a career as a social worker.\"\nRage is a word that surfaces a lot to describe the children when they first arrive. \nAmbre, 12, is sports crazy and training with the local football team whenever she can. When her father died of cancer she had no other relatives to turn to and she has been here four years now. \n\"I was very angry when I arrived,\" she remembers. \"It was very difficult for me. But I am a lot calmer now and I consider here as my second home.\" \nSome of the orphans are siblings and go home to a parent or relatives at weekends, but not all of them have that family support to depend on. Some of the kids I spoke to were clearly emotionally scarred by their experiences.\nPsychologist Laure Lamic has spent the past eight years working with the children in Agde, and says she is able to offer the children the chance to speak \"in a confidential, trusting and free manner [where] there is no censorship\".\n\"This is important because they have suffered a loss and while it's difficult for everyone to talk about death it's even more so for children. \n\"But we help create a healing process and you can see it in their school reports and with an improvement in their emotional state.\"\nOrpheopolis has an annual budget of \u20ac15m ($16.3m; \u00a312.9m) which includes running the three orphanages. Most of that comes from donations, and 38,000 police officers contribute to a fund each year. \nThe organisation has been going for more than 100 years. \nThe first orphanage was created after two officers were killed, leaving children behind with no family to support them.

    "A primary school deputy head teacher, jailed for child sexual abuse offences including two counts of rape, has been barred from teaching.\nJulie Morris, 46, the safeguarding lead at a school in Wigan, and her partner David Morris, of St Helens, filmed themselves raping a girl under 13.\nIn 2021, the teacher, of Hindley, was jailed for 13 years and four months.\nA professional conduct panel has now banned her from the profession for life due to the gravity of her offences. \nMorris worked at St George's Central Church of England Primary School in Wigan but the offences, which spanned three years, were not related to her employment.\nDavid Morris admitted 34 offences and was jailed for 16 years, also in 2021.\nThe Teaching Regulation Agency's panel found Julie Morris's actions raised \"obvious and significant public and child protection concerns\" and were \"fundamentally incompatible with her being a teacher\".\nThe panel's report said: \"The fact Ms Morris was also the safeguarding lead at her school makes her offending all the more shocking in that, whilst the designated point of contact for welfare and safety concerns at the school, she herself was engaged in abusing a child, albeit not one at the school.\"\nIt also found that \"there is a real risk of Ms Morris repeating her offending behaviour\" and noted her actions were \"deliberate and sustained, and there was no evidence that she was acting under duress\".\nDavid Oatley, who made the decision to prohibit her from teaching, added in his report: \"In view of the seriousness of the allegations found proved against her, I have decided that Ms Morris shall not be entitled to apply for restoration of her eligibility to teach.\"\nMorris, who pleaded guilty to the offences, has a right of appeal to the King's Bench Division of the High Court within 28 days.\nLiverpool Crown Court heard the videos showed her giggling as the abuse took place.\nHonorary Recorder of Liverpool, Judge Andrew Menary, said, on sentencing, the case demonstrated \"that human depravity really knows no depths\".\nProsecutor John Wyn Williams said the couple met on dating app Plenty of Fish in 2016 after both had separated from their partners and the relationship \"quickly became intensely sexual\".\n\"The communication between them became graphic and depraved which led to some of their sexual fantasies becoming a reality,\" he said.\nMr Wyn Williams said the couple's \"sordid secret\" was revealed when police found a conversation about sexual abuse of children involving David Morris in a phone seized during a search warrant.\nHe was arrested but cautioned and released and a number of devices were seized, which showed the recordings of rape and sexual abuse.\nWhy not follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X and Instagram?

    "An assembly member who believes her stillborn siblings were buried in unmarked graves in Milltown Cemetery in Belfast has called for a halt to construction at the cemetery.\nNuala McAllister is concerned the work could disturb mass baby graves.\nThe work is being carried out on land which was reclaimed by the cemetery from Ulster Wildlife in 2009.\nThe trustees of the cemetery said the works \"will not be located in proximity to known burial sites\".\nAn area on the eastern side of the cemetery known as the bog meadows was, for many years, used as a mass burial site for stillborn babies, people who took their own lives and those who could not afford an individual burial plot.\nThis land was sold to Ulster Wildlife in 2000 but was returned to the cemetery nine years later following campaigning by family members of those buried in unmarked graves within the area.\nThe Alliance Party MLA for Belfast North, Nuala McAllister, said her family believes that three of her siblings could be buried on this land.\nMs McAllister said after her mum lost a baby boy during birth and twins during pregnancy, the bodies of these babies were taken from her to be buried.\n\"[She] has been told that they are at Milltown but we cannot get concrete records of where exactly they are,\" she told BBC News NI. \nThe cemetery has now undertaken a project of works including the construction of new drainage and pathways on the land reclaimed from Ulster Wildlife in 2009.\nThe trustees of the cemetery have said that following the completion of an archaeological survey they have \"complete confidence\" that this work \"will not be located in proximity to known burial sites\".\n\"Unless there is full transparency with everything that is going on, I have no confidence,\" said Ms McAllister. \n\"When it comes to how we deal with the past, the way in which the Catholic Church, in particular, dealt with women in childbirth, with stillborn babies, I am yet to be convinced that everything that is going on here has had the correct analysis and the correct parameters on which analysis should actually take place.\n\"I am not going to let this rest, this affects me personally, it affects my mum and it affects so many mothers across Northern Ireland,\" she added.\nMs McAllister said she had raised the issue with the Department for Communities and the first and deputy first minister's office. \n\"I am calling on the Catholic Church, in particular the trustees of Milltown cemetery, to put a halt to any work that's taking place there so that we can actually have access, where there is public transparency, where everything can be held to account,\" she said.\n\"I'm calling on the Department for Communities minister to halt any work and use the powers that they have to ensure that those babies and those people who are buried in these burial grounds... that they can actually rest in peace.\"\nMs McAllister is among several relatives of people buried in the area who have raised concerns.\nSiubh\u00e1in\u00edn N\u00ed Chutnneagan's great-grandfather, aunt, and cousin are among those buried in the area.\nShe said they were buried there because her family could not afford individual plots.\nShe has accused the Catholic Church of failing to protect her family members' remains.\n\"As a Catholic we entrust our Catholic dead to these people and they're supposed to protect them, and what they're doing is not protecting them,\" she told BBC News NI. \nAlso among those to raise concerns is Toni Maguire, an archaeologist who previously worked on the site.\n\"The records in the cemetery have approximately 11,000 souls that were buried in mass graves across this land,\" Ms Maguire said. \nBut she says these records do not account for those \"being buried in a furtive manner\". \n\"The babies would have been brought in at night under cover of darkness and would have been buried by a family member in just an individual shallow grave,\" she said.\n\"They are driving 14 tonne diggers across this land which contains a lot of these burials.\"\nIn a statement released on 11 March, the Trustees of Milltown Cemetery said the upgrading of drainage and pathways was essential, but work had been undertaken to establish if the area had previously been used for burials.\n\"In November 2023, the trustees therefore secured the professional services of Northern Archaeological Consultancy Ltd. to investigate this section of the cemetery,\" the statement continued.\n\"Having provided the trustees with a clear and defined boundary of the location of all burial sites, including baby burials, within this section of the cemetery, this extensive archaeological survey assists the cemetery trustees to determine where drains and pathways can now be placed, with the complete confidence that they will not be located in proximity to known burial sites.\"\nThe Diocese of Down and Connor declined a request for comment.\nDr Alastair Ruffell, a geologist and geophysicist at Queen's University in Belfast, who specialises in the search for buried and sunk items, said there are \"comp",

Ta-ra then.\"\nThe unexpected news of his death came from the broadcaster's family, just two days later.\nThe Metropolitan Police later confirmed the presenter had been found dead at home, adding that the death was not being treated as suspicious.\nTributes poured in for the star, with fellow DJs recalling him as a radio \"genius\" whose \"heart soared when he was on air\".\nMike Read, who co-hosted a local radio show with Wright before they moved to Radio 1, said his former colleague was a \"ringmaster\" and \"good at pulling people in\".\n\"He worked tirelessly, he was a radio man, not just somebody who turned up, did the show and went home. It was in his mind, always thinking of ideas\".\nLiza Tarbuck presented a special edition of Love Songs dedicated to the broadcaster the following Sunday, choking back tears as she read messages from his dedicated audience.\nOne listener recalled how she would dance with her husband, also called Steve, while listening to Wright's show.  \n\"When me and Steve were dancing last Sunday in the kitchen to Love Songs, we would never of imagined that would be our last dance with the amazing Steve Wright. He was part of our family,\" she wrote.\nBall said he wanted to continue that relationship with the listeners, saying the show would still feature \"beautiful, moving, relaxing and uplifting music to lift the soul on a Sunday morning, coupled with the stories, suggestions, requests and precious memories from you, the listener\".\nThe programme will be renamed Love Songs with Michael Ball - but the singer said he wanted to \"ensure that this won't be just MY show, but OUR show\".\n\"I hope you will join us as we continue to share the love.\" he continued.\nThe Phantom Of The Opera star has been a presence on Radio 2 since 2005, and will hand his current Sunday lunchtime slot to comedian and actor Paddy McGuinness.\nA new presenter for Wright's other show, Pick Of The Pops, will be announced in due course.\nNicki Chapman has been standing in to present Sunday Love Songs for the last few weeks.\nMeanwhile, broadcaster Mark Radcliffe has announced an extended leave of absence from his shows on Radio 2 and 6 Music.\nThe presenter reassured fans that this was not connected to the cancer of the tongue and lymph nodes that affected him in 2018.\n\"Having been on the radio since the late industrial revolution I've decided to have a bit of time off,\" he said. \n\"I'm getting on a bit now, and there are some things I want to do whilst I'm still (relatively) fit and active. So I'll be taking April and May off, if that's alright with you lot.\n\"I am clear of cancer and feeling great, so please don't read anything sinister into it. I'm just going to do some stuff I want to do, and I'll be back in early June.

It was needing some repairs and attention, so I decided to offer it for free on social media.\"\nMs Cope was contacted by Gary Christy, chairman of the Fenland Association for Community Transport (FACT), based in March, who came up with an idea for a new use for the carriage.\nMr Christy contacted the Make and Mend Shed, a community project based at the FACT site, and its members have taken on the challenge of dismantling and moving the carriage, which they hope to complete by May. \nMr Christy is also vice-chairman of the Friends of March Railway Station, formed in 2009 to preserve platforms and buildings on the disused side of the station, and the group intends to use the restored carriage in that location as a tea room.\n\"It is so rare to see one of these things being offered,\" said Dave Everett, who runs the Make and Mend Shed.\n\"I came over to see it, and was blown away with what I saw. It was originally a six-compartment, third-class with smoking area carriage, used on the Great Eastern Railway, which means it could well have travelled through March many times.\n\"When I find the carriage number I will be able to delve more into its past and find out where it was based and how it ended up here in a back garden in Needingworth.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The London section of the River Thames is facing the brunt of sewage dumping, a clean water campaign group has claimed.\nIt comes after some members of the University of Oxford rowing team criticised sewage levels in the water and said some team members were sick before the annual Boat Race against the University of Cambridge.\nThe Henley Mermaids, a five-person campaign group who regularly swim in the waterway, have called for Thames Water to taken into public ownership.\nThe company said taking action to improve the health of rivers was a \"key focus\" with plans including the upgrade of more than 250 storm sewer discharge sites.\nLaura Reineke, one of the Henley Mermaids, told BBC London: \"We are still swimming in it but we are not putting our heads in and we're being very careful indeed.\n\"There's condoms, sanitary products, paper, there's even a toilet cassette from a boat.

    "The shadow transport secretary has called the government \"totally negligent\" over 1,300 train manufacturing jobs at risk in Derby. \nLouise Haigh visited train builder Alstom on Tuesday after it announced it was resuming a redundancy process at its Litchchurch Lane factory.\nThe firm says it has \"no meaningful workload\" until 2026. \nTransport Secretary Mark Harper said the government's \"top priority\" was ensuring workforces were supported. \nMs Haigh said the government knew of the challenges the firm were facing, and it was \"totally negligent that [it] had allowed Alstom to get into this position\". \nMr Harper posted an open letter on X on Friday saying the government had been working with Alstom \"over many months\" and encouraged the firm to keep investing in its Derby site and seek export orders. \nBut some staff fear the site, which has been in Derby for 147 years, is past the point of being saved. \nDarren Spencer, a production manager at the site, said the situation was \"devastating\" for staff and cuts would impact surrounding businesses, such as a local cob shop and newsagents. \n\"We've got nothing, we've got no work, we haven't got anything.

    "Tennessee lawmakers have passed a bill banning the release of airborne chemicals that critics say is inspired by \"chemtrails\" conspiracy theories. \nThe bill forbids \"intentional injection, release, or dispersion\" of chemicals into the air.\nIt doesn't explicitly mention chemtrails, which conspiracy theorists believe are poisons spread by planes.\nInstead it broadly prohibits \"affecting temperature, weather, or the intensity of the sunlight\".\nThe Republican-sponsored bill passed along party lines on Monday. If it is signed by Tennessee's governor, Republican Bill Lee, it will go into effect on 1 July.\nThe bill's backers were spurred on by a government report released last year on solar geoengineering, which is the idea of cooling the planet by reflecting sunlight back into space. The White House, though, has said that there are no plans \"to establish a comprehensive research programme focused on solar radiation modification.\"\nSeveral witnesses who testified before the Tennessee legislature cited debunked conspiracy theories or speculated about secret government geoengineering programmes, according to Scott Banbury, conservation director of the state's branch of the Sierra Club, an environmental organisation.\nTheir claims were troubling, he said. \n\"As a serious environmental organisation, if what was in the bill was actually going on we would be calling for a stop to it,\" he said. \"It's not happening.\"\nThe legislation focuses on geoengineering,  a very broad category which includes mostly theoretical large-scale action to mitigate climate change.\nGeoengineering is controversial even among legitimate climate scientists, because of uncertainty around its usefulness and the possibility of unintended outcomes. \nPlanet-wide climate engineering is distinct from more routine weather modification, such as cloud seeding, which increases rainfall over specific areas and is used in several US states. \n\"Chemtrails\", meanwhile, is a separate, pseudoscientific idea that governments or corporations are spraying chemicals from planes to kill, control or poison people. \nConspiracy theorists point to white plumes of water vapour trailing behind passenger aeroplanes, commonly called contrails, as proof of sinister and secret plots, but lack evidence for their claims.\nThe most common claim of proof is \"simply that aircraft contrails look 'different', without any comparative analysis,\" according to a report from a Harvard geoengineering group.\n\"This as convincing as saying that alien beings walk among us in disguise as people because some people act very strangely,\" it said.\nIn recent decades speculation about chemtrails has risen as the number of airline flights - and thus the number of contrails - has surged. \nIn the debate over the Tennessee bill, lawmakers and witnesses cited a range of both reliable and debunked facts about geoengineering and weather modification, and at least one witness said she believed the White House was engaged in climate experiments but could not provide definitive proof.\nThe legislation's sponsor, Monty Fritts, called it \"a very common-sense thing to do\". \nAlthough several lawmakers mentioned chemtrails while the bill was being discussed, during Monday's session Mr Fritts focused on cloud seeding. \n\"Everything that goes up must come down, and those chemicals that we knowingly and willingly inject into the atmosphere simply to control the weather or the climate are affecting our health,\" he said.\nIn a joking response, John Ray Clemmons, a Democrat from Nashville, introduced an amendment that would protect fictional beasts.\n\"This amendment would make sure that we are protecting yetis, or Sasquatch or Bigfoot, from whatever this conspiracy is that we're passing in this legislation,\" he said during debate.\n\"This legislation is not to be taken seriously,\" he said.\nMr Clemmons told the BBC that several of his fellow lawmakers believe in QAnon theories and conspiracies about vaccines being hidden in food.\n\"This is unfortunately nothing new,\" he said. \"There's a lot of things we could be doing to reduce living costs for our working families, but we are wasting time with this.\"\nA spokesperson for Mr Fritts said: \"Nothing that helps ensure that our air, water, and soil are cleaner could be a waste of time.\"  \n\"We cannot change what people believe,\" the spokesperson said about the persistent conspiracy theory allegations. \"We can only present the information and let them make up their own minds.\"  \nThe BBC contacted Governor Lee's office for comment.\nAlthough the Tennessee bill appears to be the first of its kind to pass a state legislature, lawmakers in several other states including Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Kentucky, Minnesota and New Hampshire have introduced similar legislation. \nMr Banbury, the Sierra Club official, noted that witnesses supporting the bill travelled from outside Tennessee, and several have testified in favour of similar laws in other states.\n\"As a grassroots organiser I'm impressed that a",
    "When Kyrah Gray first got into comedy, she says she struggled to find an audience.\n\"I started doing shows and then everyone was on lockdown,\" she tells BBC Newsbeat, about timing her career with the coronavirus pandemic.\nBut since then, the comedian has been honing her craft and on Monday night was one of eight acts on stage for the first ever 1Xtra Comedy Gala, celebrating voices underrepresented in the industry.\nThe event hosted established talents like Thanyia Moore, Kane Brown, Babatunde Al\u00e9sh\u00e9, and Slim while also introducing fresh talents like Gbemi Oladipo (Bemi), Ola Labib and Michael Odewale as well as Kyrah.\nRepresentation and highlighting black talent is an issue close to Kyrah's heart.\n\"The industry has kind of made black women feel like there isn't a place for them in the comedy circuit,\" she says. \n\"And if there is a space, it's like one-in-one-out.\"\nKyrah says she likes to use her sets to joke about her family and relationships - subjects she feels are relatable for everyone.\n\"Just because I make a specific joke and I look a certain kind of way, doesn't mean that everyone can't enjoy my comedy,\" she says.\n\"It's really important that people focus on the jokes and the writing and not on the person that's delivering those jokes.\"\nOne person who knows that only too well is fellow comedian Ola Labib, who was also on the line-up for the event at the Hackney Empire.\n\"A lot of people say, 'you comedians only get to where you are because all you do is talk about race',\" Ola says.\nBut actually, it's jokes about Lord of the Rings which have become her calling card.\nShe's a practicing Muslim with Sudanese heritage and says before she started out in stand-up, she'd never been to a pub.\n\"The first time I ever went into a pub was when I did an open mic,\" says Ola.\nShe didn't know it then, but the event's promoter was as much of a Lord of the Rings fan as she was. \n\"I made an off comment, saying, 'I bet you've never seen a hijabi in a pub before. \n\"I think the last time anyone saw hooded figures going into a pub was Frodo at the Prancing Pony'.\"\nEven though she caveats the joke saying \"only nerds and losers will get it\", it got lots of laughs and has been included in her sets since and will also feature in her tour this summer.\nBut Ola thinks even though it's funny, what's funnier is audiences not expecting it to be a joke someone who looks like her would tell.\nOla says she was the only African Muslim in her school and now she's in her 30s, she still doesn't see many people like her on the circuit.\nSometimes, she says, that adds a pressure to speak out about issues affecting her community.\nComedian and presenter Eddie Kadi, who hosted the event, says talking about race is something young comedians \"can't avoid\".\n\"I think what comedy needs to do is actually say that we should embrace our differences,\" he adds.\n\"Our differences are what make us all special.\n\"But you will be shocked the moment you open your mouth, how much similarity there is in the stories, and we should be able to tackle it head-on.\"\nEddie says the gala has been an important platform for the black comedy scene because \"other platforms are really hard to get on to\".\nBut more than a platform, he says events like the gala can act as a \"trampoline\" for underrepresented talent.\n\"There are just so many amazing, talented, young black women that are fighting to get their spot and fighting to be seen,\" adds Kyrah. \n\"There's always space for us and it's important that we keep highlighting that.\"\n1Xtra Comedy Gala with Eddie Kadi and Friends is now available to watch on BBC iPlayer or listen on BBC Sounds.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",
    "Squeezed between a hospital and a busy dual carriageway heading to France's Mediterranean coast is a discreet, sprawling walled compound that serves as a remarkable haven.\nThis is an orphanage that has a unique role - and one of a network of three, called Orpheopolis. \nAll the orphans have lost a mother or father who were serving police officers. Some have lost both. \nAround 70 children are housed in each one of the three orphanages. But in total, Orpheopolis provides care for some 1,000 orphaned children. Many are living with a surviving parent or relatives, but still need constant psychological care or financial support.\nTheir parents have died from numerous different causes: illness, gun and bomb attacks, accidents related to their work, and often from taking their own lives following depression or post-traumatic stress. Between 50 and 70 officers die by suicide each year in France.  \nSome 20 children aged 10-18 live in one of the orphanages on the outskirts of the town of Agde.\n\"Despite their tragic personal situations, it's vital that they are integrated into wider society, and that's why they go to local schools and have lunch in the canteens like everyone else,\" director Christophe Bart told the BBC.\n\"They can even invite friends back to the centre. It's crucial to break their social isolation.\"\nOne boy called Alexandre was celebrating his birthday while the BBC was there and nine of his friends from school had been invited over. Boyfriends and girlfriends are allowed to visit, although none are allowed to stay overnight.\nWhat is remarkable about the orphanage is the safety net it provides.\nThe equivalent of 28 full-time staff look after 20 children, including round-the-clock social workers, psychologists, housekeepers, sport coaches and after-school support teachers.\nThey live in four separate housing blocks where they cook, eat and socialise together. Upstairs they have individual bedrooms. \nThere are common play areas, a garden, and a well equipped outdoor sports facility. There are strict house rules on bedtime and mobile phone use that wouldn't be out of place at a British boarding school.\n\"For sure what unites these children is mourning, and an overwhelming feeling of sadness. So we work on that - it's about dialogue,\" says 30-year-old social worker Louis Rodriguez.\n\"A strength for these kids who are missing one or both parents is that they can speak amongst themselves, as they are all in similar situations and facing common experiences.\"\nFor three days the BBC was able to speak to the children, first in Agde and then at another centre in Bourges in central France.  \nSeventeen-year-old Elena has been at the orphanage for four years. Her father was one of the first police officers to arrive on the scene of the attack on Paris's Bataclan concert hall in November 2015. \nSome 130 people were killed in simultaneous gun and bomb attacks across the city that night, including 90 at the concert venue. \nElena says she does not know if her father took his own life later because of the harrowing experience he witnessed that night, but the orphanage has allowed her to heal too. \n\"After my father's death it was very difficult for my mother and myself. I couldn't stay at home and coming here provided me with some stability,\" she says.\n\"I would be a lot angrier today if I didn't have all this support structure around me. Now I can move on, I will soon leave to start a career as a social worker.\"\nRage is a word that surfaces a lot to describe the children when they first arrive. \nAmbre, 12, is sports crazy and training with the local football team whenever she can. When her father died of cancer she had no other relatives to turn to and she has been here four years now. \n\"I was very angry when I arrived,\" she remembers. \"It was very difficult for me. But I am a lot calmer now and I consider here as my second home.\" \nSome of the orphans are siblings and go home to a parent or relatives at weekends, but not all of them have that family support to depend on. Some of the kids I spoke to were clearly emotionally scarred by their experiences.\nPsychologist Laure Lamic has spent the past eight years working with the children in Agde, and says she is able to offer the children the chance to speak \"in a confidential, trusting and free manner [where] there is no censorship\".\n\"This is important because they have suffered a loss and while it's difficult for everyone to talk about death it's even more so for children. \n\"But we help create a healing process and you can see it in their school reports and with an improvement in their emotional state.\"\nOrpheopolis has an annual budget of \u20ac15m ($16.3m; \u00a312.9m) which includes running the three orphanages. Most of that comes from donations, and 38,000 police officers contribute to a fund each year. \nThe organisation has been going for more than 100 years. \nThe first orphanage was created after two officers were killed, leaving children behind with no family to support them.

    "The judge overseeing Donald Trump's criminal hush money case has expanded a gag order on the former president after his online attacks against his daughter.\nJustice Juan Merchan has banned Mr Trump from criticising his family members or those of Manhattan prosecutor Alvin Bragg.\nThe Trump campaign has called the gag order unconstitutional.\nIn the case, Mr Trump denies concealing hush money payments to an adult film actress ahead of the 2016 election. \nThe original order last week barred Mr Trump from attacking court staff, potential jurors and witnesses.\nBut Mr Bragg, the district attorney, argued on Monday that the restriction should be widened following Mr Trump's singling out of the judge's daughter.\nIn a post on Truth Social after the gag order was expanded, Mr Trump said the judge should be removed from the case.\n\"They can talk about me, but I can't talk about them??? That sounds fair, doesn't it?\" he said.\nThe expanded order comes after earlier posts by Mr Trump, on 28 March, saying Justice Merchan's daughter was a \"Rabid Trump Hater\" who \"admitted to having conversations with her father about me\".\nHe has also claimed that Loren Merchan \"makes money by working to 'Get Trump'\", and accused her of sharing social media posts that showed him behind bars.\nA New York state court system spokesperson told the Associated Press that Mr Trump's claim was false and that a social media account that made the posts no longer belonged to Ms Merchan.\nMs Merchan runs a digital marketing agency that works with Democratic candidates among other clients.\nMr Trump's lawyers strongly opposed the gag order expansion on Monday, saying it would violate his free speech rights.\nIn his ruling, Justice Merchan wrote that \"it is no longer just a mere possibility or a reasonable likelihood that there exists a threat to the integrity of the judicial proceedings. The threat is very real.\"\nHe acknowledged that Mr Trump had the \"constitutional right to speak to the American voters freely, and to defend himself publicly\".\nJustice Merchan said, however, such attacks \"serve no legitimate purpose\".\n\"It merely injects fear in those assigned or called to participate in the proceedings, that not only they, but their family members as well are 'fair game' for Defendant's vitriol,\" the judge wrote.\nMr Trump denies 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the case. The trial is due to begin on 15 April in Manhattan.\nTrump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung slammed the judge's order.\n\"The voters of America have a fundamental right to hear the uncensored voice of the leading candidate for the highest office in the land,\" he said in a statement.\nThe former president has made attacks on judges, prosecutors and court staff involved in his cases.\nJustice Merchan is not the first judge to issue a gag order preventing the ex-president from attacking court staff.\nIn a civil fraud trial last year that resulted in a $464m fine against Mr Trump, the judge issued a gag order on the former president after he repeatedly attacked the court clerk.\nMr Trump violated the order, leading to two separate fines and an impromptu grilling on the witness stand.\nThe former president posted a $175m bond in that case on Monday night, leaving enforcement of the penalty in limbo while he appeals against the judgement.\nHe is also under a gag order in a separate federal criminal case centred on his effort to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election. \nA federal appeals court upheld most of that gag order in December, writing that his remarks \"pose a significant and imminent threat\" to the judicial process.",
    "Roman Kemp has said hosting the Capital breakfast show over the past four years was like reliving the \"horrible day\" of the death of his friend and producer \"over and over again\".\nKemp was in the middle of an edition of his radio show in August 2020 when he found out Joe Lyons had killed himself.\n\"I went through such a horrible moment in that room, in that studio,\" he said.\n\"Four years on and I've been living that same day over and over again, without the awful event.\"\nKemp presented his final show on the station on Thursday.\n\"For me, I'm quite ready to go, 'OK, close that door now, don't keep going back living that horrible day over again',\" he told the Mirror.\n\"That's sad that obviously affects me, but it does. Every day I walk in there and I see Joe. That's a weird thing to do.\n\"I think it's going to be really good for me to move on with my life. I had an opportunity in my life, I can go and enjoy my life for a bit and I want to enjoy what I have achieved.\"\nKemp joined Capital in 2014 and moved to the weekday breakfast slot in 2017. Alongside Sian Welby and Chris Stark, he attracted almost 2.5 million listeners a week, according to the latest figures.\nSpeaking to the paper, he said he had been trying \"to spin the plates\" of hosting a daily show but it was \"getting in the way of my life\".\n\"You can't enjoy your own life,\" he said. \"If you think of a radio show, every day you've got to go out in front of the public and dance and every now and then you've got to give yourself a rest and I've not been doing that for myself. It came to that point of 'I need to leave this behind now.'\"\nA big part of the decision to leave was so he could \"close this chapter\" following Lyons' suicide, he said, adding: \"Imagine a tragedy happened in your house, you're going to want to move.\"\nAt the time of Lyons' death, Kemp described him as \"my best friend\".\nThe following year, the presenter made an acclaimed BBC documentary about men's mental health, titled Our Silent Emergency.\nHe joined BBC One's The One Show last August, co-hosted this year's Brit Awards, and appears on Celebrity Gogglebox with his parents, 1980s pop stars Martin and Shirlie Kemp.\nRoman will also take part in celebrity football match Soccer Aid in June.",
    "A Venezuelan YouTuber who uploads travel videos has been released after being held for 32 hours following his arrest at Caracas airport on Sunday.\nVenezuela's Attorney-General Tarek Saab said US-based YouTuber Oscar Alejandro P\u00e9rez had been arrested over a video he uploaded last year.\nMr Saab alleges that in the video, the influencer urges blowing up a financial building in Caracas.\nAfter his release, Mr P\u00e9rez said he would never disturb the public order.\nThe YouTuber, who has close to two million followers, said the sentence Mr Saab had referred to had been taken out of context.\nIn the video, he points to a high-rise building housing and says: \"That lit-up building behind us is Credicard Tower. \n\"Curious detail: all the servers for Venezuelan credit and debit cards are in there. If a bomb were to be thrown at that building, the whole national banking system would collapse.\"\nIn a message uploaded after he was freed, Mr P\u00e9rez said he was sorry if the clip had been misconstrued.\nHe insisted he loved his home country and said that any attacks on a financial institution would harm his family as well as him, something he would never entertain. \nMr P\u00e9rez was arrested as he was about to board a flight to Canaima, a national park in the south of Venezuela which is home to Angel Falls.\nHe was freed on Monday on condition he make himself available to prosecutors and the courts if they summon him, Attorney-General Saab said. \nThe YouTuber's arrest was the latest in a wave of arrests of individuals which have included human rights advocates and political activists. Most of them have been charged with \"terrorism\" or inciting hate. Mr Saab did not clarify exactly what Mr P\u00e9rez was arrested on suspicion of.\nIn most cases, those arrested have been active members of the opposition coalition or outspoken critics of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government.\nIt is more unusual for Venezuela's attorney-general, who is a close ally of President Maduro, to accuse a YouTuber of trying to destabilise the country.\nHowever, tension has been on the rise in the run-up to July's presidential election, in which Mr Maduro is running for a third consecutive term.\nThe previous election in 2016 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair, and the opposition leader, Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, has accused the president of trying to handpick who will stand against him in this election.\nMs Machado has been barred from running for political office and her replacement has been blocked from registering as a candidate.

    "Ukraine is exporting over five million tonnes of grain a month - much more than in the summer of 2023, when Russia pulled out of the Black Sea grain deal. \nRussia stopped giving safe passage to cargo ships going to and from Ukraine in July of that year, and as a result, the country's grain exports slumped. \nUkraine exported 5.2 million tonnes of grain and maize in March, 5.8 million tonnes in February and 5.3 million tonnes in January. \nBefore Russia's invasion in 2022, the country was sending about 6.5 million tonnes abroad every month. \nAfter Russia pulled of the Black Sea Grain Initiative (or \"grain deal\"), it said it would view any vessel bound for Ukraine as a potential military target. \nFew cargo ships dared to go to Ukrainian ports, and monthly grain exports fell to just over 2 million tonnes in July, August and September 2023.\nHowever, Ukraine has since established new export routes. \nBetween the end of the grain deal in July 2023 and the end of February 2024, it shipped about 20 million tonnes of grain to 42 countries, according to the country's vice prime minister Oleksandr Kubrakov.\nThis is despite 30 Russian attacks on Ukrainian grain ports and storage facilities since the deal ended.\nBefore Russia's invasion in February 2022, Ukraine was the world's seventh largest exporter of wheat, fourth largest exporter of barley, and the biggest exporter of sunflower seeds (used for sunflower oil and feed).\nWhen the war started, Ukraine's exports slumped and world prices for grain soared. This particularly affected people in the world's poorest countries. \nThe more grain that Ukraine has been able to supply to global markets, the lower prices have gone.\nFoodstuffs are a major earner for Ukraine. In 2021, the year before Russia's invasion, it made $27.8bn (\u00a323.8bn) from exports.\nUnder the grain deal, cargo ships travelled to and from Ukrainian ports along a 357-mile (574km) corridor across the Black Sea to the Bosphorus Strait.\nAfter that deal ended, Ukraine established a new \"temporary export corridor\" in August 2023, which hugs the western coastline. \nThis is a relatively safe route for cargo ships because the waters there are too shallow for Russian submarines to operate. \nIt also passes through the territorial waters of Romania and Bulgaria, two Nato countries.\nUnder the EU's \"solidarity lanes\" scheme, Ukraine is also sending grain by land and barge to ports on the River Danube, or to the Romanian port of Constanta, to be loaded onto cargo ships which then travel through the Black Sea.\nMore Ukrainian grain is also being exported to Europe to be sold on arrival, or to be shipped onwards from other European ports.\nUkrainian armed forces have carried out repeated attacks on Russian naval ships and bases in the Black Sea, using aerial drones, sea drones and long-range missiles.\nUkraine's navy claims it has hit or disabled a third of all the ships in Russia's Black Sea fleet since the war began. \nThis has meant Russia is now putting fewer ships near the Ukrainian coast to blockade it.\nTo help Ukraine's economy after the Russian invasion, the EU scrapped tariffs on imports from the country.\nHowever, countries in eastern Europe complained that this meant Ukrainian grain was flooding their markets, lowering wholesale prices and hitting the incomes of their farmers.\nSome dealers had decided to sell the grain in these countries rather than ship it overseas from other European ports. \nAccording to the EU's agriculture commissioner, Janusz Wojciechowski, 4.1 million tonnes of Ukrainian grain entered Poland between April 2022 and March 2023, and 3.4 million tonnes of that stayed in the country.\nIn May 2022, the European Commission introduced a ban on Ukrainian grain sales in Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria, only allowing grain meant for transit to enter those countries. \nIt lifted the restrictions in September 2023, saying the problem had been solved.\nHowever, Poland has since imposed its own ban on Ukrainian grain imports, and Polish farmers have been blockading border crossings with Ukraine.\nIn March 2024, the European Commission proposed a cap on duty-free imports of some Ukrainian produce, including oats, eggs, poultry and sugar. \nHowever it confirmed that all other Ukrainian imports into the EU - including wheat and barley - would remain free of duties until at least June 2025.\nIt is also proposing to increase tariffs on imports of Russian and Belorusian grain to reduce surpluses in eastern European countries.",
    "The mother of a three-year-old whose earache led to a brain tumour diagnosis has spoken about how they are learning to live with the condition.\nElsi, from Llanrug in Gwynedd, had 80% of her non-cancerous tumour removed, but the location in her head means doctors cannot remove it all.\nWith her mother Eleri and sister Lowri, Elsi is raising awareness for Brain Tumour Awareness Month.\nAccording to The Brain Tumour Charity, more done needs to be done to tackle the condition.\nElsi was two years old when she started complaining of an earache.\nFollowing tests at Ysbyty Gwynedd, Bangor, and a CT scan, the doctors discovered that Elsi had a tumour.\n\"I heard the words no parent wants to hear - 'we're very sorry, your daughter has a brain tumour',\" said Eleri.\nElsi was taken to Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool for treatment to try to remove the tumour.\nShe then had a second operation following complications including an illness called hydrocephalus, which is excess fluid in the brain.\nShe also needed a shunt, a thin tube placed in her brain, to get rid of the extra fluid to her stomach, and had a third operation.\n\"When we first went we were expecting a week or two stay (in hospital), but the complications arose, and we ended up there for three months continuously, and then back and forth,\" said Eleri.\n\"It was difficult as a family - being away from our other daughter, Lowri, who was at the time six years old, and explaining to Lowri that Mum and Elsi weren't going to be living in Llanrug. It was hard on her as well.\"\nDespite support from family, friends and colleagues, it was difficult to come to terms with.\n\"What I thought would be a few weeks turned into a few months - it changed everything,\" said Eleri.\nElsi is now back home in Llanrug with her family.\nShe goes for check-ups every three months at Alder Hey Hospital, Liverpool. The care was described as \"fantastic\" by Eleri.\n\"Our main hope is that everything stays stable for now, she gets routine scans that monitor the tumour and her other condition as well, and eventually, she gets to live her life like any other three-year-old,\" she said.\nEleri hopes that the condition does not define Elsi.\n\"It is something she will live with for the rest of her life,\" she said.",
    "More than 1,400 children are filling Gloucestershire's grammar school places from out of the county - up by 700 from before the pandemic.\nFreedom of Information (FOI) requests by the BBC found that pupils from as far away as Chester and Wolverhampton are being accepted into the county's seven grammar schools.\nPate's, in Cheltenham, has the highest intake of out-of-county pupils.\nOne tutor has called for schools to change their criteria for places.\nA spokesperson for Gloucestershire County Council said: \"All grammar schools in Gloucestershire are academies and therefore are responsible for setting their own admissions policies. \n\"No Gloucestershire grammar school has a catchment area in its admissions criteria and places are offered following the applicant undertaking the common grammar school entrance exam.\"\nGrammar Schools are selective state schools whose pupils are chosen according to their score in verbal and non-verbal reasoning tests known as the 11-plus.\nIn Gloucestershire, pupils who sit the exam are ranked based on their score and parents are able to select their preference for which grammar school they want their child to attend.\nThe schools then take the highest ranking pupils from their preferences. Some children are given extra consideration such as those in receipt of free school meals.\nThe BBC sent FOI requests to Gloucestershire's seven grammar schools - Pate's, Sir Thomas Rich's, Stroud High, Ribston, Crypt, Marling and Denmark Road - asking for the first half of the postcodes for all pupils.\nIn total, 1,409 pupils have enrolled from non-Gloucestershire postcodes, which is up from 751 in 2019.\nThe majority of children travelling into Gloucestershire come from Swindon and Stroud High has the highest intake of pupils from Swindon, which is currently 230 pupils.\nStudents are also travelling from Bristol, South Gloucestershire, Oxford and Worcester.\nBut they are also being accepted from postcodes in areas many hours away from the county, such as in Slough in Berkshire, Leicester in Leicestershire and Harrogate in North Yorkshire.\nSome of them then change their postcodes to GL - meaning Gloucestershire - and others are \"dual-registered students\" with a reduced timetable for attending school in person.\nPate's has the highest intake of out-of-county pupils, with one in four pupils classed as non-local.\nDenmark Road High School said it had been carrying out a consultation into admissions arrangements for September 2025, with proposed changes including priority being given to pupils who live in Gloucester, when the number of places are oversubscribed.\nIts figures showed that less than half of year seven pupils lived in Gloucestershire, with 16 out of 31 coming from outside the county.\nHowever, the proportion of county pupils was higher in all other year groups, the highest being in year 12 (69%) followed by years 11 and 13 (68%).\nFrustrated Gloucestershire parents anonymously told the BBC they felt they were up against a \"catchment area of the whole country\" and were competing with the children of people who could afford private tutoring.\nDorothy Gladwell, who has been tutoring children in Gloucester for 20 years, told the BBC places should be \"limited primarily for people in Gloucester and the surrounding Cheltenham and Stroud\" areas.\n\"It is not good for the children because little 11 and 12-year-olds are leaving home at 7am,\" she said. \n\"They are getting back very late, falling asleep sometimes in afternoon lessons because they are absolutely exhausted. \n\"There are the environmental issues of having to have transport. For example a coach travelling from Swindon to Sir Thomas Rich's everyday is a lot of fuel to add to pollution levels.\n\"The more people who are applying means that there are fewer children in Gloucester getting into the grammar schools, which means they have to travel further to other schools. It has compounded the problem,\" she added.\nDr Ian Todd, founder of Cotswold Education Tutoring, said people invested in their children because \"they want the best for their future\".\n\"Really it is in hands of the grammar schools to make the decision,\" he said. \n\"All parents want the best for their children understandably.\n\"They will do what they feel is right for their child to get them the best education, because education is one thing that is not affected very much by recession and financial difficulties,\" he said.\nStroud MP Siobhan Baillie, (Cons) said: \"Perhaps we do need to think more widely about whether there should be an expansion of grammar schools or other grammar schools in Wiltshire and surrounds.\n\"I will always want to be selfish about Stroud district children over children from outside of our area and county. \n\"I think allowing schools to set their own admissions criteria, and allowing parents and children to put their best foot forward to make those applications is important. \n\"I am very happy to look at this with schools and wider policymakers.\"\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Face",
    "In 1926, when Japanese Emperor Hirohito ascended the Imperial throne, he was revered by millions of Japanese people as a living god. \nAlmost 100 years later, the world's oldest continuing monarchy is sporting a very different look. \nHis grandson, Emperor Naruhito vowed to bring the country's royal family into the modern age when he took over five years ago. \nAnd on Monday, the royal household took a very definite step into the 21st Century: they joined Instagram.\nThe move comes some 15 years after Britain's royals first made their social media debuts. \n\"The [Japanese] were perhaps the last notable royal family not to fully engage the digital era,\" notes social media analyst Andrew Hughes. \nBut it was an inevitable move. The family had made clear their wish to engage with younger generations and stay relevant; and given those subjects increasingly only get content through their phones, the family would also have to go online.\nBut for those hoping to get a more authentic glimpse into Imperial Family's day-to-day lives, the 48-hour presence of the @kunaicho_jp account so far might disappoint. \n\"When I heard [they] created an Instagram, I quickly checked it out. But of course the emperor wouldn't post 'today's lunch (heart emoji)' or anything like that,\" one fan wrote online.\nIn the 70 pictures and five videos uploaded across the kunaicho_jp [Imperial Household] profile so far, Emperor Naruhito, Empress Masako and their widely adored only child, the 22-year-old Princess Aiko feature prominently.\nBut a page divulging personal notes, reflections or even just more candid pictures of the royals this is not.\nThe gallery so far is pretty formal in tone - just a round up of royal duties these last few months: public appearances, visits to museums, earthquake sites and meetings in drawing rooms with royals from other lands.  There's some bonsai and a lot of bowing. A birthday celebration post shows the Emperor and Empress seated at a low table, smiling for the cameras.\nInstagram influencers go to great lengths to curate the overall look of their grid - for potential new followers to be won over in one glance by a brand that's cohesive and easy on the eye, a definable aesthetic.\nThe Japanese royals appear to have one too.  A melange of beige and grey.\n\"The account's posts are extremely dull, the same kind of photos it shares in press releases,\" says Jeffrey Hall, a Japanese studies lecturer at Kanda University.\nThe captions, written solely in Japanese, so far remain just factual recaps of the event shown in photos. Don't expect a casual first name sign-off just yet or any personal musings from the Emperor.\nAnd while they've seized on the Stories function- the tool usually used by Instagram users to post sporadic flashes of life -  it appears so far the Imperial Household officials are just using it to showcase the B-roll of event photographs.\n\"I don't think that the conservative officials at the IHA have any intention of providing an interactive or entertaining experience for their Instagram followers,\" says Mr Hall.\nCrucially, they've also turned the comments off - a trend emerging out of the corporate world, social media analysts note.\n\"It stops any brand damage from those platforming their own causes, hijacking of comments\u2026 and basically diluting the content and harming the brand,\" says Mr Hughes, who teaches advertising and marketing at the Australian National University.\n\"They may yet change it but I wouldn't expect that as that would open a can of worms and they have very much seen what happens from overseas examples with other royal families.\"\nCertainly, while the Japanese royals might be making their online debut 15 years later than the Windsors, the furore over a photoshopped image of the Princess of Wales and her family in recent months would certainly be front of mind.\nAfter all, this is a royal family whose Chrysanthemum throne rule and lineage trace millennia, a royal house which did not wish to taint themselves with social media for well over a decade.\n\"Expect a very tight and narrow narrative and content as the Japanese royal family want to reinforce their conservative and safe brand image,\" says Mr Hughes. \"There will be no (Prince Harry's autobiography) Spare-style works emerging or any Photoshopped dramas.\"\nHe notes too that the Japanese have a slightly different relationship with their royals - more reverential, more respectful. \n\"They don't need to provide constant content initially, just more a subtle reinforcement of brand and minimising AI and disinformation and misinformation by controlling what is released and discussed. For me, this is smart brand management,\" says Mr Hughes. \nAnd while there have been tabloid scandals in the past, the Imperial Household has worked hard to keep the Crown family clean -  by and large, they are still viewed by the Japanese populace as morally upstanding role models. \nThe family has long used traditional media channels, photography, newspapers and since the Meji p",
    "A measles outbreak in Sheffield last year resulted in more than 40 children getting the MMR vaccine for the first time to stop the disease spreading.\nIn total, 12 cases were confirmed in the outbreak, a council meeting heard. \nThe vaccinations, at an unnamed school in the north of the city, prevented further waves of cases, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said.\nRuth Granger, Sheffield Council's lead on infectious diseases, said outbreaks could cause \"massive disruption\".\nThe outbreak in Sheffield in November was linked to a nursery that was part of a school, a meeting of Sheffield City Council's health and wellbeing board heard.\nThere had been an increase in measles cases across England since October, according to the UKHSA.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) said measles was a \"highly contagious disease\" most common in children.\nMs Granger, a consultant in public health, told the meeting that Sheffield's vaccination level was currently 86% - lower than the 95% target set by the WHO.\nLower uptake levels were linked to areas of high social and economic deprivation, she added.\n\"We have to acknowledge this is a really tough job trying to increase vaccination.

    "US President Joe Biden has condemned Israel's killing of seven humanitarian aid workers in Gaza. \nSaying he was \"outraged and heartbroken\", he accused Israel of not doing enough to protect aid workers. \nIsrael promised an independent investigation after the UK, US, Canada, Australia and Poland lost nationals in Monday's attack.\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog has apologised for the deaths.\nThe seven victims, who were working for World Central Kitchen (WCK), were killed when their convoy was attacked from the air on Monday.\nMr Biden called for Israel's investigation to be conducted swiftly, and said it \"must bring accountability\" and its findings be made public. \nDistributing aid in Gaza had been \"so difficult\", he said, because Israel had \"not done enough to protect aid workers trying to deliver desperately needed help to civilians\". \nIn some of his strongest language since the war began, Mr Biden also accused Israel of not doing enough to protect Palestinian civilians. \n\"The United States has repeatedly urged Israel to deconflict their military operations against Hamas with humanitarian operations, in order to avoid civilian casualties,\" the US leader said.\nIn a video message, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief of general staff Herzi Halevi called the incident a \"grave mistake\" and said \"it shouldn't have happened,\" blaming the strike on misidentification.\nHumanitarian aid to Gaza is in doubt after WCK - a key provider of aid to the Strip - suspended operations.\nThree of the killed aid workers were British nationals. A Polish national, an Australian, a Palestinian and a dual US-Canadian citizen were also killed. The IDF has promised an independent investigation into the incident.\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday. On the call, he described the situation in Gaza as \"increasingly intolerable\" and \"demanded a thorough and transparent independent investigation\" into the killing of the aid workers.\nMr Sunak added that Israel needed to end restrictions on humanitarian aid and protect civilians, according to a Downing Street statement.\nIn other reaction:\nAcknowledging that Israel's forces had hit \"innocent people\", Mr Netanyahu said: \"Unfortunately, in the last 24 hours there was a tragic case of our forces unintentionally hitting innocent people in the Gaza Strip.\n\"It happens in war, we check it to the end, we are in contact with the governments, and we will do everything so that this thing does not happen again.\"\nWCK - founded by celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s - is one of the main suppliers of aid to Gaza. Four days ago, it said that it had served 42 million meals in the territory - dispatching more than 1,700 food trucks and also sending close to 435,000 meals by sea.\nThe charity has said it will pause its operations in the region immediately. \"We will be making decisions about the future of our work soon,\" it said in a statement. \nAccording to Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body in charge of civilian policy in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, WCK is responsible for 60% of the non-governmental aid getting into the territory.\nA second charity, the American Near East Refugee Aid (Anera), which was working closely with WCK, told the BBC it was also freezing its operations in Gaza.\nThe aid workers who were killed have been named as: \nMr Sobol, Mr Abu Taha and Mr Flickinger worked on WCK's relief team, which Ms Frankcom led, while Mr Chapman, Mr Henderson and Mr Kirby were part of its security team.\nAll seven were \"heroes\", the chief executive of WCK said.\n\"We have countless memories of them giving their best selves to the world. We are reeling from our loss. The world's loss,\" Erin Gore said in a statement.\nAccording to the charity, the aid convoy was hit while leaving the Deir al-Balah warehouse, \"where the team had unloaded more than 100 tons of humanitarian food aid brought to Gaza on the maritime route\".\nThe convoy was made up of three vehicles, including two that were armoured, which clearly displayed the charity's logo. All three were hit during the strike.\nWCK said it had co-ordinated the convoy's movements with the IDF.\nMore than 196 aid workers have been killed in Gaza since October, according to the US-funded Aid Worker Security Database, which records major incidents of violence against aid personnel. Not all have been killed in the line of duty.\nMuch of the Gaza Strip has been devastated during the Israeli military operations that began after Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages.\nAbout 130 of the hostages remain in captivity, at least 34 of whom are presumed dead.\nMore than 32,916 people have been killed in Gaza since then, the Hamas-run health ministry says.",
    "The killing of seven members of World Central Kitchen (WCK) in Gaza has starkly highlighted the food charity's often dangerous work around the globe. \nFor 14 years, the non-profit founded by chef Jose Andres has provided millions of meals in places ravaged by natural disasters and violent conflicts.\nIt had been bringing food to civilians in the Israel-Hamas war since October.\nAfter the airstrike on its aid convoy, it suspended that work, sparking fears that a vital lifeline will be cut.\nThose killed were traveling from a warehouse in central Gaza, when the convoy was struck by Israeli aircraft.  They represented the organization's international reach, coming from as far away as Australia.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has acknowledged the airstrike and vowed to investigate. \nThe group is no stranger to conflict. It has also operated in Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion, where it has also lost seven people.\nWCK has been operating in Gaza - as well as in Israel and Lebanon - since the outbreak of hostilities in early October last year. \nBy 29 March, the organisation had dispatched more than 1,700 trucks with food and cooking equipment through the Rafah crossing from Egypt, and was working through 68 \"community kitchens\".\nAdditionally, it has delivered 230,000 meals from Jordan, both overland and via airdrops, and sent 435,000 meals by sea.\nIt recently said that two more ships are loaded with 1.2 million meals ready to be sent to northern Gaza. \nMick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for the Middle East, said that the risks for WCK in Gaza are \"as high or higher\" than in other conflict areas, largely due to the \"condensed\" nature of the warzone. \n\"There should be an investigation to determine why a clearly marked vehicle whose movement was coordinated was struck in the daytime by what appears to be a precision weapon,\" he said. \"That should not happen.\" \nThe announcement that WCK and another charity, the American Near East Refugee Aid, have suspended operations raised immediate concerns about a disruption of aid to Gaza. The UAE - WCK'S primary funder in Gaza - has also paused its Gaza aid route.\n\"Children are dying of hunger,\" Juliette Touma, the communications director for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) told the BBC.  \"Any organisation which delivers assistance to people in Gaza is key.\" \n\"Any disruption will have severe consequences on a population which is already going through quite a lot.\"\nDr Mona Jebril, a Palestinian researcher at Cambridge who lived in Gaza for more than 22 years, said that the impact of the airstrike is \"much more than just catastrophic\". \n\"We're talking about a population that has basically 100% been declared as being on the brink of famine,\" she said. \"The population is being left to die...This is very dangerous.\" \nThere are two major reasons WCK has become so instrumental in Gaza: its ability to distribute food and problems with UNRWA.\nWhile large swaths of Gaza's population have relied on humanitarian assistance for decades, WCK quickly gained prominence largely as a result of opening its maritime corridor and its distribution network.\nMeanwhile, UNRWA, the biggest UN agency operating in Gaza, has been pulled into a diplomatic storm, hampering its operations. \nIsrael has accused some of its employees of taking part in the 7 October attack and has said there was a Hamas tunnel under its local headquarters.

    "Shares of Donald Trump's social media company fell by more than 20% on Monday, less than a week after it began publicly trading under the DJT ticker.\nThe drop comes after Trump Media & Technology Group reported it had lost nearly $60m (\u00a348m) last year while only bringing in around $4m in revenue.\nThe price plunge caused the former president's net worth to shrink by $1bn, according to Bloomberg.\nShares had surged last week, giving the company an $11bn valuation.\nBut experts warned the stock was bound to tumble, as its main product - Truth Social - loses users and burns cash.\nThe price spike drew comparisons to the pandemic-era \"meme stock\" mania, when the share prices of companies like GameStop and AMC soared even though basic parts of their businesses, such as revenue, were weak.\nMeme stocks are ones that gain sudden popularity on social media, sparking price rises as online investors rush to buy.\nOn Monday, shares of Trump Media - which makes its money exclusively through advertising on Truth Social - fell $13.30 to $48.66. But they are still up nearly 200% so far this year.\nThe surge has been driven by small-time investors, at least some of whom appear to be showing support for the former president as his legal troubles, and the bills that accompany them, pile up.\nMr Trump holds a nearly 60% ownership stake in the company and stands to earn a billion-dollar windfall when he cashes out his shares - though he is legally barred from doing so for another six months unless the company's board grants him a waiver.\nBut these investors are making a bet on a company that, in a special filing on Monday, told the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) it \"expects to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future\".\nAccording to the financial filing, Trump Media paid about $40m in interest expenses and $16m in operating losses in 2023.\nThe company said its management had \"substantial doubt\" that it \"will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities as they fall due\".\nTruth Social launched in February 2022, about one year after the former president was banned from Twitter (now X) and Facebook in the aftermath of the violent riot at the US Capitol.\nWhile Mr Trump's accounts on both platforms have since been reinstated, he has continued to use Truth Social as the main avenue for his social media posts.\nBut his presence on the platform has not helped it gain a broad audience. Estimates from Similarweb show the company has roughly five million active monthly users, far fewer than rivals.\nTruth Social has claimed it has about 8.9 million sign-ups, but it has declined to share the commonly disclosed performance metrics that could give shareholders a better sense of its operations.",

    "Millions of workers across the UK have received a pay increased after the National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage rose on 1 April. \nThe Real Living Wage - a higher amount voluntarily paid by some UK businesses - remains the same. \nFrom 1 April, employees aged 21 and over became entitled to the National Living Wage. Previously, you had to be 23 to qualify.\nThe rate increased to \u00a311.44 an hour, up from \u00a310.42.\nThe changes, which apply across the UK, mean:\nYounger employees - aged between 16 and 20 - receive the National Minimum Wage.\nThe rates for this also increased on 1 April:\nThe separate apprentice rate, which applies to eligible people under 19 - or those over 19 in the first year of an apprenticeship - will be \u00a36.40 an hour, up from \u00a35.28.\nThe National Living Wage and National Minimum Wage are both set by the Department for Business and Trade every year on the advice of independent group, the Low Pay Commission.\nThose who don't qualify include:\nPeople with disabilities or in long-term unemployment who take part in government work programmes are paid fixed amounts at different stages of the scheme. \nThese are less than the equivalent National Minimum or Living rate. \nYes, it is a criminal offence if employers fail to pay the correct National Minimum and Living Wages to their workers. \nThe rates apply to staff even if they are not paid by the hour.\nIf you think you are being paid incorrectly, you can complain via the HMRC website. \nYou can also get advice from workplace experts Acas.\nAny employer not paying the correct amount can be fined by HMRC.\nIn June 2023, the government said that more than 200 firms had been fined a total of nearly \u00a37m and told to reimburse 63,000 workers for failures over several years.\nThe companies included Marks and Spencer, Argos and Lloyds Pharmacy. \nWH Smith was the worst offender, having failed to pay more than \u00a31m to more than 17,600 workers.\nThe Real Living Wage is an unofficial hourly rate which is overseen by the Living Wage Foundation charity. It is based on the amount the charity believes people need to earn. \nIt is aimed at UK workers aged 18 and over, but is not a legal requirement, and businesses choose whether to pay it. \nThe charity says more than 460,000 employees working for 14,000 firms currently receive the Real Living Wage.  \nThe rate for workers in London - sometimes called the London Living Wage - is \u00a313.15 an hour. \nIn the rest of the UK, it is \u00a312.\nA qualifying full-time worker in London would earn \u00a35,323 more than someone on the National Living Wage. \nSomeone on the Real Living Wage outside the capital would earn \u00a33,081 more than someone on the National Living Wage. \nThe charity points out that - unlike the National Minimum Wage - the Real Living Wage has kept up with the rising cost of living.\nThe CPI measure of inflation rose by 17.4% between September 2021 and September 2023. Over the same period the Real Living Wage for the UK went up by 21.2% (19% in London). \nBy comparison, the National Minimum Wage increased by less than CPI between April 2021 and April 2023. \nIn February 2024, the charity said it had found that one in eight UK jobs paid less than its suggested hourly rate, with the highest concentration of low-paid jobs in the north-east of England (15.9%), the East Midlands (15.7%) and Northern Ireland (15.6%). \nThe National Minimum Wage came into force under the Labour government in 1999. \nIt started at \u00a33.60 an hour for those 22 and older, and \u00a33 for 18-21-year-olds.\nThe Conservative government introduced the National Living Wage for workers aged over 25 in 2016.\nIt was initially set at \u00a37.20 an hour - 50p more than the National Minimum Wage. The qualifying age fell to 23 in 2021. ",
    "The killing of seven members of World Central Kitchen (WCK) in Gaza has starkly highlighted the food charity's often dangerous work around the globe. \nFor 14 years, the non-profit founded by chef Jose Andres has provided millions of meals in places ravaged by natural disasters and violent conflicts.\nIt had been bringing food to civilians in the Israel-Hamas war since October.\nAfter the airstrike on its aid convoy, it suspended that work, sparking fears that a vital lifeline will be cut.\nThose killed were traveling from a warehouse in central Gaza, when the convoy was struck by Israeli aircraft.  They represented the organization's international reach, coming from as far away as Australia.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has acknowledged the airstrike and vowed to investigate. \nThe group is no stranger to conflict. It has also operated in Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion, where it has also lost seven people.\nWCK has been operating in Gaza - as well as in Israel and Lebanon - since the outbreak of hostilities in early October last year. \nBy 29 March, the organisation had dispatched more than 1,700 trucks with food and cooking equipment through the Rafah crossing from Egypt, and was working through 68 \"community kitchens\".\nAdditionally, it has delivered 230,000 meals from Jordan, both overland and via airdrops, and sent 435,000 meals by sea.\nIt recently said that two more ships are loaded with 1.2 million meals ready to be sent to northern Gaza. \nMick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for the Middle East, said that the risks for WCK in Gaza are \"as high or higher\" than in other conflict areas, largely due to the \"condensed\" nature of the warzone. \n\"There should be an investigation to determine why a clearly marked vehicle whose movement was coordinated was struck in the daytime by what appears to be a precision weapon,\" he said. \"That should not happen.\" \nThe announcement that WCK and another charity, the American Near East Refugee Aid, have suspended operations raised immediate concerns about a disruption of aid to Gaza. The UAE - WCK'S primary funder in Gaza - has also paused its Gaza aid route.\n\"Children are dying of hunger,\" Juliette Touma, the communications director for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) told the BBC.  \"Any organisation which delivers assistance to people in Gaza is key.\" \n\"Any disruption will have severe consequences on a population which is already going through quite a lot.\"\nDr Mona Jebril, a Palestinian researcher at Cambridge who lived in Gaza for more than 22 years, said that the impact of the airstrike is \"much more than just catastrophic\". \n\"We're talking about a population that has basically 100% been declared as being on the brink of famine,\" she said. \"The population is being left to die...This is very dangerous.\" \nThere are two major reasons WCK has become so instrumental in Gaza: its ability to distribute food and problems with UNRWA.\nWhile large swaths of Gaza's population have relied on humanitarian assistance for decades, WCK quickly gained prominence largely as a result of opening its maritime corridor and its distribution network.\nMeanwhile, UNRWA, the biggest UN agency operating in Gaza, has been pulled into a diplomatic storm, hampering its operations. \nIsrael has accused some of its employees of taking part in the 7 October attack and has said there was a Hamas tunnel under its local headquarters.

A Polish national, an Australian, a Palestinian and a dual US-Canadian citizen were also killed. The IDF has promised an independent investigation into the incident.\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday. On the call, he described the situation in Gaza as \"increasingly intolerable\" and \"demanded a thorough and transparent independent investigation\" into the killing of the aid workers.\nMr Sunak added that Israel needed to end restrictions on humanitarian aid and protect civilians, according to a Downing Street statement.\nIn other reaction:\nAcknowledging that Israel's forces had hit \"innocent people\", Mr Netanyahu said: \"Unfortunately, in the last 24 hours there was a tragic case of our forces unintentionally hitting innocent people in the Gaza Strip.\n\"It happens in war, we check it to the end, we are in contact with the governments, and we will do everything so that this thing does not happen again.\"\nWCK - founded by celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s - is one of the main suppliers of aid to Gaza. Four days ago, it said that it had served 42 million meals in the territory - dispatching more than 1,700 food trucks and also sending close to 435,000 meals by sea.\nThe charity has said it will pause its operations in the region immediately. \"We will be making decisions about the future of our work soon,\" it said in a statement. \nAccording to Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body in charge of civilian policy in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, WCK is responsible for 60% of the non-governmental aid getting into the territory.\nA second charity, the American Near East Refugee Aid (Anera), which was working closely with WCK, told the BBC it was also freezing its operations in Gaza.\nThe aid workers who were killed have been named as: \nMr Sobol, Mr Abu Taha and Mr Flickinger worked on WCK's relief team, which Ms Frankcom led, while Mr Chapman, Mr Henderson and Mr Kirby were part of its security team.\nAll seven were \"heroes\", the chief executive of WCK said.\n\"We have countless memories of them giving their best selves to the world. We are reeling from our loss. The world's loss,\" Erin Gore said in a statement.\nAccording to the charity, the aid convoy was hit while leaving the Deir al-Balah warehouse, \"where the team had unloaded more than 100 tons of humanitarian food aid brought to Gaza on the maritime route\".\nThe convoy was made up of three vehicles, including two that were armoured, which clearly displayed the charity's logo. All three were hit during the strike.\nWCK said it had co-ordinated the convoy's movements with the IDF.\nMore than 196 aid workers have been killed in Gaza since October, according to the US-funded Aid Worker Security Database, which records major incidents of violence against aid personnel. Not all have been killed in the line of duty.\nMuch of the Gaza Strip has been devastated during the Israeli military operations that began after Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages.\nAbout 130 of the hostages remain in captivity, at least 34 of whom are presumed dead.\nMore than 32,916 people have been killed in Gaza since then, the Hamas-run health ministry says.",

    "A small, uninhabited island that is part of Sri Lanka has sparked a political row in India weeks before general elections kick off.\nKatchatheevu - a strip of land spanning just about 1.9 sq km (0.7 sq miles) - is located in the Palk Strait, a stretch of ocean which divides India and Sri Lanka. It lies to the northeast to Rameswaram town in India's Tamil Nadu state and to the southwest of Sri Lanka's Jaffna city.\nThe island has no source of drinking water and the only structure on it is a church which holds an annual three-day festival that draws devotees from both India and Sri Lanka.\nSince 1921, rulers in both India and Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) - British colonies at the time - had staked claim to fishing rights in the waters around Katchatheevu. But in 1974, India ended the dispute by relinquishing any claim over the island; two years later, India and Sri Lanka signed an agreement that prevented people from both countries from fishing in waters belonging to each other.\nNow, that decades-old decision is in the headlines again after India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused the country's opposition Congress party - which was in power at the time - of \"callously\" giving away the island to Sri Lanka. The Congress has reacted sharply, accusing Mr Modi of raking up the issue ahead of elections due to \"desperation\".\nThe ostensible trigger for the controversy is new information accessed by a leader from Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) about the debates within the federal government about Katchatheevu in the 1960s. \nBut opposition leaders say the BJP is trying to turn Katchatheevu - a sensitive issue in Tamil Nadu - into a controversy to gain votes in the southern state, where it has been trying hard to make inroads. Tamil Nadu will vote in the first phase of the general election on 19 April.\nThe controversy began on Sunday when Mr Modi shared an article from The Times of India newspaper on X (formerly Twitter), saying \"Eye opening and startling! New facts reveal how Congress callously gave away Katchatheevu.\"\nThe article was based on documents obtained by K Annamalai, chief of the BJP in Tamil Nadu, under a law which allows Indians to access information from the government. \nThe documents quoted Jawaharlal Nehru, India's prime minister at the time, saying that he attached \"no importance at all to [Katchatheevu]\" and that he \"would have no hesitation in giving up [India's] claims to it\".\nBut according to the report, some officials from the ministry of external affairs and other experts said that India had a \"good legal case\" to assert claim over Katchatheevu as they claimed the island was ruled by an Indian king \"continuously and uninterruptedly\" between 1875 and 1948.\nIn 1974, when Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi was prime minister, the Indian government ended the dispute with Sri Lanka over the island.\nSince then, political parties in Tamil Nadu have regularly raised the issue of Katchatheevu and filed cases in court challenging the agreement with Sri Lanka - two of these cases are pending in the Supreme Court. Fishermen from Tamil Nadu have often been arrested by Sri Lankan authorities when entering the country's waters, including around Katchatheevu, so the issue often makes headlines there.\nAfter Mr Modi's post, many BJP leaders and federal ministers joined him in criticising the Congress. They also said the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) - which currently governs Tamil Nadu and was also in power in 1974 - did not do enough to retain Katchatheevu.  The DMK has denied this, saying they were not aware of the decision to relinquish claim over the island until the agreement was completed.\n\"The DMK had written several letters to the foreign ministry over the past many decades, upholding the rights of Tamil Nadu's fisher people over Katchatheevu. The BJP woke up to the issue only now, just as elections are nearing,\" DMK spokesperson Saravanan Annadurai told the BBC. \nEven India's foreign minister, S Jaishankar held a press conference, saying that the issue had been \"hidden too long from the gaze of the public\".\nHowever, when asked if India planned to revisit the 1974 agreement with Sri Lanka, Mr Jaishankar said the matter was in court.\nIn 2013, the federal government had told the Supreme Court that it could not \"retrieve\" Katchatheevu from Sri Lanka as \"no territory belonging to India was ceded nor sovereignty relinquished since the area was in dispute and had never been demarcated\".\nAnd the next year, former attorney general Mukul Rohatgi, representing Mr Modi's government, told the court that if India wanted Katchatheevu, it would have to \"go to war\" to get it.\nMr Annamalai, however, has told reporters that the federal government was trying to \"bring back\" Katchatheevu to protect the interests of Tamil Nadu's fisher people.\nThe BBC has emailed the Sri Lankan high commission in India for comment and is awaiting a response.\nA Sri Lankan minister told the Indian Express newspaper that the country has not rec",

    "Millions of workers across the UK have received a pay increased after the National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage rose on 1 April. \nThe Real Living Wage - a higher amount voluntarily paid by some UK businesses - remains the same. \nFrom 1 April, employees aged 21 and over became entitled to the National Living Wage. Previously, you had to be 23 to qualify.\nThe rate increased to \u00a311.44 an hour, up from \u00a310.42.\nThe changes, which apply across the UK, mean:\nYounger employees - aged between 16 and 20 - receive the National Minimum Wage.\nThe rates for this also increased on 1 April:\nThe separate apprentice rate, which applies to eligible people under 19 - or those over 19 in the first year of an apprenticeship - will be \u00a36.40 an hour, up from \u00a35.28.\nThe National Living Wage and National Minimum Wage are both set by the Department for Business and Trade every year on the advice of independent group, the Low Pay Commission.\nThose who don't qualify include:\nPeople with disabilities or in long-term unemployment who take part in government work programmes are paid fixed amounts at different stages of the scheme. \nThese are less than the equivalent National Minimum or Living rate. \nYes, it is a criminal offence if employers fail to pay the correct National Minimum and Living Wages to their workers. \nThe rates apply to staff even if they are not paid by the hour.\nIf you think you are being paid incorrectly, you can complain via the HMRC website. \nYou can also get advice from workplace experts Acas.\nAny employer not paying the correct amount can be fined by HMRC.\nIn June 2023, the government said that more than 200 firms had been fined a total of nearly \u00a37m and told to reimburse 63,000 workers for failures over several years.\nThe companies included Marks and Spencer, Argos and Lloyds Pharmacy. \nWH Smith was the worst offender, having failed to pay more than \u00a31m to more than 17,600 workers.\nThe Real Living Wage is an unofficial hourly rate which is overseen by the Living Wage Foundation charity. It is based on the amount the charity believes people need to earn. \nIt is aimed at UK workers aged 18 and over, but is not a legal requirement, and businesses choose whether to pay it. \nThe charity says more than 460,000 employees working for 14,000 firms currently receive the Real Living Wage.  \nThe rate for workers in London - sometimes called the London Living Wage - is \u00a313.15 an hour. \nIn the rest of the UK, it is \u00a312.\nA qualifying full-time worker in London would earn \u00a35,323 more than someone on the National Living Wage. \nSomeone on the Real Living Wage outside the capital would earn \u00a33,081 more than someone on the National Living Wage. \nThe charity points out that - unlike the National Minimum Wage - the Real Living Wage has kept up with the rising cost of living.\nThe CPI measure of inflation rose by 17.4% between September 2021 and September 2023. Over the same period the Real Living Wage for the UK went up by 21.2% (19% in London). \nBy comparison, the National Minimum Wage increased by less than CPI between April 2021 and April 2023. \nIn February 2024, the charity said it had found that one in eight UK jobs paid less than its suggested hourly rate, with the highest concentration of low-paid jobs in the north-east of England (15.9%), the East Midlands (15.7%) and Northern Ireland (15.6%). \nThe National Minimum Wage came into force under the Labour government in 1999. \nIt started at \u00a33.60 an hour for those 22 and older, and \u00a33 for 18-21-year-olds.\nThe Conservative government introduced the National Living Wage for workers aged over 25 in 2016.\nIt was initially set at \u00a37.20 an hour - 50p more than the National Minimum Wage. The qualifying age fell to 23 in 2021. ",

    "A major port has recorded a sharp increase in customers moving imported freight by train rather than by lorry.\nDP World Southampton introduced incentives to use rail in September, paying \u00a370 per shipping container and then \u00a3100 from January.\nThe firm said rail's share had risen from 21% of containers in early 2023 to 35% in March 2024.\nDirector John Trenchard said the switch had avoided 13,500 lorry journeys in six months.\nMr Trenchard said: \"It saved about 4,500 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2). That is more than two-and-a-half times more than the total CO2 emitted by port operations at DP World Southampton for the time period.\"\nThe incentive is paid for freight travelling to railheads within about 140 miles (225km) of Southampton, including large distribution centres in the Midlands.\nThe scheme is funded by a \u00a310 levy on all laden containers arriving at Southampton docks. Customers moving freight to railheads further away than 140 miles have the \u00a310 refunded.\nThe incentive was reduced to \u00a380 from April.\nBy Paul Clifton, BBC South transport correspondent\nThe ambition is to enable rail to compete better against lorries heading up the congested A34 and M3 to the giant distribution hubs in the Midlands. \nPreviously those journeys were thought to be too short to be viable by train.\nIn recent years the proportion of docks traffic going by rail has fallen, with lorries proving a cheaper option for moving global imports inland. \nDP World aims to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 - a difficult challenge when almost everything entering or leaving its terminals by land or sea is powered by oil.  \nSouthampton port director Alistair Welch, from Associated British Ports, said: \"We are putting the infrastructure in place to support growth in rail. \n\"We are seeing an uptick. And the total volume now is much higher than we had 10 years ago.\"\nThe port also sees a daily Freightliner service to Coatbridge near Glasgow, which uses HVO fuel as far as Crewe and electric power further north.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

    "A speeding driver who ran over and killed a woman he claimed he did not see has been jailed for three years and nine months.\nIain Fletcher hit Rachel McLaren in his Ford Focus, sending her flying over a roadside safety barrier, on 27 November 2021.\nThe 51-year-old had been driving at 58mph in a 30mph zone on Balmore Road in Glasgow's Milton area.\nHe pled guilty to causing the death of the 33-year-old by dangerous driving.\nJudge Lady Stacey said: \"Nothing I can say or do on this occasion can lessen the grief felt now and forever for Miss McLaren's family and friends.\n\"Of course, I cannot put a value on another person's life.\n\"She was a much loved daughter, sister and had a partner and friends who must miss her terribly.\n\"I know from your background report that you understand that.\n\"You appreciate that your dangerous driving had catastrophic consequences for Miss McLaren and her family.\n\"I have decided that in all the circumstances, custody is appropriate.\"\nFletcher was also disqualified from driving for six years and eight months.\nThe crash happened as Ms McLaren - who lived nearby - had been heading to a local shop.\nCCTV played at the High Court in Glasgow showed Ms McLaren crossing the road before being hit by Fletcher's car.\nProsecutor James Irvine said: \"The car did not brake until after the collision - coming to stop 82m (269ft) away.\"\nWitnesses immediately ran to help Ms McLaren, but Mr Irvine said her injuries were so serious that she never recovered.\nThe court heard that Fletcher, from the city's Maryhill area, did not have any traces of drink or drugs in his system. But it emerged he had a clear sight of Ms McLaren for 230m (755ft) as she crossed the road.\nIan Duguid, defending, said father-of-two Fletcher - who had no previous driving convictions - was \"remorseful\" for what he called a \"shocking incident\".\nThe KC added: \"He stopped his car...he got out.

    "A social worker has been jailed for eight years after he was convicted for a series of rapes and sexual assaults. \nThomas Proctor was found guilty of attacking three women in Glasgow, Fife and Lanarkshire between January 2002 and August 2019.\nThe High Court in Glasgow heard he used his job to prey on the women, as well as threatening to have the children of two of them removed from their care.\nThe 43-year-old raped one woman while she was recovering in hospital.\nHe also took advantage of a victim after she drank water with a mystery substance in it.\nProctor, from Airdrie, Lanarkshire, had denied the accusations but jurors found him guilty of a total of 11 charges.\nThe charges against him included the repeated rape and indecent assault of the first woman at different locations in Lanarkshire.\nProctor was found guilty of sexually assaulting the second woman at a flat in Glasgow's Maryhill.\nHe was also convicted of raping and making threats to a third woman in Fife and Lanarkshire.\nJudge William Gallacher imposed an 11-year extended sentence on Proctor, meaning he will be in prison for eight years and under supervision upon his release for three years.\nThe judge told Proctor his actions were \"simply disgraceful.\"\nHe added: \"It is difficult to figure out the appropriate sentence due to the level of abuse carried out over a period of time.\n\"I will impose a significant penalty. You will have grasped that because of the gravity of this case, there is only one thing I can do.\"\nAfter the sentencing, one of Proctor's victims said: \"I am really pleased with the judge's reflections of the offences.\n\"I understand the appropriate length of the sentence however my fear is that it doesn't reflect the number of potential other victims.\"\nAn indefinite non-harassment order against Proctor's victims was granted.

    "Thousands of people are to be offered a blood test for dementia as part of a trial run by memory clinics across the UK.\nThe hope is that more people will be able to access care, support and new drug treatments at an earlier stage.\nThe research, by University College London and the University of Oxford, will involve around 5,000 volunteers. \nThe five-year project will study blood tests for Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.\nCurrently, around a third of patients with dementia never get a formal diagnosis and are left with worry and uncertainty about their condition.\nOnly around 2% of patients have one of the 'gold standard' tests for Alzheimer's - either a specialist PET brain scan or a spinal lumbar puncture.\nBoth can show the presence of rogue proteins in the brain such as amyloid and tau which start to accumulate up to 20 years before symptoms emerge - but tests are expensive. \nThe Oxford team will be looking at a range of blood tests, which could be a cheaper and easier way for doctors to spot early signs of the disease. \nOne blood test will look for traces of these proteins in the blood in order to diagnose Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. Some tests will also look for potential biomarkers for vascular and frontotemporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies.  \nThe researchers will also look at whether the blood tests can help detect these diseases at various stages.\nDr Vanessa Raymont, from the University of Oxford, is leading a study which will recruit volunteers from more than 50 UK trial sites, which are all NHS memory clinics.  \nShe told the BBC that although several dementia blood tests had already shown promising results, they had limitations. \n\"Research has tended to exclude the very elderly, ethnic minorities and those with other medical conditions so we need to understand what the data looks like in the real world, which is why these projects are so important.\"\nThe University College London (UCL) team will focus on the most promising biomarker for Alzheimer's disease, called p-tau217, which can indicate levels of amyloid and tau in the brain.\nIts trial will see if measuring p-tau217 in the blood can increase the rate of diagnosis for Alzheimer's disease in people with early dementia, but also those with mild but progressive memory problems.\nLucy, whose mother had dementia, told BBC News she would like to volunteer for the trial: \"I have very close personal experience. \n\"Fortunately, she was relatively old - she was in her 80s - when it started, and she died at 97. But her last few years were really mired by the disease. \n\"Anything that might be able to pick it up earlier and if there was some treatment in the future...that would be wonderful.\"\nJonathan Schott, professor of neurology at UCL, who is leading the trial, said: \"An early, accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is already important, allowing people to access appropriate care and medications. \n\"If, as we hope, new treatments that can slow down Alzheimer's disease become available soon, then this will be vital,\" he said.\n\"This would pave the way for fair and equitable access to new and potentially life-changing treatments to all who might benefit.\"\nTwo treatments have shown in trials that they can slow the progression of early stage Alzheimer's. Doctors say the benefits are modest but they represent the first 'disease-modifying' drugs.  \nThe drugs, lecanemab and donanemab, are currently being considered by the MHRA, the body which approves drugs in the UK. \nEven if they are granted licences, they would then need to be given the green light by health assessment bodies which consider their cost-effectiveness for the NHS, before being rolled out to patients.  \nDr Sheona Scales, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"We've seen the enormous potential that blood tests are showing for improving the diagnostic process for people and their loved ones in other disease areas.\"\nShe said it was important to see \"the same step-change in dementia\", which is the greatest health challenge facing the UK.\nThe Blood Biomarker Challenge is being funded by Alzheimer's Society, Alzheimer's Research UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Research and Gates Ventures, including \u00a35m from People's Postcode Lottery.",

    "Many migrants risk all to reach South Africa, making a notoriously dangerous journey across the border from Zimbabwe. Having fled poverty and desperation elsewhere in Africa they feel they have no choice. But as elections approach, xenophobic sentiment is on the rise and South Africa's government is under pressure to tighten the border.\nThe men who raped Portie Murevesi did not care that she was visibly pregnant.\nThey attacked her with glass bottles too, she told us, pointing to a large and jagged scar on her forearm. \nNow, her pregnancy almost at full term, she is recovering at a church-run shelter in the South African border town of Musina. \n\"When I try to sleep sometimes, I see what those men did to me,\" she told the BBC.\nMusina is well known as a place of refuge for migrants who, like Ms Murevesi, slip unnoticed over the border.  \nThe migrants who make it have survived a difficult trek through the bush. It is lawless and unforgiving territory. Wild animals and gangs of criminals are a constant threat. \nStories of theft, beatings, rapes and even killings are common. \n\"It is very, very dangerous,\" a Zimbabwean man, who only gave his name as George, told us. \n\"You see skeletons, you see someone already killed two or three months ago,\" he said about his own crossing. \nWe met him as night fell in Musina and groups of men returned to a dingy compound of tin-roofed huts. \nThe lucky ones had found some casual work in town, earning a little cash to send back to their families in neighbouring countries. \nOne explained: \"We can't go back to Zimbabwe because there is nothing there. We're starving. There is no food.\"\nNo-one knows for sure how many undocumented migrants live, under the radar of the authorities, in South Africa, the continent's most advanced economy. \nThe last census found that there were more than 2.4 million foreigners - nearly half of them Zimbabwean - living in the country, accounting for just over 3% of the population.  \nBut there are no official estimates for the number of those who have entered illegally. \nAnd with a general election scheduled for the end of May, illegal immigration has become a highly charged political issue. \nThe South African authorities say they are tightening border security. \nWe saw for ourselves the enormity of the task.\nAlong the road from Musina towards the Limpopo River, which separates South Africa and Zimbabwe, coils of metal glint in the undergrowth. \nIt is the remains of a border fence: flimsy, piecemeal, trampled.\nThe river itself is all but dried up. And there, in the sweltering heat, dozens of people bustle back and forth across an invisible border. \nDonkeys drag carts, laden with goods, across the cracked riverbed. \nWomen, balancing stacks of packages on their heads, hurry alongside. \nThey told us that it takes about five minutes to walk from the nearest Zimbabwean village into South Africa. \nAnd there is nothing - no fence, no guards - to stop them. \nJohn - who asked for his name to be changed to protect his identity - sat on his cart, occasionally twitching a whip at his restless donkeys. Watermelons were piled up on the wagon.  \nHe has a family at home in Zimbabwe, he told us. But there are no jobs there, not enough food. So now he grows the melons and brings them over to sell in South Africa, where they fetch a far higher price.\n\"I do this to survive,\" he says.  \nIt is a thriving, illicit, cross-border marketplace. While the migrants who cross here face a gruelling trek to Musina, most of the goods are shifted back and forth by cart or car. \nOccasionally, John told us, soldiers arrive and make arrests. But there is usually advance warning, he added, and it is easy - albeit risky - to melt into the bush. \nBut the South African government wants to take back control. Last year President Cyril Ramaphosa officially launched a new border force. \nMike Masiapato, the commissioner of the Border Management Authority (BMA), told us he was sending 400 newly trained officers to the border and procuring drones, body cams and motorbikes to improve surveillance. \n\"I can assure you now that the current leadership of the country understands the criticality of this work.\"\nBut even Mr Masiapato acknowledges it will take time to really secure the country's border. \n\"We have started to fortify the environment. Hopefully in [the] next few years we should be able to succeed.\"\nThe country's governing party, the African National Congress (ANC), may not have years. \nAfter three decades in power, the ANC presides over a country in which power and water supplies are failing and whose citizens are plagued by record levels of unemployment and violent crime. \nAs South Africa lurches towards what polls predict will be a bruising election for the ANC, it is perhaps unsurprising that some political opponents - like the anti-migrant party Operation Dudula - openly blame migrants for the country's woes. \nAnd xenophobic rhetoric is rife, with migrants also blamed for taking jobs from locals.\nE",

    "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed into law a bill lowering the military mobilisation age by two years from 27 to 25. \nKyiv and Moscow have both faced heavy losses on the battlefield after two years of war, but Russia has benefited from a sizeable advantage in manpower.\nThe move will allow Ukraine to call up more people to replenish its reserves, after volunteer numbers dropped.\nMr Zelensky said in December 500,000 more soldiers needed to be mobilised.\nBut on Wednesday, he said: \"We don't need half-a-million.\" Last week, Ukraine's top general said the required number of mobilised soldiers had been \"significantly reduced\" following a review of available resources.  \nUkraine's parliament approved the bill in May 2023, but it did not come into force because Mr Zelensky did not sign it. \nIn a separate move, Nato foreign ministers in Brussels were discussing plans for a \u20ac100bn (\u00a386bn) five-year fund to provide long-term military support for Ukraine.\nAsked if the figure was correct, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the framework was yet to be decided but Nato allies agreed that Ukraine needed more money and for many years.\n\"Make no mistake, Ukraine can rely on Nato support now and for the long haul.\"\nRussia was \"pushing\" on the battlefield in Ukraine and trying to win the war by \"waiting us out\", Mr Stoltenberg said.\nIt was not immediately clear what prompted President Zelensky to sign the bill and how many additional soldiers Ukraine could now get, although he has previously warned of plans Russia may have to launch a spring or summer offensive.\nAnd on Wednesday, the Ukrainian leader said Russia was ready to mobilise additional 300,000 troops in June.\nRussia's military has not commented on the claim.\nUkrainian forces had hoped to take back swathes of territory gained by Russia as well as cutting off Russian supply lines to Crimea - Ukraine's southern peninsula illegally annexed by Russia in 2014.\nBut lacking air superiority and faced with formidable Russian defences, Kyiv's counter-offensive ground to a halt at the start of winter and there are fears that Russian forces could outgun Ukraine. \nIn the past few months, Kyiv has been actively building defence fortifications amid steady Russian advances in eastern Ukraine, including the capture of the strategic town of Avdiivka.\nLast year, Ukrainian Gen Oleksandr Tarnavskyi warned troops had already been forced to downsize some military operations because of a drop-off in foreign aid.\nUkraine has relied heavily on Western supplies, particularly on deliveries of long-range missiles and air defence systems. However, billions of pounds of US and EU aid have been held up amid political wrangles.\nIn January 2024, Mr Zelensky said Ukraine's armed forces numbered 880,000, without specifying how many were actually fighting on the more than 1,200km-long (745 miles) frontline in the country's south-east. \nIn February, he said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, but US officials have put the number of Ukrainian soldiers killed as at least 70,000 and as many as 120,000 injured.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said more than 600,000 of his troops are fighting in Ukraine, but has not revealed how many have lost their lives there. \nA classified US intelligence report released in December estimated that 315,000 Russian soldiers had been either killed or wounded since the war began - which it said was almost 90% of Russia's military personnel at the start of the invasion.\nOn Wednesday, Russia's defence ministry said more than 100,000 people had signed up to serve in the country's armed forces since the start of the year.",

    "Late last year, the Spanish government fined 25 Spanish-flagged fishing ships that had been operating near Argentina's territorial waters.\nThe financial penalties were imposed because the vessels had illegally turned off the GPS-based automatic identification systems (AIS), which were transmitting their positions. This is often a sign that a vessel is engaged in illegal fishing.\n\"It's estimated that illegal or unregulated fishing is as much as 20% of what's caught,\" says David Kroodsma, head of the research team at Global Fishing Watch.\nSuch illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing may catch as much as 26 million tonnes of fish every year, or one in every five fish, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. It says that in financial terms this black market is worth up to $23bn (\u00a318bn).\nThis contributes significantly to overfishing, with the UN adding that a third of global fish stocks are now being fished beyond biologically sustainable levels. For example it's estimated that the population of bluefin tuna, is just 2.6% of its historic, unfished size.\n\"Sharks and rays are at the brink of extinction,\" says Mr Kroodsma. \"You have extinction threats to sea birds and turtles from bycatch. It is really sad, because we could manage the oceans so much better.\"\nGlobal Fishing Watch was co-founded by Google, marine conservation body Oceana, and environmental group SkyTruth. The latter studies satellite images to spot environmental damage.\nTo try to better monitor and quantify the problem of overfishing, Global Fishing Watch is now using increasingly sophisticated AI software, and satellite imagery, to globally map the movements of more than 65,000 commercial fishing vessels, both those with - and without - AIS.\nThe AI analyses millions of gigabytes of satellite imagery to detect vessels and offshore infrastructure. It then looks at publicly accessible data from ships' AIS signals, and combines this with radar and optical imagery to identify vessels that fail to broadcast their positions.\nAnd while not all ships are legally required to use AIS, the AI and its \"fishing detection algorithm\" aims to work out which of these \"dark\" vessels are likely to be engaging in fishing.\n\"We use information like the length of the vessel, plus environmental information as to where that vessel is located, the imaging of the area, the density of vessel traffic in the area, the state of the ocean, like the temperature - a bunch of information on where the vessel is operating,\" says Fernando Paolo, Global Fishing Watch's senior remote sensing machine learning engineer. \n\"And this model infers whether the vessel is likely a fishing vessel or not a fishing vessel, like passenger vessels, oil tankers, shipping vessels and that kind of stuff.\"\nThe researchers have found that three quarters of the world's industrial fishing vessels are not publicly tracked, with particular hot spots around Africa and South Asia. \nGlobal Fishing Watch is now working to introduce higher-resolution imagery to help spot more smaller fishing vessels.\nHowever, stamping out illegal fishing means getting data as quickly as possible - and a project from the University of Southampton and local firm RS Aqua is aiming to do just that.\nThe team is building a submarine robot that uses underwater sensors and AI to identify the sound of fishing, and transmit the information in real time. The AI can already differentiate between the natural sounds of the ocean, and is now being trained to identify the noise of trawlers operating in protected waters. \n\"Part of the drive of the project is to try and put something in place that would help monitor fishing activity within marine protected areas [MPAs],\" says University of Southampton professor of statistical signal processing Paul White.\n\"There's a definite concern that by creating these ecosystems with higher densities of fish, those are going to be attractive to fishermen.\"\nRead more stories on artificial intelligence\nCurrently there are around 15,000 MPAs around the globe, which account for 8% of the world's oceans. Yet one study says that less than half are actually \"fully protected\" from fishing.\nMr White says the aim is that if the robot senses fishing, it will automatically contact authorities who can send out a patrol vessel.\nHe adds: \"Exactly what form of AI we're going to use, we've not completely fixed on yet. Part of the problem is that for this to work it has to sit in the ocean for many months. You can't put something out in one week and then have to go back and change the batteries.\n\"It's got to be very power efficient, which means you can't have very complicated algorithms running, but they need to be sufficiently powerful to distinguish something like trawler noise from other sources of noise in the ocean.\"\nPaul Lansbergen, chair of the International Coalition of Fisheries, says that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) \"is a scourge of the industry\".\n\"The sustainability impacts ",
    "The president of Botswana has threatened to send 20,000 elephants to Germany in a dispute over conservation.\nEarlier this year, Germany's environment ministry suggested there should be stricter limits on importing trophies from hunting animals. \nBotswana's President Mokgweetsi Masisi told German media this would only impoverish people in his country. \nHe said elephant numbers had exploded as a result of conservation efforts, and hunting helped keep them in check.\nGermans should \"live together with the animals, in the way you are trying to tell us to\", Mr Masisi told German newspaper Bild. \"This is no joke.\"\nBotswana is home to about a third of the world's elephant population - over 130,000 - more than it has space for.\nHerds were causing damage to property, eating crops and trampling residents, Mr Masisi said.\nBotswana has previously given 8,000 elephants to neighbouring Angola, and has offered hundreds more to Mozambique, as a means of bringing the population down.\n\"We would like to offer such a gift to Germany,\" Mr Masisi said, adding that he would not take no for an answer.\nBotswana's Wildlife Minister Dumezweni Mthimkhulu last month threatened to send 10,000 elephants to London's Hyde Park so British people could \"have a taste of living alongside\" them.\nIn March, UK MPs voted to support a ban on importing hunting trophies, but the legislation has further scrutiny to pass before becoming law.\nA pledge to ban the import of hunting trophies was included in the Conservatives' 2019 general election manifesto.\nBotswana and other southern African countries make a lot of money from rich Westerners who pay thousands of dollars for a permit to shoot an animal and then take its head or skin back home as a trophy.\nThey say this money is used to help conservation efforts, and local people, so they are less likely to be tempted to poach the animals.\nAnimal rights groups argue that the practice is cruel and should be banned.\n\"In some areas, there are more of these beasts than people. They are killing children who get in their path. They trample and eat farmers' crops leaving Africans hungry,\" said Botswana's wildlife minister.\nGermany is the EU's largest importer of African elephant trophies, and hunting trophies overall, according to a 2021 report by the Humane Society International.\nBotswana banned the practice in 2014, but lifted the restrictions in 2019 after facing pressure from local communities.  \nThe country now issues annual hunting quotas, saying that it is licensed and strictly controlled.\nIt has previously considered using elephants for pet food.\nA spokeswoman for the environment ministry in Berlin told the AFP news agency that Botswana had not raised any concerns with Germany on the matter.\n\"In light of the alarming loss of biological diversity, we have a special responsibility to do everything to ensure the import of hunting trophies is sustainable and legal,\" she said.\nThe ministry, however, remained in talks with African countries affected by import rules, including Botswana, the spokeswoman said.\nAustralia, France and Belgium are among countries that have banned the trade in hunting trophies.\nBotswana, along with its neighbours Zimbabwe and Namibia, has also argued that it should be allowed to sell their stockpiles of ivory so it can earn money from its huge numbers of elephants.\nCountries in East Africa, as well as animal rights groups, have opposed this saying it would encourage poaching.",
    "Royal Mail has proposed cutting second-class letter deliveries to every other weekday.\nIt wants to keep its six-day-a-week service for first class letters under the proposals to reform the company.\nIt comes after regulator Ofcom suggested Royal Mail could reduce the number of delivery days from six to as few as three per week for all letters.\nThe firm has struggled as letter volumes have plummeted in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses.\nIts performance has also been poor, with households and businesses complaining about delays on deliveries of important letters detailing medical appointments or legal documents.\nThe company's boss said the suggested plans would give it a \"fighting chance\" to change and keep its \"universal service\". \nRoyal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, is legally obliged to deliver a one-price-goes-anywhere postal service, which means it has to deliver letters six days per week, Monday to Saturday, and parcels Monday to Friday. \nWhile it is planning to cut second-class letter deliveries under its reforms, the company has said parcels - which have become more popular in recent years and are more profitable - would still be delivered seven days a week.\nIt comes as the price of stamps increased on Tuesday, rising by up to 13% for a second class standard letter which now costs 85p to send. The cost of a first class standard letter also went up 8% to \u00a31.35. \nSecond class stamps being priced at 85p mean they are now the same cost as first class one was at the start of 2022.\nRoyal Mail's new proposals, to be considered by Ofcom, include:\nIf the plans are approved by the regulator, it would mean daily delivery routes are cut by between 7,000 to 9,000 within two years, and would likely lead to job cuts.\nRoyal Mail said there would be \"fewer than 1,000\" voluntary redundancies and it expects no compulsory redundancies as part of the proposed overhaul which will target savings of \u00a3300m a year.\nMartin Seidenberg, chief executive of International Distributions Services, Royal Mail's parent company, said that the current universal service was now \"unsustainable\".\nWith letter volumes dropping from a peak of 20 billion a year in 2004 to seven billion a year, Mr Seidenberg suggested it \"will help us on the path to sustainability.\"\nHe also voiced \"serious concerns\" that the situation was not being treated with enough urgency by the regulator. The company has been struggling financially, making a loss of \u00a3419m last year.\nRoyal Mail wants the watchdog to introduce changes by April 2025. It said there would be no need for the government and parliament to change the current legislation which sets out the universal service requirements if its proposals were accepted, due to it wanting to maintain the six-day-a-week service.\nAn Ofcom spokesperson said it had \"laid out some potential options\" so that there could be a \"national discussion\" over the future of the postal service. \"We'll carefully consider all the feedback received, and provide an update in the summer,\" they added.\nIn response to Royal Mail's submission to the regulator on Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Department for Business said that any changes to its operations would \"need to take into account the impacts on business and vulnerable consumers who rely on this vital service\".\nThey said that it would wait for Ofcom's recommendations, although the government has strongly opposed the reduction of a six-day service.\nUnder the regulator's current rules, Royal Mail is required to deliver 93% of first class post within one working day and 98.5% of second class within three working days, but in 2022-23 the company only delivered 73.7% of first class and 90.7% of second class mail on time.\nThe company's poor performance around deliveries led to it being fined \u00a35.6m for missing delivery targets in late 2023. \nThe boss of the UK's Greeting Cards Association, Amanda Fergusson, said reforms put forward by Royal Mail would \"ignore\" the needs of the businesses it represents.\n\"They expect a postal service that's national, reliable, and affordable and they're not getting it,\" she said.\nAnd the policy chair of the Federation of Small Business, Tina McKenzie, said the industry body recognised Royal Mail had to make savings, but added the solution was not to \"torpedo daily deliveries\".\n\"Taking the axe to daily deliveries for second class would be a drastic cut which would hit the many small businesses which rely on it, and will in all probability leave some with no choice but to fork out for first class,\" she said.\nRoyal Mail also wants the regulator to introduce new reliability targets for first class and second class services to give customers more confidence. \nOn Wednesday, the company was also forced to respond to complaints by consumers who have been hit with \u00a35 charges to collect post because the stamps were flagged as counterfeit.\nThe issue has emerged since the service switched to a new barcoded system last ",
    "Seven people have been arrested after a protest at a pork processing facility in Norfolk.\nPolice were called to reports that \"protesters have gained entry\" at Cranswick Country Foods in Brandon Road, Watton, at 06:07 BST.\nThe group said it occupied what it described as a CO2 gas chamber to highlight the \"horrifying reality of UK slaughterhouses\".\nThe company said the incident was \"criminal\".\nOne of the activists, Joey Carbstrong, was arrested and driven from the scene in a police car.\nThe group claimed that six people gained entry to the building, and five activists could be seen outside holding placards.\nMr Carbstrong said in a statement earlier: \"We have occupied the gas chamber at Cranswick today in order to bring attention to the horrifying reality of UK slaughterhouses.\"\nThe British Meat Industry said carbon dioxide is used in abattoirs to stun pigs and induce a loss of consciousness and death prior to being slaughtered. \nThey said the method was widely recognised as being the most \"welfare friendly\". \nThe activists published footage earlier this week that was purportedly filmed from inside the processing plant. Mr Carbstrong and others have also produced a video documentary about pig farming, which was released earlier this year.\nNorfolk Police arrested three men in their 30s, one man in his 20s and another man in his 50s on suspicion of aggravated trespass. \nA woman in her 30s was also arrested for aggravated trespass and a woman in her 20s was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit aggravated trespass. \nAll seven were taken to Wymondham Police Investigation Centre for questioning.\nA company spokesman said: \"There is an ongoing criminal incident taking place at the Cranswick site in Watton, Norfolk, and as such we are unable to comment at this stage.\" \nThe company employs 1,300 people locally. \nAccording to the Cranswick website, the Watton facility produces fresh pork and sausages.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The White House wants US space agency Nasa to develop a new time zone for the Moon - Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC).\nBecause of the different gravitational field strength on the Moon, time moves quicker there relative to Earth - 58.7 microseconds every day.\nThis might not seem like much, but it can have a significant impact when trying to synchronise spacecraft.\nThe US government hopes the new time will help keep national and private efforts to reach the moon co-ordinated.\nProf Catherine Heymans, Scotland's Astronomer Royal, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"This fundamental theory of gravity in our Universe has an important consequence that time runs differently in different places in the Universe. \n\"The gravity on the Moon is slightly weaker and the clocks run differently.\"\nTime is currently measured on Earth by hundreds of atomic clocks stationed around our planet which measure the changing energy state of atoms to record time to the nanosecond. If they were placed on the Moon, over 50 years they would be running one second faster. \n\"An atomic clock on the Moon will tick at a different rate than a clock on Earth,\" said Kevin Coggins, Nasa's top communications and navigation official. \n\"It makes sense that when you go to another body, like the Moon or Mars, that each one gets its own heartbeat,\" he said.\nBut Nasa is not the only one trying to make lunar time a reality. The European Space Agency has also been developing a new time system for a while. There will need to be agreement between countries and a centralised co-ordinating body - currently this is done by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures for time on Earth. \nAt the moment on the International Space Station, Coordinated Universal Time is used because it remains low in orbit. Another element that countries will have to agree on is where the new time frame begins from and to where it extends.\nThe US wants LTC to be ready by 2026 in time for its crewed mission to the Moon. \nArtemis-3 will be the first mission to return to the Moon's surface since Apollo 17 in 1972. It is set to land at the lunar south pole, which is thought to hold vast stores of water-ice in craters that never see sunlight. \nLocating and directing this mission requires extreme precision down to the nanosecond, errors in navigation which could risk spacecraft entering the wrong orbits.\nBut Artemis-3 is also one of numerous planned national missions to the Moon as well as private endeavours. If time is not co-ordinated between them it could lead to challenges in sending data and communication between spacecraft, satellites and Earth.",
    "The number of trees lost in tropical forests in Brazil and Colombia fell dramatically last year because of political action, a new analysis finds.\nResearchers say new leaders have prioritised the environment, with tree losses in the Brazilian Amazon down by a huge 39%.\nHowever, increased tree felling and fires in Bolivia, Laos and Nicaragua wiped out many of these gains. \nGlobal losses were up by a quarter, mainly due to forest fires in Canada.\nThe intense, long-lasting wildfires that burned across Canada drove five times more tree losses in 2023 than in the previous year. \nFires in northern forest areas have a huge impact on the overall global picture of tree cover loss, according to analysts from the University of Maryland's GLAD lab and the World Resources Institute (WRI) who publish annual data on forest felling.\nBut for these researchers, the intentional clearing of mature rainforests in the tropical regions is the most important measure when it comes to climate change. \nIn locations like the Amazon, these primary forests store vast amounts of carbon critical to the world's efforts to limit the rise in global temperatures. \nThese tropical regions have also been the main focus for human-driven deforestation over the past five decades. \nIn 2023, the tropics saw 3.7 million hectares of forest lost - equivalent to 10 football fields per minute, a slight decline on last year.\nThese losses would have been far higher if it wasn't for Brazil and Colombia. \nAccording to this new analysis, political action in both countries has had a significant impact on tree felling.\nPresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva came to power in Brazil last year promising to tackle tree losses and end deforestation by 2030. \nAs a result, there has been a 36% drop in primary forest losses in Brazil in 2023, compared to 2022. \n\"I think what we're seeing in Brazil, for example, is really a case of putting law enforcement back in place that was dismantled during the previous government,\" said Rod Taylor from WRI.\nGiven that Brazil was responsible for 43% of all tropical forest loss in 2022, this reduction is significant.\nWhile the drop has been welcomed, observers say that tree losses still remain higher than they were in the early 2010s. \nNot all the forested regions of Brazil saw reductions. In the Cerrado, which is the  centre of agricultural  production, there was a 6% increase in tree loss. \nColombia also saw a significant decline with primary forest loss down by almost half compared to 2022.\nObservers say the actions of President Gustavo Petro Urrego have played an important role in the fall. \n\"The story of deforestation in Colombia is complex and deeply intertwined with the country's politics, which makes 2023's historic decrease particularly powerful,\"  said Alejandra Laina, from WRI, Colombia. \n\"There is no doubt that recent government action and the commitment of the communities has had a profound impact on Colombia's forests, and we encourage those involved in current peace talks to use this data as a springboard to accelerate further progress.\"\nBut elsewhere the picture on tree loss remains poor. \nBolivia saw a record loss for the third year in a row with numbers up 27% on 2022. Around half of this was down to fires, as hot weather saw fires started by humans spread into forests. \nThere were also notable upticks in Laos and Nicaragua, mainly due to agricultural expansion. \nIndonesia also saw an increase in losses, but the rate remains historically low compared to a decade ago.\nResearchers say the overall picture is decidedly mixed, and they point to the fact that the world has just six years left to keep a promise to halt deforestation, made in 2021 at COP26 in Glasgow.\n\"This report appropriately challenges us to balance despair and hope at the same time,\" said Dr. Andrew Steer, president and CEO of the Bezos Earth Fund.\n\"The alarmingly high rates of global deforestation remind us how badly off track we are in solving the climate and nature crises.\"",
    "Rescue efforts are under way in Taiwan after a 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck the island's eastern coast, killing at least nine and injuring more than 900.\nSome 127 people are trapped in collapsed tunnels and on mountainous roads along the rugged coastline. \nThe epicentre was 18km (11 miles) south of Hualien city, but strong tremors were felt all the way in the capital Taipei, more than 100km away. \nThis is the strongest quake to hit Taiwan in 25 years. \nIt also triggered tsunami alerts earlier in the day in nearby Japanese and Philippine islands which were later retracted. It caused the most damage in Hualien, where buildings fell, roads were blocked and train lines disrupted, leaving the remote region even more cut off from the rest of Taiwan.\n\"I was just getting out of bed when a clothes rack and a low cabinet fell over,\" Ocean Tsai, who lives in Hualien, told BBC Chinese. \"It kept getting stronger, and I started worrying about our belongings at home. Fortunately, apart from the motorcycle tipping over, the damage was minimal.\"\nBut social media was soon filled with extraordinary footage of landslides along the coast. They tumbled down the mountains, making huge clouds billow up from the sea as they crashed into it. \nIt is along this coastline, with its narrow, winding roads and tunnels carved out of the rock, that dozens have become trapped. The route is popular with tourists, famed for its spectacular views from the mountains out across the Pacific Ocean. But it is also known to be treacherous, not least because of the possibility of landslides.\nRescue operations to reach 77 people trapped in the Jinwen and Qingshui tunnels along the road in Hualien were continuing into the night. Pictures show how the road outside the Qingshui tunnel has simply fallen away.\nIt is unclear how long those inside will be trapped - and whether or not they have food and water, or can communicate with the outside world.\nFurther north, Taipei was also shaken violently with footage showing collapsed residential buildings, and people being evacuated from their homes and schools. Local TV stations aired clips of smashed vehicles and stores in disarray. Power cuts and internet outages were reported across the island. \n\"The earthquake is close to land and it's shallow. It's felt all over Taiwan and offshore islands... It's the strongest in 25 years,\" said Wu Chien Fu, the director of Taipei's Seismology Centre. \nTaiwan, home to 23 million people, is largely mountainous in the east, where Hualien sits. It is a sparsely populated area, home to indigenous tribes. For most of its history, the area has been completely cut off from the rest of Taiwan because of its high mountains. \nBut since the 1930s the government has carved roads out of the rockface and built tunnels connecting the area to the rest of the island - it is still, however, considered a difficult place to reach, which will complicate rescue efforts. \nThese are stunning routes that take locals and tourists to the Taroko National Park, named after a landmark gorge, just outside Hualien, which is considered to be one of the natural wonders of Asia. Three of those who died were hikers on a trail there and 50 of those who are trapped are staff who were being transported to a popular hotel, ahead of a four-day long weekend. \nWednesday's earthquake hit at 07:58 local time (23:58 GMT) at a depth of 15.5km and set off at least nine aftershocks at magnitude 4 or larger. \n\"The government must ensure the accuracy of information and provide timely assistance to people in need, so that people can feel at ease and safe,\" President Tsai Ing-wen said. \nTaiwan's foreign office issued a statement on X expressing thanks for the offers of aid from \"allies and friends\" like Japan and Paraguay. \nTaiwan's agency, which engages with China, the Mainland Affairs Council, also thanked China for its concern but said there would be no request for assistance from that side. Beijing claims sovereignty of the self-governed island, which sees itself as distinct from China. \nWhile Taiwan has a history of quakes, both locals and foreigners who have lived in Taipei for years say this is the strongest quake they have experienced in decades. \nThe last major quake - at 7.6-magnitude - hit in September 1999, killing 2,400 people and destroying 5,000 buildings.\nAdditional reporting by Peter Hoskins in Singapore\nAre you affected by the issues raised in this story?

    "A key witness has told a court in Germany he saw videos of the prime suspect in the disappearance of three-year-old Madeleine McCann raping an elderly woman and a young girl.\nThe man, named as Helge B, told the court in Braunschweig that he had picked up the videos when he broke into the Portuguese home of Christian Br\u00fcckner, 47, who was a former friend.\nBr\u00fcckner faces five sex offence allegations.\nThey are unrelated to the McCann case.\nHe has previously denied involvement in the three-year-old's disappearance and has never been charged.  \nBr\u00fcckner is on trial, in the German state of Lower Saxony, for three counts of rape and two of the sexual abuse of children. \nThe offences are all alleged to have taken place between 2000 and 2017 in Portugal, where he lived in the Algarve region on and off for years. \nBr\u00fcckner's lawyers have previously declared the case to be based on \"very shaky foundations\". \nThey have also questioned whether their client can get a fair trial after being publicly linked, by prosecutors, to the disappearance of Madeleine. \nHelge B described meeting Br\u00fcckner in Portugal in 2006 but claimed they did not get along well: \"We just never vibed.\"  \nHe recalled breaking into the suspect's home in Portugal while Br\u00fcckner was in jail, along with another witness identified as Manfred S under German privacy conventions.\nHelge B told judges that they took various things including cameras and videos - \"the biggest mistake of my life\" - and later watched the tapes at his mobile home.  \nHe claimed to have seen an \"old lady\" being raped on a bed and that he had then recognised Br\u00fcckner as the rapist when he removed a mask.\nAnother tape, he claimed, showed the rape of a girl, who told him in German: \"Hey, Christian you know what this is - it's rape.\" \nHelge B is also seen as a potentially key witness should Br\u00fcckner ever be charged in the Madeleine McCann case. \nHe has previously told German tabloid newspaper Bild, that when he discussed the British girl's disappearance with the suspect in 2008, Br\u00fcckner replied she \"didn't scream\". \nIn the past, Br\u00fcckner has referred to his claims as \"not even worthy of comment\". \nIn court on Wednesday, Br\u00fcckner's defence team sought to question Helge B's reliability as a witness.\nUnder cross-examination, the 52-year-old witness admitted to substance abuse between 2000 and 2010.\nWhen asked if he had been paid \u20ac5,000 (\u00a34,300) for the Bild interview, he replied: \"Could be.\"\nMadeleine McCann went missing from her family's Algarve holiday apartment in 2007, in what remains one of the most prominent missing persons cases in the world. \nGerman authorities have classed the three-year-old's disappearance as a murder inquiry, but no charges have been brought. \nThe trial continues.",
    "Rain drips down the glasses of new recruit Toivo Saabas, tracing the contours of the green and black face paint that completes his camouflage. \nLying on the saturated ground, and peering through the sight of his gun, the only frailty that threatens to give away his position is the plume of air he breathes out silently into the icy Estonian forest.  \nThen comes the deafening call to attack. \nThe 25-year-old springs to his feet. Forming a line with his brothers in arms, he bounds through the trees towards the Russian border. \nAs he advances to the clatter of enemy fire, the Southampton University mechanical engineering graduate knows that one day this could all be for real. \n\"We're practising for any threat,\" he says.\n\"We're ready for anything that comes to Estonia and we're ready to defend the country.\"\nToivo, from the capital Tallinn, is among the current crop of young Estonians undergoing their military service - a duty all men over 18 are asked to carry out. For women, it's voluntary.\nAs the Cold War ended, and relations with post-Soviet Russia warmed in the 1990s, conscription appeared consigned to history in many parts of Europe. \nBut not in Estonia, where it would have been impossible for the collective pain of occupation and deportation to have faded away.  \nAnd now, following President Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, conscription is being rebooted and expanded across Europe, with those living on Russia's doorstep urging their Nato allies further afield, including the UK, to follow suit. \nThis week Norway announced it was increasing the number of conscripted soldiers after Denmark said last month it intends to extend conscription to women and increase the duration of service.\nLatvia and Sweden recently restarted military service and Lithuania brought it back after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. \n\"It takes a toll on you,\" says a drenched Toivo, explaining that the training has been the toughest experience of his life. \n\"But in the end, it's service for your country. Being prepared for anything is better than kind of sneaking off and trying to evade this service.\" \nRain has turned to hail and then to snow in a matter of minutes. \nEveryone is soaked to their skin. But as the simulation ends, relief quickly leads to animated conversation and laughter eclipsing the hardship of the previous hours. \n\"It's the conscripts in Ukraine I feel sorry for,\" says Captain Mikk Haabma who is overseeing proceedings.\n\"They are fighting for their lives.\"\nStanding more than 2m tall, the 38-year-old has a natural advantage when it comes to surveying the progress of his new intake. \n\"Our country is based on reserves and these guys are filling the slots all the time. But also, they're getting the skills to get by in life - especially building their confidence. In a few weeks from now, these guys will be ready to fight the enemy.\"\nHe means Russia. \nRussia has never attacked a country within Nato, whose collective defence pact means that an attack on one member constitutes an attack on all. Indeed, the Kremlin ridicules suggestions it might.\nThree Nato countries - the UK, the US and France - each have nuclear weapons, as does Russia, so there would be concerns over the risk of nuclear escalation as a result of such a conflict.\nHowever, if the Russians did attack, I ask, what would they be confronted with? \n\"A massive defeat,\" Captain Haabma replies.\n\"Of course, they have the numbers, but in the end on a strategic level we have Nato and the technical superiority.\"\nThe transatlantic military alliance - now a club of 32 including new members Finland and Sweden - is celebrating its 75th anniversary this week.\nSo what is the overwhelming feeling in Estonia today? \nA sense of security being part of an enlarged alliance? Or fear about what Vladimir Putin may do next?\n\"I think it's both,\" replies Kaja Kallas in her prime ministerial office in Tallinn. \nFor her, Nato allies keeping their promise to spend 2% of GDP on defence is what's crucial.   \n\"In 1938, it was clear that the war was coming so the defence expenditure was increased by 100% but it was already too late.\"\nShe continues, \"This is what we have to do now in order to preserve our way of living, in order to preserve peace in Europe.\"\nHowever, in 2024, fewer than two thirds of Nato members are on course to reach their 2% funding goal, a shortfall that perpetually irked US President Donald Trump during his time in the White House. \nMs Kallas, who's led Estonia since 2021, sees conscription as another integral part of both providing a deterrence to Russia but also stronger defence if it does attack. \n\"We have a reserve army of 44,000 people that would equal, for Great Britain, around two million people. Two million people who are ready to defend their country and know what they have to do.\"\nAfter she mentions Britain unprompted, I ask whether she would in fact recommend conscription to the UK.\n\"Of course, every country decides for themselves, we are all democracie",
    "The government has revealed how much companies will have to pay to import foods from the EU due to Brexit.\nSmall imports of products such as fish, salami, sausage, cheese and yoghurt will be subject to fees of up to \u00a3145 from 30 April, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).\nThe Cold Chain Federation said the new charges would hit food prices.\nThe government said the fees would pay for \"world-class border facilities\".\nThe fee, known as the \"common user charge\", will apply to animal products, plants and plant products entering the UK from the EU through the Port of Dover and the Eurotunnel at Folkestone.\nIt will be charged per type of good imported - the \"commodity line\" - and capped at \u00a3145 for mixed consignments. Individual products will face charges of up to \u00a329. It will apply to goods deemed low, medium and high risk. \nThe Cold Chain Federation's chief executive Phil Pluck said the fee would have to be passed on to \"either the EU importer, the smaller UK retailer, or the UK consumer\".\n\"Ultimately, this will increase business costs and food prices and potentially lower choices for the shopper,\" he said.\nHe added that the government had \"announced the charges at the last minute, leaving affected businesses little time to revise their commercial arrangements\".\nThe fee has been introduced to pay for border inspections and fund new facilities in Kent to protect biosecurity - preventing the import of plant and animal disease.\nBut the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) said the policy felt like it was \"constructed on the back of an envelope at best\" and would \"undoubtedly increase costs, potentially reduce consumer choice, and increase the likelihood of empty shelves\".\n\"Our sector typically has multiple commodity lines per consignment, meaning, in reality, businesses in our sector will be paying the \u00a3145 maximum charge,\" said James Barnes, the HTA chairman.\nHorticultural consignments can include plants, seeds, bulbs and cut flowers, he said.\nThe government has delayed implementing the changes five times, partly to give business time to prepare and to reduce disruption to supply chains. \nThe new border checks will be phased in gradually over the next 12 months but physical checks have been flagged as starting on 30 April for some time. However, the cost associated with those checks had not been revealed until now. \nPrior to Brexit, trade between the EU and the UK was free flowing and frictionless.\nBut following the UK's departure from the trading bloc, this changed as a result of the relatively distant approach to EU relations adopted by the UK government.\nLabour said British shoppers and businesses were \"rightly worried about prices being driven up again\" and that it had warned about the \"potential for chaos\" from new border checks. \nShadow minister Nick Thomas-Symonds said: \"With less than a month before their introduction, we now know what the costs will be.\n\"Labour has a plan to reduce costly bureaucracy, through seeking to negotiate a veterinary agreement with the EU to massively reduce the need for checks, helping make food cheaper and our businesses more competitive.\"\nIn a statement the government said the flat-rate charge was at the \"bottom end of the range which we consulted with industry on\".   \nIt said the charge was designed to \"recover the costs of operating our world-class border facilities where essential biosecurity checks will protect our food supply, farmers and environment against costly disease outbreaks entering the UK through the short straits\".  \nA spokesperson said: \"The charges follow extensive consultation with industry and a cap has been set specifically to help smaller businesses. We are committed to supporting businesses of all sizes and across all sectors as they adapt to new border checks and maintaining the smooth flow of imported goods.\" ",
    "The killing in Gaza of seven aid workers, including three British nationals, in an Israeli air strike is on many of Wednesday's front pages. The Mirror's headline is: \"Killed trying to feed starving kids\". The Daily Mail says two of the British victims, James Henderson and John Chapman, were former Royal Marines, and the other, James Kirby, was a former soldier. The Sun focuses on Mr Chapman, describing him as a \"Special Boat Service hero\".\nThe Guardian has a photo of the burned-out interior of one of the vehicles caught in the attack. It believes the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip \"seems likely to worsen\" in the wake of what happened. It says many aid organisations have already suspended their operations in the territory. The i says the UK is demanding answers from Israel. The headline in The Times is simply: \"Outcry at aid worker deaths\", while for the Daily Express it is: \"Three Britons killed on Gaza mercy mission\".\nAccording to the Daily Telegraph, the Foreign Office has been considering for weeks whether Israel is failing to demonstrate a commitment to international law, and whether it should therefore stop selling arms to the country. The paper says there are emerging calls that - if legal advice finds Israel is falling short of that requirement - intelligence sharing should be scaled back.\nAn investigation by Royal Mail into reports that new barcoded postage stamps are wrongly showing as counterfeit also makes the front page of the Telegraph. It says customers have complained about being forced to pay \u00a35 penalties to collect their post, despite the stamps being bought directly from Royal Mail.\nThe Times reports that the number of police-enforced drug tests has risen tenfold in the past two years. The paper says figures due out later are expected to show 100,000 tests were carried out by officers, in the final three months of 2024. It says Home Office data reveals the majority of tests come back positive, and cocaine is found in nine of 10 of them. The paper says ministers are planning to expand police powers to broaden testing further.\nThe Financial Timesleads with a slump in electric car sales in the first three months of this year. The paper says the performance of the world's two leading producers of electric cars, Tesla, and its Chinese rival BYD, have added to concerns about the slowing uptake of the technology. \nFinally, many of the papers feature pictures of the 18-carat gold toilet stolen from Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire in 2019. James Sheen, from Wellingborough in Northamptonshire, has pleaded guilty to stealing the loo which is worth \u00a34.8m.

    "A historian is trying to solve the puzzle of what happened to an African emperor's garments that were stolen 156 years ago - and believes they may have found their way to Manchester.\nEmperor Tewodros II had his prized coat and scarf ripped from his body during a British invasion of Ethiopia in 1868. \nAndrew Heavens is urging people to check their attics as he believes parts of the items may be lost in the city. \nHe said finding any relic of the emperor would be \"a huge deal\".\nEthiopia is appealing for the return of any artefacts taken during the battle \"in the same way Greece wants the Elgin Marbles back\", Mr Heavens said.\nBritain's invasion saw soldiers charging into the east African mountain kingdom of Abyssinia - now known as Ethiopia - in a bid to free European captives.\nDefeating the emperor, who took his own life amid the destruction, the British then fled, taking with them various treasures including gold crowns, illuminated manuscripts and sacred carvings.\nThey also ripped up the emperor's scarf and coat, and cut off locks of his hair for souvenirs.\nMr Heavens, who has written a book on the subject, The Prince and the Plunder, said \"bits and pieces\" from the battle have been turning up ever since, with the National Army Museum returning a lock of the emperor's hair to Ethiopia in 2019.\nA small piece of his silk scarf was also presented to Stamford Park Museum in Stalybridge - just outside Manchester.\nMr Heavens now believes part of the scarf or coat may have been taken to somebody's home after the museum was demolished in the 1950s.\nBits of the collection survived and were distributed to other local museums - but Mr Heavens' efforts to find evidence of the clothes have so far turned up a blank.\n\"[The scarf] may have been lost or destroyed,\" he said.\n\"But I thought there was just a chance someone took it home when the museum closed, particularly if it was in a nice display case.\"\nHowever, Stalybridge Library and Tameside Metropolitan Borough Museum said they do not have the clothes in their collection.\nThe historian has since sent requests to Tameside Local Studies and Archives Centre and Manchester Museum.\nAccording to the National Army Museum, Emperor Tewodros had established his rule since 1855 through war but also continued to face many internal rebellions as he tried to remain in power.\nIn 1862 he asked the British government for an alliance and assistance in acquiring the latest weapons and tactical experts to help him - but his request went unanswered.\nAs a result he seized a number of European hostages, among them was the British Consul, Captain Charles Cameron, who was kept in chains for over two years. \nIt created a public outcry that forced the government into a response - resulting in the invasion and subsequent looting.\nHistorians say 15 elephants and 200 mules were needed to cart away all the stolen treasure from Maqdala, the emperor's northern citadel capital.\nEthiopia lodged a formal request in 2008 at various British institutions for the return of the items. \nWhy not follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X and Instagram?

Just 31% of votes cast supported Mr Peltz for a seat, according to a source familiar with the results. \nBut the hard-fought battle raised pointed questions about struggles at Disney's film and television business, and cast a shadow over the legacy of long-time leader Bob Iger. \n\"All we want is for Disney to get back to making great content and delighting consumers and for Disney to create sustainable long-term value for shareholders,\" Mr Peltz said at the shareholder meeting on Wednesday.\nMr Peltz is known for his fights with big companies such as fast food chain Wendy's and Procter & Gamble, maker of brands such as Pampers and Vick's.\nHe had criticised Disney for responding too slowly as pay television subscribers started to flee in 2015 and said big gambles, such as Mr Iger's decision to buy a hefty chunk of Rupert Murdoch's media empire in 2019, had not paid off.\nTrian and another firm, Blackwells Capital, said the board had overpaid executives and bungled its responsibility to pick a new chief executive. \nThey also called for a review of Disney's studio operations, noting a streak of films that have disappointed at the box office.\nThe debate coincided with pressure Disney has been under from right-wing activists, who have accused the firm of \"going woke\".\nConcern about how Disney is handling culture wars issues prompted several questions from shareholders at Wednesday's meeting, where separate shareholder proposals focused on Disney's political and charitable donations and its policies for trans employees were also defeated.\nDisney had urged shareholders to vote against those proposals and to back the current board. It said new faces threatened to disrupt progress that the company has been making. \n\"As we gather today, we stand on a far more solid foundation,\" Mr Iger said in remarks at the meeting after the results were announced. \"We have turned the corner and entered a new positive era for the Walt Disney company.\"\nMr Iger had retired as chief executive in 2020, but Disney's board abruptly re-installed him as boss in 2022, ousting his successor amid complaints about the company's streaming business and other issues. \nSoon after his return Mr Iger announced a reorganisation and thousands of job cuts in a bid to improve the company's profits. He is now planning to step aside at the end of 2026.\n\"With the distracting proxy contest now behind us, we're eager to focus 100% of our attention on our most important priorities: growth and value creation for our shareholders and creative excellence for our consumers,\" Mr Iger said in a statement after the victory.\nThe investor battle was costly for both sides.\nTrian estimated it would spend $25m million trying to win over shareholders, blitzing social media platforms with adverts aimed at everyday investors, while Disney claimed a spend of up to $40m. \nMr Iger won out - gaining support from major shareholders including Star Wars creator George Lucas, the widow of Steve Jobs, Laurene Powell Jobs, and members of the Disney family.\nIn a statement after the result Mr Peltz, whose efforts won a last-minute nod from Elon Musk, said he was disappointed by the outcome but \"proud\" of his campaign's impact.

    "The Attorney General has warned of potential offences from social media posts discussing the court case facing Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.\nThe former DUP leader was charged with rape and other historical sexual offences last Thursday.\nHe insists he will be strenuously contesting the charges.\nDame Brenda King has now issued a statement about potential contempt of court issues and victims' right to anonymity.\nThe police previously stated speculation about the case may affect the judicial process.\nThe Ulster Unionist Party leader, Doug Beattie, said there should be a crackdown on potential offenders.\nSpeaking on BBC NI's The Nolan Show, he said the police needed to \"make an example\" of people.\n\"I certainly think they should be doing more than putting out a statement. \n\"They need to cut this and they need to cut this pretty quickly.\"\nRetired police officer Jon Burrows told the programme the police should be more robust in their language and action. \n\"The speculation online has been absolutely dreadful.\"\nAlong with a 57-year-old woman who faces related charges, the former DUP leader is due to appear at Newry Magistrates' Court later this month.\nThe Attorney General's statement, which did not directly reference the case, said: \"The Attorney advises the public as well as media outlets to think about potential consequences before publishing, posting or sharing commentary, online or otherwise.\n\"The Attorney would remind the public and the media of the risk of any person publishing, posting or sharing material being found to be in contempt of court.\"\nContempt of court issues are when someone risks unfairly influencing a case and jeopardise someone receiving a fair trial.\nOffenders can be fined or sentenced to a period of imprisonment.\nDame Brenda's statement also pointed out: \"The PSNI has already highlighted the separate statutory requirements to protect the anonymity of any person against whom certain sexual offences, including rape, are alleged to have been committed. \n\"The relevant legislation is the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992.\"",
    "A new group has been set up to support young crofters across the Western Isles and encourage more people into the industry.\nCrofting is a system of land tenure and farming unique to Scotland, and has had its own legislation for almost 140 years.\nAbout 33,000 people live on crofts across the Hebrides, Highlands, Argyll and Northern Isles.\nMore than 200 people turned out for the launch of the new Western Isles Young Crofters.\nThe group aims to create a network of contacts for people involved in crofting along the 160-mile (257km) length of the Outer Hebrides.\nWestern Isles Young Crofters was launched at an event in a Stornoway auction mart and the group already has its own line in merchandise, including T-shirts and hats.\nSarah Campbell, 24, has been involved in crofting since she was a child.\nShe would spend her Easter school holidays helping her father and grandfather lambing ewes on the tiny island of Pabbay.\nMs Campbell continues to work on a croft in south Harris, while also working as a nurse.\nShe said: \"Crofting is something I was brought up doing and really enjoy.\n\"It's just good to get out into the fresh air and work with the sheep.\"\nMs Campbell has welcomed the setting up of Western Isles Young Crofters.\nShe said: \"It is a great opportunity for us to have a support network.\n\"It lets you know you are not the only one doing it or having difficulties.\"\nMs Campbell said in recent years crofting had seen a decline in livestock numbers, and also older generations having to bear the responsibilities for keeping the industry going.\nBut she said the launch event had shown there were young people interested in crofting.\n\"It is important to keep that alive and create opportunities for people to get into it and support people to keep it going,\" she added.\nFiona Maciver, 29, crofts in the Lochs area of Lewis, and works full-time as a supervisor in the care sector.\nShe has also been involved in crofting since a young age.\n\"A lot more younger people are taking an interest and I think there are number of reasons for that,\" she said.\n\"I think it is a bit of novelty now while years ago it was an expectation for people to take over the family croft and working them.\n\"Social media also has a lot to do with it. \n\"There are a lot of influencers out there who are farming or crofting. It is good to see how other people are crofting and farming.\"\nShe said increasing interest in food security - access to sufficient nutritious food - was another factor.\nMs Maciver said crofting was hard work and it could be tricky at times balancing busy times, such as the lambing season, with her full-time job.\nThe launch was supported by Lewis and Harris Sheep Producers Association and attended by members of the Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs.\nOne of the organisers, Ally Williamson, said: \u201cIn the last few years we have seen more and more young people attending sales, shows and events. \n\"There is obviously a growing interest in crofting but there is no dedicated organisation for them to get involved in. \n\"This event was about exploring demand for setting up such a group and the turnout has certainly shown that demand is there.\"\nAyrshire sheep shearer and BBC Landward presenter Cammy Wilson, who also took part, said: \u201cThis is the third time I\u2019ve been to the Western Isles and one of the things I think is really special about the place is the sense of community, that was certainly on display at the launch event.\"",
    "The share price of Donald Trump's media company has fallen from last week's high when it officially listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange.  \nBut it is still worth more than $7bn (\u00a35.6bn) at current prices - an astonishing sum given the business behind it. \nSo what is the Truth Social platform, who owns it, how many users does it have, and how much money does it make? And is it the answer to Mr Trump's spiralling legal bills?\nTrump Media & Technology Group was founded in 2021 after Mr Trump lost the presidential election and was temporarily booted from major social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, which accused him of inciting violence. \nThe idea was pitched to him by two men, former contestants on his reality TV show, The Apprentice, who saw an opportunity to create an alternative to the mainstream social media sites.\nIn 2022 Trump Media launched its first - and to date only - product for the public: the social media platform Truth Social.\nMuch of Truth Social's functionality is identical to X. Users are able to post 'truths' or 'retruths' as well as send direct messages. Adverts, meanwhile, are called 'sponsored truths'.\nTrump Media claims about 9m Truth Social accounts have been created since its start.\nIt does not disclose how many users it has, but research firm SimilarWeb estimates that Truth Social had 5m monthly website visits in February this year. \nBy comparison, TikTok received more than 2bn visits, while Facebook had more than 3bn. X had 104m visits in February, SimilarWeb reported.\nMr Trump has roughly 7m followers on Truth Social, far fewer than the 87m he has on X. The former president's X account was reinstated towards the end of 2022, but he has only posted once since then.\nIt doesn't.  \nTrump Media lost nearly $60m in 2023, while bringing in only about $4m in revenue from advertising, according to its latest financial update, which also warned of \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to continue as a business. \nThe report was another reminder of the considerable disconnect between the finances of the company and its stock price, which puts its value at around $7bn.\nAs a gauge, in 2013, when Twitter listed on the stock market, it reported $660m in revenue and had a market value of roughly $24bn. \nBy 2021, the year before Elon Musk bought Twitter for $44bn, that figure had grown to more than $5bn.\nMr Trump's relationship with the firm is a bit like the licensing deals that he used in his property empire, in which he signed over his name for the promotion of a business run primarily by others. \nIn this case, Mr Trump has also agreed to post non-political messages first on Truth Social.\nThe other difference is that this deal did not yield a stream of automatic licensing fees - instead, Mr Trump was paid by being given shares in the new start-up.\nTrump Media, which is led by former Republican congressman Devin Nunes, was originally a private company, and Mr Trump owned 90% of it.\nIt went public in March 2024 via what is known as a SPAC - basically, it was acquired by a company whose shares were already trading publicly on the stock market, in this case, Digital World Acquisition Corp.\nMr Trump now owns about 57% of shares in the combined firm, which was renamed Trump Media and trades under the DJT ticker - Mr Trump's initials.\nThe next biggest owner of TMTG is the Kuwaiti-headquartered investment firm ARC Global Investments, which has a 6.9% stake, according to Trump Media filings with financial regulators. \nThe former Apprentice contestants also have a sizable stakes, though those holdings are currently subject to legal fights. \nThe two men - Wes Moss and Andy Litinsky - filed a suit against Mr Trump claiming he was trying to cheat them out of their shares. He sued them back, arguing that their mismanagement of the social media site should cost them their stakes in the company. \nOverall, insiders own about 70% of the stock. \nWhen Trump Media announced its plans to go public in 2021, the news prompted small-time investors to snap up shares of Digital World, helping to pump up its price and drawing comparisons to pandemic-era meme stocks. \nAt the end of 2023, big financial firms owned only about 5% of Digital World stock, far less than is typical, implying everyday investors had the bulk of the rest. \nWith the merger complete, those individuals now also own a significant chunk of Trump Media, though just how much is not known exactly. \nConversations in online forums suggest at least some of those shareholders see their stock purchase as a bet on Mr Trump and a way to support him as his legal troubles, and the bills that accompany them, pile up. \nMr Trump has been ordered to pay more than $350m in damages in a civil fraud case, with interest charges potentially adding another $100m.\nAfter the merger was completed, Mr Trump saw his net worth more than double to over $5bn overnight, according to Forbes.\nMr Trump is barred from selling his roughly 78m shares for about six months, unless",
    "A grieving son has been told his mother's ashes were found in a \"brown paper bag\" by police investigating a Hull funeral directors.\nGary Dean's family used Legacy Independent Funeral Directors for his mother Joan's funeral in December 2022.\nThey were later given urns containing what they thought were her ashes.\nIn March, 35 bodies and a quantity of ashes were removed from the firm by police following \"concern for care of the deceased\". \nMr Dean, 62, from Hull, who has a brother and two sisters, said: \"It's a horror show - devastating for us as a family. \n\"We thought we each had an urn containing our mum's ashes.\"\nDescribed by her children as an \"amazing mum\", Mrs Dean died from lung cancer on 19 November 2022, aged 82.\nHer funeral, arranged through Legacy Independent Funeral Directors, was held at Haltemprice Crematorium in Willerby, East Yorkshire.\nMr Dean said the family bought four urns - one for each of Mrs Dean's children - online before passing them to Legacy to fill with the ashes.\nOn 30 June last year, the family collected the urns from the firm's branch in Hessle Road, Hull.\n\"I had our mum's urn on the floor next to the sofa,\" said Mr Dean. \"We didn't received a cremation certificate, but at the time we didn't think anything of it.\" \nAfter concerns were first raised over the funeral firm, Mr Dean contacted a helpline set up by Humberside Police.\nOn Sunday, the family were given the news they dreaded.\nMr Dean said: \"Police rang me to say, 'We have your mum's ashes, still in a sealed brown paper bag.' It had our mum's name on it.\"\nOn Monday, he received another call from the police, who advised him what his family needed to do with the ashes they were originally given.\n\"I was told to contact the crematorium, which I did, [but] a manager said they could not accept the ashes because nobody knows who they belong to,\" Mr Dean said.\nHe said he was told by police he and his siblings must wait to receive their mother's ashes due to the investigation.     \nIn a statement, Humberside Police said: \"Given the complexities and scale of the investigation and the number of people affected, we are not in a position to comment on individual circumstances.\n\"However, we are continuing to explore numerous lines of inquiry, and where people have been identified as victims we will be supporting them.\"\nThe BBC has also approached East Riding of Yorkshire Council and Legacy Independent Funeral Directors for comment.\nA 46-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman, who were arrested on suspicion of prevention of a lawful and decent burial, fraud by false representation and fraud by abuse of position, remain on police bail.  \nVictim Support has set up a helpline for anyone affected by the investigation.

    "Video released by US police shows the moment officers shot and killed a girl who they were attempting to rescue. \nIt was believed that Savannah Graziano had been kidnapped by her father - who was suspected of killing her mother.\nThe two were fatally shot in the 2022 incident. The video shows Savannah, 15, was hit while obeying officers' orders after a car chase and gun battle.\nPolice said they hope the video gives \"insight into the unfortunate events\", as an investigation continues. \nThe narrated footage provided by police includes video clips and audio from a police helicopter. It states that Savannah and her father, Anthony Graziano, were struck \"by deputy rounds and died of their injuries\". \nOfficials had not previously clarified whether Savannah had been fatally shot by officers or by her own 45-year-old father.\nThe footage, which also comprises witness dashcam clips, provides additional details of officers' long pursuit of a pickup truck driven by Graziano. Savannah was seated on the passenger side of the truck. \nSavannah had been living with her father in his truck and in hotels in the weeks prior to the episode, according to the Associated Press, with no allegations of wrongdoing by Graziano.\nHowever, officials put out an Amber Alert - a message warning the US public of a child abduction - for Savannah when her mother was shot dead the day before the chase unfolded on 27 September 2022. \nThe helicopter footage of the episode shows Graziano's truck speeding down a freeway. Narration added to the clips says shots were fired at officers from both sides of the vehicle. The alleged shooter is unclear.\nThe miles-long chase ends with Graziano surrounded by police cars at the side of the freeway near Hesperia, California. An \"extensive exchange of gunfire\" then broke out, according to the video narration.\nSavannah can be seen emerging from the vehicle. Audio from the belt recorder of the officer on the ground captures him telling her to come over, and she obeys.\nThe narration states that Savannah was wearing \"tactical gear and a helmet\", though this level of detail is not visible in the footage provided.\nA shot is fired, and audio from the helicopter captures an officer saying: \"Oh no.\" The officer on the ground tells colleagues to \"stop shooting her\" and that \"he's in the car\", referring to Graziano.\nFurther shots are heard. The narration says the officer continues to tell his colleagues to stop, \"but it was too late\".\nThe teenager was pronounced dead at hospital after attempts to give her medical aid. She was unarmed when she was shot.\nHer father, who was also fatally hit, was declared dead at the scene, according to the narration. It adds that multiple weapons and body armour were found in his vehicle. \nThe incident remains under an independent investigation by California's Department of Justice. The names of the officers involved in the incident have not been released.  \nSan Bernardino Sheriff Shannon Dicus said the footage had been released in the interests of transparency.\n\"My hope is that this video will be watched in its entirety and provide insight into the unfortunate events that unfolded that day,\" he said in a statement.\nSheriff Dicus said there had been \"speculation and misrepresentation\" of the case. He asked that the public wait to pass judgment until the state had finished its investigation. \nThe incident has again raised questions about the use of force by American police and of Mr Dicus's police department. \nHis officers faced criticism for last month's fatal shooting of an autistic 15-year-old boy, Ryan Gainer, who was having a mental health episode.",
    "Google, the search engine used by more than a billion people around the world, is reported to be considering charging for premium content generated by artificial intelligence (AI). \nThe company, owned by Alphabet Inc, is said to be revamping its business model and looking at putting some of its core product behind a paywall. \nIt would be the first time Google had charged for any of its content. \nGoogle said it did not have anything to announce \"right now\".\nAccording to the Financial Times (FT) it is said to be looking at whether to add certain AI-powered search features to its premium subscription services which already offer access to its new AI assistant called Gemini, Google's version of the viral chatbot ChatGPT. \nExecutives have reportedly not yet made a decision when or whether to move ahead with the technology but the FT said engineers were developing the know-how needed to deploy the service.\nGoogle's traditional search engine would remain free of charge but would continue to appear with ads alongside searched-for content, which subscribers would also see, the FT said. \nGoogle has faced challenges coming to grips with the AI revolution - earlier this year Gemini, which can answer questions in text form but also generate pictures in response to text prompts, stoked controversy after it mistakenly created an image of the US Founding Fathers including a black man.\nIt also generated German soldiers from World War Two, incorrectly featuring a black man and an Asian woman.\nGoogle apologised and immediately \"paused\" the tool, saying it was \"missing the mark\". \nHowever, the company is still number one for the majority of internet users when it comes to searching for information. \nAccording to the global market research company Statista, Google has dominated the desktop search engine market since 2015 with a solid 80%+ of internet users. Various websites suggest it has more than a billion daily users. \nThe majority of Google's revenues are generated through advertising. Its parent company, Alphabet, is one of the biggest internet companies worldwide with a 2023 valuation of $1.6tn (\u00a31.26tn), according to Statista.\nBut it has diversified and now offers mail, productivity tools, enterprise products and mobile devices, among other ventures, and in 2023 it earned revenues of approximately $305.6bn (\u00a3241bn)\nIn a statement issued to the BBC, Google said it was \"not working on or considering an ad-free search experience\". \n\"As we've done many times before, we'll continue to build new premium capabilities and services to enhance our subscription offerings across Google,\" the search giant said. \"We don't have anything to announce right now.\"",
    "World Central Kitchen (WCK) founder Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s has accused Israeli forces in Gaza of targeting his aid workers \"systematically, car by car\".\nMonday's strike which killed seven members of his staff was not a mistake, he said, repeating that Israeli forces had been told of their movements.\nWCK workers from Australia, Canada, Poland, the UK and the US were killed as well as their Palestinian colleague.\nIsrael says the strike was a \"grave mistake\" and has apologised.\nIt has also promised an independent investigation. \nAccording to the charity, the aid convoy was hit while leaving the Deir al-Balah warehouse, \"where the team had unloaded more than 100 tonnes of humanitarian food aid brought to Gaza on the maritime route\".\nThe convoy was made up of three vehicles, including two that were armoured, which clearly displayed the charity's logo. All three were hit during the strike.\nSpeaking to Reuters news agency on Wednesday, the Spanish-American celebrity chef said this was not a \"bad luck situation where, 'oops,' we dropped the bomb in the wrong place\". \nIn a separate interview with Israel's Channel 12 news, Mr Andr\u00e9s said \"it was really a direct attack on clearly marked vehicles whose movements were known by everybody at the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]\".\nThe bodies of six of the dead WCK workers have since been taken from Gaza into Egypt to be repatriated. \nTheir Palestinian colleague was buried in his hometown in Rafah, southern Gaza, on Tuesday.\nHumanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip is in doubt after WCK - a key provider of aid to the territory - suspended operations.\nThe UN announced it was pausing movements at night for at least 48 hours to evaluate the security situation.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described the strike as unintentional.\n\"It happens in war, we check it to the end, we are in contact with the governments, and we will do everything so that this thing does not happen again,\" Mr Netanyahu said on Tuesday.\nIDF Chief of General Staff Herzi Halevi called the incident a \"grave mistake\" and said \"it shouldn't have happened,\" blaming the strike on misidentification.\nUS President Joe Biden has condemned the strike, accusing Israel of not doing enough to protect aid workers.\n\"The United States has repeatedly urged Israel to deconflict their military operations against Hamas with humanitarian operations, in order to avoid civilian casualties,\" Mr Biden said.\nThree of the killed aid workers were British nationals. A Polish national, an Australian, a Palestinian and a dual US-Canadian citizen were also killed.\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke to Mr Netanyahu on Tuesday. On the call, he described the situation in Gaza as \"increasingly intolerable\" and \"demanded a thorough and transparent independent investigation\" into the killing of the aid workers.\nMr Sunak added that Israel needed to end restrictions on humanitarian aid and protect civilians, according to a Downing Street statement.\nIn other reaction:\nFour days ago, WCK said that it had distributed 42 million meals in the Gaza Strip - dispatching more than 1,700 food trucks and also sending close to 435,000 meals by sea.\nAccording to Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body in charge of civilian policy in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, WCK is responsible for 60% of the non-governmental aid getting into the territory.\nA second charity, the American Near East Refugee Aid (Anera), which was working closely with WCK, told the BBC it was also freezing its operations in Gaza.\nMore than 196 aid workers have been killed in Gaza since October, according to the US-funded Aid Worker Security Database, which records major incidents of violence against aid personnel. Not all have been killed in the line of duty.\nMuch of the Gaza Strip has been devastated during the Israeli military operations that began after Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages.\nAbout 130 of the hostages remain in captivity, at least 34 of whom are presumed dead.\nMore than 32,916 people have been killed in Gaza since then, the Hamas-run health ministry says.",
    "A Ukrainian mother living in Wiltshire says she returned to her war-torn country because she could not access NHS dental care.\nNatalia Negreba has recently had root canal work done in the city of Dnipro.\nThe 36-year-old said she was in \"excruciating\" pain, but could not find NHS dental care or afford to pay for private treatment.\nThe care board that covers Wiltshire said it had laid on \"additional urgent dental care appointments\" since 2021.\nDnipro, which is fewer than 100km (62 miles) from the front line, was on the receiving end of a devastating wave of attacks by Russian forces in December.\nThe Ukrainian air force said it had \"never seen so many locations targeted simultaneously\" after Russia launched 158 drones and missiles.\nDespite the danger the city has faced since Russian forces invaded Ukraine in 2022, Mrs Negriba says she returned with her three-year-old daughter Agnia in July 2023 because she was in so much pain.\n\"I started looking for a dentist but I didn't find any [NHS clinics]. It was very terrible because I took paracetamol and ibuprofen every day. My pain didn't go away,\" she said.\n\"My friend helped me make an appointment at a private clinic in Corsham but it would have cost \u00a3800 - which was too much for me, it's very expensive.\n\"Dnipro is very dangerous, and I was very worried when I went [back], but my pain was very strong. I could not stay here.\"\nMrs Negriba, who moved to Corsham at the start of the war, told the BBC she would often hear air raid alarms when she was in Dnipro, where her treatment cost about \u00a3150 for a root canal procedure and an implant.\nShe said she also has a friend from Chippenham who had also travelled to Dnipro for dental care.\nMrs Negriba added: \"I had a very long wait, too much. I didn't find an NHS dentist.\n\"If I have a new problem with my tooth, I will fly to Ukraine to have it fixed again.\" \nLiz Taylor, from Chippenham, runs Bybrook Homes for Ukraine, which supports about 50 Ukrainian refugees living in Wiltshire.\nShe said other patients have revisited their mother country to get dental care, with some of them having \"severe dental problems\".\n\"We've either had to pay ourselves for them to receive treatment, or they have gone back to Ukraine - much to our horror - and to some of the really dangerous parts of Ukraine in the east, near the Russian border, because of toothache,\" said Mrs Taylor.\nShe added that she was also supporting another woman who was considering going back to Kharkiv, which is right next to the front line and a place Mrs Taylor considers even more dangerous than Dnipro.\nKateryna Lagun, Mrs Negriba's dentist in Dnipro, said she had treated several Ukrainians who had travelled from the UK.\n\"We have a lot of people coming from outside of Ukraine to get their treatment,\" she said.\n\"Dnipro is quite dangerous because we have a lot of air attacks at night, and up to 15 air raid warnings a day.\n\"I live really close to the [bombed] factory here and several times I thought it was the end because it [the bombing] was really close to us.\n\"I guess they do not have much choice in the UK. I heard you have this situation with NHS dentistry and even UK citizens cannot get the proper treatment.\" \nA spokesperson for the Bath and North East Somerset, Swindon and Wiltshire Integrated Care Board said it would not comment on individual cases but that in this case Mrs Negriba may meet the criteria for \"an urgent dental or a stabilisation appointment\".\n\"Since September 2021 we have commissioned additional urgent dental care appointments that people can access by calling NHS111 with an urgent dental need,\" they added.\n\"There are 390 appointments every week across the South West, with 86 urgent dental appointments in Wiltshire each week.\"\nThe board said there were also 750 stabilisation appointments across the South West, which were for people who had a serious but not urgent dental issue.\nIt said Mrs Negriba should contact the board to discuss her treatment.\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The Guardian leads with the call by hundreds of legal experts for an Israeli arms ban. The paper gives details of the 17-page letter sent to the prime minister that's been backed by 600 lawyers and academics, including the former president of the Supreme Court Lady Hale and two other former justices, Lord Sumption and Lord Wilson. The paper says Conservative party sources believe Foreign Secretary Lord David Cameron has pushed for the government to harden its approach to Israel but has been met with resistance from No 10.\n\"Gaza plunges into new aid crisis,\" says the i's headline. The paper says aid agencies are warning that children in the territory are dying of malnutrition and being forced to eat animal feed to survive. The Metro also leads on the conflict with the headline \"Intolerable\", after the deaths of the three British men in Gaza.  Israel says claims it is blocking humanitarian aid into Gaza wholly unfounded. \nThe Times leads on a new Alzheimer's study. It says thousands of Britons who are worried about their memory will receive blood tests in the hope of detecting the disease earlier.  It says these tests are important to make best use of a \"new class of Alzheimer's drugs that require early diagnosis\".  \nThe Daily Mail has the headline \"MPs caught up in naked honeytrap sex sting\". The paper says a serving minister is among a number of Westminster figures who've been sent flirtatious WhatsApp messages and nude pictures, and there are fears that a foreign state may be involved. The story carries quotes from an unnamed Labour Party staff member who said whoever sent the messages seemed to know a lot about them.\nThe Sun leads with Rishi Sunak's comments that raised the prospect of taking the UK out of the European Court of Human Rights. In an interview with the paper's Never Mind the Ballots show, the prime minister said he believed controlling illegal migration was more important than membership of foreign courts, after the Strasbourg judges blocked the first flights to Rwanda in 2022. \nOffenders from \"deprived\" or \"difficult\" backgrounds could get more lenient sentences, according to the Daily Telegraph. The paper says that the Sentencing Council has for the first time published \"mitigating factors\" it says should be considered. \nMany of the papers carry the story of a man from Cardiff, who has been honoured for his heroism during World War Two.

    "NFL star Rashee Rice has apologised for his role in a hit-and-run crash on Saturday that left two people injured. \n\"I take full responsibility for my part in this matter and will continue to co-operate with the necessary authorities,\" he posted on Wednesday.\nPolice in Dallas, Texas, say two speeding cars, a Lamborghini and Corvette, caused \"a chain reaction collision\" that damaged four more cars.\nThe Lamborghini and Corvette occupants left the scene, police say. \n\"The occupants of the Lamborghini and the Corvette all ran from the scene without stopping to determine if anyone needed medical help or providing their information,\" Dallas police said in a statement sent to the BBC.\nIn his short Instagram post, Rashee Rice, a 23-year-old wide receiver for the Kansas City Chiefs, said he had met with Dallas investigators earlier on Wednesday. \n\"I sincerely apologise to everyone impacted in Saturday's accident,\" he added.\nHis lawyer, Royce West, on Monday told ESPN: \"On behalf of Rashee Rice, his thoughts are with everyone impacted by the automobile accident on Saturday.\n\"Rashee is co-operating with local authorities and will take all necessary steps to address this situation responsibly.\" \nCiting unnamed officials, the Dallas Morning News on Monday reported that the Corvette was registered or leased to the Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver.\nDashcam footage from another motorist appears to show the moment of the collision. The video shows two vehicles speeding ahead of the motorist, losing control and crashing into several more cars which then also spin out of control on the motorway.\nDallas police would not confirm to the BBC whether the American football player was among those involved in the crash, citing the ongoing investigation.\nOn Monday, Kansas City Chiefs president Mark Donovan said during a radio interview with local station KCMO: \"In all these situations you have to wait until you have all the facts and frankly, we don't have all the facts at this point. \n\"We'll get to the bottom of it, we'll gather the facts and we'll react accordingly,\" he added.\nTwo drivers were treated at the scene for minor injuries and two motorists in another vehicle were taken to a local hospital.\n\"No one stopped,\" Kayla Quinn, who said her car was damaged in the crash, told the Dallas Morning News.\nMarc Lenahan, a personal injury attorney who represents a victim of the crash, told the BBC his firm's research links the Corvette to Rashee Rice and the Lamborghini to a local luxury car rental service.  \nMr Rice, who is from the Dallas area, was drafted to the NFL last year and played in the Chiefs' second consecutive Super Bowl victory in February.",
    "In the aftermath of the shooting that saw a 12-year-old kill another child and injure two in the city of Vantaa, north of the capital Helsinki, the headlines in Finland have been full of soul-searching.\n\"What kind of events led to such an extreme act?\"\n\"How could a 12-year-old get hold of a gun?\"\n\"Could the incident have been prevented somehow?\"\nFew of these questions have had answers so far. \nInstead, harrowing details about the events in Vantaa have continued to emerge.\nThe boy wore a mask and noise-cancelling headphones, showing his actions were premeditated. He shot his victims on a school premises they all knew well and spent time in every day. The two girls he wounded are still in a serious condition in hospital. \nMost shocking of all, the killer was 12 years old.  \nThere have been other school shootings in Finland, although not many: this was only the fourth in the country's history. \n\"In this case the shooter and the victims are really too young,\" Tomi Kiilakoski, youth researcher at the University of Tampere, told the BBC. \"We are really talking about children - and that shocks us.\"\nSquaring up the brutality of the crime with the young age of the suspect was difficult, he said, and the incident came as \"a big shock for children, for the community, for young people and for the whole of Finnish society\".\nPolice revealed on Wednesday that the suspect had indicated the motive behind the shooting was that he had been bullied, and their initial inquiry had confirmed that.\nThis is likely to worry many Finnish parents. Bullying is very difficult to eradicate, and relatively widespread: studies show that 8.6% of children between the ages of 10-11 in Finland are bullied every week. \nOf course, victims of bullying rarely end up killing others, but bullying often features as one of the reasons for extreme acts of violence. \nAfter two school shootings in 2007 and 2008 left 18 dead, a police inspector said that a \"system of pre-emptive measures\" had been built in that allowed police to intervene if they received information on a \"person's intent to stage an attack\". \nOn Tuesday, Finland's National Police Commissioner Seppo Kolehmainen had to admit that system had failed.\nHenri Rikander, associate professor of police law at the University of Eastern Finland, told the BBC that out of the 60-100 potential mass shootings Finnish police investigate each year, about 20 are typically in the last stages of preparation and can be classified as \"serious\". \nIn the Vantaa case, the boy does not appear to have talked about his plans with anybody - and so may have fallen through the cracks.\nThat has left Finns wondering how to prevent such a tragedy from happening again.\nAs it stands, the Vantaa suspect will not face charges and has been placed in the care of social services - so some sections of Finnish society are calling for the age of criminal responsibility to be lowered from 15.\nLast summer, Interior Minister Mari Rantanen of Finland's far-right Finns Party said the age should be lowered in order to \"break the cycle of crime\" among those younger than 15. \nJani Makela, chairman of the Finns Party parliamentary group, told the BBC that \"there have been cases in which the 15-year age limit is suspected to have been exploited on purpose\".\nBut others disagree that such a move would have any preventative effect. \nProf Rikander said violent episodes should be prevented through social intervention rather than \"official control\". \nHarmful or worrying behaviour in others was easier to spot in contexts like sports clubs, schools or at home, he explained, but the \"increasing isolation\" of young people meant that worrying signs were being missed.\n\"The most important thing is preventative measures,\" said Tomi Kiilakoski. \"What I would hope to see is a societal discussion on how we can provide services for children and young people in supporting their growth.\"\nIt is not yet known how a 12-year-old was able to get hold of a firearm. But we do know it belonged to a close relative and weapons are not hard to come by in Finland. With its vast open spaces and woodland, it calls itself a country of \"hunters and gun enthusiasts\". \nAccording to the interior ministry, there are more than 1.5 million licensed firearms in Finland and about 430,000 people with licences, meaning almost 8% of Finland's 5.6 million residents have a gun licence. There is no limit to the number of guns that can be owned. \nSo far, there has been little discussion around tightening gun legislation. \"We are proud of ourselves for being close to nature and hunting is a part of that,\" said Tomi Kiilakoski, adding that fatal shootings in Finland were low despite the high number of guns.\nThe boy's relatives will now have to explain how the revolver-type handgun came into the child's possession. Finnish legislation states that firearms must be \"locked in such a way that the firearm... cannot be easily stolen\". This appears not to have been the case.\nThe Viertola school where ",
    "Donald Trump is suing two co-founders of Trump Media, claiming they should lose their shares of the company for mismanaging his social media site. \nThe men, Wes Moss and Andy Litinsky, had already filed a suit against Mr Trump in February to prevent him from reducing their 8.6% stake in the firm.\nThey pitched the idea of Truth Social following the Capitol riot, after Mr Trump was banned from Twitter, now X. \nTheir shares are currently valued at around $600m (\u00a3477m). \nBoth co-founders met Mr Trump as contestants on NBC's The Apprentice reality show. \nIn the lawsuit, filed on 24 March in Florida state court, lawyers for the former president say Mr Moss and Mr Litinsky were in charge of Trump Media & Technology Group's daily operations, but \"failed spectacularly at every turn\".\nTrump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) is the parent company of Truth Social. \n\"They made a series of reckless and wasteful decisions at a critical time that caused significant damage to TMTG and a decline in the stock price of its merger partner,\" Mr Trump's lawyers wrote in the filing.\nMr Trump's lawyers claim the two executives in particular slowed down the process of taking Trump Media public, including by finding an appropriate merger company. \nTMTG went public last week through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. \nMr Moss and Mr Litinsky were not immediately available for comment. \nIn their February lawsuit, Mr Moss and Mr Litinsky claimed the former president was trying to reduce their stake in the firm by increasing the company's total number of shares from 120 million to 1 billion.\nMr Trump founded TMTG in 2021 after he was kicked off of major social media platforms over his actions during the 6 January Capitol riot. \nMr Moss and Mr Litinsky suggested Truth Social as an alternative to mainstream social media sites. They later agreed to a deal in which Mr Trump would own 90% of the platform when it was a private company. \nShares in Truth Social skyrocketed last week - surging as high as $79 (\u00a363) - after Trump Media went public despite the business facing government investigations and other hurdles in its merger deal. \nThe stock price has since fallen considerably.

    "All except the shortest wars have times when killing is an unchanging, grim routine. There are also moments, like the last few days in the Middle East, when events leave belligerents and their allies at a crossroads with big decisions to make.  \nChoices are confronting leaders in the governments and armed forces in Israel and Tehran, at Hezbollah's HQ in the southern suburbs of Beirut and further afield in the Gulf, Europe and America. \nThe killing of foreign aid workers in Gaza might finally exhaust the considerable patience of Israel's allies, led by the United States. \nIsrael and Egypt have banned foreign journalists from entering Gaza, except on occasional, highly controlled and brief visits with the Israeli military. Belligerents need to win the media battle in an age of asymmetric warfare where victory or defeat can rely on perceptions as much as the realities of battle. Journalists are also denied access to a war when the parties fighting it have something to hide. \nBut even without foreign reporters on the scene, evidence is piling up that Israel is not, as it claims, respecting its obligations under the laws of war to respect civilian lives, or allowing the free movement of aid in a famine created by Israel's own actions. After the World Central Kitchen team was killed in Gaza, President Biden used his strongest language yet in public statements to condemn Israel's actions. \nThe president and his aides have now to decide whether words are enough. So far, they have resisted calls to put conditions on the use of American weapons in Gaza, or even to turn off the supply line. \nWhile the weapons still arrive, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who depends on hardline Jewish ultranationalists to stay in office, might feel he can still afford to defy President Biden. A major test will be the offensive Israel wants to attack Hamas in Rafah, plans the US believes would compound the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. American interests and Joe Biden's political prospects in an election year have already been damaged by what is seen in many countries as complicity with Israel. \nIn another change this week, Mr Netanyahu has come back to work after two days off for hernia surgery to huge demonstrations demanding his resignation and early elections for a new parliament. Deep cultural and political fissures between Israelis that were put to one side after 7 October are wide open again and being shouted about in the streets. The prime minister is in political trouble, blamed by his opponents for letting down Israel's guard so badly that Hamas detected a chance to attack. \nMillions of Israelis who believe they are fighting a just war against Hamas have no confidence in Mr Netanyahu. Their charge sheet includes prolonging the war to put off the moment when he is held accountable for his mistakes, failing to bring Israel's hostages home safely, and alienating vital allies starting with President Biden. Add to that the fact that after a huge onslaught over six months Hamas is still fighting, and its senior leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar is still alive somewhere in the Strip. \nAnother new set of calculations about the next stages of the crisis in the Middle East arise from the assassination of a senior Iranian general in Damascus, widely assumed in Israel to be the work of its air force. It was a coup for intelligence services that missed or ignored the Hamas attacks six months ago. It was also an escalation in the wider war in the region that will have consequences. \nSome of them may happen close to where I'm writing this, looking across the Sea of Galilee towards the Golan Heights, the large swathe of southern Syria that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed. As the crow flies, Damascus is less than 50 miles from here. The border with Lebanon is close by. At night, especially, there is constant Israeli air activity, with the roar of jets on patrol, or heading off to bomb Lebanon or Syria. \nA shadow war has been fought here in parallel with the war in Gaza since last October. It started with Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia and political movement attacking Israel, in support of Hamas in Gaza. It was not the onslaught that the Hamas leadership was hoping for - neither Hezbollah or its patrons in Tehran wanted an all-out war with Israel and, indirectly, its American backers. The Americans did not want that either and restrained Israel's instinct to respond in full force. \nBut Hezbollah still tied down thousands of Israeli troops and forced the evacuation of something like 80,000 civilians from the border areas. Israel's response, limited compared to earlier border wars, forced the displacement of at least as many civilians on the Lebanese side. \nSince the start of this year it has been different. Israel has been setting the pace, bombing its enemies deeper inside Lebanon and Syria. The biggest leap up the ladder of escalation came on Monday with the assassination by air strike on th",
    "An Iranian TV journalist stabbed outside his London home has vowed he will be back on air soon.\nPouria Zeraati is now staying in a safe house after the attack on Friday, which is being investigated by Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism officers.\nSpeaking to a friend, Mr Zeraati said he would carry on his work, no matter who was behind the attack.\nHis employer said they had received threats from the Iranian regime, but Iran denied any involvement.\nMr Zeraati is unable to give an interview but has spoken to his friend Kasra Aarabi, who spoke to the BBC.\nMr Aarabi, an outspoken critic of the regime in Tehran, works for a campaign group where he researches the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC).\nThe IRGC is a powerful paramilitary group within the Iranian regime which has been accused of targeting journalists at Iran International, where Mr Zeraati works.\nMr Aarabi said his friend was in a positive frame of mind and recovering. He described the attack as horrific but said: \"Pouria has told me, regardless of who is behind this, he won't be silenced, he'll carry on.\"\nHe said the 36-year-old journalist told him that he had sensed that something was about to happen just before the attack. Two people had been spotted hanging around his quiet suburban street in Wimbledon, south-west London, he said.\n\"Pouria crossed the road to get to his car, he noticed one man approaching, so he backed off,\" Mr Aarabi said.\nHe said the man then asked Mr Zeraati in English: \"Brother, can I have three pounds?\"\nMr Zeraati told the man he did not have any money and turned back towards his car to open the door. The man then signalled to a second person, who ran towards the TV host with his face covered and grabbed him in a bear hug, pinning his arms.\n\"Pouria told me he couldn't move, he had lost all control,\" Mr Aarabi said. \"At which point the first person, who asked for money, stabs him several times in the back of the thigh.\"\nThe attack was over quickly, Mr Aarabi said, and the assailants ran down the road to a parked car.\nThe Met Police said there is now an international investigation after officers identified three suspects, who they believe all fled the UK within hours of the attack.\nThe Met did not say where the men have flown to.\nMr Aarabi, who works for the US-based campaign group United Against Nuclear Iran, said he believes this was a targeted attack and Mr Zeraati has said on social media that it was \"purposefully planned\". \n\"Nothing was stolen from Pouria, his phone, he had brand new Apple AirPods, his wallet with cash in it and a valuable watch - they weren't interested in taking anything of value,\" said Mr Aarabi.\n\"It could be a local gang who have been paid to do this - we know the Iranian regime has been accused of this before. The regime may have also flown in its operatives. \n\"The other option is that these are local home-grown attackers radicalised and recruited by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards in the UK, which is a terrifying but real prospect.\"\nIran's charge d'affaires in the UK, Mehdi Hosseini Matin, said \"we deny any link\" to the attack.\nIn January, the BBC revealed videos obtained by Mr Aarabi of former and current Iranian Revolutionary Guard generals holding online events with British student organisations.\nIn one speech, an IRGC commander described an apocalyptic war that the British students could join to \"bring an end to the life of the oppressors and occupiers, Zionists and Jews across the world\".\nThe Charity Commission has opened a statutory inquiry into the allegations.\nMr Aarabi, who has previously warned of the threats to Iranians living in the UK from the Iranian regime, said the risks to Mr Zeraati intensified after his \"outspoken\" coverage of the protests which followed the death of Mahsa Amini in September 2022, after she had been detained by Iran's morality police.\nHe said that in November 2022, the IRGC-backed Fars news agency published \"Wanted: dead or alive\" posters, showing the faces of Iran International journalists including Pouria Zeraati. The posters were seen on the streets of Tehran and were put up by the IRGC, Mr Aarabi said.\nThe poster also featured Sima Sabet, another Iran International journalist in London who was the reported target of a failed assassination plot last year along with another colleague, Fardad Farazad. \nSince the attack on Mr Zeraati, she said she has been told by police to leave her home immediately.",

    "A ringleader in a global monkey torture network exposed by the BBC has been charged by US federal prosecutors.\nMichael Macartney, 50, who went by the alias \"Torture King\", was charged in Virginia with conspiracy to create and distribute animal-crushing videos.\nMr Macartney was one of three key distributors identified by the BBC Eye team during a year-long investigation into sadistic monkey torture groups.\nTwo women have also been charged in the UK following the investigation.\nWarning: This article contains disturbing content\nMr Macartney, a former motorcycle gang member who previously spent time in prison, ran several chat groups for monkey torture enthusiasts from around the world on the encrypted messaging app Telegram.\nThe groups were used to share ideas for custom-made torture videos, such as setting live monkeys on fire, injuring them with tools and even putting one in a blender.\nThe ideas were then sent, along with payments, to video-makers in Indonesia who carried them out, sometimes killing the baby long-tailed macaque monkeys in the process.\nAccording to charging documents, Mr Macartney, who lives in the US state of Virginia, is accused by prosecutors of collecting funds from his chat groups and distributing videos depicting the \"torture, murder, and sexually sadistic mutilation of animals, specifically juvenile and adult monkeys\".\nMr Macartney has cooperated with investigators from the Department of Homeland Security and agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy charges. He will formally make a plea later this month and is facing up to five years in prison.\nSpeaking to the BBC Eye investigations team last year, Mr Macartney confessed to his role in the torture network, describing himself as the \"king of this demented world\". \n\"I was the man,\" he said. \"You want to see monkeys get messed up? I could bring it to you.\"\nMr Macartney also described the moment he joined his first Telegram monkey group.\n\"They had a poll set up,\" he said. \"Do you want a hammer involved? Do you want pliers involved? Do you want a screwdriver?\" \nThe resulting videos were \"the most grotesque thing I have ever seen\", Mr Macartney said, and yet he went on to become a key player in the monkey torture groups.\nThe BBC understands that more charges are expected to follow soon for other key players in the monkey torture network. At least 20 people were placed under investigation last year globally, following the BBC's investigation. \nThree participants have already been charged in the US, including Mr Macartney. Two torturers were arrested and jailed in Indonesia, and three women have been arrested in the UK, two of whom have been charged.\nHolly LeGresley, 37, of Kidderminster and Adriana Orme, 55, of Upton-upon Severn were charged last month with publishing an obscene article and causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal. \nMs LeGresley and Ms Orme were high-profile members of the online torture groups.

    "The family of a murdered woman has angrily disputed Donald Trump's claim that he spoke to them.  \nAt a Tuesday rally, Mr Trump used the alleged killing of 25-year-old Ruby Garcia by an undocumented immigrant to illustrate his strong stances on immigration and crime.\n\"She lit up that room, and I've heard that from so many people,\" Mr Trump said. \"I spoke to some of her family.\" \nBut Ms Garcia's sister said they never talked to Mr Trump or his campaign.\n\"He did not speak with us, so it was kind of shocking seeing that he had said that he had spoke with us, and misinforming people on live TV,\" she said in an interview with local news network Target 8. \"The focus should be on my sister right now, who she was in life.\" \nAccording to authorities, Ruby Garcia was found shot dead on a highway near the city of Grand Rapids in Michigan on 22 March. \nA Mexican national in the US illegally, Brandon Ortiz-Vite - who was the victim's boyfriend - was arrested days later and allegedly confessed. Authorities later said he entered the country as a child and had previously been deported in September 2020, when Mr Trump was still in office.\nIn his speech in Grand Rapids, Mr Trump used the murder to highlight what he termed President Joe Biden's \"border bloodbath\". \nMavi Garcia said she wishes that Mr Ortiz-Vite had \"stayed in Mexico\", but that she does not tie her sister's death to immigration.\n\"It's always been about illegal immigrants,\" she added. \"Nobody really speaks about when Americans do heinous crimes, and it's kind of shocking why he would just bring up illegals. What about Americans who do heinous crimes like that?\"\nThe BBC has contacted the Trump campaign for comment. \nBorder security, as well as immigration and a perception - not supported by statistics - that it is tied to violent crime, are common features of Mr Trump's rallies and campaign speeches. \nOn Tuesday, for example, he referred to undocumented immigrants as \"animals\" and \"not humans\". \nPolls show that immigration, including the border, is a primary concern for many American voters. \nSome 61% of Americans in a recent Monmouth survey listed illegal immigration as a \"very serious problem\", with a majority of respondents for the first time saying they support Mr Trump's proposal of building a US-Mexico border wall.",

    "Florida's Supreme Court delivered two rulings on abortion on Monday, with competing consequences.\nFirst, the court upheld the state's right to prohibit abortion, giving the green light for a six-week ban to take effect on 1 May. \nThe near-total ban will block almost all access in the US South, where Florida had been something of a haven for those seeking abortions, surrounded by states that had already implemented six-week or total bans on the procedure. \nThe ruling was applauded by national anti-abortion activists, many of whom see a six-week ban as the gold standard for abortion policy. The decision is a \"victory for unborn children\", said Katie Daniel, Florida policy director of Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America.\nBut in a 4-3 vote, the justices also approved a November ballot initiative that, if approved, would overturn the six-week ban and enshrine broad abortion access in the state's constitution.\nThe decisions have sharpened the glare of the political spotlight on the Sunshine State, and set up perhaps the highest stakes abortion fight since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in June 2022.\nThe six-week ban in Florida - the country's third most populous state - may affect more women than any other statewide ban implemented since the repeal of Roe. \nJust over 84,000 women received abortions in Florida last year, state data says. According to pro-choice research group the Guttmacher Institute, that figure showed a 12% jump over 2020, which researchers attribute mostly to out-of-state patients.\nSome Florida lawmakers, many of whom voted for the six-week ban last year, called the law a compromise, adding that it includes exceptions for cases involving rape, incest, abnormalities and when the mother's life is in danger.\nBut pro-choice activists have warned that even with these exceptions, strict abortion bans can endanger women's health, pointing to cases involving pregnancy complications in states such as Texas. \nAnd, they add, Florida's six-week law is particularly restrictive, requiring patients seeking abortions to have two in-person doctor appointments with a 24-hour waiting period in between. \n\"At six weeks most women have no idea that they're even pregnant,\" said Anna Hochkammer, executive director of the pro-choice group Florida Women's Freedom Coalition. \"A mammoth health crisis is about to befall us.\" \nFlorida's new abortion landscape also has significant political consequences. The November referendum, experts say, has handed Democrats a chance to highlight an issue where they have a proven electoral edge. \nIn the almost two years since Roe was overturned, pro-choice activists have won all seven abortion-related ballot initiatives, even in Republican-led states. And sustained public support for abortion access has been credited with helping Democrats over-perform in both state and national races. \n\"Abortion is an opportunity for Democrats and it remains a problem for Republicans,\" said Republican strategist Kevin Madden, who was a spokesman for Utah Senator Mitt Romney's presidential campaigns. \"This gives them [Democrats] some wind at their backs.\"\nAlready, Democrats have moved to press that advantage in Florida.\nOn Tuesday, within a day of the abortion rulings, top US House of Representatives lawmakers convened a special hearing in the state, which the chamber's minority leader Hakeem Jeffries called \"ground zero\" for abortion access. \nHours after that, on a call with reporters, Biden campaign manager Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez said the same as she worked to tie the Florida ban to Donald Trump, now the presumptive Republican nominee. \nMr Trump \"is directly to blame\", Ms Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez said. \"Because of Donald Trump, Maga [Make America Great Again] Republicans across this country are ripping away access to reproductive healthcare.\"\nAnd Ms Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez went further, suggesting the Florida abortion fight could help tilt the electoral scales, giving Democrats a fighting chance to flip the state in November. \n\"We definitely see Florida in play,\" she said. \"We're clear eyed about how hard it is to win Florida\u2026 But we also know that Trump does not have it in the bag.\"\nFew people think that these rulings will actually swing the presidential contest in Florida - a Republican stronghold for over a decade. But experts say there is indeed now an opening for Democrats to once again over-perform and potentially flip some down-ballot contests, including some competitive Senate and House races. \nVeteran Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg said that the abortion vote would bring \"enormous amounts of money, volunteers and energy into the pro-choice side, which changes the politics in the state\". \n\"All of a sudden what we knew about Florida in 2024 is now unsettled,\" he said. \"A six-week abortion ban is a bridge too far for the people of Florida, the polling on this is really clear.\" \nEarly surveys on the ballot initiative itself, dubbed Amendment 4, tell a similar story, indicating that more than 60% of ",

    "The family of a murdered woman has angrily disputed Donald Trump's claim that he spoke to them.  \nAt a Tuesday rally, Mr Trump used the alleged killing of 25-year-old Ruby Garcia by an undocumented immigrant to illustrate his strong stances on immigration and crime.\n\"She lit up that room, and I've heard that from so many people,\" Mr Trump said. \"I spoke to some of her family.\" \nBut Ms Garcia's sister said they never talked to Mr Trump or his campaign.\n\"He did not speak with us, so it was kind of shocking seeing that he had said that he had spoke with us, and misinforming people on live TV,\" she said in an interview with local news network Target 8. \"The focus should be on my sister right now, who she was in life.\" \nAccording to authorities, Ruby Garcia was found shot dead on a highway near the city of Grand Rapids in Michigan on 22 March. \nA Mexican national in the US illegally, Brandon Ortiz-Vite - who was the victim's boyfriend - was arrested days later and allegedly confessed. Authorities later said he entered the country as a child and had previously been deported in September 2020, when Mr Trump was still in office.\nIn his speech in Grand Rapids, Mr Trump used the murder to highlight what he termed President Joe Biden's \"border bloodbath\". \nMavi Garcia said she wishes that Mr Ortiz-Vite had \"stayed in Mexico\", but that she does not tie her sister's death to immigration.\n\"It's always been about illegal immigrants,\" she added. \"Nobody really speaks about when Americans do heinous crimes, and it's kind of shocking why he would just bring up illegals. What about Americans who do heinous crimes like that?\"\nThe BBC has contacted the Trump campaign for comment. \nBorder security, as well as immigration and a perception - not supported by statistics - that it is tied to violent crime, are common features of Mr Trump's rallies and campaign speeches. \nOn Tuesday, for example, he referred to undocumented immigrants as \"animals\" and \"not humans\". \nPolls show that immigration, including the border, is a primary concern for many American voters. \nSome 61% of Americans in a recent Monmouth survey listed illegal immigration as a \"very serious problem\", with a majority of respondents for the first time saying they support Mr Trump's proposal of building a US-Mexico border wall.",
    "Iran has vowed to respond to Monday's air strike on its consulate in Damascus - but what capacity does Iran have to hurt Israel and what form might retaliation take?\nThirteen people were killed including Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, an important figure in the Quds force, the overseas branch of Iran's elite Republican Guards. Israel has not said whether it was behind the attack.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had \"completely lost his mental balance\", Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian was quoted as saying on his ministry's website. \nThe escalation was designed to show the world that Iran was a \"paper tiger\", said Fawaz Gerges, professor of International Relations at London School of Economics. It also represented a significant loss to the Quds force, \"which is really for coordination and arms and technology transfers to Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria\".\nHamas's military wing, the Qassam brigades, has said Brig Gen Zahedi had a \"prominent role\" in the 7 October Hamas attacks on southern Israel, which sparked the current war in Gaza that is threatening to spread. Iran has denied a role in the attack itself but backs Hamas with funding, weapons and training.\nHowever Iran's options for retaliation for the Damascus strike may be limited in scope and number, Mr Gerges and other experts told the BBC. \n\"Iran is not capable of a big confrontation with Israel given its military capabilities and economic and political situation,\" said Ali Sadrzadeh an author and analyst of Middle East affairs. \"But it will have to come up with a response for domestic consumption and to protect its reputation among its regional allies.\"\nMr Gerges also said Iran was unlikely to retaliate directly against Israel, \"even though Israel really humiliated Iran and bloodied Iran's nose\".\nInstead Iran was likely to exercise \"strategic patience\" because it will prioritise a more important goal: making a nuclear bomb.\n\"[Iran is] accumulating power, it's enriching uranium, it's making progress. And the big prize for Iran is not really to send 50 ballistic missiles and kill 100 Israelis, but to establish strategic deterrence, not only against the Israelis, but even against the US state.\"\nSince Israel's war in Gaza, missile and drone attacks by Iran-backed militia in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen against Israel interests have escalated but they seem to have limited their actions short of provoking Israel into a full-scale war. \n\"Even an attack against an Israeli diplomatic mission by Iran's proxy forces seems difficult to imagine,\" said Mr Sadrzadeh, although he did predict that current attacks by Iran-backed Houthi militia against ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden are \"very likely to continue, especially against vessels that are somehow linked to Israel or the US\". \nHezbollah is one of the most heavily armed, non-state military forces in the world - independent estimates suggest the group has between 20,000 and 50,000 fighters, and many are well-trained and battle-hardened through their participation in the Syrian civil war.\nThe Iran-backed Lebanese group has an arsenal of an estimated 130,000 rockets and missiles, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank.\nYet the experts the BBC spoke to thought it unlikely that the group would launch a major escalation against Israel.\n\"Hezbollah does not really want to fall into Israel's trap because they realise Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet are desperately trying to expand the war,\" said Mr Gerges.\n\"The political future of Benjamin Netanyahu depends on the continuation of the war in Gaza and its escalation into northern fronts with Hezbollah and even with Iran itself.\"\nMr Sadrzadeh believes Iran is likely to show a \"symbolic\" reaction rather than risking a direct war with Israel.\n\"Iran is an expert in carrying out symbolic attacks like the one in response to the killing of its most important military commander Qasem Soleimani,\" Sadrzadeh said, referring to a ballistic missile attack by Iran against an Iraqi air base where US troops were stationed - a week after the US assassinated the Iranian general in Baghdad.\nDespite Iran's promise of \"severe revenge\", no US military personnel stationed at the base were killed, and there were reports that the US military had been warned in advance of the incoming missiles. \nYousof Azizi at Virginia Tech's School of Public & International Affairs believes that there will be a struggle going on behind the scenes in Iran between those who argue that Iran should seek to establish itself as a nuclear power to deter Israeli aggression and more hawkish figures who suggest direct attacks on Israel and its military installations.\nBut he told the BBC that an analysis of state media interviews and key social media accounts suggested the policy of \"strategic patience\" was likely to prevail.\nSo what other avenues are open to the Iranians?\n\"We cannot rule out that perhaps Iran may use cyberspace as another dime",

    "Florida's Supreme Court delivered two rulings on abortion on Monday, with competing consequences.\nFirst, the court upheld the state's right to prohibit abortion, giving the green light for a six-week ban to take effect on 1 May. \nThe near-total ban will block almost all access in the US South, where Florida had been something of a haven for those seeking abortions, surrounded by states that had already implemented six-week or total bans on the procedure. \nThe ruling was applauded by national anti-abortion activists, many of whom see a six-week ban as the gold standard for abortion policy. The decision is a \"victory for unborn children\", said Katie Daniel, Florida policy director of Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America.\nBut in a 4-3 vote, the justices also approved a November ballot initiative that, if approved, would overturn the six-week ban and enshrine broad abortion access in the state's constitution.\nThe decisions have sharpened the glare of the political spotlight on the Sunshine State, and set up perhaps the highest stakes abortion fight since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in June 2022.\nThe six-week ban in Florida - the country's third most populous state - may affect more women than any other statewide ban implemented since the repeal of Roe. \nJust over 84,000 women received abortions in Florida last year, state data says. According to pro-choice research group the Guttmacher Institute, that figure showed a 12% jump over 2020, which researchers attribute mostly to out-of-state patients.\nSome Florida lawmakers, many of whom voted for the six-week ban last year, called the law a compromise, adding that it includes exceptions for cases involving rape, incest, abnormalities and when the mother's life is in danger.\nBut pro-choice activists have warned that even with these exceptions, strict abortion bans can endanger women's health, pointing to cases involving pregnancy complications in states such as Texas. \nAnd, they add, Florida's six-week law is particularly restrictive, requiring patients seeking abortions to have two in-person doctor appointments with a 24-hour waiting period in between. \n\"At six weeks most women have no idea that they're even pregnant,\" said Anna Hochkammer, executive director of the pro-choice group Florida Women's Freedom Coalition. \"A mammoth health crisis is about to befall us.\" \nFlorida's new abortion landscape also has significant political consequences.

It was a cause of debt that resulted in prisoners self-isolating and self-harming because of their fears of violence.\n\"There were limited resources available to keep drugs out of the prison with no scanners, systematic checks on staff or adequate technology to reduce the frequent arrival of contraband-laden drones over the large perimeter fence.\" \nA Prison Service spokeswoman said: \"HMP Wymott has already taken decisive action to address the concerns raised in this report including boosting staffing levels, increasing time out cells, and improving mental health support.\n\"We've also invested \u00a3100m in tough security measures such as X-ray body scanners to stop more contraband entering jails.\"\nWhy not follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram?

    "Donald Trump is suing two co-founders of Trump Media, claiming they should lose their shares of the company for mismanaging his social media site. \nThe men, Wes Moss and Andy Litinsky, had already filed a suit against Mr Trump in February to prevent him from reducing their 8.6% stake in the firm.\nThey pitched the idea of Truth Social following the Capitol riot, after Mr Trump was banned from Twitter, now X. \nTheir shares are currently valued at around $600m (\u00a3477m). \nBoth co-founders met Mr Trump as contestants on NBC's The Apprentice reality show. \nIn the lawsuit, filed on 24 March in Florida state court, lawyers for the former president say Mr Moss and Mr Litinsky were in charge of Trump Media & Technology Group's daily operations, but \"failed spectacularly at every turn\".\nTrump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) is the parent company of Truth Social. \n\"They made a series of reckless and wasteful decisions at a critical time that caused significant damage to TMTG and a decline in the stock price of its merger partner,\" Mr Trump's lawyers wrote in the filing.\nMr Trump's lawyers claim the two executives in particular slowed down the process of taking Trump Media public, including by finding an appropriate merger company. \nTMTG went public last week through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. \nMr Moss and Mr Litinsky were not immediately available for comment. \nIn their February lawsuit, Mr Moss and Mr Litinsky claimed the former president was trying to reduce their stake in the firm by increasing the company's total number of shares from 120 million to 1 billion.\nMr Trump founded TMTG in 2021 after he was kicked off of major social media platforms over his actions during the 6 January Capitol riot. \nMr Moss and Mr Litinsky suggested Truth Social as an alternative to mainstream social media sites. They later agreed to a deal in which Mr Trump would own 90% of the platform when it was a private company. \nShares in Truth Social skyrocketed last week - surging as high as $79 (\u00a363) - after Trump Media went public despite the business facing government investigations and other hurdles in its merger deal. \nThe stock price has since fallen considerably.

And the big prize for Iran is not really to send 50 ballistic missiles and kill 100 Israelis, but to establish strategic deterrence, not only against the Israelis, but even against the US state.\"\nSince Israel's war in Gaza, missile and drone attacks by Iran-backed militia in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen against Israel interests have escalated but they seem to have limited their actions short of provoking Israel into a full-scale war. \n\"Even an attack against an Israeli diplomatic mission by Iran's proxy forces seems difficult to imagine,\" said Mr Sadrzadeh, although he did predict that current attacks by Iran-backed Houthi militia against ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden are \"very likely to continue, especially against vessels that are somehow linked to Israel or the US\". \nHezbollah is one of the most heavily armed, non-state military forces in the world - independent estimates suggest the group has between 20,000 and 50,000 fighters, and many are well-trained and battle-hardened through their participation in the Syrian civil war.\nThe Iran-backed Lebanese group has an arsenal of an estimated 130,000 rockets and missiles, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank.\nYet the experts the BBC spoke to thought it unlikely that the group would launch a major escalation against Israel.\n\"Hezbollah does not really want to fall into Israel's trap because they realise Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet are desperately trying to expand the war,\" said Mr Gerges.\n\"The political future of Benjamin Netanyahu depends on the continuation of the war in Gaza and its escalation into northern fronts with Hezbollah and even with Iran itself.\"\nMr Sadrzadeh believes Iran is likely to show a \"symbolic\" reaction rather than risking a direct war with Israel.\n\"Iran is an expert in carrying out symbolic attacks like the one in response to the killing of its most important military commander Qasem Soleimani,\" Sadrzadeh said, referring to a ballistic missile attack by Iran against an Iraqi air base where US troops were stationed - a week after the US assassinated the Iranian general in Baghdad.\nDespite Iran's promise of \"severe revenge\", no US military personnel stationed at the base were killed, and there were reports that the US military had been warned in advance of the incoming missiles. \nYousof Azizi at Virginia Tech's School of Public & International Affairs believes that there will be a struggle going on behind the scenes in Iran between those who argue that Iran should seek to establish itself as a nuclear power to deter Israeli aggression and more hawkish figures who suggest direct attacks on Israel and its military installations.\nBut he told the BBC that an analysis of state media interviews and key social media accounts suggested the policy of \"strategic patience\" was likely to prevail.\nSo what other avenues are open to the Iranians?\n\"We cannot rule out that perhaps Iran may use cyberspace as another dime",

    "A key witness has told a court in Germany he saw videos of the prime suspect in the disappearance of three-year-old Madeleine McCann raping an elderly woman and a young girl.\nThe man, named as Helge B, told the court in Braunschweig that he had picked up the videos when he broke into the Portuguese home of Christian Br\u00fcckner, 47, who was a former friend.\nBr\u00fcckner faces five sex offence allegations.\nThey are unrelated to the McCann case.\nHe has previously denied involvement in the three-year-old's disappearance and has never been charged.  \nBr\u00fcckner is on trial, in the German state of Lower Saxony, for three counts of rape and two of the sexual abuse of children. \nThe offences are all alleged to have taken place between 2000 and 2017 in Portugal, where he lived in the Algarve region on and off for years. \nBr\u00fcckner's lawyers have previously declared the case to be based on \"very shaky foundations\". \nThey have also questioned whether their client can get a fair trial after being publicly linked, by prosecutors, to the disappearance of Madeleine. \nHelge B described meeting Br\u00fcckner in Portugal in 2006 but claimed they did not get along well: \"We just never vibed.\"  \nHe recalled breaking into the suspect's home in Portugal while Br\u00fcckner was in jail, along with another witness identified as Manfred S under German privacy conventions.\nHelge B told judges that they took various things including cameras and videos - \"the biggest mistake of my life\" - and later watched the tapes at his mobile home.  \nHe claimed to have seen an \"old lady\" being raped on a bed and that he had then recognised Br\u00fcckner as the rapist when he removed a mask.\nAnother tape, he claimed, showed the rape of a girl, who told him in German: \"Hey, Christian you know what this is - it's rape.\" \nHelge B is also seen as a potentially key witness should Br\u00fcckner ever be charged in the Madeleine McCann case. \nHe has previously told German tabloid newspaper Bild, that when he discussed the British girl's disappearance with the suspect in 2008, Br\u00fcckner replied she \"didn't scream\". \nIn the past, Br\u00fcckner has referred to his claims as \"not even worthy of comment\". \nIn court on Wednesday, Br\u00fcckner's defence team sought to question Helge B's reliability as a witness.\nUnder cross-examination, the 52-year-old witness admitted to substance abuse between 2000 and 2010.\nWhen asked if he had been paid \u20ac5,000 (\u00a34,300) for the Bild interview, he replied: \"Could be.\"\nMadeleine McCann went missing from her family's Algarve holiday apartment in 2007, in what remains one of the most prominent missing persons cases in the world. \nGerman authorities have classed the three-year-old's disappearance as a murder inquiry, but no charges have been brought. \nThe trial continues.",
    "Two years of rising prices have left many people struggling to pay their bills and in debt.\nIf you are in that position one option is to seek a debt relief order (DRO). From 6 April in England and Wales there will no longer be a \u00a390 fee for applying for one.\nA DRO lets people who have got into severe difficulties start afresh.\nBut there are other ways to tackle your debt. So what can you do if you find yourself in difficulty?\nFirst, work out how much you owe, who to, and how much you need to pay each month, says the charity Citizens Advice.\nNext, create a budget by adding up your income, such as your wage and any benefits you receive, then taking away the amount you need for essential living costs like food and housing. The amount left is what you have available to pay your debts.\nOnce you have taken stock of your situation, see whether you can reduce your outgoings: you may be eligible for a reduction in your council tax or a lower tariff on your broadband or TV package for example. \nYou may also be able to boost your income. Check which benefits you are entitled to on the independent MoneyHelper website, backed by the government, or using benefits calculators run by Policy in Practice and charities Entitledto and Turn2us.\nIt is important to talk about your financial difficulties - the earlier, the better - or you may find yourself in a spiral of debt.\nIf you think you cannot pay your debts or are feeling overwhelmed, seek support. Help is available. A trained debt adviser can talk you through the options available.\nInformation and support is free of charge - here are some organisations who may be able to help.\nIdentify which bills and debts are most urgent and pay them first, says debt advice charity StepChange.\nThat will include your rent or mortgage repayments, and any other loans secured on the home. It also includes gas and electricity bills, child support and maintenance payments, council tax, income tax, VAT and other taxes, TV licence payments, court fines and payments.\nThese are all what are known as priority debts and bills, because there can be serious consequences if you do not pay them, such as losing your home or facing court proceedings.\nYou may have additional debts, such as credit card and store card debts, pay-day loans, buy-now-pay-later payments, overdrafts, unsecured loans and water bills. If you do not pay these off, their cost can spiral and could lead to legal action or bailiffs seizing your property.\nStepChange advises trying to make the minimum payments on every debt to avoid default charges, which can affect your credit rating. After that pay most towards whichever debt has the highest borrowing cost or interest rate.\nYour energy supplier must give you a chance to clear your debt through a payment plan - that means you agree to pay off the outstanding amount you owe, but spread out in smaller amounts over a longer period.\nIf you don't agree a plan they can switch you onto a pre-payment mode to make sure you do not fall further into arrears.\nPeople in England and Wales who are getting debt advice can apply for a break, lasting up to 60 days, as part of the \"breathing space\" scheme. It shields them from further interest and charges to prevent them falling into a spiral of debt.\nIf you are receiving mental health crisis treatment you can also apply for a breathing space scheme which lasts for the length of your treatment, plus another 30 days.\nConsultation is under way for a similar scheme in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, an alternative short-term debt relief system is known as a Statutory Moratorium and lasts for six months.\nIf you think there is no way to pay off your outstanding debts, you may have to consider some form of personal insolvency.\nThis should only be done after seeking advice. \nGoing through an insolvency process can have an impact on your personal and professional life, debt charities warn, and will affect your credit rating for up to six years.\nA debt relief order (DRO) is the easiest form of insolvency and is designed for people with few assets on low incomes. Your debts must not exceed \u00a330,000 (rising to \u00a350,000 at the end of June).\nIf your application is accepted, some of your debts will be frozen for one year, then written off. It previously cost \u00a390 to apply for a DRO but from 6 April it will be free if you live in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nAnother option is an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA). Under an IVA you make smaller payments over several years and then the rest of the debt is written off.\nFull bankruptcy, which is also usually completed within a year, can result in you having to sell assets such as a house or car to pay your debts.\nIf you live in Scotland, bankruptcy is known legally as sequestration. There are three alternatives: a Debt Arrangement Scheme, a Debt Management Plan, or a Trust Deed.",
    "A display of Vivienne Westwood clothing spanning 40 years offers \"something for everybody\", according to its curator.\nThe \"vast\" private collection features items from the designer's early days with Malcolm McLaren and punk, right up to recent times.\nIt was amassed by Lee Price, who worked for the designer for 18 years.\nSenior shoe curator Rebecca Shawcross said it was \"exciting\" to host the collection at Northampton Museum and Art Gallery.\n\"I think there will be something for everybody, really, so whether you like Vivienne Westwood or you don't like Vivienne Westwood, you'll find something in the exhibition where you'll think, 'Wow that's great, I'd love to have that and wear it',\" she said.\nWestwood, who died in 2022 aged 81, made her name with her controversial punk and new wave styles in the 1970s and went on to dress some of the biggest stars in fashion.\nMr Price, who grew up in the Kettering area, wore a lot of the men's pieces for work.\n\"In the mid-90s, standing at Kettering train station in a tartan bondage suit gives you confidence,\" he said.\n\"Being a quiet, shy kid at school, I found Westwood's clothes gave me the confidence - when you put it on you came into your comfort zone.\"\nMs Shawcross said of Mr Price: \"He is not only passionate about Vivienne Westwood, but also about the shoemaking history in Northampton and the county.\"\nThe industry's history in the county dates to the mid-19th Century, and Mr Price's parents and grandparents had shoe shops.\nInitially, the curator hoped to display just his Westwood shoe collection, but the final exhibition, which runs until 9 June, offers a far greater range of items.\n\"His collection is vast, spans from Vivienne Westwood's early days with Malcolm McLaren and punk right up to almost the present day, so we even have a tea set with her design on it.\"\nShe said the exhibition had been largely well-received so far.\n\"Occasionally, there might be someone who just thinks, 'What ridiculous clothing', but actually most people coming, it's something that they really want to see and they just really love Vivienne Westwood and what she stood for and how she made the clothes,\" she said.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "World Central Kitchen (WCK) founder Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s has accused Israeli forces in Gaza of targeting his aid workers \"systematically, car by car\".\nMonday's strike which killed seven members of his staff was not a mistake, he said, repeating that Israeli forces had been told of their movements.\nWCK workers from Australia, Canada, Poland, the UK and the US were killed as well as their Palestinian colleague.\nIsrael says the strike was a \"grave mistake\" and has apologised.\nIt has also promised an independent investigation. \nAccording to the charity, the aid convoy was hit while leaving the Deir al-Balah warehouse, \"where the team had unloaded more than 100 tonnes of humanitarian food aid brought to Gaza on the maritime route\".\nThe convoy was made up of three vehicles, including two that were armoured, which clearly displayed the charity's logo. All three were hit during the strike.\nSpeaking to Reuters news agency on Wednesday, the Spanish-American celebrity chef said this was not a \"bad luck situation where, 'oops,' we dropped the bomb in the wrong place\". \nIn a separate interview with Israel's Channel 12 news, Mr Andr\u00e9s said \"it was really a direct attack on clearly marked vehicles whose movements were known by everybody at the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]\".\nThe bodies of six of the dead WCK workers have since been taken from Gaza into Egypt to be repatriated. \nTheir Palestinian colleague was buried in his hometown in Rafah, southern Gaza, on Tuesday.\nHumanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip is in doubt after WCK - a key provider of aid to the territory - suspended operations.\nThe UN announced it was pausing movements at night for at least 48 hours to evaluate the security situation.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described the strike as unintentional.\n\"It happens in war, we check it to the end, we are in contact with the governments, and we will do everything so that this thing does not happen again,\" Mr Netanyahu said on Tuesday.\nIDF Chief of General Staff Herzi Halevi called the incident a \"grave mistake\" and said \"it shouldn't have happened,\" blaming the strike on misidentification.\nUS President Joe Biden has condemned the strike, accusing Israel of not doing enough to protect aid workers.\n\"The United States has repeatedly urged Israel to deconflict their military operations against Hamas with humanitarian operations, in order to avoid civilian casualties,\" Mr Biden said.\nThree of the killed aid workers were British nationals. A Polish national, an Australian, a Palestinian and a dual US-Canadian citizen were also killed.\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke to Mr Netanyahu on Tuesday. On the call, he described the situation in Gaza as \"increasingly intolerable\" and \"demanded a thorough and transparent independent investigation\" into the killing of the aid workers.\nMr Sunak added that Israel needed to end restrictions on humanitarian aid and protect civilians, according to a Downing Street statement.\nIn other reaction:\nFour days ago, WCK said that it had distributed 42 million meals in the Gaza Strip - dispatching more than 1,700 food trucks and also sending close to 435,000 meals by sea.\nAccording to Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body in charge of civilian policy in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, WCK is responsible for 60% of the non-governmental aid getting into the territory.\nA second charity, the American Near East Refugee Aid (Anera), which was working closely with WCK, told the BBC it was also freezing its operations in Gaza.\nMore than 196 aid workers have been killed in Gaza since October, according to the US-funded Aid Worker Security Database, which records major incidents of violence against aid personnel. Not all have been killed in the line of duty.\nMuch of the Gaza Strip has been devastated during the Israeli military operations that began after Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages.\nAbout 130 of the hostages remain in captivity, at least 34 of whom are presumed dead.\nMore than 32,916 people have been killed in Gaza since then, the Hamas-run health ministry says.",
    "Video released by US police shows the moment officers shot and killed a girl who they were attempting to rescue. \nIt was believed that Savannah Graziano had been kidnapped by her father - who was suspected of killing her mother.\nThe two were fatally shot in the 2022 incident. The video shows Savannah, 15, was hit while obeying officers' orders after a car chase and gun battle.\nPolice said they hope the video gives \"insight into the unfortunate events\", as an investigation continues. \nThe narrated footage provided by police includes video clips and audio from a police helicopter. It states that Savannah and her father, Anthony Graziano, were struck \"by deputy rounds and died of their injuries\". \nOfficials had not previously clarified whether Savannah had been fatally shot by officers or by her own 45-year-old father.\nThe footage, which also comprises witness dashcam clips, provides additional details of officers' long pursuit of a pickup truck driven by Graziano. Savannah was seated on the passenger side of the truck. \nSavannah had been living with her father in his truck and in hotels in the weeks prior to the episode, according to the Associated Press, with no allegations of wrongdoing by Graziano.\nHowever, officials put out an Amber Alert - a message warning the US public of a child abduction - for Savannah when her mother was shot dead the day before the chase unfolded on 27 September 2022. \nThe helicopter footage of the episode shows Graziano's truck speeding down a freeway. Narration added to the clips says shots were fired at officers from both sides of the vehicle. The alleged shooter is unclear.\nThe miles-long chase ends with Graziano surrounded by police cars at the side of the freeway near Hesperia, California. An \"extensive exchange of gunfire\" then broke out, according to the video narration.\nSavannah can be seen emerging from the vehicle. Audio from the belt recorder of the officer on the ground captures him telling her to come over, and she obeys.\nThe narration states that Savannah was wearing \"tactical gear and a helmet\", though this level of detail is not visible in the footage provided.\nA shot is fired, and audio from the helicopter captures an officer saying: \"Oh no.\" The officer on the ground tells colleagues to \"stop shooting her\" and that \"he's in the car\", referring to Graziano.\nFurther shots are heard. The narration says the officer continues to tell his colleagues to stop, \"but it was too late\".\nThe teenager was pronounced dead at hospital after attempts to give her medical aid. She was unarmed when she was shot.\nHer father, who was also fatally hit, was declared dead at the scene, according to the narration. It adds that multiple weapons and body armour were found in his vehicle. \nThe incident remains under an independent investigation by California's Department of Justice. The names of the officers involved in the incident have not been released.  \nSan Bernardino Sheriff Shannon Dicus said the footage had been released in the interests of transparency.\n\"My hope is that this video will be watched in its entirety and provide insight into the unfortunate events that unfolded that day,\" he said in a statement.\nSheriff Dicus said there had been \"speculation and misrepresentation\" of the case. He asked that the public wait to pass judgment until the state had finished its investigation. \nThe incident has again raised questions about the use of force by American police and of Mr Dicus's police department. \nHis officers faced criticism for last month's fatal shooting of an autistic 15-year-old boy, Ryan Gainer, who was having a mental health episode.",

After that pay most towards whichever debt has the highest borrowing cost or interest rate.\nYour energy supplier must give you a chance to clear your debt through a payment plan - that means you agree to pay off the outstanding amount you owe, but spread out in smaller amounts over a longer period.\nIf you don't agree a plan they can switch you onto a pre-payment mode to make sure you do not fall further into arrears.\nPeople in England and Wales who are getting debt advice can apply for a break, lasting up to 60 days, as part of the \"breathing space\" scheme. It shields them from further interest and charges to prevent them falling into a spiral of debt.\nIf you are receiving mental health crisis treatment you can also apply for a breathing space scheme which lasts for the length of your treatment, plus another 30 days.\nConsultation is under way for a similar scheme in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, an alternative short-term debt relief system is known as a Statutory Moratorium and lasts for six months.\nIf you think there is no way to pay off your outstanding debts, you may have to consider some form of personal insolvency.\nThis should only be done after seeking advice. \nGoing through an insolvency process can have an impact on your personal and professional life, debt charities warn, and will affect your credit rating for up to six years.\nA debt relief order (DRO) is the easiest form of insolvency and is designed for people with few assets on low incomes. Your debts must not exceed \u00a330,000 (rising to \u00a350,000 at the end of June).\nIf your application is accepted, some of your debts will be frozen for one year, then written off. It previously cost \u00a390 to apply for a DRO but from 6 April it will be free if you live in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nAnother option is an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA). Under an IVA you make smaller payments over several years and then the rest of the debt is written off.\nFull bankruptcy, which is also usually completed within a year, can result in you having to sell assets such as a house or car to pay your debts.\nIf you live in Scotland, bankruptcy is known legally as sequestration. There are three alternatives: a Debt Arrangement Scheme, a Debt Management Plan, or a Trust Deed.",
    "All except the shortest wars have times when killing is an unchanging, grim routine. There are also moments, like the last few days in the Middle East, when events leave belligerents and their allies at a crossroads with big decisions to make.  \nChoices are confronting leaders in the governments and armed forces in Israel and Tehran, at Hezbollah's HQ in the southern suburbs of Beirut and further afield in the Gulf, Europe and America. \nThe killing of foreign aid workers in Gaza might finally exhaust the considerable patience of Israel's allies, led by the United States. \nIsrael and Egypt have banned foreign journalists from entering Gaza, except on occasional, highly controlled and brief visits with the Israeli military. Belligerents need to win the media battle in an age of asymmetric warfare where victory or defeat can rely on perceptions as much as the realities of battle. Journalists are also denied access to a war when the parties fighting it have something to hide. \nBut even without foreign reporters on the scene, evidence is piling up that Israel is not, as it claims, respecting its obligations under the laws of war to respect civilian lives, or allowing the free movement of aid in a famine created by Israel's own actions. After the World Central Kitchen team was killed in Gaza, President Biden used his strongest language yet in public statements to condemn Israel's actions. \nThe president and his aides have now to decide whether words are enough. So far, they have resisted calls to put conditions on the use of American weapons in Gaza, or even to turn off the supply line. \nWhile the weapons still arrive, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who depends on hardline Jewish ultranationalists to stay in office, might feel he can still afford to defy President Biden. A major test will be the offensive Israel wants to attack Hamas in Rafah, plans the US believes would compound the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. American interests and Joe Biden's political prospects in an election year have already been damaged by what is seen in many countries as complicity with Israel. \nIn another change this week, Mr Netanyahu has come back to work after two days off for hernia surgery to huge demonstrations demanding his resignation and early elections for a new parliament. Deep cultural and political fissures between Israelis that were put to one side after 7 October are wide open again and being shouted about in the streets. The prime minister is in political trouble, blamed by his opponents for letting down Israel's guard so badly that Hamas detected a chance to attack. \nMillions of Israelis who believe they are fighting a just war against Hamas have no confidence in Mr Netanyahu. Their charge sheet includes prolonging the war to put off the moment when he is held accountable for his mistakes, failing to bring Israel's hostages home safely, and alienating vital allies starting with President Biden. Add to that the fact that after a huge onslaught over six months Hamas is still fighting, and its senior leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar is still alive somewhere in the Strip. \nAnother new set of calculations about the next stages of the crisis in the Middle East arise from the assassination of a senior Iranian general in Damascus, widely assumed in Israel to be the work of its air force. It was a coup for intelligence services that missed or ignored the Hamas attacks six months ago. It was also an escalation in the wider war in the region that will have consequences. \nSome of them may happen close to where I'm writing this, looking across the Sea of Galilee towards the Golan Heights, the large swathe of southern Syria that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed. As the crow flies, Damascus is less than 50 miles from here. The border with Lebanon is close by. At night, especially, there is constant Israeli air activity, with the roar of jets on patrol, or heading off to bomb Lebanon or Syria. \nA shadow war has been fought here in parallel with the war in Gaza since last October. It started with Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia and political movement attacking Israel, in support of Hamas in Gaza. It was not the onslaught that the Hamas leadership was hoping for - neither Hezbollah or its patrons in Tehran wanted an all-out war with Israel and, indirectly, its American backers. The Americans did not want that either and restrained Israel's instinct to respond in full force. \nBut Hezbollah still tied down thousands of Israeli troops and forced the evacuation of something like 80,000 civilians from the border areas. Israel's response, limited compared to earlier border wars, forced the displacement of at least as many civilians on the Lebanese side. \nSince the start of this year it has been different. Israel has been setting the pace, bombing its enemies deeper inside Lebanon and Syria. The biggest leap up the ladder of escalation came on Monday with the assassination by air strike on th",

    "The new energy price cap means gas and electricity bills have dropped by an average 12% in England, Scotland and Wales.\nFrom 1 April, the typical annual energy billfell to \u00a31,690 - the lowest price in two years.\nThe energy price cap covers 29 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is set every three months by the energy regulator Ofgem.\nIt fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit.\nFrom 1 April until 30 June, gas prices will be capped at 6p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24p per kWh. Previously, gas was 7.42p per kWh and electricity 28.62p per kWh.\nWhen prices soared after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the government introduced a temporary Energy Price Guarantee to limit bills. However, Ofgem is again responsible for deciding how much customers can be charged.\nThe cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Prices are also falling there.\nOfgem said that,as of 1 April, an average household paying by direct debit for dual fuel (gas and electricity) would pay \u00a31,690 a year, a drop of \u00a3238 from the previous cap.\nAlthough the overall cap has fallen, standing charges - a fixed daily amount which covers the costs of connecting to a supply - have increased.\nStanding charges are 60p a day for electricity and 31p a day for gas, although they vary by region.\nOfgem said more than 20,000 customers responded to its recent consultation about how standing charges work. \nThe regulator is also adding \u00a328 to everyone's bill over the year to cover the cost of dealing with \u00a33.1bn of debt that customers owe to suppliers.\nYour energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. \nThe type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, and how many people live there, are also relevant.\nThe Ofgem cap is based on a \"typical household\" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single contract for gas and electricity, which they pay by direct debit.\nThe vast majority of people pay their bill this way, to help spread payments across the year.\nThose who pay every three months by cash and cheque are charged more. Their typical annual bill from April will be \u00a31,796, which is \u00a3106 more a year than that of a direct debit customer.\nIn March, Ofgem said it was considering a range of options for changing the current energy cap system. \nThis could see a more \"dynamic\" price cap which might charge customers more during periods of peak demand. Prices could also drop when, for example, more energy is available from renewable sources such as when the wind blows.\nAs of 1 April, households with prepayment meters pay the same as those on direct debit. Previously they were charged more.\nAbout four million households had prepayment meters in July 2023, according to Ofgem. \nMany have been in place for years, but some meters were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay their bills. \nNew rules mean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter, and they cannot be installed at all in certain households.\nThe fall in energy prices raised hopes that suppliers would offer cheaper, fixed-price deals.\nThese offer certainty for a set period, but if prices drop further, people could find themselves stuck at the higher price.\nEnergy market analysts at Cornwall Insight predict the price cap will see a small fall in July, but increase again slightly in October.\nWhen considering switching to a fixed-price deal, Ofgem says people should seek independent advice and \"consider what is most important for them, whether that's the lowest price or the security of a fixed deal\".\nPrice comparison website Uswitch says it expects \"increased competition\" from suppliers, but warns that people to check any exit fees if they want to leave a fixed deal early.\nCertain groups - such as pensioners and those on some means-tested or disability benefits - received extra cost-of-living payments when bills soared. \nBut much of that extra support has now finished. \nThe \u00a3500m Household Support Fund, which the government introduced to help with costs in September 2021, had been due to end in March 2024. \nHowever, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced a six-month extension in the spring Budget. \nThe Warm Home Discount scheme continues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. \nThe government's Fuel Direct Scheme can help people to repay a debt from their benefit payments. \nIn addition, energy suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling to pay bills.\nMost suppliers also offer hardship grants.\nThe energy support scheme for businesses, which offered firms a discount on wholesale prices, expired at the end of March 2024.\nThe scheme offered a larger discount to heavy energy-using sectors, like glass,",

    "Energy prices have fallen from 1 April, but many households will still struggle to pay their bills.\nSome will need to repay debt to suppliers and many will worry about future levels of financial support. \nFrom April, energy bills fell by more than 12% for most people in England, Scotland and Wales.\nEnergy regulator Ofgem announced the average household paying for dual fuel by direct debit would nowpay \u00a31,690 a year.\nThat's a drop of \u00a3238 (or about \u00a320 a month) from the previous energy price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity used.\nIt's the lowest level in more than two years, a period when energy prices soared due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nAbout 5.3m people in Great Britain are in debt to their energy supplier, research by Citizens Advice suggests.\nThe charity says 1.7m people lost connection at least once a month in 2023 because they couldn't afford to top up their prepayment meter.\nIts survey found that 800,000 people went more than 24 hours without gas and electricity because they couldn't afford to top up. \nIt estimated that 2m people would lose their power supply for the same reason between January and March 2024.\nUnder Ofgem rules, your supplier must work with you to agree a payment plan. \nIf you don't agree one, they might try to force you to have prepayment meter installed or switch an existing smart meter to prepayment mode.\nIn very rare cases, if you haven't paid a bill after 28 days, you might be threatened with disconnection.\nIf you've reached state pension age, your supplier can't disconnect you between 1 October and 31 March if you either:\nSuppliers can pass your details to a debt collection agency - and you might be charged more to cover the cost of this.\nMany suppliers also charge extra fees for late payments.\nNon-payment could also damage your credit rating and make it harder to borrow money in the future. \nSuppliers can install a prepayment meter without a household's permission - but only if they meet certain requirements.\nThese were brought in after an investigation by The Times found debt agents acting for British Gas wrongly broke into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters. \nThe rules mean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts, contacting them at least 10 times before installing a meter. They also have to conduct a \"site welfare visit\". \nMeters cannot be fitted for:\nAbout four million households had a prepayment meter in July 2023, according to Ofgem.\nPrepayment meters used to be more expensive than paying by direct debit but the charges are now the same.\nIf you are struggling to pay your energy bills, you need to contact your supplier.\nYou can ask for a review of your payments and debt repayments, payment breaks or reductions, more time to pay and access to hardship funds.\nIf eligible you could be added to a list of households entitled to extra support, the Priority Services Register. \nIt doesn't cancel your debts but it does show that you are vulnerable, which your supplier should take into account. \nOfgem also recommends asking your supplier to add you to the Network Operator Register, if you rely on energy for medical reasons.\nMake sure you are claiming relevant benefits and government help. You can check the MoneyHelper benefits guide or use the Entitledto and Turn2us benefits calculators.\nPensioners, people on certain disability benefits, and households on means-tested benefits, can get help with energy bills.\nCouncils can offer help through the Household Support Fund, which has been extended for six months from March 2024.\nFinally, adjusting settings on your boiler can save money.",

So what can you do if you find yourself in difficulty?\nFirst, work out how much you owe, who to, and how much you need to pay each month, says the charity Citizens Advice.\nNext, create a budget by adding up your income, such as your wage and any benefits you receive, then taking away the amount you need for essential living costs like food and housing. The amount left is what you have available to pay your debts.\nOnce you have taken stock of your situation, see whether you can reduce your outgoings: you may be eligible for a reduction in your council tax or a lower tariff on your broadband or TV package for example. \nYou may also be able to boost your income. Check which benefits you are entitled to on the independent MoneyHelper website, backed by the government, or using benefits calculators run by Policy in Practice and charities Entitledto and Turn2us.\nIt is important to talk about your financial difficulties - the earlier, the better - or you may find yourself in a spiral of debt.\nIf you think you cannot pay your debts or are feeling overwhelmed, seek support. Help is available. A trained debt adviser can talk you through the options available.\nInformation and support is free of charge - here are some organisations who may be able to help.\nIdentify which bills and debts are most urgent and pay them first, says debt advice charity StepChange.\nThat will include your rent or mortgage repayments, and any other loans secured on the home. It also includes gas and electricity bills, child support and maintenance payments, council tax, income tax, VAT and other taxes, TV licence payments, court fines and payments.\nThese are all what are known as priority debts and bills, because there can be serious consequences if you do not pay them, such as losing your home or facing court proceedings.\nYou may have additional debts, such as credit card and store card debts, pay-day loans, buy-now-pay-later payments, overdrafts, unsecured loans and water bills. If you do not pay these off, their cost can spiral and could lead to legal action or bailiffs seizing your property.\nStepChange advises trying to make the minimum payments on every debt to avoid default charges, which can affect your credit rating. After that pay most towards whichever debt has the highest borrowing cost or interest rate.\nYour energy supplier must give you a chance to clear your debt through a payment plan - that means you agree to pay off the outstanding amount you owe, but spread out in smaller amounts over a longer period.\nIf you don't agree a plan they can switch you onto a pre-payment mode to make sure you do not fall further into arrears.\nPeople in England and Wales who are getting debt advice can apply for a break, lasting up to 60 days, as part of the \"breathing space\" scheme. It shields them from further interest and charges to prevent them falling into a spiral of debt.\nIf you are receiving mental health crisis treatment you can also apply for a breathing space scheme which lasts for the length of your treatment, plus another 30 days.\nConsultation is under way for a similar scheme in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, an alternative short-term debt relief system is known as a Statutory Moratorium and lasts for six months.\nIf you think there is no way to pay off your outstanding debts, you may have to consider some form of personal insolvency.\nThis should only be done after seeking advice. \nGoing through an insolvency process can have an impact on your personal and professional life, debt charities warn, and will affect your credit rating for up to six years.\nA debt relief order (DRO) is the easiest form of insolvency and is designed for people with few assets on low incomes. Your debts must not exceed \u00a330,000 (rising to \u00a350,000 at the end of June).\nIf your application is accepted, some of your debts will be frozen for one year, then written off. It previously cost \u00a390 to apply for a DRO but from 6 April it will be free if you live in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nAnother option is an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA). Under an IVA you make smaller payments over several years and then the rest of the debt is written off.\nFull bankruptcy, which is also usually completed within a year, can result in you having to sell assets such as a house or car to pay your debts.\nIf you live in Scotland, bankruptcy is known legally as sequestration. There are three alternatives: a Debt Arrangement Scheme, a Debt Management Plan, or a Trust Deed.",
    "Network Rail is aiming to turn hundreds of staff into \"amateur meteorologists\" as part of plans to deal with the effects of climate change.\nIt wants to help staff to interpret weather forecasts to make better decisions during storms or heatwaves.\nThe public rail body said it will spend \u00a32.8bn over the next five years on efforts to cope with extreme weather.\nIts boss Andrew Haines said climate change was \"the biggest challenge our railway faces\".\n\"The extreme weather of the past year that has seen an unprecedented 14 named storms, has taken its toll on our railway - with experts predicting more of the same to come,\" he said.\nAs the Earth's climate changes due to global warming, weather events such as heatwaves and storms are set to become more intense, and flooding more severe.\nIt has led to Network Rail, which owns and maintains the railways, \"relentlessly\" having to rebuild embankments and cuttings due to more landslips caused by heavier rain in a way that its predecessor British Rail never had to, a spokesman said.\nThe body said: \"Hundreds of key operational staff will attend Network Rail's new 'weather academy' to help make them 'amateur meteorologists'\".\nWorkers will be trained at the academy, which is a collaboration between Newcastle University, the Met Office, and MetDesk, a private weather forecasting firm.\nA spokesman for the body added: \"By training with actual meteorologists, our people will be better placed to make positive decisions when there is extreme weather, from speed restrictions to - in extreme circumstances - closing lines.\"\nThe controllers will not get a qualification, and their training will not replace the detailed forecasts Network Rail currently uses, but it will help them \"become more informed and well-rounded decision makers\", the spokesman said.\nAs well as weather training, Network Rail said it planned to increase and make drainage on rail lines more resilient. It is also aiming to recruit 400 more drainage engineers, strengthen cuttings and embankments, and install sensors to monitor movement and CCTV at flood sites.\nIt said deploying new technology would allow trains to run at higher speeds during stormy weather.\nInadequate drainage and heavy rain can cause serious or even fatal incidents on the railways. In 2020, a train derailed at Carmont in Aberdeenshire after hitting debris that had washed out of an improperly installed drainage ditch, killing three people and injuring six.\nNetwork Rail admitted to a series of failings and criminal charges in September 2023.\nBut while Network Rail has announced its \u00a345.4bn plan to mitigate the impact of climate change over the next five years, the amount is a cut in real terms of \u00a3200m compared with the previous period.\nWith funding being tighter, Network Rail said it would focus investment on \"the parts of the railway that affect the most people and the aspects that protect safety\".\nIt also plans to make cost savings of \u00a33.9bn.\nHowever, Bruce Williamson from campaign group Railfuture said passengers wanted a \"reliable railway\", which would only happen from \"regular, long-term investment to a high standard\". \nFewer than two thirds of trains in the UK were on time between October and December 2023, and roughly 5% of trains were cancelled.\nThis was for various reasons, including faults attributed to Network Rail, and faults by train operators.",
    "A GP surgery in Nottinghamshire dealing with \"overwhelming\" demand says more than 700 appointments have been missed already this year.\nJubilee Park Medical Centre, in Carlton, started sharing the number of daily missed appointments on a sign in the surgery to raise awareness.\nThe surgery had faced \"understandable\" complaints from patients struggling to get appointments, a senior GP said. \nHealth bosses said the number of available appointments have increased.\nIan Campbell, GP and senior partner of the Carlton surgery, said staff \"shared the desperation that patients feel\".\n\"We've had people who phone and book in at 09:00 and then don't show up,\" the GP said. \nDr Campbell added the practice was not intending to be \"punitive\" by sharing the notice but instead wanted to highlight the issue. \n\"If people can't make an appointment, we'll give it to somebody else but if they don't tell us, it's just another appointment that goes to waste,\" he said. \nOne patient of the surgery said \"it's too hard to get an appointment now\". \nKelly Rosen, 43, said: \"I've had a routine appointment before and I've waited a month-and-a-half for it. \n\"I know at the end of the day I'm going to that appointment because I won't get seen again.\" \nMissed appointments in the county cost the NHS more than \u00a3600,000 in the first two months of the year, according to the doctors' union The British Medical Association (BMA).\nA BMA spokesperson said: \"In Nottinghamshire, in January and February, there were about 15,000 missed appointments and that has cost the NHS roughly \u00a3630,000.\" \nThe spokesperson added more needed to be done to tackle the issue. \nAccording to figures published by the NHS, in January 26,583 appointments were missed out of 683,628 across 130 GP practices in Nottingham and the county. \nA further 38,996 were recorded as being \"unknown\" as to whether they were attended or not. \nIn February, 25,044 out of 645,406 appointments were unattended with 38,996 recorded as \"unknown\". Figures for March have not been published.  \nThe Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Integrated Care Board (ICB) said the number of appointments being provided have \"significantly increased in the last 12 months\" and many practices sent reminders to patients via text message. \nVictoria McGregor-Riley, commissioning delivery director at the ICB said: \"Sadly, patients failed to attend more than 25,000 GP appointments in Nottingham and Nottinghamshire in February this year alone. \n\"Although this counts for less than 4% of the 645,000 appointments provided in the same month, it is still a significant drain on NHS resources and precious GP practice time.\n\"We'd encourage people to download the NHS app to keep a track of their appointments and always cancel if they no longer need it.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf has said the SNP would like to see a conclusion to the marathon police inquiry into its funding and finances.\nOperation Branchform was launched in July 2021 and on Friday it will be a year since police arrested the SNP's former chief executive Peter Murrell.\nHis wife, former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, was arrested in June. Both were released without charge.\nMr Yousaf told BBC Scotland News he would like the inquiry to be over.\nBut he said Police Scotland should take as much time as they need.\nAfter his early morning arrest on 5 April, the police spent the day searching the home Mr Murrell shares with Ms Sturgeon in Glasgow.\nImages of a police tent in the couple's front garden dominated news bulletins and front pages and sent shockwaves around the country.\nPolice insiders said they needed the tent so they could examine potential evidence without being filmed or photographed by the media.\nIts use and the scale of the police operation angered many in the SNP and a year on, with a general election on the way, the protracted inquiry is the cause of growing disquiet among party members.\nMr Murrell's arrest 12 months ago was followed by that of the party's former treasurer Colin Beattie, who was also released without charge.\nMs Sturgeon attended a police interview by arrangement on 11 June.\nAfterwards she told reporters: \"I respect and fully understand the process that's underway but I am absolutely certain that I have done nothing wrong and that is a position that I will continue to maintain.\"\nAsked this week if he was frustrated over the length of time being taken by the inquiry, Mr Yousaf replied: \"Well, I think people will realise that all of us in the SNP would like to see a conclusion to Operation Branchform.\n\"I think that's stating the obvious but, of course, it's up to Police Scotland to determine how long that takes and for them to have the space and time to investigate thoroughly and I don't intend to interfere in that.\n\"It's for Police Scotland to take as much time as they require in order to investigate thoroughly.\"\nThe investigation originally centred on \u00a3600,000 which had been raised for a second campaign for independence.\nIn July last year, the then chief constable Sir Iain Livingstone shed some light on why it was taking so long. \nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that inquiries around \"fraud or potential embezzlement or misuse of funds\" take time.\nSir Iain said investigators needed to obtain information from banks and other financial institutions, which required judicial warrants.\nIn a later interview Sir Iain said the sooner the investigation was concluded, the better for everyone involved.\nBut he added the force was duty bound to carry out its work as rigorously as possible.\nAnother source with knowledge of the case put it this way: \"It will take as long as it takes.\"\nSince her appointment, the new Chief Constable Jo Farrell has refused to discuss the case.\nIn a statement, Police Scotland said: \"As the investigation remains ongoing we are unable to comment.\"\nThe next expected step is for the police to send what is called a standard prosecution report to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS).\nIts lawyers would then decide what action, if any, should be taken.\nNo-one is saying when that might happen and the Crown has confirmed that, as yet, no-one has been reported for prosecution.\nA spokesperson said: \"Senior professional prosecutors from COPFS and an advocate depute are working with police on this ongoing investigation.\n\"The duration of any investigation will vary depending on its individual circumstances.\n\"As is routine, to protect the integrity of ongoing investigations, we do not comment in detail on their conduct.\"\nThe senior law officers at the top of the Crown Office are not involved in the process because the case involves politicians.\nThe Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain KC and her deputy Solicitor General Ruth Charteris KC are the Scottish government's principal legal advisors and members of the Scottish cabinet.\nThe Crown Office spokesperson said: \"It is standard practise that any case regarding politicians is dealt with by prosecutors without the involvement of the Law Officers.\n\"All Scotland's prosecutors act independently of political interference.\"",
    "Three men suspected of being involved in the stabbing of an Iranian TV host in south London have left the UK, the Metropolitan Police has said.\nPouria Zeraati, 36, was stabbed outside his home in Wimbledon on Friday afternoon.\nHe has since been discharged from hospital.\nCdr Dominic Murphy said: \"We have identified three suspects who we believe left the UK within hours of the attack.\"\nThe Met did not say where the men may have gone.\nDetectives have established Mr Zeraati was approached by two men in a residential street and stabbed before the pair fled in a blue Mazda 3 driven by a third male.\nThe car was found abandoned in the nearby New Malden area shortly after.\n\"We have established that after abandoning the vehicle, the suspects travelled to Heathrow Airport and have left the UK,\" Cdr Murphy said in an update.\n\"We are now working with international partners to establish further details.\"\nHe added the Met was not yet able to provide further information about any motive, but Mr Zeraati's occupation, coupled with recent threats towards UK-based Iranian journalists, meant the investigation continued to be led by counter-terrorism officers.\nThe Iranian regime has denied any involvement. \nOne eyewitness, who did not want to be named, told the BBC they saw two men, dressed in black tracksuits with hoods, sprinting down the road from where the stabbing happened.\n\"They got 30-40 yards from us on our side of the road coming towards us. They were running side by side - and I saw the car,\" they said.\nThe witness added a third man was waiting in a blue car parked near a junction, which the men got into and it quickly drove away.\nThe men seemed casual and the witness added they did not see any weapons or blood.\nOn Monday, Mr Zeraati thanked well-wishers for their \"sympathy, kindness and love in the past few days\". \n\"Fortunately, I am feeling better, recovering and I have been discharged from the hospital,\" he posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. \n\"My wife and I are residing at a safe place under the supervision of the Met Police.\"\nMr Zeraati, the host of the Last Word on Iran International, claimed the suspects had purposefully planned the attack.\nIran International says it provides independent coverage of events in the country, but the regime in Tehran has declared it a terrorist organisation.\nThe channel's spokesman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) had been targeting journalists and their families.\nAdam Baillie said: \"It was a shocking, shocking incident, whatever the outcome of an investigation reveals.\n\"But for him as a leading presenter, as with our other presenters and journalists, yes, it is a great shock.\n\"It's the first attack of its kind.\"\nIran's charge d'affaires in the UK, Mehdi Hosseini Matin, said \"we deny any link\".\nNearly 18 months ago, Iran International became one of the main providers of news during a wave of anti-government protests in Iran.\nIn January this year, the Foreign Office announced sanctions against members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp - one of the most powerful paramilitary organisations in the Middle East - following an ITV investigation into plans to assassinate two of the channel's presenters in the UK.\nIran International resumed its operations in London last September after temporarily moving its broadcasting studios to Washington DC in February 2023 because of a \"significant escalation in state-backed threats from Iran\".\nIn a separate case in December last year, Magomed-Husejn Dovtaev, a Chechen-born Austrian national, was jailed for three-and-a-half years for spying on Iran International before a \"planned attack\" on UK soil.\nAccording to the Met, 15 plots to either kidnap or kill UK-based individuals perceived as enemies of the Iranian regime have been foiled since the start of 2022.\nIn 2022, two British-Iranian journalists working for Iran International were warned of a possible risk to their lives by the Met.",
    "Rishi Sunak is facing growing pressure over UK arms sales to Israel, after the killing of seven aid workers by an Israeli strike in Gaza.\nThe Liberal Democrats, Scottish National Party (SNP) and a former UK national security adviser are calling for sales to be suspended now.\nLabour says sales must stop if government lawyers believe Israel risks breaching international law.\nThe prime minister says the UK has a \"very careful\" arms licensing regime.\nSpeaking to the Sun, he called for an independent investigation into the Israeli strike, but stopped short of saying arms sales should end.\nHe added that the UK had been \"consistently clear\" with Israel that it must follow international humanitarian law. \nDescribing the deaths as \"an awful tragedy,\" he said the UK wanted to see \"a dramatic increase in the amount of aid getting into Gaza\".\nBritons John Chapman, James Henderson and James Kirby, who were all military veterans, were working alongside food aid charity World Central Kitchen as security and safety advisors when their convoy was attacked from the air on Monday. \nThe other individuals killed in the strike were aid workers Lalzawmi \"Zomi\" Frankcom, an Australian national, American-Canadian dual citizen Jacob Flickinger, Polish national Damian Sobol and Palestinian Saifeddin Issam Ayad Abutaha.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the attack as unintended and \"tragic\", promising an independent investigation.\nSpeaking to the BBC earlier, former national security advisor Lord Ricketts called for the UK to halt arms sales, saying it would send a \"powerful message\" and encourage a similar debate in the United States. \n\"I think there's abundant evidence now that Israel hasn't been taking enough care to fulfil its obligations on the safety of civilians,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \nSir Alan Duncan, an ex-Tory MP and former Foreign Office minister, has also joined calls for a suspension, writing in the Independent that further arms sales \"cannot be justified\".\nLabour has not called for a suspension, but is urging the government to publish internal legal advice on whether Israel is in breach of international law.\n\"If it says there is a clear risk that UK arms might be used in a serious breach of international humanitarian law, it's time to suspend the sale of those arms,\" added shadow foreign secretary David Lammy.\nHe told reporters there was \"precedent\" for suspending sales. Former PMs Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair both took the move, in 1982 and 2002 respectively. \nThe SNP is calling for Parliament to be recalled from its current Easter break, ending on 15 April, to debate whether arms sales to Israel should be stopped.\nConservative MP Paul Bristow said the idea British-made arms could be used in action that kills innocent civilians in Gaza \"turns the stomach,\" adding the deaths of British aid workers \"must be a line in the sand\".\nBut his fellow Tory MP and former home secretary Suella Braverman rejected the idea of a ban, telling the BBC \"we owe it to Israel to stand with them\".\nSpeaking during a trip to Israel, she said: \"I think that it would be a tragic shame if we were to walk away from our closest ally in this region\".\nShe added that UK arms exports to Israel were \"relatively small\" and \"the Israeli government will carry on with or without the provision of UK arms\".\nAsked if he backed calls for arms sales to Israel to be suspended, the prime minister told the Sun: \"We've always had a very careful export licensing regime that we adhere to. There are a set of rules regulations and procedures that we'll always follow.\n\"And I've been consistently clear with Prime Minister Netanyahu since the start of this conflict that whilst of course we defend Israel's right to defend itself and it's people against attacks from Hamas, they have to do that in accordance with humanitarian law, protect civilian lives, get more aid into Gaza.\"\nArms export licences, which are granted by the business department, cannot be issued if there is a clear risk the weapons could be used in a serious violation of international humanitarian law.\nThe UK has licenced arms to Israel worth over \u00a3574m since 2008, when official country-level data was made available, according to pressure group Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT).\nBusiness Minister Greg Hands has previously told MPs the figure for 2022, \u00a342m, represented 0.02% of Israel's military imports that year.\nBritish sales are lower than those of other countries, including Germany and Italy, and dwarfed by the billions supplied by its largest arms supplier, the United States.\nBut a UK ban would nevertheless add diplomatic and political pressure on Israel, at a time when its conduct in the Gaza conflict is coming under renewed international scrutiny. \nLast week, a cross-party group of more than 130 MPs and peers wrote to Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron calling for an immediate suspension of export licenses for arms sales to Israel. \nMuch of the Gaza Strip has been de",

There's a lot more [people on] forums talking about their diagnosis and support [but] there's still a struggle. \n\"I think society still has a long way to go with regards to understanding autism, but I understand it is a two-way communication. \n\"There needs to be more autistic people involving the neurotypical community, we need to have more of a conversation rather than being against each other.\n\"We want to be friends, it shouldn't be divided.\" \nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Tapping into the potential of Ebrington Square in Londonderry could see thousands more tourists visit the city, a music promoter has said.\nKieran Dunlop said a special working group should be set up to attract big names in the world of art and entertainment.\nSeveral music events have been confirmed to take place in the square in the coming months \u2013 including electronic, pop, dance and some 1980s nostalgia.\nMr Dunlop, of Music Capital, commented that \"short time frames\" were preventing bigger acts performing at the venue. \n\n\"If you want to book some of the bigger acts you would need at least a year to 18 months in advance notice,\" he said.\n\"I mean some of the time frames we have been given could be as little as three to four months and that makes it very difficult.\"\nMr Dunlop said a working group should be established with a team to work on the site and with promoters. \nHe added that the group could also work to promote and \"positively enhance\" the venue. \nEbrington Square has hosted many big concerts over the years creating magical moments for concert goers.\nDiscussions are now under way to map out a strategy for developing an area that has become known as the Peoples' Square. \nThe council and The Executive Office are working together on that strategy.\nThere was controversy last year when the Ebrington Hotel threatened legal action over a concert plan for the Square. \nThat objection was withdrawn after a public backlash. \nNow the council and The Executive Office - which owns the venue - is engaging with a range of promoters and businesses - among others - to agree a way forward.\nThe general manager of one newly-opened bar and restaurant said the area's potential is huge. \nJason Foody from Stitch and Weave \u2013 which is based in one of the old Army blocks on the square \u2013 remains optimistic about the future.\nHe said anything that brings people to the area will benefit the community and the businesses in the square. \n\"That will attract national and international tourists we would hope as well,\" he said.\n\u201cSo, the opening of the square and the more and more events that are on the square that\u2019s hugely important and will make businesses successful here.\"\nMr Foody said that could see his business hire more staff and could extend opening hours from five days a week to seven. \nA spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said: \u201cThe council will continue to work with The Executive Office to help deliver successful events in this hugely important strategic event space.\u201d",

head.\n\u201cEvery time I show people [the pictures], they can\u2019t believe people were sending me home with my eye like that.\u201d\nMr Oladapo first spotted a small bruise on his right eye in May 2022 but assumed it would \u201cgo down\u201d over time.\nHe then noticed swelling around the eye, leading him to book a GP appointment, but after completing vision tests, he said doctors \u201csent him on [his] way\u201d.\nAlthough Mr Oladapo\u2019s vision was unaffected, the swelling progressively worsened and he said he visited the A&E department at Croydon University Hospital several times.\n\u201cEvery time I went to A&E, they did the same visual test repeatedly, and then afterwards they would just send me home,\u201d Mr Oladapo said.\nMr Oladapo decided to visit the A&E department at St George\u2019s on 3 June 2022 for a second opinion, and St George\u2019s University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has said he was referred for ongoing care.\nMr Oladapo said his parents then paid \u00a3300 for a private medical consultation for him, where the same visual tests were completed, with the consultant \u201cnot sure\u201d what was wrong.\nMr Oladapo continued to monitor his eye, but over the following days the swelling worsened and he started to experience double vision and noticed his eye was \u201cpointing slightly towards the right\u201d.\nThe 24-year-old said he was told by a doctor it was possible he had \u201csomething pressing on his brain\u201d but when he visited Croydon University Hospital again, he said staff completed the same visual test.\n\u201cIn total, before I actually got anywhere with this, I think I went to hospital nine times before anybody told me [the right diagnosis],\u201d he said.\n\u201cMy eye was coming out of my face, it went yellow \u2013 it was so horrible.\u201d\nOver the following days he said he could no longer close his eye.\n\u201cThere was pus all over my eye, there was liquid on my face, the eye was going yellow,\u201d he said\nMr Oladapo then visited Moorfields at St George\u2019s, where he said his eye was stitched shut on 8 June in order to prevent further infection.\nAfter having a scan, Mr Oladapo was told by doctors that a mass was causing his eye to protrude and he said a biopsy during surgery on 10 June revealed it was a cancerous tumour, specifically embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma \u2013 a type of soft tissue cancer.\n\u201cWhenever you hear cancer, you just assume that people die \u2013 that\u2019s just what you know,\u201d Mr Oladapo said.\n\u201cMy granddad passed away, my friend\u2019s dad passed away, so that\u2019s all I\u2019ve known \u2013 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve spoken to anyone who\u2019s had cancer and lived to tell the tale.\u201d\nMr Oladapo started eight rounds of chemotherapy in June 2022 followed by three more rounds in January 2023.\nMr Oladapo, who is 6ft 5in (195cm) tall, suffered complications during treatment in August 2022, leading him to spend two weeks in intensive care where he was \u201cin and out of consciousness\u201d, and his weight dropped from 85kg (13st 4lbs) to 60kg (9st 4lbs).\n\u201cI literally just looked like a bag of bones, I looked like a skeleton,\u201d Mr Oladapo said.\nWhile he said he had been left with slight blurred vision in his right eye, he has reached remission and will continue to have check-ups over the next 10 years.\nHe said he felt proud that he was able to complete his degree and had since achieved his FA Level 1 in Coaching Football, and would soon start his new role as a business and commercial banking analyst.\nHe urged others who may be in similar situation to \"trust your gut\" and \"don't wait till it's too late\".\nA spokesperson for Croydon Health Services NHS Trust said: \u201cWe are sorry to hear that Mr Oladapo was unhappy with the care he received.\n\u201cDuring his first attendance at our Emergency Department on 19 May 2022, an urgent referral was made to Moorfields Eye Hospital, a specialist in eye care.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: \u201cMr Oladapo\u2019s case was complex.\n\u201cThe rare form of cancer

    "Energy prices have fallen from 1 April, but many households will still struggle to pay their bills.\nSome will need to repay debt to suppliers and many will worry about future levels of financial support. \nFrom April, energy bills fell by more than 12% for most people in England, Scotland and Wales.\nEnergy regulator Ofgem announced the average household paying for dual fuel by direct debit would nowpay \u00a31,690 a year.\nThat's a drop of \u00a3238 (or about \u00a320 a month) from the previous energy price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity used.\nIt's the lowest level in more than two years, a period when energy prices soared due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nAbout 5.3m people in Great Britain are in debt to their energy supplier, research by Citizens Advice suggests.\nThe charity says 1.7m people lost connection at least once a month in 2023 because they couldn't afford to top up their prepayment meter.\nIts survey found that 800,000 people went more than 24 hours without gas and electricity because they couldn't afford to top up. \nIt estimated that 2m people would lose their power supply for the same reason between January and March 2024.\nUnder Ofgem rules, your supplier must work with you to agree a payment plan. \nIf you don't agree one, they might try to force you to have prepayment meter installed or switch an existing smart meter to prepayment mode.\nIn very rare cases, if you haven't paid a bill after 28 days, you might be threatened with disconnection.\nIf you've reached state pension age, your supplier can't disconnect you between 1 October and 31 March if you either:\nSuppliers can pass your details to a debt collection agency - and you might be charged more to cover the cost of this.\nMany suppliers also charge extra fees for late payments.\nNon-payment could also damage your credit rating and make it harder to borrow money in the future. \nSuppliers can install a prepayment meter without a household's permission - but only if they meet certain requirements.\nThese were brought in after an investigation by The Times found debt agents acting for British Gas wrongly broke into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters. \nThe rules mean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts, contacting them at least 10 times before installing a meter. They also have to conduct a \"site welfare visit\". \nMeters cannot be fitted for:\nAbout four million households had a prepayment meter in July 2023, according to Ofgem.\nPrepayment meters used to be more expensive than paying by direct debit but the charges are now the same.\nIf you are struggling to pay your energy bills, you need to contact your supplier.\nYou can ask for a review of your payments and debt repayments, payment breaks or reductions, more time to pay and access to hardship funds.\nIf eligible you could be added to a list of households entitled to extra support, the Priority Services Register. \nIt doesn't cancel your debts but it does show that you are vulnerable, which your supplier should take into account. \nOfgem also recommends asking your supplier to add you to the Network Operator Register, if you rely on energy for medical reasons.\nMake sure you are claiming relevant benefits and government help. You can check the MoneyHelper benefits guide or use the Entitledto and Turn2us benefits calculators.\nPensioners, people on certain disability benefits, and households on means-tested benefits, can get help with energy bills.\nCouncils can offer help through the Household Support Fund, which has been extended for six months from March 2024.\nFinally, adjusting settings on your boiler can save money.",
    "In the aftermath of the shooting that saw a 12-year-old kill another child and injure two in the city of Vantaa, north of the capital Helsinki, the headlines in Finland have been full of soul-searching.\n\"What kind of events led to such an extreme act?\"\n\"How could a 12-year-old get hold of a gun?\"\n\"Could the incident have been prevented somehow?\"\nFew of these questions have had answers so far. \nInstead, harrowing details about the events in Vantaa have continued to emerge.\nThe boy wore a mask and noise-cancelling headphones, showing his actions were premeditated. He shot his victims on a school premises they all knew well and spent time in every day. The two girls he wounded are still in a serious condition in hospital. \nMost shocking of all, the killer was 12 years old.  \nThere have been other school shootings in Finland, although not many: this was only the fourth in the country's history. \n\"In this case the shooter and the victims are really too young,\" Tomi Kiilakoski, youth researcher at the University of Tampere, told the BBC. \"We are really talking about children - and that shocks us.\"\nSquaring up the brutality of the crime with the young age of the suspect was difficult, he said, and the incident came as \"a big shock for children, for the community, for young people and for the whole of Finnish society\".\nPolice revealed on Wednesday that the suspect had indicated the motive behind the shooting was that he had been bullied, and their initial inquiry had confirmed that.\nThis is likely to worry many Finnish parents. Bullying is very difficult to eradicate, and relatively widespread: studies show that 8.6% of children between the ages of 10-11 in Finland are bullied every week. \nOf course, victims of bullying rarely end up killing others, but bullying often features as one of the reasons for extreme acts of violence. \nAfter two school shootings in 2007 and 2008 left 18 dead, a police inspector said that a \"system of pre-emptive measures\" had been built in that allowed police to intervene if they received information on a \"person's intent to stage an attack\". \nOn Tuesday, Finland's National Police Commissioner Seppo Kolehmainen had to admit that system had failed.\nHenri Rikander, associate professor of police law at the University of Eastern Finland, told the BBC that out of the 60-100 potential mass shootings Finnish police investigate each year, about 20 are typically in the last stages of preparation and can be classified as \"serious\". \nIn the Vantaa case, the boy does not appear to have talked about his plans with anybody - and so may have fallen through the cracks.\nThat has left Finns wondering how to prevent such a tragedy from happening again.\nAs it stands, the Vantaa suspect will not face charges and has been placed in the care of social services - so some sections of Finnish society are calling for the age of criminal responsibility to be lowered from 15.\nLast summer, Interior Minister Mari Rantanen of Finland's far-right Finns Party said the age should be lowered in order to \"break the cycle of crime\" among those younger than 15. \nJani Makela, chairman of the Finns Party parliamentary group, told the BBC that \"there have been cases in which the 15-year age limit is suspected to have been exploited on purpose\".\nBut others disagree that such a move would have any preventative effect. \nProf Rikander said violent episodes should be prevented through social intervention rather than \"official control\". \nHarmful or worrying behaviour in others was easier to spot in contexts like sports clubs, schools or at home, he explained, but the \"increasing isolation\" of young people meant that worrying signs were being missed.\n\"The most important thing is preventative measures,\" said Tomi Kiilakoski. \"What I would hope to see is a societal discussion on how we can provide services for children and young people in supporting their growth.\"\nIt is not yet known how a 12-year-old was able to get hold of a firearm. But we do know it belonged to a close relative and weapons are not hard to come by in Finland. With its vast open spaces and woodland, it calls itself a country of \"hunters and gun enthusiasts\". \nAccording to the interior ministry, there are more than 1.5 million licensed firearms in Finland and about 430,000 people with licences, meaning almost 8% of Finland's 5.6 million residents have a gun licence. There is no limit to the number of guns that can be owned. \nSo far, there has been little discussion around tightening gun legislation. \"We are proud of ourselves for being close to nature and hunting is a part of that,\" said Tomi Kiilakoski, adding that fatal shootings in Finland were low despite the high number of guns.\nThe boy's relatives will now have to explain how the revolver-type handgun came into the child's possession. Finnish legislation states that firearms must be \"locked in such a way that the firearm... cannot be easily stolen\". This appears not to have been the case.\nThe Viertola school where ",

They're so passionate about what they do.\n\"Change is not something that will happen overnight but we will not let it drop. We will keep pushing and pushing. We want this level of service across the board.\"\nDepartment head Det Sgt David Thomason said: \"Richard and Alison shouldn't have to be here. I'm pleased they are but it's a bittersweet thing.\n\"They're saying what victims, families, people who have lost children over the years have been saying for decades. It's the same mistakes, the same victim blaming, the same apathy. That's why we're so determined to make change.\"\nFollowing the inquest into Miss Spinks' death, Derbyshire police admitted it had \"failed\" her.\nSeveral months before her death, she had made a report about Michael Sellers being \"obsessed\" with her.\nTwo dog walkers also found a bag of weapons belonging to Sellers, but police did not investigate the bag and instead treated it as \"found property\".\nDerbyshire's Deputy Chief Constable Simon Blatchly said the force had made significant improvements to how it investigates stalking and supports victims, including training for all staff and the introduction of a civil orders team to manage and apply for Stalking Protection Orders.\nHe said: \"Through the role of the stalking coordinator - who reviews every stalking incident - early identification of the most serious cases is now helping ensure those who are most at risk are supported and protected quickly and effectively. \n\"Victims are also supported by two stalking advocate roles who help victims report offences to the police, support them through the criminal justice process and ensure they have safety plans and home security.\"\nMiss Spinks' parents are campaigning for Gracie's Law, calling for all police forces to be required to employ independent stalking advocates (ISAs). ISAs provide help and support for victims throughout the process of reporting a crime and any legal proceedings that follow.\nMrs Ward said the family needed to push forward with their campaigning work \"for our own sanity\".\nVictoria Lowry, one of the ISAs at Cheshire HRU, said: \"I'm not saying that having me in Gracie's area would have saved her, but it would have given her space to vent.\n\"I am not a police officer, I am someone to talk to, to explain steps to keep you safe. We know what we're talking about and can guide you through the process.\"\nThe coroner who led the inquest into Miss Spinks' death said there was a \"postcode lottery\" of support available for stalking victims.\nAssistant coroner Matthew Kewley said he was \"reassured\" to hear Derbyshire police had a stalking advocate in place but was concerned by a \"lack of consistency and availability of stalking advocates to victims of stalking across the UK\".\nA BBC Breakfast investigation found that of 40 forces who responded, 14 had a stalking advocate in place. Twenty-three did not have any advocacy service available.\nA number of other forces, including Derbyshire, have asked Cheshire police for support in how they treat victims of stalking.\nDet Sgt Thomason said: \"Most forces recognise they can and should adapt their response. \n\"With stalking, the stakes are always so high. One thing that we have learned is that there's no one-size-fits-all approach. These services have to be adapted to work in their local area.\"\nA government spokesperson said: \"The death of Gracie Spinks was a tragedy and we offer our deepest condolences to her family and friends.\n\"As part of the Home Office's Domestic Abuse and Stalking Perpetrator Intervention Fund, we are funding stalking projects in a number of areas which includes support for victims, for example independent stalking advocates. \n\"We have also seen a year-on-year increase in stalking offences charged since 2017, and remain determined for perpetrators to face the full force of the law.\"",
    "A jeweller who was injured by hammer-wielding robbers said he was \"lucky to be alive\" after his business was targeted last week.\nTwo masked men went into Bourbon-Hanby Arcade on Sydney Street, Chelsea, at about midday on 26 March, and smashed counters and threatened staff.\nIan Towning, 76, says he now cannot sleep after more than \u00a3100,000 worth of jewellery was stolen from the arcade.\nThe Metropolitan Police has appealed for witnesses to come forward.\nWarning: this story contains images that some might find distressing\nMr Towning, who has featured on ITV and Channel 4 antiques television shows, said he was hit with a sledgehammer during the robbery, while his security guard Mark was hit on the back of his head. \nHe said he was working at the counter on jewellery repairs when the men entered the premises and began \"smashing the place\".\n\"They pushed me to the floor. They beat me up. I got up.

It could've been very serious. \n\"But, luckily - thank God - he's going to be okay.

    "An advert posted by Katie Price on Instagram, which promoted a low-calorie diet for The Skinny Food Co, has been banned by the advertising watchdog.\nIn the video, posted last August, the former glamour model detailed her meals adding up to only 755 calories a day.\nThe NHS states the recommended daily intake is around 2,000 calories a day for women and 2,500 for men.\nThe Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the ad was \"irresponsible\" and must not appear again.\nPrice has taken down the advert from her Instagram account.\nIn the Instagram Reel for the diet food firm, the TV personality was seen making meals for herself throughout the day and talking about her efforts to lose weight.\nHer day started with porridge and a \"delicious\" coffee with zero calorie syrup.\nFor lunch, she had a wrap with zero-calorie garlic mayonnaise sauce on top, while dinner consisted of a low-calorie chicken tikka curry.\nThe video ended with Price having low-calorie chocolate malt balls as a post-dinner snack.\nIn her caption for the video, Price wrote: \"All of this was only 755 calories and helping me stay in a calorie deficit to shift some extra pounds when needed.\"\nPrice said her children also \"loved\" the products, adding: \"If I have a bad day I like to go in a calorie deficit to ensure it's not a bad week!\"\nThe ASA said that it had received two complaints that the advert irresponsibly promoted a low-calorie diet.\nIn the UK, adverts promoting diets that fall below 800 calories must do so only for short-term use and must encourage users to take medical advice before embarking on them.\nBut the ASA found that the The Skinny Food Co advert included no explicit instruction that the diet must only be followed on a short-term basis, nor any reference to the need to take medical advice before embarking on it.\nIt warned that consumers would understand from the ad that they could choose to follow a similar diet, that fell below 800 calories a day, without taking medical advice, until they achieved their desired weight.\n\"For the above reasons, we concluded that the ad irresponsibly promoted a diet that fell below 800 kcal a day,\" the ASA said.\nThe ASA also received one complaint that the post was not obviously recognisable as an advert.\nNot Guilty Food Co Ltd, which trades as The Skinny Food Co, said that the reel included the hashtag #ad. It also said it could not control what Price ate, but that being in a \"calorie deficit\" was a proven way to achieve weight loss.\nBut the ASA said the hashtag #ad was not visible without expanding the text.\nIt therefore concluded that the label was insufficiently prominent to obviously identify the post as an advert from the outset.\nIt also told The Skinny Food Co and Price to ensure that future adverts were obviously identifiable as marketing communications, and the commercial intent was made clear, and that identifiers such as #ad were clearly displayed.\nPrice subsequently agreed to remove the advert, saying she followed a calorie deficit approach, which she believed many people in the UK did. She also asked for further information on how to make similar posts compliant in future.\nFinally, the ASA also found that because the advert made specific health claims that were not authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register, it broke the rules.\n\"We also told them to ensure that their ads did not irresponsibly promote diets that fell below 800 kcal a day, and to only make weight loss or weight maintenance claims for foods if the claim was authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register and the foods met the associated conditions of use.\"\nThe watchdog concluded the ad must not appear again in the form that was subject to complaints.\nThe Skinny Food Co and Katie Price have not yet responded to a request for comment from BBC News.",

    "A mum says she worries she is wishing her son's life away as she waits to qualify for help with childcare costs. \nAlex McGinn, from Holyhead, Anglesey, has been waiting for her son to turn three to receive 30 hours of free childcare per week. \nBut she did not qualify for a free childcare scheme which is only available for some two-year-olds in Wales, although this is being extended. \nThe Welsh government said it was making \"excellent\" progress on rolling out high-quality provision but campaigners have called for a clearer plan.  \nIn England, an offer of 15 hours of free childcare per week has been introduced for two-year-olds. \nMs McGinn owns a nursery and her son went to a childminder from five months old when she went back to work.\nShe said: \"I\u2019m the only breadwinner in the house and I couldn't afford to not work, especially with the rising costs of bills and my mortgage.\" \nShe was paying about \u00a31,000 a month for childcare, but did not qualify for financial support offered under the Welsh government's Flying Start programme - which offers 12-and-a-half hours of childcare per week. \nThat scheme, which is focused on the most disadvantaged areas, is being extended - but only gradually.\n\"We weren\u2019t eligible for Flying Start because we weren't in the postcode,\" Ms McGinn said.\n\"My friend across the road does get it.\n\"I would like to see an equal playing field for all parents because childcare is expensive and it's expensive for everyone, not just me because I'm on my own. But for everyone.\"\nShe added: \u201cAll families in Wales should be treated equally.\"\nNow her son has turned three, she is eligible for a different scheme - the Childcare Offer, which provides up to 30 hours of early education and childcare a week for working parents of three and four-year-olds.\nBut Alex said parents in Wales were at a disadvantage compared with families in England where a new offer of free childcare for two-year-olds is being introduced from April.\nSarah Rees, head of Oxfam Cymru, said the new offer for England was \"riddled with problems\" but it was understandable parents in Wales felt \"short-changed\".\nShe said some parents were confused about whether the changes applied in Wales and in some cases letters had mistakenly been sent to families saying they qualified.\nThe charity is calling for an overhaul of the system and a clearer plan from the Welsh government about how free childcare is being extended to more areas.\n\"What parents want to know is when will that be rolled out to all two-year-olds, not via the postcode lottery it currently is,\" Ms Rees said.\n\"And also how will it help them to work when it is just two-and-a-half hours a day.\"\nThe Welsh government said it was making \"excellent progress rolling out high-quality childcare to two-year-olds across Wales\".\nThe scheme is part of the Labour government's cooperation deal with Plaid Cymru and it aims to create 9,500 extra places by 2025.\nIt said \"a phased roll-out\" took account of capacity in the sector and the need to increase staff and the number of settings.\nLittle Sprouts in Neath is one nursery which has been able to offer more places with the extension of the Flying Start programme.\nMum-of-two Stephanie Thomas was able to take up the offer of free childcare hours for her daughter which meant she could go back to work full-time. \nHer daughter has \"come on leaps and bounds\" at Little Sprouts nursery, she said.\n\"It\u2019s helped me for my mental health as well.\n\"I\u2019ve got friends locally who will work full-time and their entire wage goes towards childcare and I just think it\u2019s crazy.\n\"We\u2019re trying to support working parents going back to work and then we\u2019ve put in all these barriers in front of them so having the extra free childcare is definitely a huge help.\"",

not least to betrayed islanders - what is going on here and why she believes sacking CalMac's top boss is a good idea.\"\nScottish Labour transport spokesman Alex Rowley said: \"The chaos on CalMac services is a direct result of the SNP's woeful mismanagement of Scotland's ferry fleet.\n\"No matter who is in the top job in CalMac, islanders will continue to be let down until the SNP government starts delivering the ferries we need.\"\nAnd Liberal Democrat MSP Willie Rennie said: \"Another week, another resignation - but still no SNP minister is carrying the can for the ferry chaos.\"\nLast week, Ms McAllan answered MSPs' questions about the situation at Ferguson Marine but Mr Drummond's position was not discussed.\nThe Scottish government said there were regular discussions with the chair of CalMac's board about the company's performance.\nA spokesman said: \"We thank Robbie Drummond for his contribution to CalMac and wish him well for the future.\n\"Decisions relating to the chief executive are for the chair to make, in consultation with the board.\n\"We welcome the chair's decision to appoint an interim CEO immediately and his intention to recruit a permanent managing director who can take the business forward in the best interests of the communities that rely on it, and in a way that maximises the benefits of the significant investment we continue to make in ferry services.\"",
    "Labour will back the childcare expansion plan being rolled out by the government if it wins the next general election.\nShadow education minister Bridget Phillipson has said Labour will not remove any entitlements promised to families \"in the future\".\nThe government announced an expansion of free childcare to all children under five in England in last year's Budget.\nThere are three phases of expansion, with the final one in September 2025.\nPreviously, 30 hours of free childcare was available for working parents with children aged three and four, although that is limited to 15 hours a week if at least one parent earns more than \u00a3100,000. \nFrom 1 April, working parents with two-year-olds are eligible for 15 hours of free childcare and that will be extended to nine-months from September this year.\nFrom September 2025 the third phase will see hours of free childcare doubled to 30 hours a week for eligible parents.\nPreviously, Labour has said the expansion \"would not be reduced\" if the party takes power in a general election expected to take place in 2024.\nThe party also commissioned a review of childcare, led by former senior Ofsted figure Sir David Bell, in October.\nMs Phillipson told the BBC's Newsnight programme last month that Labour would not commit to the \u00a34bn plan, saying the government risks \"crashing the childcare system\" due to a lack of places for parents with struggling providers.\nThat sparked an attack by education secretary Gillian Keegan, who claimed a Labour win could put the scheme \"at risk\".\nIn a letter to her Labour counterpart, Ms Keegan wrote: \"Parents have told me that they are now uncertain whether they should go back to work, grow their families, or take a promotion, because they don't know if they will still have this childcare provision.\n\"Will the Labour party commit to supporting our policy of giving working parents 30 hours free childcare a week from when their child is nine months old to when they start school? \n\"If not, how would you make up for the 60,000 fewer people in work that our policy will support?\"\nMs Phillipson responded with a letter of her own, promising a reformed childcare system that will \"stand the test of time\".\n\"I am delighted to see the Conservatives have finally woken up to the importance of childcare after 14 years of smashing the system to pieces,\" she wrote.\n\"As we have made abundantly clear, Labour will not be removing any entitlements offered to families now or those promised to them in the future. \n\"Your suggestion to the contrary is an outright lie - and the public will not believe a word of it.\"\nThe party has published a dossier, with some parents complaining of high costs and extra fees to pay while others reported 18-month waiting lists at some nurseries.\nOne nursery warned it could be \"forced to go bust\" under the government's expanded offer, the dossier claimed.\nMs Keegan said she was confident that the childcare sector is ready to deliver the offer and make sure parents have the childcare they need.\nShe said: \"Last year, we committed to delivering the largest ever expansion of childcare that England has ever seen. \n\"And with over 150,000 children about to begin accessing a government-funded childcare place in just over two weeks, it's clear our plan is working.\"",

    "A baby boy who died a day after being born would have lived had he received adequate hospital care, an inquest has heard. \nEthan Blackwell was born at Royal Derby Hospital in May 2021 and died 32 hours later after suffering brain damage. \nThe trust that runs the hospital admitted he should have been delivered by Caesarean section seven hours earlier.\nIt apologised to Ethan's family at the inquest into his death on Wednesday.\nHis parents, Ben and Jodie Blackwell, aged 31 and 23, told Derby Coroner's Court how the heartbreak of Ethan's death still haunts them and how it has impacted their career aspirations and confidence, reports the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS).\nA statement read out on behalf of Mr Blackwell said, \"the poor midwives were running around like headless chickens; it was so busy\".\nHe also said doctors had told them the maternity unit was \"understaffed\".\nMr Blackwell's statement added: \"I feel I am a failure of a father and that I am to blame. I see the same scenes again and again. I just burst into tears and have breakdowns where I cry and scream.\"\nDr Sophie Stenton, who carried out the post-mortem on the baby, told the hearing that the leading cause of death was a \"very severe hypoxic brain injury\".\nThis caused Ethan to be born with almost all of his organs having already failed and major brain damage.\nThe inquest heard the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust agree with a report's recommendations that said there were a number of \"missed opportunities\" in the lead-up to to the baby's death.\nThe court heard that the emergency buzzer was pulled twice at about 03:00 and 05:00 to alert staff to issues relating to his heart rate.\nBut, discussions about an emergency Caesarean section were dismissed when the rate reduced back within normal thresholds.\nSigns of infection were also present, with Mrs Blackwell looking \"very unwell\", the LDRS said.\nA pessary - a tablet on the end of a ribbon aimed at preparing the cervix for labour - fell out of Mrs Blackwell twice and was readministered.\nHowever, on one occasion, it fell into the toilet bowl onto used toilet paper, but due to a \"misunderstanding\", was deemed hygienic enough to be readministered \nThe couple's midwife, for the majority of their labour, said she would not have signed off on the reinsertion of the pessary had she known it had fallen within the toilet bowl. \n\"I am so sorry that you lost your little boy. Jodie, you were amazing, you too, Ben,\" she told Ethan's parents. \nA spokesperson for the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust said: \"We are profoundly sorry for the shortcomings in care that Ethan and Jodie received in 2021, and our deepest condolences remain with their family.\n\"We remain absolutely dedicated to making the changes we have committed to so that we continue to improve the safety of care we provide for parents and babies at our hospitals.\"\nThe inquest continues.\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Teachers in England and Wales could strike again over pay, in September, the National Education Union has said.\nMembers debating pay, on Thursday, are expected to vote on whether to hold a formal strike ballot.\nBut the NEU leadership could call such a ballot even without that backing. And a strike would then require a majority in favour, on a turnout of at least 50%\nThe Department for Education in England said further strikes would \"cause more disruption to pupils\".\nTeacher across the UK went on strike last year, including eight days by NEU members in England.\nSpeaking at the NEU's conference, in Bournemouth, general secretary Daniel Kebede said there was \"more and more frustration developing amongst\" teachers.\n\"My view is if there is a decision to go for a formal ballot, we should conduct that over a fairly significant period of time, looking to take action in September,\" he said.\nMembers have already been asked if they would strike for a fully funded above-inflation pay rise, as part of an informal consultative ballot in recent weeks.\nAnd in England and Wales, most responded, with about 90% saying they would be prepared to strike - a result Mr Kebede called \"exceptionally significant\", adding England's Education Secretary, Gillian Keegan, \"has to take that seriously\".\nNASUWT, the Teachers' Union, also held an informal consultative ballot, in England - but 78% of those who voted rejected a formal ballot.\nGeneral secretary Patrick Roach told its conference, in Harrogate, N Yorks: \u201cOur members have weighed that up and their priority right now is not about causing more disruption to lives that are already in tumult, but actually saying we need a government that's on the side of teachers and on the side of children and young people.\u201d\nThe union would be \"looking carefully at how the government responds\" to calls for a pay rise, he said, adding: \"2023 was a year of action - this must be the year of change.\"\nStrikes in England ended last year, after all four teaching unions accepted the government's 6.5% pay rise, in July.\nThe starting salary rose to \u00a330,000, last year - but experienced teachers' pay this school year remains 12% lower than in 2010-11, once rising living costs are taken into account, according to the National Foundation for Educational Research.\nAnd unions have continued to call for a fully funded above-inflation pay increase this year,  to help tackle difficulties recruiting and retaining staff.\nNo formal offer has been made for teachers' 2024-25 pay award in England or Wales. \nIn England, the School Teachers' Review Body is expected to give its recommendation this term.\n\nIn a letter to the STRB, last month, Ms Keegan said she supported a return of teacher pay awards this year \"to a more sustainable level than the previous two historically high pay awards\".\nThe DfE said the unions \"should engage\" with the STRB process \"instead of striking before they even know what the pay recommendations are\".\nOverall school funding was rising to more than \u00a360bn in 2024-25 and teachers had \"already benefitted from two historic pay awards totalling over 12% in just two years\".\nA Welsh government official said \u201cthe UK government\u2019s austerity agenda places significant pressure on all budgets\u201d and \u201cmeeting the cost of the teachers\u2019 pay award should be considered in this context\u201d.",

    "A woman left in constant pain because of a ruptured faulty breast implant has paid \u00a311,000 for private surgery because the NHS waiting list was too long.\nBeth Hewson, from York, said she was left unable to work after one of her Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) implants burst six months ago. \nThe 49-year-old said the private clinic that fitted the implants in the 1990s had refused to remove them, and there was a 12-month wait for corrective surgery on the NHS.\nShe said: \"You just don\u2019t know where it is. You don\u2019t know what is happening. You don\u2019t know where it has gone and you don\u2019t know how it\u2019s affecting you.\"\nThe Department of Health said there was no evidence to suggest ruptured PIP implants were toxic, and it did not believe they were a threat to the long-term health of women.\nHowever, more than a decade on from the PIP breast implant scandal, campaigners say the lives of tens of thousands of women are still being affected.\nNearly 50,000 British women had the French-made implants fitted before they were banned in 2010.\nPIP was liquidated in 2010 after it emerged its breast implants were filled with cheap, industrial-grade silicone made for mattresses, not cosmetic surgery, and had a high splitting rate.\nThe company's founder, Jean-Claude Mas, was sentenced to four years in prison for fraud in 2013.\nLast year, Ms Hewson\u2019s GP confirmed one of her PIP implants had split and leaked into her body following a breast cancer scare.\nThe BBC followed her journey as she tried to get them replaced.\nShe said she knew one implant had ruptured as she could feel it \"moving around\", adding that it was painful and caused her a lot of stress and worry.\nMs Hewson said she could have opted to have her implants removed under the NHS \u2013 but she had been told there was a year-long waiting list.\nAn NHS worker at York Hospital, she said the pain meant she could not wait any longer and she decided to get private treatment.\nShe said: \"It's cost just over \u00a311,000 to get the PIP implants removed because the NHS said I had to wait 12 months, and I can't wait 12 months\".\nThe vast majority of PIP implants were available in private clinics. Ms Hewson had hers fitted in the late 1990s at private clinic Transform at a cost of nearly \u00a33,500.\nSince finding out 14 years ago how unsafe they were, she has been trying to get them replaced but said she had not had funds at the time to do anything about it.\nShe said: \"I went back to Transform and asked them if they could remove them free of charge, not necessarily replacing them, just taking them out so at least you felt safe, and they refused to do that.\"\nTransform Healthcare said it followed the independent expert advice to the industry at the time \"which did not recommend the routine removal of PIP breast implants\".\nHundreds of women have had PIP implants removed for free on the NHS, but the NHS and private clinics in the UK say they will only take them out if a rupture can be proved.\nJan Spivey, of the PIP Action Campaign, speaks on behalf of many of the victims of the scandal. \nShe was given PIP implants after she had a mastectomy because of breast cancer.\nShe is calling for a public inquiry so the voices of the women and families affected by the scandal can be heard.\n\"Lives have been lost and will continue to be lost until we have a proper policy in place,\" she told the BBC.\nFollowing the PIP scandal, new measures are being introduced to improve patient safety around the products.\nFrom 2025, the government says clinicians must give patients an implant card with information about any necessary warnings, precautions or measures.\nMs Hewson was in her mid-20s when she decided to have implants after breast feeding her daughter.\n\"My reasoning behind it was a personal thing. I didn\u2019t feel like a woman any more because I lost them through having a child,\" she said.\n\"Unfortunately, I just got caught up in the scandal.\"\nMs Hewson has now had her PIP breast implants replaced.\nShe said the whole experience had been \"debilitating\" and that she was \"just glad I'm coming to the end of it.\"\nShe said that she regretted getting them, and that she \"just wouldn\u2019t have it done\" unless \"you needed it doing, if you\u2019ve had a mastectomy then it would be something to consider\".\nShe urged anyone who was thinking about getting implants to think again.\n\"If it\u2019s just a case you wanted to be two sizes bigger, I just would avoid it at all costs,\" she said.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "A man who pretended to be a taxi driver to pick up a woman who he then raped, has been handed an 18-year sentence. \nThe woman had been on a night out in Swindon on 15 April 2023 when Fareed Tariq lured her into his car before driving to a quiet area where he assaulted her.\nIt is the second time Tariq, 43, of Barnum Court, Swindon, has been found guilty of raping a woman after a night out. He was jailed for six years in 2012 for what the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) called a \"near-identical crime\".\nDuring sentencing at Swindon Crown Court earlier, the judge said Tariq must serve 13 years in custody and five on licence.\nTariq was found guilty of rape by a jury during a trial in February.\nThe court was told he posed as a taxi driver in Swindon town centre to pick up a lone woman at a taxi rank on Bridge Street in the early hours.\nShe reported the attack to police the next morning.\nTariq initially denied sexual contact before later saying it had been consensual sex. \nThe victim said in a statement that her life came \u201ccrashing down\u201d as she struggled with her emotions.\nShe told the court: \"The rape will haunt me forever\", adding that she had turned to alcohol to try to forget what had happened. \nTariq watched via video link from a prison in Oxfordshire as the court sentencing got under way.\nThe judge told him he was a significant risk to women and his attitude was not likely to change. \nTariq was given a six-year sentence for rape in Swindon in 2011 in an attack where he posed as a taxi driver. \nHe had also been recalled twice under licence after complaints from women.\nThe judge paid tribute to the victim, who was in court for the sentencing, saying she \u201chad the courage to go to police... and has protected potential victims\".\nThe victim\u2019s statement told how her seven-year relationship with her partner had broken down after the rape and she found it hard to trust people.\n\"I hope my nightmare will become a distant memory, but I doubt it, the rape will haunt me forever,\" she added.\nLisa Garcia, senior crown prosecutor with CPS Wessex, called Tariq  \"a danger to women\".\nShe continued: \u201cNot only did he pose as a taxi driver to prey on a lone victim, Tariq then cruelly tried to blame her for his depraved crime.\n\u201cThe fact he committed a strikingly similar crime over a decade ago shows he is devoid of remorse and remains a threat to the public.\"",
    "Nicola Sturgeon has said she is \"veering away\" from voting in favour of assisted dying.\nThe former first minister said she had \"rarely been as conflicted on any issue as I am on this\".\nThe Lib Dem MSP Liam McArthur has introduced a bill to legalise assisted dying in Scotland.\nMSPs are expected to have a free vote on the matter, with Mr McArthur saying \"robust safeguards\" are included in the bill.\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf has indicated that he does not support the proposed legislation, which is opposed by the Church of Scotland, the Catholic Church in Scotland, and the Scottish Association of Mosques.\nWriting in the Glasgow Times, Ms Sturgeon said she had initially expected to back the legislation, but had instead found herself going the opposite way.\nShe said she had been \"deeply moved\" by the accounts of terminally ill people who wish to die at a time of their own choosing.\nBut Ms Sturgeon added: \"Despite my expectations, the more deeply I think about the different issues involved, the more I find myself veering away from a vote in favour, not towards it.\n\"I worry that even with the best of intentions and the most carefully worded legislation, it will be impossible to properly guarantee that no-one at the end of their life will feel a degree of pressure.\"\nMs Sturgeon said she was worried the legislation could be the \"thin edge of the wedge\" and that society could lose focus on palliative care.\nMSPs will get a \"conscience vote\" when it comes to assisted dying legislation. Party leaders won't tell their MSPs which way to go.\nBut the stance of influential politicians still matter. \nNicola Sturgeon remains one of the biggest names in Scottish politics, and it looks like she's inclined to not back the legislation. \nShe's giving off similar signals to the main party leaders - Humza Yousaf, Anas Sarwar and Douglas Ross have all indicated they have concerns.\nSo can this bill pass without the support of Holyrood's biggest names?\nWell Liam McArthur, the MSP behind the assisted dying bill, believes there's been a \"mood shift\" amongst parliamentarians.\nThe talk amongst supporters is that Mr McArthur has done his maths, and is confident he has the numbers to get it through.\nIt feels like this legislation has better prospects than previous attempts, but many of Holyrood's main players seem unconvinced.\nShe said: \"If we normalise assisted dying... then we will, as a society, lose focus on the palliative and end-of-life care and support that is necessary to help people, even in the worst of circumstances, to live with dignity.\"\nMs Sturgeon - who voted against previous bills that would have enabled someone to end their life - said that she had yet to reach a final decision and wanted to hear from her constituents.\nMr McArthur said he appreciated the issues raised by Ms Sturgeon and that he hoped to meet her and other MSPs \"to allay their concerns\".\nHe said: \"Our current laws on assisted dying are failing too many terminally ill Scots and, despite the best efforts of palliative care, dying people too often face traumatic deaths that harm both them and those they leave behind.\"\nMr McArthur's bill would give people with an \"advanced and progressive\" terminal illness the option of requesting an assisted death.\nThey would need to have the mental capacity to make such a request, which would have to be made voluntarily and approved by two doctors.\nOnly people aged 16 and over who have lived in Scotland for at least a year would be allowed to make a request, which would be followed by a mandatory 14-day \"reflection period\".\nThey would have to administer the life-ending medication themselves.\nThis will be the third time that the Scottish Parliament has considered the issue.\nIn 2010, MSPs rejected Margo MacDonald's End of Life Assistance Bill by 85 votes to 16.\nThe independent MSP, who had Parkinson's Disease, died in 2014 and the cause was taken up by Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens.\nThe following year, his Assisted Suicide Bill was rejected by 82 votes to 36.\nIn Scotland, it is not illegal to attempt suicide but helping someone take their own life could lead to prosecution for crimes such as murder, culpable homicide or offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.\nIn England and Wales, the Suicide Act 1961 makes it an offence to encourage or assist the suicide or attempted suicide of another person.

    "A Tyneside law firm says small businesses struggling with crippling energy costs could each be due thousands of pounds in compensation after being mis-sold deals with suppliers.\nEnergy Solicitors, based in Wallsend, says its group is currently pursuing more than 400 cases, but believes up to two million firms may have been victims and the eventual compensation bill could top \u00a32bn.\nThe vast majority of claims centre on the commission paid to brokers, or middlemen, who most small businesses use to negotiate deals with energy suppliers.\nEnergy Solicitors says brokers frequently took commission from suppliers which were not disclosed to the customer.\nThe supplier then effectively recovered the commission from the small business by adding it to their bills.\nThe law firm believes a recent court judgement its group won in favour of a County Durham amusement arcade could open the floodgate to more claims.\nIn the case, a judge at Leeds County Court awarded Queenie's Casino Slots, in Crook, \u00a314,000 in compensation because brokers' fees had not been made clear.\nVictoria Myers, senior partner at Energy Solicitors, said: \"There are approximately two and a half million businesses that have used energy brokers and we think around two million have been mis-sold to, so it's a massive scandal.\n\"Brokers want to get commission. They are aggressive in their tactics. They pressure clients and cold call and it is so unregulated. It needs regulation to protect businesses.\"\nAndrew Smith, from Queenie's Casino Slots, said the compensation \"may not seem like a huge amount\" but for a small business \"it makes a big difference\".\n\"Like many others, we are trying to operate in challenging economic circumstances,\" he added.\n\"Energy bills are big enough as it is without having to fork out more.\n\"No business wants to be ripped-off. Check your energy bill or get support. It's important to make sure you are not overpaying through hidden fees.\"\nAnother potential victim of mis-selling is Luciano's Bar and Bistro in Peterlee, County Durham. \nIts energy bills increased from \u00a32,000 to \u00a310,000-a month in 2022 when a broker signed it up to a new deal. The broker also took a hidden commission that was passed on in bills.\nLuciano's owner, Masoud Farrahi, says he was told charges would drop once energy prices began to fall, but that has not happened and he says the energy supplier told him he would have to pay about \u00a375,000 to get out of the deal.\nHe describes paying \u00a310,000-a-month as \"unsustainable\" for his business.\n\"It's impossible. You can't pass it on to the customer. You can't put your price up by five times. Nobody would come.\n\"I was expecting our bills to drop, as they have for some others, but no, the supplier told me there was nothing they could do.\"\nEnergy Solicitors is looking to get him a better deal and compensation from his supplier.\nHowever, the umbrella organisation representing the majority of brokers, the Utilities Intermediaries Association, says most provide \"a valuable and bona fide\" service and that they have had to declare the level of commission since regulator Ofgem introduced extra safeguards in October 2022.\nA spokeswoman pointed out it was in the interests of specialist claims firms to use publicity to attract more clients.\nPressure is growing, though, for stricter regulation with Ofgem asking the government to impose tighter controls.\nEnergy UK, the industry body representing most suppliers, also accepts more regulation is needed.\nA spokesperson said: \"The industry has long called for brokers to be regulated in the same way as the rest of the market. \n\"Energy UK and our supplier members have supported proposals from Ofgem for increasing the information, clarity and transparency of commissions. \n\"Ofgem having the legal powers to set out and enforce rules would increase regulatory oversight and establish higher standards for brokers, so business customers are properly protected.\"     \nThat though may not stop more claims from small businesses that feel the deal they were offered was far from transparent or fair.\nFollow BBC North East  on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

    "Republican congresswoman Lauren Boebert says she has May-Thurner Syndrome, a rarely-diagnosed condition that tends to affect women more than men. \nThe Colorado representative was diagnosed after going for surgery to have \"an acute blood clot\" removed.\nShe was taken to hospital after severe swelling in her upper left leg, her campaign staff said on Tuesday.\nThe surgery was successful and Ms Boebert is expected to make a full recovery, they added.\nMedics say May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) is not necessarily dangerous in itself but can lead to complications and health risks.\nIt is a condition caused by a problem involving the right iliac artery, which carries blood to the right leg, and the left iliac vein, which returns blood from the left leg towards the heart.\nThese blood vessels naturally cross over each other in the pelvis. MTS results when the artery squeezes the vein, resulting in reduced blood flow in that vessel.\nThis may not lead to any symptoms at all, and some people do not know they have the condition, leading the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) to describe it as \"clinically silent\".\nBut reduced blood flow can increase the risk of blood-clot formation. If a clot travels to the heart, lungs or brain it can cause a blockage with potentially fatal consequences.\nMTS often presents itself through pain or cramp in a person's arm or leg, accompanied by swelling or a discolouring of the skin. Veins can appear more pronounced. \nDiagnosis may be confirmed following a CT scan, as was the case with Ms Boebert.\nThe short answer is that doctors do not know. But they believe it affects certain groups more than others. They also think it is more common than the number of people diagnosed would suggest. \nMs Boebert's team pointed out that \"women between the ages of 20 and 45 who have given birth are also more likely to have May-Thurner syndrome\". \nThis is consistent with advice provided by the Cleveland Clinic, a non-profit medical centre which runs several hospitals in the US.\nAs a 37-year-old mother of four, Ms Boebert fits that description.\nMany people with MTS do not seek treatment as the condition does not present them any problems that prompt them to do so.\nOptions available to medics include inserting a stent, a small tube that makes sure the compressed vein stays open. This is the form of treatment that Ms Boebert's team said the congresswoman received.\nOther surgery may be considered to restore typical blood flow - for example by moving the artery that is compressing the vein, or by creating an entirely new route for the vein.\nPeople with MTS experiencing blood clots may be given medication in an attempt to break those up.\nThose with mild symptoms might be advised by their doctor to wear compression socks on their lower legs to improve blood flow.\nBecause the cause of the syndrome is unknown, there is no definite way to prevent it, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\nHowever, it has general advice for improving blood flow and reducing the risk of clots. It recommends avoiding long periods of sitting, not smoking, exercising regularly and drinking water.\nA doctor who treated Ms Boebert was quoted by the congresswoman's campaign team as saying the surgery was successful, and that she is expected to make a full recovery. \n\"Patients with May-Thurner syndrome who undergo the procedure to restore blood flow are able to live and work just as they have in the past after a brief recovery,\" the doctor added.\nMs Boebert herself thanked the staff at the UCHealth Medical Center of the Rockies \"for their great care and providing helpful insight on my recent diagnosis\".\nShe said she looked forward to continuing her campaign. She currently represents the state's 3rd congressional district, but plans to switch to the 4th district.",
    "A man who lost his home after being prosecuted for claiming too much Carer's Allowance says he has \"been through hell\".\nGeorge Henderson claims he made an \"honest mistake\" by failing to declare his income working as a taxi driver in Leyland, Lancashire. \nThe 64-year-old had been caring for his son, who has learning difficulties, and received overpayments for a decade.\nThe government said it was \"right\" it sought to claim back taxpayers' money. \nHe was prosecuted by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and found guilty of benefit fraud, resulting in a suspended prison sentence with requirements to wear an electronic tag. \nMr Henderson told BBC North West Tonight: \"I've ticked a box, mistakenly and honestly, incorrectly. But it took 10 years for them to find that.\n\"I was degraded as a criminal. I was Jack the lad, laughing, joking, but that's gone.\"\nMr Henderson re-visited his story after the BBC revealed a similar case of Cheshire woman Vivienne Groom, who lost her inheritance after being prosecuted for the same offence. \nMrs Groom had been caring for her elderly mother but had also worked a minimum wage job at a local Co-op supermarket for about five years. \nShe claimed she had agreed a re-payment plan with the DWP after receiving a bill for \u00a316,800, however the department decided to prosecute when it learned she was due to inherit \u00a316,000 after her mother died.\nOn Wednesday, a judge at Chester Crown Court granted the DWP permission to seize that amount under the Proceeds of Crime Act. \nIt used the same legislation, more commonly used to claw back the criminal assets of drug dealers or money launderers, to force Mr Henderson to sell his house in 2018.\nThe government has been criticised for allowing such large overpayments to build up in thousands of cases, despite having access to earnings data.\nIt was also accused of \"bullying and harassing\" claimants for overpayments in a parliamentary report. \nEmily Holzhausen, from the charity Carers UK, told the BBC: \"It's not acceptable that people are building these overpayments without necessarily realising. \n\"It's really important that the government invests in a modern system for carers' allowance.\"\nMr Henderson, who now lives in supported accommodation in Walton-le-Dale, said: \"I had a lovely two-bedroom house, worked hard to keep my home, and they just came and they took it.\n\"I've been through hell, for five years.\"\nHe told the BBC he had attempted suicide and was awaiting trauma therapy.\n\"As every day goes by, I'm frightened to put my head on the pillow, because I have really bad nightmares,\" he added. \nThe DWP said Carer's Allowance claimants have a responsibility to inform it of any changes in their circumstances. \n\"It is right that we recover taxpayers' money when this has not occurred\", a spokesperson said. \nWhy not follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram?

    "An inquest has found that a woman's death in hospital was from natural causes but neglect was a contributory factor.\nTracey Farndon, 56, died of sepsis at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, in April 2023.\nShe had waited five hours for routine observations to be taken which could have led to a faster diagnosis and treatment, her family said.\nCoroner Louise Hunt said she would be writing to the Department of Health and Social Care because an overwhelmed emergency department contributed to her death.\nShe will also write to the trust which runs the hospital over concerns that sepsis was not considered an issue until after Ms Farndon died.\nThe coroner said a nurse could not complete a full set of observations and, while the nurse claimed Ms Farndon could not keep still, Ms Hunt found that was not the case.\nOn the balance of probabilities, Ms Farndon's blood pressure was not recorded because it was too low on admission to hospital, Ms Hunt said.\nShe added no observations were repeated for five hours and overcrowding in the emergency department at the time was a significant factor in the failure to give Ms Farndon the care she needed.\n\"I am satisfied that she was suffering from sepsis when admitted to the emergency department,\" Ms Hunt said.\nShe said medics also failed to record Ms Farndon's blood pressure.\nShe recorded a narrative conclusion and said: \"Tracey died from natural causes contributed to by a delay in diagnosis and treatment.\n\"Her death was contributed to by neglect.\n\"I am still concerned about a genuine lack of understanding about sepsis.\n\"It does seem to me that there was a particular lack of understanding here because it was not considered by anybody until after her death.\u201d\nMs Farndon's daughter, Jess Salmina said after the conclusion of the inquest: \"What my mother went through in the final hours of her life was truly horrendous.\n\"We are all completely heartbroken as a family about the lack of care she experienced when she needed it the most.\n\"I think it\u2019s too early for forgiveness at this point \u2013 hopefully in time, but not at this point.\"\nA serious incident investigation by the trust had already looked at the circumstances surrounding the clinical management of Ms Farndon. \nThe report, seen by the BBC, said incomplete observations were caused by \u201creduced staffing against the volume of patients and acuity of the department\".\nSepsis was not considered as part of the differential diagnosis so antibiotics were not prescribed, the report said.\nIt added that repeat patient observations may have led to \"earlier identification of the patient's deterioration\" as well as \"earlier escalation\" to the nurse in charge and doctor and commencement of sepsis screening.\nDr Jitender Monga, from University Hospitals Birmingham, said: \u201cThe service was stretched, long waits. It probably did contribute to Tracey being seen quite late.\n\"The failure to take blood pressure was a serious failure.\n\"Overcrowding is probably one of the major  factors.

    "A seven-month-old British baby has been separated from her parents and is stuck in Algeria because of passport issues.\nAdra, who has an Algerian passport, travelled to the North African country on 14 January with her mother but needs a British one to return home to Hull. \nHer father, Abdel Meslem, said he applied four months ago, but the passport had still not arrived and described it as a \"living nightmare\".\nThe Home Office said \"all checks\" had to be done before issuing a passport.\nNew passports were usually issued within three weeks of applications being received, they said.\nMr Meslem, who has British citizenship, said his wife, Souad, an Algerian national, had to return home to Hull on 25 March for a medical appointment but his daughter was not allowed back because she did not have the correct travel documents.\nAs a result, the couple were forced to leave their \"bundle of joy\" in Algeria with her maternal grandmother, who was looking after the child \"really well\", he said.\nMr Meslem said the family were left \"in limbo\" and the \"separation is just too much\" to bear.\n\"It's very devastating,\" he said.\n\"She's got her first tooth. I was never there to witness it. She's saying her first mumbling words - she's saying 'da da' - which every time I hear it, it brings a tear to my eye. \n\"She's learning to crawl.

Mr Meslem later travelled to see his family but returned home two weeks' later on 2 March because of \"work commitments\".\nHe said: \"I was hoping by the time I was gonna join them I would have had her British passport, so we could spend two weeks together and travel back together. \n\"[But] nothing went as planned... we never received her passport.\"\nHe said his daughter could not travel back using her Algerian passport because a visa was required to enter the UK. However, being a British citizen, Adra was not entitled to the visa.\nMr Meslem said he had contacted the British consulate in Algeria for assistance in obtaining emergency travel documents for his child but was denied support because, he was told, it was \"not an emergency\". \n\"It's just too upsetting,\" he said.\n\"I just feel absolutely let down by the system. A passport application shouldn't take [this long].\n\"We're four months down the line and we're still none the wiser. \n\"I haven't got a date where I can see an end to this living nightmare.\"\nMr Meslem believes his family was \"being discriminated against\" because of the couple's nationality.\nHe said: \"I understand for security reasons you need to carry out all the necessary checks.

    "Billionaire Joe Lewis, whose family trust owns Tottenham Hotspur football club, was fined $5m (\u00a34m) Thursday, but will avoid prison after pleading guilty to insider trading. \nThis is the story of how his plan to enrich his lovers, friends, and employees unravelled. \nThe pilot had just touched down in Orlando when he texted a friend with a hot tip: \"Boss is helping us out.\" \nThe \"boss\" he was referring to was British tycoon Joe Lewis, and the helping hand was a loan of half a million dollars. And it came with juicy stock advice: buy shares in a pharmaceutical company that was about to announce positive results for a new cancer drug.\nTwo weeks later, the pilot texted again, noting \"the Boss has inside info\" and \"knows the outcome\". \nHe was right - the company's stock price jumped more than 16%. The pilot cashed out and repaid the \"Boss\". \nBut there was one big hitch. The whole scheme was illegal.\nOne of Britain's richest men, the 87-year-old Lewis pleaded guilty to insider trading as part of an agreement with prosecutors in January.\nAt a hearing in Manhattan on Thursday, he was fined $5m (\u00a34m) and sentenced to three years of probation, avoiding jail time. Lewis arrived in court wearing an eye patch.\nFederal guidelines in the case called for a sentence of between 18 months and two years in prison, but both defence and prosecutors urged leniency, citing Lewis' guilty plea, co-operation with authorities and poor health. \nJudge Jessica Clarke said his crimes were \"serious\" and \"strike at the integrity of our markets\" but said his circumstances did not warrant prison.\nIn court, Lewis referred to his childhood in London during the Blitz and said: \"At an early age, I learned how precious life is. I made a terrible mistake. I broke the law. I am ashamed, sorry, and I hold myself accountable.\"\nAs part of the plea deal, one of Lewis' companies, Broad Bay Ltd, also pleaded guilty to securities fraud and was fined $44m (\u00a334.8m).\nA substantial part of his fraudulent activity, according to an indictment, was not meant to pad his estimated worth of $6.2bn (\u00a34.9bn). \nInstead, the incident with his pilot Patrick O'Connor was just one of a number of times that he passed along insider information about his companies to his private pilots, friends, personal assistants and romantic partners, in order to enrich his close associates.\nIn part, the billionaire hatched the scheme because he felt bad for never setting up formal retirement plans for his pilots, according to a statement he made in court at the time of his guilty plea. \nLewis was born in London's East End and took over a restaurant business started by his father before selling it to focus on currency speculation and investments.\nHe was reportedly one of the investors who made money betting heavily against the pound prior to \"Black Wednesday\" - the UK's withdrawal from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in September 1992. \nHe founded the investment firm Tavistock Group, which has ownership stakes in a large array of property, sports, finance, energy and life sciences companies.\nLewis was ranked 39th in the 2023 Sunday Times Rich List and is best known for his ownership of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, which he bought a controlling stake in for \u00a322m in 2001 - a sum then worth around $32m. \nIn 2022, control was handed over to a family trust, and financial documents the club filed with the UK's Companies House indicate that Lewis no longer has \"significant control\" over the club.\nHis current fortune includes homes in several countries, a huge art collection and $250m (\u00a3200m) yacht, which he used to secure a bail bond after his arrest in July 2023.\nHis position in the financial world gave him access to boardroom secrets, and for years, prosecutors said, he tipped off associates so that they could take advantage, in a fraud that netted millions of dollars.\nIn addition to pilots and workers on his yacht, romantic partners were also on the receiving end of his criminal largesse. \nIn July 2019, a company called Solid Biosciences that Tavistock had invested in was looking for fresh cash. While considering the deal, Lewis was given confidential information about a clinical trial. \nHe was staying with his girlfriend in South Korea at the time, and told her to pour money into the company. She invested around $700,000. \nThe following day the couple returned via private plane to the US. Along the way, Lewis shared his insider tip with his pilots. \nAs results of the clinical trial were released, the company's shares skyrocketed. Lewis' girlfriend more than doubled her money. \nThe fraud also went beyond insider trading, prosecutors said. Starting in 2013, Lewis concealed the true scale of his holdings in companies in order to obtain favourable terms for stock deals. \nHis pilot, O'Connor, pleaded guilty to insider trading charges and will be sentenced in May. \nAnother pilot, Bryan Waugh, pleaded not guilty and will go on trial later this year. His lawyers have argued in court filings ",
    "A woman has told of her shock after the government seized \u00a316,000 left to her by her mother because she was overpaid her carer's allowance. \nVivienne Groom was prosecuted for failing to declare her minimum wage Co-op job while also caring for her mum. \nMrs Groom said she was told by a social worker she did not have to tell the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) about the job. \nThe DWP said it was \"right\" it sought to claim back \"taxpayers' money\".\nAfter taking the job at the store in Tarvin, near Chester, Mrs Groom was told she had to pay back \u00a316,800.\nShe said she initially agreed a payment plan with the DWP at \u00a330 per month to cover the overpayments, which she received between 2014 and 2019. \nHowever, when the government discovered she stood to inherit \u00a316,000 following the death of her mum, it decided to seize it. \nMrs Groom told the BBC she was devastated by what had happened. \n\"I followed that lady's rules and I looked after my mum,\" she said. \n\"I mean, if people look after their parents they should be paid more money so they don't have to go to work as well.\n\"I had to go to work. We had bills to pay.\"\nThe only way for the DWP to recover the money was to prosecute Mrs Groom, so she was charged with benefit fraud offences. \nWithout legal representation to assist her, Mrs Groom pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a community order with unpaid work requirements. \nShe was, however, forced back to court after the DWP initiated proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA), enabling them to ask a judge to order the confiscation of her inheritance. \nThat order was granted on Wednesday, despite a different judge describing himself as \"truly unimpressed\" with the DWP's handling of the case during her sentencing hearing. \nAt that earlier hearing, the Recorder of Chester, judge Steven Everett, told Mrs Groom she was \"doing the best you could for your mother\". \nSpeaking outside court on Wednesday, her husband, Geoff, told the BBC his wife had been \"penalised for looking after her mum\".\nThe DWP has faced criticism for failing to prevent overpayments, despite having the ability to do so, and allowing the recipients to end up in legal trouble.\nBenefit staff get automatic alerts from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if a carer's allowance claimant is earning too much to claim.\nOne DWP employee agreed to speak about Mrs Groom's case on condition of anonymity. \n\"From 2014 onwards really they had no excuse for having these overpayments carry on for longer than two or three months \u2026 if they're investigating all of the alerts\", he told BBC North West Tonight. \n\"DWP should be protecting these people from getting into trouble with their benefits but instead they're persecuting them and treating them like hardened criminals using the Proceeds of Crime Act against them. It's appalling.\"\nFive years ago a report from the House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee accused the DWP of \"bullying and harassing\" those who had been overpaid. \nMargaret Greenwood, Labour MP for Wirral West, told the BBC about 44% of people caring for others for more than 35 hours a week are \"living in poverty\". \nShe said to then receive a \"large bill\" for overpayments they are often unaware of \"can be devastating for people\". \nLast year the DWP revealed it was seeking to recover 145,567 overpayments of Carers Allowance.\nAn extra 26,500 overpayments were added to that total in the last year alone.\nA spokesperson for the DWP said: \"We are committed to fairness in the welfare system while protecting the public purse. \n\"Claimants have a responsibility to inform DWP of any changes in their circumstances that could impact their award, and it is right that we recover taxpayers' money when this has not occurred.\"\nWhy not follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X and Instagram?

    "Seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen (WCK) have been killed in an Israeli air strike in Gaza, the charity's founder says.\nThe victims were British, Polish, Australian, Palestinian and also included a dual US-Canadian citizen, WCK said.\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has acknowledged that the Israeli military hit \"innocent people\", describing it as tragic and unintentional.\n\"It happens in war, we check it to the end, we are in contact with the governments, and we will do everything so that this thing does not happen again,\" he said in a video message.\nHere's what we know about the aid workers killed.\nMs Frankcom died \"doing the work she loves\", her family said in a statement.\nThe aid worker from Melbourne, Australia was the WCK's Relief Lead in Gaza. She was described as a \"kind, selfless and outstanding human being [who] travelled the world helping others in their time of need\".\n\"She will leave behind a legacy of compassion, bravery and love for all those in her orbit,\" they added.\nLast month, WCK posted a video on X of Ms Frankcom at their kitchen in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, which was newly opened.\nDora Weekley, a friend and former WCK colleague, told ABC News that Ms Frankcom was \"dedicated\" and someone who made sure people in need had a hot meal to look forward to every day.\nMs Weekley met Ms Frankcom in 2019, when they responded to Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas, and worked with her again during the summer bushfires in Australia.\nPolish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski has confirmed Mr Sobol was killed. \n\"Our brave compatriot, Mr Damian Sobol from Przemysl, helped people in need in Gaza where there is a humanitarian crisis. He was killed during an attack which the Israeli army has accepted responsibility for,\" he said in a video message on X. In an earlier post, he said he had personally asked the Israeli ambassador for an \"urgent explanation\" for the strike.\nPolish President Andrzej Duda wrote on X that it was \"with deep pain\" that he had learned about the deaths of the WCK volunteers, including a Polish citizen.\n\"These brave people changed the world for the better with their service and dedication to others. This tragedy should never have happened and must be explained,\" he said.\nMr Sobol, from Przemysl in south-eastern Poland, was originally identified by the city's mayor in a Facebook post.\nWojciech Bakun called Mr Sobol a \"fantastic boy\" and said words could not describe how those who knew him were feeling.\nColleagues of Mr Sobol have posted comments on social media describing how he had taken part in delivering aid to Ukrainian refugees following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nMourners gathered in the Gazan city of Rafah on Tuesday for the funeral of the Palestinian driver who was killed in the strike.\nHundreds of people mourned Saifeddin Issam Ayad Abutaha, whose body was transported to Rafah, his hometown, where relatives, colleagues and friends carried him on their shoulders.\n\"He was happy to work with an organisation that provides humanitarian aid to the displaced, our hearts are broken by your death, Saif,\" his close friend Hassan said amid tears, sadness and anger. \n\"You have hurt us with your passing, and we will not forget you. We pray for your mercy, Saif, and may God give us patience and give patience to your family and loved ones,\" he told the BBC.\nThree British nationals were killed in the attack. They were all former soldiers who were working for UK-based security firm Solace Global as part of WCK's security team.\nMr Chapman was one of the three. \nHis family described him as \"an incredible father, husband, son and brother\" who \"will forever be a hero\".\nIn a statement, they said they were \"devastated\" to have lost him, adding he died trying to help people.\n\"He will be missed dearly,\" they said.\nChris Burns, who served with Mr Chapman in the military, remembers him as a \"very, very bubbly [man who] got on with everybody\".\n\"He was a very, very funny guy,\" Mr Burns said on BBC World at One.\nMr Kirby was born in Bristol and had completed tours in Bosnia and Afghanistan with the British Armed Forces before working as a security consultant.\nHis family said he would be \"remembered as a hero\" who will \"never know the void he has left\".  \n\"James was always willing to lend a helping hand to anyone, even in the face of senseless violence,\" they said in a statement.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Kirby's cousin Adam McGuire said he was \"completely selfless\" and \"just wanted to help people\", which is why he had gone to Gaza.\nAnother cousin, Amy Roxburgh-Barry, described him as a \"true friend\" who \"loved his mates, he loved his family.\"\nMr Henderson was the third British man killed. \nHe had been in Gaza for just over a week alongside with Mr Chapman and Mr Kirby. They were due to return home in days, the BBC understands.\nThe three's roles as security advisers were to ensure the aid convoy travelling in Gaza followed safety procedures and remained on the correct rout",
    "For many musicians, making it big in the industry means making it in the US.\nBut some artists say they're losing money by going on tour there due to the rising costs of getting a visa.\nOverseas performers and the support staff they travel with must apply for special types of visas for professional artists and entertainers.\nFrom April, the cost has in some cases more than doubled to over $1,000 (\u00a3800) per person - and that's before additional fees.\nThe US Embassy has told BBC Newsbeat it doesn't make any money from visa charges and the price hike is down to its own rising expenses.  \nBut artists like Irish singer-songwriter CMAT say that even before the rise, getting to the US was \"extremely expensive\" and now it risks being ruled out for some musicians.\n\"Every time I go over there, I'm losing money,\" she says. \n\"We're never making money, it's not a possibility.\n\"I'm lucky enough that I'm signed now and I've made two albums so I have the money to lose in America.\" \nBut CMAT, whose real name is Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson, fears less established artists trying to break through won't be so lucky.\n\"It's a lot more difficult now than it would have been for me five years ago to get my foot in the same door,\" she tells BBC Newsbeat. \n\"It's terrible and it's a really important market to crack, especially if, like me, you're an Irish person doing country music - it's probably the most important.\"\nTour manager Nathalie Candel also worries the increasing costs will put artists off travelling to the US, which she agrees is still \"a really important market\".\n\"There are so many legendary venues and festivals, all these late-night TV shows that have music as part of them,\" she says.\n\"And the industry has changed so much over the past few decades, because you used to be able to earn a living as a musician from selling records and that's not the case anymore. \n\"So touring is just super, super important. That makes an artist able to have a career.\"\nBBC Radio 1's Sound Of 2024 winners The Last Dinner Party are among the acts trying to replicate their UK success across the Atlantic.\nThe London group are currently on tour in North America, finishing with a set at Coachella later this month.\nBut bassist Georgia Davies says it's \"becoming increasingly impossible for independent and indie label artists to get out to America, which is an absolute travesty\". \n\"There should be more funding of arts in this country to enable artists be able to do that.\"\nThere are two types of visa that artists are likely to have to apply for - O or P visas - depending on whether you're a solo artist with \"exceptional ability\" or a band of \"international renown\".\nBefore the changes, both visas cost $460. The new prices vary based on factors like who artists will be working with when they get to the US, but can be more than $1,000.\nAdditional expenses like legal costs and processing fees can add to the total bill. \nThe US embassy says it has been facing rising costs for things like rent, staffing and the technology it uses, as well as a backlog in handling applications after the Covid-19 pandemic. \nApplications have taken longer to process as a result of that backlog, leading some artists to pay up to $2,805 in extra fees to speed it up.\nFor The K's guitarist Ryan Breslyn, soaring costs have put him off returning to the US after his last tour seven years ago when the group supported The Who. \nRyan, 29, describes the cost to artists as \"silly money\". \nHe says his indie rock band from Merseyside would be looking at spending thousands per person \"before you've even stepped on the plane\".\n\"It puts people off because they simply can't afford it,\" he says.\n\"It's just a whole headache, and especially after Covid and Brexit. It's making it difficult for everyone.\"\nThe rising cost of visas is the latest hurdle artists say they have to overcome, with many previously raising concerns about the impact of Brexit and the cost of living crisis.\nRyan says something needs to change soon to make it easier for acts to tour. \n\"It's just a minefield and a headache for the band and management arranging it,\" he says.\n\"It just puts people off doing it.\n\"Hopefully, someone will start to listen and try and make it a little bit easier for people to play where they want to play.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",
    "Turkey's election authority has scrapped a decision to annul an pro-Kurdish candidate's election victory after days of escalating protests.\nAbdullah Zeydan won the mayoral elections in the eastern province of Van with more than 55% of the vote.\nBut election officials handed victory to a man standing for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party with less than half his vote.\nTheir decision led to protests and clashes across south-eastern Turkey.\nRegional officials in Van overturned Abdullah Zeydan's election win, citing a previous conviction during a crackdown on pro-Kurdish politicians in 2016.\nVan was one of 10 areas won by the pro-Kurdish DEM party in Turkey's south and south-east in last Sunday's local elections.\nThe ruling AK Party suffered its first election defeat across the country since 2002, as the main opposition party, the CHP, won in 35 provincial capitals and regained control of the main cities of Istanbul and Ankara.\nThe secular CHP (Republican People's Party) condemned the annulment of Mr Zeydan's victory as a disgrace.\nHis DEM party denounced the move as a \"political coup\", urging the Erdogan government to respect the will of Van's voters. \nMr Zeydan served several years in jail on charges of links to Kurdish militants that targeted a number of party colleagues, including two leaders who remain behind bars. He was released in 2022. \nA court ruling had allowed him to stand for election, but it was reversed two days before the vote. \nDemonstrations erupted in Van, a Kurdish-majority city of half a million people, prompting riot police to use tear gas and water cannon. A ban imposed on protests in the city was ignored.  \nThen thousands of people took to the streets in other Turkish cities in the south and south-east, and there were rallies and protests as far west as Izmir and Istanbul.\nOn Thursday, Turkey's Supreme Election Council decided to overturn the regional decision to annul Mr Zeydan's victory, prompting party officials to say that \"the will of the people has come to life\". Protests in the centre of Van were immediately replaced with celebrations.\nThe newly elected mayor said justice had been done. He thanked supporters and leaders of other political parties that had shown solidarity, as well as fellow Kurdish politicians who remained in jail.\nAmong the biggest winners in Sunday's election was Istanbul's popular opposition mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, who is increasingly being seen as the CHP's most likely candidate in the next presidential elections in 2028.\nHe condemned what had taken place in Van as a \"total aberration\" and promised never to give up on democracy. \nThe CHP was beaten by the AK Party by fewer than 4,000 votes in Hatay province in the far south of Turkey, and accuses the governing party of trying to steal the election there.",
    "Sales of electric cars are failing to keep up with the wider market, figures show, as the  industry renewed calls for the government to provide incentives for private buyers.\nSome 15.2% of new cars registered in March were battery electric vehicles, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said, down from 16.2% a year earlier.\nWhile registrations of electric cars to company fleet buyers increased, sales to individuals fell.\nSales of all types of cars - including petrol, diesel and hybrids - rose in March, which is typically the busiest month of the year as new number plates are introduced.\nThe number sold increased by 10.4% to 317,786, the SMMT said. That was the best March performance for five years, although sales remain well below pre-pandemic levels.\nSales to fleet buyers - which include businesses such as car rental and taxi companies - jumped by 29.6%.\nHowever, sales to private buyers fell 7.7%, which the SMMT said reflected a tough economic backdrop of \"low growth, weak consumer confidence and high interest rates\".\nThe industry body also said the decline in market share for electric vehicles \"underscores the need for government to support consumers\".\n\"A sluggish private market and shrinking EV market share... show the challenge ahead,\" said Mike Hawes, the SMMT's chief executive.\n\"Manufacturers are providing compelling offers, but they can\u2019t single-handedly fund the transition indefinitely.\"\nThe SMMT is calling for measures such as halving VAT on electric vehicles and cutting VAT rates at public charging points.\nRobert Forrester, the chief executive of car dealership group Vertu Motors, told the BBC's Today programme that while there are incentives for companies to buy electric vehicles for their employees as company cars, there are \"no incentives at all in the retail market\".\nHe added that the high cost of electric cars was a deterrent for private buyers, and \"clearly you've got all the issues we've discussed many times about range anxiety and things like that\".\nA spokesperson for the Department for Transport spokesperson said: \u201cThe number of new electric vehicles and plug-ins sold overall is higher than last year, and this is in part thanks to government grants over the past decade, \u00a32bn in investment and ongoing tax incentives.\n\u201cThere are now over a million electric cars on our roads and we continue to help more people to make the switch to electric through schemes such as the \u00a3381m Local Electric Vehicle fund to rollout charging infrastructure.\u201d\nCar manufacturers could face fines if they fail to increase the proportion of zero-emission vehicles sold over the years ahead.\nUnder the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, at least 22% of vehicles sold this year must be zero-emission, with the target expected to hit 80% by 2030 and 100% by 2035.\nManufacturers that fail to hit the quotas could be fined \u00a315,000 per car.\n",

    "Cost, space and contamination are some of the worries facing business owners as a new workplace recycling law comes into force across Wales.\nFrom Saturday, all businesses, public sector organisations and charities will be legally required to separate their waste ready for collection.\nThe Welsh government said the majority of businesses supported the new law and its response for non-compliance would be fair and proportionate.\nFigures suggest 75% of business waste is recyclable - but it believed too much still ends up being sent to landfill, incineration plants or abroad.\nThe move forms part of plans to achieve net zero waste and reduced emissions by 2050. \n\"Businesses are fully behind the principle of recycling our waste,\" said Clare Dent, who runs a gallery and cafe in Brecon, Powys. \n\"However, our concerns are around a lack of support and communication on the ground. \n\"There are also going to be access issues with so many bins on the street, aesthetically it doesn't look good.\"\nUnder the new workplace recycling rules, businesses will be responsible for separating waste into six separate streams.\nMetals, cartons and plastics must be disposed of in one bin, paper and cardboard must be put into another, glass will be collected alone as will all food waste. \nUnsold textiles and any small electrical items should also be placed into individual bins.\nMs Dent believes not enough consideration has been given to the practical implications of the new rules.\n\nMs Dent added: \"Separating waste also means an additional time and cost implication for us. \n\"These new bins are also not lockable so someone could come along and throw any old waste in there, like a kebab, and I could be fined if Natural Resources Wales comes along and sees it's been contaminated.\"\nThere will also be a ban on businesses putting food waste into sewers and a ban on separately collected waste going to landfill or incineration plants.\nNatural Resources Wales will ensure all sectors comply with the rules, while local authorities will oversee the ban on sending food waste to sewers. \nHospitals will not have to comply with the rule changes for another two years.\nThere could be unlimited fines or court orders for businesses found to be breaking the law. \nHowever, the Welsh government insisted the response for non-compliance would be fair.\nAround two thirds of small and medium-sized businesses which responded to a Welsh government survey last year said they already recycled everything they could and almost 80% supported the law change.\nBluestone holiday park in Pembrokeshire and Cardiff University were among a small number of places where waste is already being separated in line with the imminent law change.\nDirector of Sustainability at Bluestone Marten Lewis said: \"Since installing new bins across our site for the separation of our recyclable waste, we have noticed that there is a lot less cross-contamination. \n\"The right items are ending up in the right bins, meaning that the quality of the waste we are sending for recycling has improved by more than half.\"\nBen Cottam, head of the Federation of Small Businesses in Wales, said: \"I think this is going to be one of those situations where we only fully understand the practical challenges [of the law] after it comes into force. \n\"Our message to government and the regulators is that we need a slow run in on this and as much effort needs to go into advice and support as it does with enforcement.\"\nCabinet Secretary for Climate Change, Huw Irranca-Davies said: \u201cWales is already the best in the UK for domestic recycling and third best in the world.\n\u201cWe now want to improve the quality and quantity of recycling from workplaces. This is an important step towards reaching zero waste, reducing our carbon emissions and tackling the climate emergency.\n\u201cWe want to keep materials in use for as long as possible.

It will now reach the UK on 25 April.\nPublisher HarperCollins said its release \"has been moved to coincide with Rebel Wilson's press tours\".\nThe book includes allegations against Sacha Baron Cohen, who is understood to have threatened legal action.\nThe British comedian has vehemently denied any impropriety, saying her description of shooting his 2016 film Grimsby is \"demonstrably false\".\nThe Australian star told the Sunday Times making the spy comedy was \"the worst professional experience of my career\".\nIn the book, she wrote that she was asked to do some things that were \"derogatory to women or to my size\", and some scenes made her feel like she was \"being humiliated\" and \"sexually harassed\". \nShe likened Baron Cohen to a \"fourth-grade bully who teases the fat girl on the playground and tries to make her life a living hell\".\nWilson played the girlfriend of Baron Cohen's character in the film, which was known as The Brothers Grimsby in North America.\nBaron Cohen's lawyers have said the evidence shows her allegations have \"no basis in reality\" and are part of a \"cynical commercial ploy to promote her book\".\nThey have supplied video footage of one scene in question, plus email exchanges, script excerpts and testimony from producers and crew members, which his lawyers say back up his case.\nIn a statement, Baron Cohen's spokesperson said: \"While we appreciate the importance of speaking out, these demonstrably false claims are directly contradicted by extensive detailed evidence, including contemporaneous documents, film footage, and eyewitness accounts from those present before, during and after the production of The Brothers Grimsby.\"\nLast week, the Daily Mail published outtake video footage from one of the scenes she described. She claimed the release of the \"unauthorised and misleading\" footage was \"bullying and gaslighting me\".\nWilson will go on tour to promote it in Edinburgh, Manchester and London on 24, 26 and 29 April respectively.\nShe will then move on to Australia, visiting Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne on 9, 12 and 14 May.\nIn an appearance on Kelly Clarkson's US TV talk show on Tuesday, she said the \"book itself is obviously not about this one guy\", adding: \"Like, that is one thing in one chapter.\"\nBaron Cohen made his name with a brazen brand of comedy, including audacious pranks carried out while disguised as spoof gangster Ali G or fake Kazakh journalist Borat.",
    "Three special film events with powerful messages about race and racism will take place in Folkestone in April. \nOrganised independently of one another, they showcase the work of \"three powerful female disruptors\". \nWriter Gabriella Apicella, who co-organised one of the events, said the fact that three separate film events were taking place in April proves the community is \"thriving\". \nShe said: \"One of the things I have found since living in Folkestone is there is a naturally diverse, bustling community.\" \nThe first event is a screening of a documentary about iconic artist Frida Kahlo at the Folkestone Silver Screen Cinema, followed by a Q&A with the director Carla Gutierrez.\nPart of the Doc Club's monthly documentary club, the \"intimately raw and magical journey\" will be screened on 17 April at 19:30 BST. \nNext up is BBC Radio 4\u2019s Ellen E Jones, who will be talking about her book, Screen Deep: How film and TV can solve racism and save the world.\nThe journalist will be in conversation with vintage film shop Paradiso owner Stephen Blakemore at the Folkestone Bookshop on 19 April at 18:00 BST.\nThe final event, organised by writer Gabriella Apicella and Screen South, is a screening of Ava DuVernay's highly praised film Origin, which delves into American racism. \nIt follows the journey of Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Isabel Wilkerson as she writes the book Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents and will be shown at Silver Screen Cinema on 21 April at 15:00 BST. \nGabriella said she was compelled to bring Origin to town because \"everyone needs to see it\".\nShe said: \"I had the good fortune to see Origin in December 2023 and have simply not been able to stop thinking about it since.\n\"Ava DuVernay has created this astonishing bit of work that can actually galvanise people into looking at things differently.\n\"The natural link between all these events is they are all the work of three disrupters - three highly intelligent women who say 'no, it's not got to be this way' - and they are doing it!\"\nFollow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "Plans for a new vehicle recycling centre in a village have been refused by councillors.\nWest Suffolk Council's development control committee met on Wednesday to discuss the plans on land close to the village of Stanton.\nDevelopers want to build a storage and distribution facility for processing accident damaged and non-damaged vehicles.\nResident objections were heard during the meeting with one saying there were \"robust grounds to refuse the planning application\". \nJaynic Suffolk Park Logistics Limited applied to build on land at Shepherds Grove which had existing industrial facilities used by other companies.\nAccording to planning documents, Copart UK - a company involved in the salvage and resale of used vehicles - would operate from the site.\nA new link road and roundabout to Grove Lane had also been proposed.\nDuring the meeting, councillors heard that Stanton Parish Council supported the proposal and that the \"building of a new relief road outweighs any concerns\" - despite acknowledging its impact.\nHepworth Parish Council objected, citing the traffic impact and pollution risks among its concerns.\nHepworth resident, Nigel Burrows, told councillors he objected to the plans and there had been 105 objections from residents.\n\"There are robust grounds to refuse the planning application and you should have no qualms going against the planning officer's recommendation,\" he added.\nKate Reece, another local resident, similarly told the council their own policy was to reduce the number of HGVs through Great Barton and the surrounding villages.\n\"This is surely not the way to reduce pollution on this stretch of road,\" she said.\n\"It therefore seems astounding and totally illogical for any report to come to the conclusion that there will be no significant impact on the A143 and surrounding villages.\"\nCouncillors voted with 10 for refusal of the application - and four for approval. \nThe application had previously been deferred from consideration at a previous meeting on 6 March, where councillors were minded to refuse it despite planning officer recommendation. \nDuring this meeting councillors were told additional traffic generated by the site and by cars travelling through the surrounding villages to avoid \"peak time congestion on the A143 would have a significant harmful impact on the amenity of residents\".\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Almost 20 years after PC Sharon Beshenivsky was shot and killed on her daughter's fourth birthday, the last member of the armed gang responsible for her death has been found guilty of her murder.\nThe conviction of Piran Ditta Khan, 75, marks the end of almost two decades of evading justice for his part in the killing of the West Yorkshire Police officer after she interrupted a raid at a Bradford travel agents on 18 November 2005.\nFor Andy Brennan, who was then the detective superintendent tasked with leading the manhunt, Khan's conviction is the fulfilment of a long-held promise he made to PC Beshenivsky's husband, Paul, on the day of her death.\n\"I gave him a commitment on that day that we would go to the 'nth' degree to make sure all of those responsible would be placed before the court,\" he says.\nBefore the fatal shooting in Bradford city centre earlier that evening, PC Beshenivsky had been coming to the end of her shift and was soon due to head home to join the birthday celebrations for the couple's little girl.\nMr Brennan remembers that he and Mr Beshenivsky were still surrounded by unopened cards and presents as he made his promise.\nIt was \"very humbling to see how he controlled himself in front of the children having been given the news of his wife's death,\" Mr Brennan says. \"It was an emotional time.\"\n\"I'm a father, but, for me, in that position at that time, I couldn't show my emotions because Paul was looking at me to tell him what was going on and what we were going to do,\" he adds.\nPC Beshenivsky, a 38-year-old mother of three as well as two stepchildren, had been an officer for just nine months when she was gunned down in a raid at the Universal Express travel agents.\nShot at close range and left lying on the pavement, her injuries were instantly fatal. \nHer colleague, Teresa Milburn, then 37, was also shot and seriously injured at the same time, though she survived the attack.\nThe pair had been responding to a silent panic alarm which had been activated at the travel agents on Morley Street just 30 minutes before the end of their shifts that Friday afternoon.\nIn the huge manhunt that followed, the gang, who had escaped with little more than \u00a35,000, were eventually caught.\nIn 2006, Muzzaker Imtiaz Shah and Yusuf Abdullah Jama were sentenced to life and told they would both serve at least 35 years in jail for PC Beshenivsky's murder. \nA third man, Faisal Razzaq, was cleared of her murder but found guilty of manslaughter. He was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 11 years.\nA year later, Hassan Razzaq, the brother of Faisal, was also convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 20 years in prison.\nThat same year, Raza Ul Haq Aslam, was convicted of robbery and jailed for eight years.\nHowever, two suspects remained at large. One was Mustaf Jama, who had used a friend's passport to flee to his native Somalia. The other wanted man, Piran Ditta Khan, had escaped to Pakistan. \nJama was eventually extradited in 2007 when he was smuggled out of Africa in an undercover operation. The brother of Yusuf Jama, he was found guilty of murder and jailed for life with a minimum term of 35 years.\nBut it was to be another 17 years before Khan was to face justice for his role as the robbery's instigator. \nBack in 2006, when Mr Brennan was piecing together the investigation, detectives built a picture that showed Khan was the mastermind behind the plot.\nKhan had used the travel agents to send money to Pakistan and knew that \"substantial amounts\" of cash would be held at the premises. \nLooking back, Mr Brennan says: \"The information we were getting was that he was more important in relation to the organisation of what had taken place than any of the other six individuals.\n\"The more information and evidence we got, the clearer his role became of being an instigator.\"\nBut by the time police were in a position to arrest him, Khan had already fled to Pakistan - something Mr Brennan says was \"seriously disappointing\".\nGetting Khan back to face justice was a long and drawn-out process. \nBecause there is no extradition treaty between the UK and Pakistan, a diplomatic request was made by the UK for his removal.\nMr Brennan said: \"I spent about 12 to 18 months every week going down to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Home Office.\n\"I was meeting them on a weekly basis to say, this is the position we're in, these are the individuals we want back.\n\"We put pressure on them [the authorities in Pakistan] all the time, but effectively we were in their hands to arrest one of their citizens.\"\nUp until January 2020, Khan remained free. However, he was eventually arrested in Pakistan, with his solicitor describing him as a \"scared and shivering man\".\nIt then took another three years before Khan was brought back to the UK. \nBy the time of Khan's extradition, Mr Brennan had retired from West Yorkshire Police, but recalls being \"elated\" by the development.\n\"I knew this was always bubbling away in the background and would never ",
    "Israel says it has approved the opening of two humanitarian routes into Gaza, to allow more aid into the territory.\nThe Erez Gate in northern Gaza will be temporarily re-opened for the first time since the start of the war and Ashdod Port will also be opened for humanitarian deliveries.\nMore aid from Jordan will be allowed to enter via the Kerem Shalom Crossing.\nIt comes hours after Joe Biden spoke with Israel's PM for the first time since seven aid workers were killed.\nAccording to a readout of a phone call between the US president and Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr Biden warned that Israel must take steps to prevent civilian harm and humanitarian suffering if it wanted to maintain US support.\nIt is understood that the re-opening of the corridors was specifically requested by Mr Biden in the phone call.\nMr Biden essentially gave the Israeli government an ultimatum - take concrete steps to prevent civilian harm and ensure safety for aid workers or US policy in respect of Gaza would change. \nThis was a significant shift in US policy - the first time that Washington has attempted to leverage American aid in order to influence the conduct of the war in Gaza.\nSeven people working for the food aid charity World Central Kitchen (WCK) were killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza on Monday.\nThe WCK convoy they were travelling in was hit by an Israeli air strike as it travelled south along the Israeli-designated coastal aid route, just after they had unloaded more than 100 tonnes of food from a barge at a warehouse in Deir al-Balah.\nThe vehicles were around 2.5km (1.5 miles) apart and all three were hit during the attack.\nIsrael's military apologised and called the attack a tragic mistake. It has promised a full investigation.\nThe US National Security Council said it welcomed the steps announced by Israel, which it said \"must now be fully and rapidly implemented\".\nUS policy, it added, would be determined by the steps Israel took to protect \"innocent civilians and the safety of aid workers\". \nOn Thursday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there would be a change of US policy if it did not see changes from Israel.\nThe move to open Israel's northern border crossing with Gaza in Erez is particularly significant, after Israel's Foreign Minister Eli Cohen told Israeli media in November that there would be \"no more contact between Israel and Gaza\".\nIn another development, former US president Donald Trump said Israel should get its war in Gaza \"over with\" in order to achieve peace and \"stop killing people\". \nMr Trump - a staunch ally of Israel - made the comments in a radio interview. He said that Israel was \"absolutely losing the PR war\" and should stop broadcasting video footage of its air strikes in Gaza. But he added that Israel had to finish what it had started.  \nMr Trump, who is expected to be the Republican party's candidate in November's presidential election, has previously criticised Joe Biden for being insufficiently supportive of Israel.\nMr Netanyahu has faced rising international and domestic anger at Israel's conduct in Gaza.\nA long line of lorries filled with aid has been backing up on the Egyptian side of the border with Rafah for months as they can only enter Gaza after a complex and bureaucratic series of Israeli checks.\nThe absence of adequate humanitarian supplies has forced Jordan, the US and UK to drop aid from the air - the least effective way to deliver humanitarian supplies.\nAir drops have also proved dangerous - Palestinians have been crushed when parachutes fail and have drowned as they try to swim to pallets that have landed in the sea.\nA recent UN-backed report offered evidence that the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza was turning into a man-made famine.\nAnd the UN's most senior human rights official, Volker T\u00fcrk, recently told the BBC that there was a \"plausible\" case that Israel was using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza.\nIsrael denies impeding the entry of aid or its distribution inside Gaza, and blames UN agencies on the ground for failing to get the aid that is allowed in to the people who need it.\nMore than 196 aid workers have been killed in Gaza since October, according to the US-funded Aid Worker Security Database, which records major incidents of violence against aid personnel. Not all were killed while delivering aid.\nOn Thursday GPS was blocked across swathes of Israel in order to disrupt missiles and drones, as tensions rose with Iran.\nReservists have been called up to bolster air defence units and the Israel Defense Forces also announced it was halting all leave for soldiers serving with combat units.\nIran has vowed to respond after a strike it believes Israel carried out on its consulate building in Syria on Monday killed 13 people, including a senior general.\nMuch of the Gaza Strip has been devastated during the Israeli military operations that began after Hamas-led gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages.\nMore than 33,0",

Lewis arrived in court wearing an eye patch.\nFederal guidelines in the case called for a sentence of between 18 months and two years in prison, but both defence and prosecutors urged leniency, citing Lewis' guilty plea, co-operation with authorities and poor health. \nJudge Jessica Clarke said his crimes were \"serious\" and \"strike at the integrity of our markets\" but said his circumstances did not warrant prison.\nIn court, Lewis referred to his childhood in London during the Blitz and said: \"At an early age, I learned how precious life is. I made a terrible mistake. I broke the law. I am ashamed, sorry, and I hold myself accountable.\"\nAs part of the plea deal, one of Lewis' companies, Broad Bay Ltd, also pleaded guilty to securities fraud and was fined $44m (\u00a334.8m).\nA substantial part of his fraudulent activity, according to an indictment, was not meant to pad his estimated worth of $6.2bn (\u00a34.9bn). \nInstead, the incident with his pilot Patrick O'Connor was just one of a number of times that he passed along insider information about his companies to his private pilots, friends, personal assistants and romantic partners, in order to enrich his close associates.\nIn part, the billionaire hatched the scheme because he felt bad for never setting up formal retirement plans for his pilots, according to a statement he made in court at the time of his guilty plea. \nLewis was born in London's East End and took over a restaurant business started by his father before selling it to focus on currency speculation and investments.\nHe was reportedly one of the investors who made money betting heavily against the pound prior to \"Black Wednesday\" - the UK's withdrawal from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in September 1992. \nHe founded the investment firm Tavistock Group, which has ownership stakes in a large array of property, sports, finance, energy and life sciences companies.\nLewis was ranked 39th in the 2023 Sunday Times Rich List and is best known for his ownership of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, which he bought a controlling stake in for \u00a322m in 2001 - a sum then worth around $32m. \nIn 2022, control was handed over to a family trust, and financial documents the club filed with the UK's Companies House indicate that Lewis no longer has \"significant control\" over the club.\nHis current fortune includes homes in several countries, a huge art collection and $250m (\u00a3200m) yacht, which he used to secure a bail bond after his arrest in July 2023.\nHis position in the financial world gave him access to boardroom secrets, and for years, prosecutors said, he tipped off associates so that they could take advantage, in a fraud that netted millions of dollars.\nIn addition to pilots and workers on his yacht, romantic partners were also on the receiving end of his criminal largesse. \nIn July 2019, a company called Solid Biosciences that Tavistock had invested in was looking for fresh cash. While considering the deal, Lewis was given confidential information about a clinical trial. \nHe was staying with his girlfriend in South Korea at the time, and told her to pour money into the company. She invested around $700,000. \nThe following day the couple returned via private plane to the US. Along the way, Lewis shared his insider tip with his pilots. \nAs results of the clinical trial were released, the company's shares skyrocketed. Lewis' girlfriend more than doubled her money. \nThe fraud also went beyond insider trading, prosecutors said. Starting in 2013, Lewis concealed the true scale of his holdings in companies in order to obtain favourable terms for stock deals. \nHis pilot, O'Connor, pleaded guilty to insider trading charges and will be sentenced in May. \nAnother pilot, Bryan Waugh, pleaded not guilty and will go on trial later this year.

    "Chang Hsin had just woken up in the Taiwanese city of Hualien on Wednesday when her entire block started shaking. \n\"The walls were crumbling. Shortly after, another quake hit, causing the entire house to tilt,\" the 59-year-old told the BBC.\nMs Chang was in her third floor apartment when the 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit, which killed nine people and left more than 1,000 injured in Taiwan's worst earthquake in 25 years.\nImages of Ms Chang's Uranus Building apartment block have been shared across the world. The building is tilted over and rescue workers are attempting to shore up the 10-storey structure, to prevent it from falling over.\nAfter the shaking finished Ms Chang started screaming for help, and then saw a fire engine outside. \n\"I urged them to hurry. I kept yelling 'quickly, quickly or the next aftershock is coming,'\" she recalled. \n\"The house started to tilt while I was still inside,\" she said. \"My legs were shaking, and I couldn't stand steady. I still can't calm down, especially with the aftershocks last night.\"\nLocal reports said one female teacher died in the building when she returned to rescue her cat.\nMs Chang was speaking to the BBC from a shelter for people affected by the earthquake. Sitting next to her was Wei Pang-Huan, 60, who lived on the fifth floor of the Uranus Building.\nThe block is due to be demolished on Friday, and Ms Wei wasn't sure if she would be able to collect any of her belongings.\n\"All my belongings are in the building. I wonder if I could go inside to retrieve some important items, but it depends on the rescue team's instructions,\" she said. \nRescuers in Taiwan are working to reach more than 600 people stranded after the earthquake hit the eastern county of Hualien.\nSome stuck in tunnels and near a national park have been rescued by helicopters, but 34 are still missing.\nOne Singaporean woman, who was was stuck in the mountains for a day and half, said \"it's your worst nightmare coming true\". \n\"It's like what they show in the movies. You never think you're going to experience something like that,\" she told the BBC. \n\"We felt the earth tremble and we just held on to each other.

    "The family of a British aid worker killed by an air strike in Gaza have criticised the sale of arms to Israel.\nJames Henderson was among seven aid workers who died in the Israeli attack, which his brother called \"inexcusable\". \nRishi Sunak is under growing pressure after the strike, which also killed Britons John Chapman and James Kirby, as well as Australian, Palestinian, American-Canadian and Polish nationals.\nOn Tuesday, the PM said the UK had a \"very careful\" arms licensing regime.\nEarlier, 600 legal experts wrote to the government saying weapon exports must end because the UK risks breaking international law over a \"plausible risk of genocide\" in Gaza.\nThe group of World Central Kitchen aid workers had just unloaded more than 100 tonnes of food aid and the convoy's movements had been co-ordinated with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), according to the charity.\nSpeaking on behalf of the family of former Royal Marine Mr Henderson, his brother - who declined to be named - told the Times the killings of people on a humanitarian mission was \"inexcusable\".\n\"Accountability is the only hope of justice I have\", he said. \"I don't believe our government will hold the correct people to account, but I guarantee that our government will sell weapons to Israel, which may in turn be used to kill our fellow citizens.\n\"It's hard to comprehend that.\"\nBritish arms sales to Israel are lower than those of other countries, including Germany and Italy, and dwarfed by the billions supplied by its largest arms supplier, the US.\nBut a UK ban would add to the diplomatic and political pressure on Israel, at a time when its conduct in the Gaza conflict is coming under renewed international scrutiny. \nThe BBC understands there is an ongoing assessment over whether to suspend or revoke existing export licenses to Israel, which is almost finished. \nThat assessment, which will advise on the risk of Israel breaching international law, is not a result of the recent air strike. In fact it may not even consider the incident, since it is looking at Israel's actions from early 2024. \nTechnically it is up to the business secretary to decide on issuing arms export licenses, but one MP familiar with the process said, in reality, it will be Mr Sunak who will make the decision when the Foreign Office issues its legal advice.\nOn Thursday evening, former UK foreign secretary Jack Straw told the BBC he believed it was \"perfectly obvious\" Israel was breaching international law. \nMr Straw told Radio 4's PM programme that Israeli forces had been \"caught out\" by the killing of Western aid workers but suggested they \"would have dug in and refused any accountability at all\" if all the victims had been Palestinian. \nFormer Supreme Court president Lady Hale was among the lawyers, academics and retired senior judges who signed a 17-page letter to the government on the issue of arms sales to Israel.\nIt says \"serious action\" is needed to \"avoid UK complicity in grave breaches of international law, including potential violations of the Genocide Convention\". \nThe group add that the sale of arms and weapons systems to Israel \"falls significantly short\" of the government's obligations under international law, given the \"plausible risk of genocide\" in Gaza - a situation that the letters says was highlighted in a provisional judgement issued by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in January - and the worsening humanitarian situation since. \nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Lord Sumption, the former Supreme Court judge who was one of the most notable signatories, said the UK had a duty to prevent genocide and there was a \"plausible case that is what is happening\" in Gaza.\nHe added that the \"framework of international law around war\" does not mean countries can act however they want, even if they have been provoked or attacked, \"however outrageously\".\nLord Sumption continued: \"It doesn't mean to say that you can indiscriminately slaughter innocent civilians and children. It doesn't mean to say you can attack aid convoys... It doesn't mean to say you can spend two weeks flattening hospitals.\"\nAmong other actions the letter says the government must take to meet its obligations under international law are: \nMr Sunak called for an independent investigation into the air strike, but stopped short of saying arms sales should end, in an interview with the Sun newspaper after the incident. \nHe added that the UK had been \"consistently clear\" with Israel that it must follow international humanitarian law. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described the attack as unintended and \"tragic\", and promised an independent investigation. It rejects the claim of genocide as \"wholly unfounded\".\nThe UK has licenced arms to Israel worth over \u00a3574m since 2008, when official country-level data was made available, according to pressure group Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT).\nBusiness Minister Greg Hands has previously told MPs the figure for 2022 - \u00a342m - represente",

    "For many musicians, making it big in the industry means making it in the US.\nBut some artists say they're losing money by going on tour there due to the rising costs of getting a visa.\nOverseas performers and the support staff they travel with must apply for special types of visas for professional artists and entertainers.\nFrom April, the cost has in some cases more than doubled to over $1,000 (\u00a3800) per person - and that's before additional fees.\nThe US Embassy has told BBC Newsbeat it doesn't make any money from visa charges and the price hike is down to its own rising expenses.  \nBut artists like Irish singer-songwriter CMAT say that even before the rise, getting to the US was \"extremely expensive\" and now it risks being ruled out for some musicians.\n\"Every time I go over there, I'm losing money,\" she says. \n\"We're never making money, it's not a possibility.\n\"I'm lucky enough that I'm signed now and I've made two albums so I have the money to lose in America.\" \nBut CMAT, whose real name is Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson, fears less established artists trying to break through won't be so lucky.\n\"It's a lot more difficult now than it would have been for me five years ago to get my foot in the same door,\" she tells BBC Newsbeat. \n\"It's terrible and it's a really important market to crack, especially if, like me, you're an Irish person doing country music - it's probably the most important.\"\nTour manager Nathalie Candel also worries the increasing costs will put artists off travelling to the US, which she agrees is still \"a really important market\".\n\"There are so many legendary venues and festivals, all these late-night TV shows that have music as part of them,\" she says.\n\"And the industry has changed so much over the past few decades, because you used to be able to earn a living as a musician from selling records and that's not the case anymore. \n\"So touring is just super, super important. That makes an artist able to have a career.\"\nBBC Radio 1's Sound Of 2024 winners The Last Dinner Party are among the acts trying to replicate their UK success across the Atlantic.\nThe London group are currently on tour in North America, finishing with a set at Coachella later this month.\nBut bassist Georgia Davies says it's \"becoming increasingly impossible for independent and indie label artists to get out to America, which is an absolute travesty\". \n\"There should be more funding of arts in this country to enable artists be able to do that.\"\nThere are two types of visa that artists are likely to have to apply for - O or P visas - depending on whether you're a solo artist with \"exceptional ability\" or a band of \"international renown\".\nBefore the changes, both visas cost $460. The new prices vary based on factors like who artists will be working with when they get to the US, but can be more than $1,000.\nAdditional expenses like legal costs and processing fees can add to the total bill. \nThe US embassy says it has been facing rising costs for things like rent, staffing and the technology it uses, as well as a backlog in handling applications after the Covid-19 pandemic. \nApplications have taken longer to process as a result of that backlog, leading some artists to pay up to $2,805 in extra fees to speed it up.\nFor The K's guitarist Ryan Breslyn, soaring costs have put him off returning to the US after his last tour seven years ago when the group supported The Who. \nRyan, 29, describes the cost to artists as \"silly money\". \nHe says his indie rock band from Merseyside would be looking at spending thousands per person \"before you've even stepped on the plane\".\n\"It puts people off because they simply can't afford it,\" he says.\n\"It's just a whole headache, and especially after Covid and Brexit.

    "Sales of electric cars are failing to keep up with the wider market, figures show, as the  industry renewed calls for the government to provide incentives for private buyers.\nSome 15.2% of new cars registered in March were battery electric vehicles, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said, down from 16.2% a year earlier.\nWhile registrations of electric cars to company fleet buyers increased, sales to individuals fell.\nSales of all types of cars - including petrol, diesel and hybrids - rose in March, which is typically the busiest month of the year as new number plates are introduced.\nThe number sold increased by 10.4% to 317,786, the SMMT said. That was the best March performance for five years, although sales remain well below pre-pandemic levels.\nSales to fleet buyers - which include businesses such as car rental and taxi companies - jumped by 29.6%.\nHowever, sales to private buyers fell 7.7%, which the SMMT said reflected a tough economic backdrop of \"low growth, weak consumer confidence and high interest rates\".\nThe industry body also said the decline in market share for electric vehicles \"underscores the need for government to support consumers\".\n\"A sluggish private market and shrinking EV market share... show the challenge ahead,\" said Mike Hawes, the SMMT's chief executive.\n\"Manufacturers are providing compelling offers, but they can\u2019t single-handedly fund the transition indefinitely.\"\nThe SMMT is calling for measures such as halving VAT on electric vehicles and cutting VAT rates at public charging points.\nRobert Forrester, the chief executive of car dealership group Vertu Motors, told the BBC's Today programme that while there are incentives for companies to buy electric vehicles for their employees as company cars, there are \"no incentives at all in the retail market\".\nHe added that the high cost of electric cars was a deterrent for private buyers, and \"clearly you've got all the issues we've discussed many times about range anxiety and things like that\".\nA spokesperson for the Department for Transport spokesperson said: \u201cThe number of new electric vehicles and plug-ins sold overall is higher than last year, and this is in part thanks to government grants over the past decade, \u00a32bn in investment and ongoing tax incentives.\n\u201cThere are now over a million electric cars on our roads and we continue to help more people to make the switch to electric through schemes such as the \u00a3381m Local Electric Vehicle fund to rollout charging infrastructure.\u201d\nCar manufacturers could face fines if they fail to increase the proportion of zero-emission vehicles sold over the years ahead.\nUnder the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, at least 22% of vehicles sold this year must be zero-emission, with the target expected to hit 80% by 2030 and 100% by 2035.\nManufacturers that fail to hit the quotas could be fined \u00a315,000 per car.\n",
    "A man who fled a mental health unit and killed his father was failed by the health board in charge of his care, an inquest has heard.\nA senior manager with Swansea Bay University Health Board admitted background information about Daniel Harrison, 37, was not shared with the clinician treating him. \nThe coroner's court at Swansea Guildhall also heard serious concerns about the security of the hospital unit were known before he absconded. \nDr Kim Harrison, 68, was punched, kicked and stamped on by his son at the family's home in Clydach, Swansea, in March 2022.\nHe admitted manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility and was detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act.\nHarrison had a long history of mental health problems, the inquest heard, but managed the condition with medication for more than a decade while living with his parents, where he started a furniture making business.\nBut the inquest heard that his mental health started to decline in 2021 with paranoia and aggressive behaviour towards his parents, who were both doctors, culminating in an alleged assault involving his landlord.\nIn March 2022 he was detained at a secure ward in Neath Port Talbot Hospital.\nStephen Jones, the nurse director for mental health and learning disabilities for Swansea Bay University health board told the court how background information about Harrison's mental decline was not given to the doctors treating him. \nThe assistant coroner for south west Wales, Kirsten Heaven, asked why it took 10 weeks for action on an independent review, which identified the failure to share information.\n\"I was asked to review the report for further information and accuracy so it remained as a draft,\" Mr Jones told the inquest. \nThe information still had not been shared, the inquest heard, when on 12 March 2022, Harrison barged past a nurse who had opened a secure door using a swipe card and made his way to his parents' house where he attacked his father.\nMr Jones also admitted the risk assessment done before Harrison's admission to the unit was inadequate due to staff not being fully trained, and that on 48 other occasions between 2019 and 2022 patients had fled through the same door Harrison used to escape. \nHe said the health board had since spent \u00a3640,000 on increased staffing and better security, and that risk assessment training was being done with staff. \nAsked by Bridget Dolan, representing Dr Jane Harrison, why the psychiatrist was not given proper background to the case, Mr Jones said: \"I absolutely agree it would have been useful [for the psychiatrist] to have this collateral information\".\n\nHe could not say why this was not done, but added that an email had gone out in December 2023 to clinicians \"reinforcing\" the professional expectation to record and seek out relevant background information on patients in a mental health crisis.\nMs Dolan also asked why a video recorded by police showing Harrison's violent behaviour towards his parents was not shared with his doctors or considered in the risk assessment. \nMr Jones told the inquest that for data protection reasons that type of video could not be shared by email.\nHe was also questioned about a \"robust plan\" of care for Harrison, after the alleged attack on his landlord and a mental health assessment in 21 April 2021.\n\"Does Swansea Bay health board accept this plan was not robust?\" Ms Dolan asked. \n\"Yes,\" Mr Jones replied. \nMs Dolan accused the health board of ignoring repeated warnings from Harrison's family his condition was worsening into psychosis. \n\"Do you accept there was an opportunity to engage with Dan in December 2021 when he was seeking help that wasn't taken,\" she asked. \n\"Yes, we should have,\" Mr Jones said, adding the health board had since recognised those failings and acted. \nThe inquest continues.

    "The UK is trialling blood tests to see if they can accurately diagnose Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia sooner.\nThe hope is that more people will be able to access care, support and new drug treatments at an earlier stage.\nDementia is a symptom found in many diseases of the brain. \nMemory loss is the most common symptom, particularly the struggle to remember recent events.\nOthers can include changes to behaviour, mood and personality, becoming lost in familiar places, or being unable to find the right word in a conversation. \nIt can reach the point where people don't know they need to eat or drink.\nAlzheimer's is by far the most common of the diseases that cause dementia. \nOthers include vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, fronto-temporal dementia, Parkinson's disease dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the newly discovered Late.\nThe first signs of Alzheimer's disease tend to be lapses in memory. \nThis could include forgetting recent conversations, losing things, forgetting names or repeatedly asking the same question. \nThere can also be changes in mood such as greater levels of anxiety or confusion.\nThe NHS website has information on common symptoms.\nAlzheimer's is mostly a disease of old age - one in six people over the age of 80 develop it.\nEarly onset (also known as young onset) Alzheimer's is relatively rare. Still, 5% of Alzheimer's cases are in people under 65.\nA much smaller number of people are affected in their 30s and 40s.\nThe only known risk factor for getting Alzheimer's at a young age is if close relatives also had early onset disease. There is no known way of preventing it.\nThere is no proven way of stopping yourself from getting dementia. \nHowever, research suggests that one in three cases could be prevented by lifestyle changes, including:\nIt is not completely clear why doing these things can help protect the brain. \nDo these lifestyle factors actually stop the process of dementia in the brain? Or do they prepare the brain for dementia, so that it can compensate for longer and symptoms don't emerge?\nYes, it can be - but that's not the whole story.\nBroadcaster Fiona Phillips was 61 years old when she was diagnosed with this form of dementia.\nShe has described how Alzheimer's \"decimated\" her family - and having a parent or sibling with Alzheimer's increases your risk of developing the disease. \nBut having relatives with the disease does not mean you are fated to develop it.\nAnd being in a family untouched by Alzheimer's does not mean you will not develop it.\nFor the first time, drugs have been proven to slow the pace of Alzheimer's disease in clinical trials.\nDonanemab and lecanemab target amyloid in the brain during the early stages of the disease. \nAmyloid builds up in the spaces between brain cells, forming plaques that are one of the characteristics of the disease.\nHowever, the benefit of these drugs does not appear to be huge and they do not stop or reverse the disease.\nThese drugs have not yet made the leap from scientific studies to routine hospital use. \nFiona Phillips is taking part in trials of a drug called miridesap at University College Hospital in London. This involves injections in her stomach every day for a maximum of 12 months.\nThe aim of the trial is to find out whether the drug, which removes a protein called SAP (serum amyloid P component) from the brain, can stop amyloid plaques from damaging brain cells.\nThe researchers think this could be part of the process of the development of Alzheimer's disease. \nPatients with mild Alzheimer's disease have been recruited to the DESPIAD trial, which also includes tests on brain function.",

It has promised a full investigation.\nThe US National Security Council said it welcomed the steps announced by Israel, which it said \"must now be fully and rapidly implemented\".\nUS policy, it added, would be determined by the steps Israel took to protect \"innocent civilians and the safety of aid workers\". \nOn Thursday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there would be a change of US policy if it did not see changes from Israel.\nThe move to open Israel's northern border crossing with Gaza in Erez is particularly significant, after Israel's Foreign Minister Eli Cohen told Israeli media in November that there would be \"no more contact between Israel and Gaza\".\nIn another development, former US president Donald Trump said Israel should get its war in Gaza \"over with\" in order to achieve peace and \"stop killing people\". \nMr Trump - a staunch ally of Israel - made the comments in a radio interview. He said that Israel was \"absolutely losing the PR war\" and should stop broadcasting video footage of its air strikes in Gaza. But he added that Israel had to finish what it had started.  \nMr Trump, who is expected to be the Republican party's candidate in November's presidential election, has previously criticised Joe Biden for being insufficiently supportive of Israel.\nMr Netanyahu has faced rising international and domestic anger at Israel's conduct in Gaza.\nA long line of lorries filled with aid has been backing up on the Egyptian side of the border with Rafah for months as they can only enter Gaza after a complex and bureaucratic series of Israeli checks.\nThe absence of adequate humanitarian supplies has forced Jordan, the US and UK to drop aid from the air - the least effective way to deliver humanitarian supplies.\nAir drops have also proved dangerous - Palestinians have been crushed when parachutes fail and have drowned as they try to swim to pallets that have landed in the sea.\nA recent UN-backed report offered evidence that the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza was turning into a man-made famine.\nAnd the UN's most senior human rights official, Volker T\u00fcrk, recently told the BBC that there was a \"plausible\" case that Israel was using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza.\nIsrael denies impeding the entry of aid or its distribution inside Gaza, and blames UN agencies on the ground for failing to get the aid that is allowed in to the people who need it.\nMore than 196 aid workers have been killed in Gaza since October, according to the US-funded Aid Worker Security Database, which records major incidents of violence against aid personnel. Not all were killed while delivering aid.\nOn Thursday GPS was blocked across swathes of Israel in order to disrupt missiles and drones, as tensions rose with Iran.\nReservists have been called up to bolster air defence units and the Israel Defense Forces also announced it was halting all leave for soldiers serving with combat units.\nIran has vowed to respond after a strike it believes Israel carried out on its consulate building in Syria on Monday killed 13 people, including a senior general.\nMuch of the Gaza Strip has been devastated during the Israeli military operations that began after Hamas-led gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages.\nMore than 33,0",
    "A man who fled a mental health unit and killed his father was failed by the health board in charge of his care, an inquest has heard.\nA senior manager with Swansea Bay University Health Board admitted background information about Daniel Harrison, 37, was not shared with the clinician treating him. \nThe coroner's court at Swansea Guildhall also heard serious concerns about the security of the hospital unit were known before he absconded. \nDr Kim Harrison, 68, was punched, kicked and stamped on by his son at the family's home in Clydach, Swansea, in March 2022.\nHe admitted manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility and was detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act.\nHarrison had a long history of mental health problems, the inquest heard, but managed the condition with medication for more than a decade while living with his parents, where he started a furniture making business.\nBut the inquest heard that his mental health started to decline in 2021 with paranoia and aggressive behaviour towards his parents, who were both doctors, culminating in an alleged assault involving his landlord.\nIn March 2022 he was detained at a secure ward in Neath Port Talbot Hospital.\nStephen Jones, the nurse director for mental health and learning disabilities for Swansea Bay University health board told the court how background information about Harrison's mental decline was not given to the doctors treating him. \nThe assistant coroner for south west Wales, Kirsten Heaven, asked why it took 10 weeks for action on an independent review, which identified the failure to share information.\n\"I was asked to review the report for further information and accuracy so it remained as a draft,\" Mr Jones told the inquest. \nThe information still had not been shared, the inquest heard, when on 12 March 2022, Harrison barged past a nurse who had opened a secure door using a swipe card and made his way to his parents' house where he attacked his father.\nMr Jones also admitted the risk assessment done before Harrison's admission to the unit was inadequate due to staff not being fully trained, and that on 48 other occasions between 2019 and 2022 patients had fled through the same door Harrison used to escape. \nHe said the health board had since spent \u00a3640,000 on increased staffing and better security, and that risk assessment training was being done with staff. \nAsked by Bridget Dolan, representing Dr Jane Harrison, why the psychiatrist was not given proper background to the case, Mr Jones said: \"I absolutely agree it would have been useful [for the psychiatrist] to have this collateral information\".\n\nHe could not say why this was not done, but added that an email had gone out in December 2023 to clinicians \"reinforcing\" the professional expectation to record and seek out relevant background information on patients in a mental health crisis.\nMs Dolan also asked why a video recorded by police showing Harrison's violent behaviour towards his parents was not shared with his doctors or considered in the risk assessment. \nMr Jones told the inquest that for data protection reasons that type of video could not be shared by email.\nHe was also questioned about a \"robust plan\" of care for Harrison, after the alleged attack on his landlord and a mental health assessment in 21 April 2021.\n\"Does Swansea Bay health board accept this plan was not robust?\" Ms Dolan asked. \n\"Yes,\" Mr Jones replied. \nMs Dolan accused the health board of ignoring repeated warnings from Harrison's family his condition was worsening into psychosis. \n\"Do you accept there was an opportunity to engage with Dan in December 2021 when he was seeking help that wasn't taken,\" she asked. \n\"Yes, we should have,\" Mr Jones said, adding the health board had since recognised those failings and acted. \nThe inquest continues.

    "A woman who won a work tribunal after her manager described her as \"emotional and tearful\" during her pregnancy has said the ruling felt \"bittersweet\".\nNicola Hinds, 37 and from Doncaster, said she felt \"ignored\" and was portrayed as \"hormonal\" while employed at facilities management company Mitie.\nIn February, a judge ruled Ms Hinds had been discriminated against and was unfairly constructively dismissed.\nMitie told the BBC it could not comment on individual legal cases.\nMs Hinds said she had enjoyed a great career at Mitie, which provides services such as security for many national organisations, including the BBC.\nHowever, when she shared the news of her pregnancy in April 2020, attitudes \"shifted\" and she was \"heavily encouraged\" to take on a more administrative role now that her circumstances had changed.\nMs Hinds, who was a senior regional manager, said later that year she noticed her workload was increasing and she was working longer hours \"than ever before\".\nAttempts to raise her concerns with line managers were \"ignored\", she said, and she experienced several panic attacks.\nIn an email shown to the employment tribunal, her manager, Nav Kalley, wrote: \"I was expecting this email as Nicola has become very emotional and tearful especially over the last week or so. \n\"I am very frustrated with this as she is certainly not overworked and we have been very supportive in helping her manage her workload.\"\nHe added that the matter had to be dealt with \"sensitively\" and that he wanted to try and support Ms Hinds \"as much as I can\".\nThe tribunal said Mr Kalley had been \"stereotyping\" Ms Hinds as an \"emotional, hormonal pregnant woman\" and had wanted to be seen as supportive when \"he effectively wanted her out of the way as soon as possible\".\nThe ruling read: \"The inference was that she was not fully in control of her emotions because of the pregnancy and that she was making unreasonable demands as a result, when in fact she was experiencing significant work-related stress in the advanced stages of her pregnancy, had suffered two panic attacks in short succession, felt overwhelmed, was worried about letting others down but equally concerned that she might become seriously unwell.\"\nMs Hinds said the language her manager used to describe her was \"hurtful.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour on Thursday, she said: \"Yes, I was pregnant but the hormones or the emotional feelings that I was going through at the time were not because I was a pregnant woman but because I was an exhausted employee.\"\nMs Hinds said the problems continued during her maternity leave and she was made to feel \"like a huge inconvenience\" when she did eventually return to work.\nMs Hinds said further issues and the way she was being treated led to her constructive dismissal, which is when an employee is forced to leave their job against their will due to their employer's conduct.\n\"I just felt that I could no longer work for a company that was continuously making me feel like I was an inconvenience,\" Ms Hinds said.\n\"It felt like they were trying their hardest to change everything around me to make me feel uncomfortable.\"\nIn February this year, employment judge Roger Tynan ruled that Ms Hinds was unfairly constructively dismissed and had been discriminated against.\nMs Hinds, who represented herself during the proceedings, is now in line for compensation.\nThe mother-of-two said while the result was what she had hoped for, hearing it had felt \"bittersweet\".\n\"There was no moment of fist-punching the air, there was no jumping up and down in celebration,\" she said.\n\"I felt sad that I had to go through this process and that it had taken such a long time just to get acknowledgement that what I had suffered was what I had suffered.\"\nShe now hopes her case will inspire other employers to scrutinise their own policies and leaders.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "President Joe Biden's call for a ceasefire in Gaza is the lead in the Guardian and the Telegraph. The Guardian's headline describes it as America's \"strongest rebuke\" yet to Israel since the start of the conflict. The Daily Telegraph quotes a confidante of President Biden as saying that the US is \"at that point\" where it must consider putting conditions on arms sales to Israel.\nThe i reports that the prime minister is being urged to publish legal advice received by the government on arm sales. It says Rishi Sunak is preparing to suspend the sales to Israel if new guidance suggests the country has broken international law. The i also says that civil servants, who are overseeing the export of arms to Israel, are threatening legal action against the government over concerns they will be held \"personally responsible\" for any breach of the law. Israel strongly rejects the claim it is responsible for genocide in Gaza. \nBoth the Times and the Daily Mail lead with stories about Conservative MP William Wragg, who has said to have admitted handing over colleagues' phone numbers to a man he met on a dating app. Speaking to the Times, Mr Wragg said he was scared that the man \"had compromising things\" on him and said he was \"so sorry\" his weakness had hurt other people. The paper says the incident has \"heightened\" concerns over the vulnerability of MPs to cyber-attacks. \nThe Daily Telegraph carries a warning from French President Emmanuel Macron that Russia will seek to disrupt the Paris Olympics this summer. It reports that Mr Macron told Nato foreign ministers about a \"bizarre and threatening\" phone call between Russia's defence minister and his French counterpart. Sergei Shoigu is said to have \"suggested\", without evidence, that France was involved in the recent attack on a Moscow concert hall. Asked whether he was concerned that Russia may target the Games this summer, Mr Macron reportedly replied: \"I have no doubt.\" \nThe Sun carries a photo of King Charles and Queen Camilla during their visit to Australia in 2018 on its front page.

    "Members of the National Education Union (NEU) have voted to hold a formal strike ballot if they reject this summer's pay offer.\nTeacher strikes took place across the UK last year over pay, including eight days of walkouts by NEU members in England.\nThe four teaching unions in the dispute with the government in England accepted an offer last July, but are continuing to campaign for pay rises in the next school year.\nNo more full strikes are planned at this stage, although the threat of future action has not been ruled out. \nMembers of the NEU had debated whether - and when - to hold a formal strike ballot over pay for 2024-25 at their annual conference in Bournemouth. Such a ballot could lead to more school strikes from September.\nThe Department for Education (DfE) has called the threat of another strikes ballot \"extremely disappointing\".\nLast July, the NEU, the largest teaching union, as well as the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), and NASUWT accepted the government's 6.5% pay rise for 2023-24.\nNASUWT members decided overwhelmingly against having a new formal ballot on more industrial action over pay and working conditions this year. \nASCL halted its strike ballot after accepting the government's pay offer last summer, and has held no further ballots or had any sort of industrial action since then.\nThe NAHT has also not held another ballot.\nEngland\nIn March, the NAHT, ASCL, Community, NASUWT and NEU teaching unions jointly called for a \"fully funded, inflation-plus\" pay rise for 2024-25.\nThey also called for \"significant improvements\" on workload, saying that was also needed to address problems recruiting and retaining teachers.\nEach year, the independent School Teachers' Review Body (STRB) hears submissions from each side and makes recommendations on teacher pay to the government, who ultimately decide on how much to award.\nIn its own evidence submitted to the STRB in February, the DfE said teacher pay should \"return to a more sustainable level\" after \"two unprecedented years\".\nBut the unions called for the STRB to recommend \"urgent significant additional investment\" in schools.\nWales\nLong-running action ended on 17 November after NAHT members accepted a new workload agreement along with an improved pay offer and additional funding.\nMembers had been restricting their hours since February 2023 in a dispute with Wales's 22 local councils.\nScotland\nLast year's dispute ended in Scotland when unions accepted a 7% rise for 2022-23, backdated to April. They also accepted a 5% rise in April 2023, and a 2% rise in January 2024.\nThe Education Institute of Scotland (EIS) has since submitted a claim for a pay rise of 6.5% to the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers, which represents schools, councils and the Scottish government.\nNorthern Ireland\nIn March, all five of Northern Ireland's recognised teachers' unions - the Ulster Teachers' Union, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, the NAHT, NEU and NASUWT - accepted pay offers for 2021-22, 2022-23, and 2023-24.\nThe pay offer will see starting salaries rise to \u00a330,000 and represents a cumulative total rise of 10.4%, plus a \u00a31,000 increase to other teachers and leadership pay scales.\nA meeting of the Teachers' Negotiating Committee to ratify the deal is expected to see an end to the campaign of industrial action which has been ongoing since 2022.\nAlthough none are currently planned, schools in England should open where possible in the event of a teachers' strike, the government says.\nTeachers do not have to declare in advance if they intend to strike, and there are no rules about when parents must be told about school closures.\nHead teachers take a decision on whether to shut schools. Some parents may only be told about a closure on the morning of industrial action, once staff numbers are known.\nUnder new minimum service level proposals due to come into force by September, unions will have to ensure schools in England stay open on strike days - but the unions have called the new rules \"undemocratic\".\nIn England, you can ask for leave to care for \"family and dependants\", including emergency childcare.\nYour employer must not refuse a reasonable request, but you may not be paid. Alternatively you may be able to take holiday or unpaid parental leave.\nSchools are asked to prioritise vulnerable pupils and key workers' children during strikes. They are also asked to try to prevent, or reduce, any disruption to exams and other formal assessments.\nThe NEU issued guidance to support arrangements for head teachers to \"provide the minimum level of teaching staff needed\" on strike days so students who had exams coming up could attend school.\nSchools must also support children eligible for benefits-related free school meals if they close.\nClassroom teachers were paid an average of \u00a338,982 in the 2021-22 school year in England, \u00a339,009 in Wales and \u00a340,026 in Scotland.

    "An old graveyard in rural County Tyrone might seem an unlikely place to begin a story about one of rock music's most famous sons.\nBut take a quick scan across the headstones and a familiar-sounding surname begins to stand out.\nThe graveyard in Carrickmore is the final resting place for several of Kurt Cobain's Irish ancestors.\nThe American musician rose to fame as the lead singer for the seminal grunge '90s band Nirvana.\nCobain, 27, was found dead at his home on 8 April 1994 after taking his own life.\nThe coroner found that he had died on 5 April.\nThe influence of his music is still felt decades later.\nTo mark the 30th anniversary of his passing, historians and distant relations from Carrickmore  have been speaking about the rocker's County Tyrone connections.\nDiarmuid McGurk is from the Patrician Hall in Carrickmore, and earlier this week he gave me a tour of St Columbkille Church in Carrickmore.\n\"It's mad to think you have one of the biggest rock bands in the world and one of the most iconic singers, and it all came from here,\" he said. \n\"But it's really a story about emigration.\"\nAt the back of the church are the graves of distant family relations of Kurt Cobain.\nSamuel Cobane, was born on 23 May 1823 and he grew up in the townland of Dunmisk. He and his wife Letitia married in St Columbkille Church in 1854 and six of their children were born in Carrickmore.\nIn 1875 the family left Ireland and sailed to Ontario, Canada.\nLike many other Irish people emigrating to North America at the time, their names were changed or were misspelled on official documentation and the Cobanes became Cobains.\nTheir descendants would eventually move to Washington State and the family line continued and Kurt Cobain was born on 20 February 1967 in Aberdeen, Washington.\nFrom an early age he was attracted to music and art.\nBy the age of four he could play the piano and on his 14th birthday he received his first guitar.\nThis was the beginning of a life of music, which would see him go on to form the band Nirvana.\nCobain sparked a revolution in popular culture becoming a figurehead to the grunge generation.\nBut he suffered with physical and mental health issues, as was apparent by the early 1990s, and he later developed substance addiction.\nHis death came three days before Nirvana was due to play a concert in Dublin.\nThe previous year, Cobain had given an interview to an American magazine in which he talked about his Irish roots and how he sensed he was from Ireland.\nHe said: \"I never really knew about my ancestors until this year, when I learned that the name Cobain was Irish. My parents had never bothered to find that stuff out.\n\"When we toured Ireland, we played in Cork and the entire day I walked around in a daze. \n\"I'd never felt more spiritual in my life.

    "Former Prime Minister Liz Truss was among the guests at Nigel Farage's 60th birthday party in London on Wednesday. \nFellow Conservative MP Dame Andrea Jenkyns also attended the event for Reform UK's honorary president.\nMeanwhile, there was a video message from former US President Donald Trump, who described Mr Farage as a \"prophetic leader\". \nThe ex-UKIP leader helped to found Reform from the ashes of the Brexit Party. \nThe right-wing party has pledged to stand candidates in every seat across England, Scotland and Wales at the next general election, in a challenge to the Tories. It is currently polling at around 12%. \nMr Farage has so far refused to confirm whether he will play a role in the upcoming election, which is expected later this year. \nHe is not expected to make another bid to become an MP after failing to get elected to the UK Parliament seven times, but could be given a campaigning role. \nIn a photo shared on X, Dame Andrea, the Tory MP for Morley and Outwood, said it was a \"pleasure\" to be invited to Mr Farage's party, describing him as \"a true patriot, conservative to the core\" and \"one of the most influential politicians of our generation\". \nSpotted in the background of the photo was Ms Truss. \nMr Farage recently appeared at the campaign launch of Ms Truss's Popular Conservatism group, although this was technically in his role as a GB News presenter.\nIn his video message, Mr Trump said Mr Farage he was \"very much looking forward to watching what your next move will be\", congratulating him on his \"incredible\" achievements.\nOther guests included Tory MP Mark Francois and Lee Anderson, who defected from the Tories to Reform last month.\nAlso at the event, held at Boisdale, a Scottish-themed restaurant and bar in Canary Wharf,were Reform leader Richard Tice, LeaveEU co-founder Arron Banks and reality TV star Georgia Toffolo. \nMr Farage began his political journey as a Conservative but quit the party in the early 1990s over its then pro-European stance.\nHe was warmly welcomed at the Tory Party's annual conference in Manchester last year, where he was seen dancing with former Conservative minister Priti Patel at a karaoke party. \nHis appearance prompted speculation he could rejoin the party. \nHowever, he has insisted he is committed to backing Reform at the next election.

    "A fraudster who stole more than \u00a3300,000 from three elderly people has been moved from Cardiff Prison because of threats, a court has heard. \nFormer soldier Layne Perry claimed to be a millionaire, but was living in a rented caravan in Trecco Bay, Porthcawl, in Bridgend county.\nIn December, Perry, 39, originally from Bridgend, was jailed for seven years.\nHe appeared at Cardiff Crown Court by video from HMP Berwyn, Wrexham, for a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing. \nPerry's barrister Justin Hugheston-Roberts told Judge Lucy Crowther further bank accounts belonging to Perry had been discovered.\nHe said his client was \"anxious to get the matter resolved\" and explained that Perry had been moved from Cardiff to Wrexham because of what he described as \"threats to his personal safety\".\nThe court heard that Perry's three victims had said their lives had been destroyed by his greed and cruelty. \nVal Gwiliam, 72, from Bridgend, said the distress caused by Perry led her to consider taking her life.\nDetectives are still trying unravel the complex finances and trace cash and assets Perry gained during the 18-month fraud. \nPerry met two of his victims, Ms Gwiliam and her husband Charlie, 67, at stables in the Vale of Glamorgan, where they both kept horses.\nHis third victim, Sharan Jones, 71, from Rhondda Cynon Taf, is the mother of Perry's sister's partner Theo.\nPerry met her at a Christmas party and offered to help with her finances after the death of her husband in 2017.\nAfter gaining her trust and access to her online bank accounts, he took her money and set up loans and credit cards in her name. He did the same with the Gwiliams.\nHe told all three he had made a fortune in gold, showing them bags of cash and even a gold bar. He persuaded Mr Gwiliam to invest in a business scheme involving the buying and selling of gold. \nMr Gwiliam said he had been pressured into it and did not want to do it.\nHe became close to all three. The Gwiliams said they thought of him as a son.\nBut all the time he was taking money from them, leaving them facing huge credit card bills and final demands for unpaid loans.\nAll three believed he was a wealthy and generous friend who wanted to share his good fortune with them, taking them on helicopter rides and VIP trips to the races. \nIn fact, he was spending their savings, or money from loans and credit cards on the lavish trips and high end restaurants.\nThe true scale of the fraud was only uncovered when the Gwiliams realised he had redirected their mail.\nWhen Mr Gwiliam told him and his wife were going to report the fraud to the police, Perry warned him the stress of his barrister's cross examination of Mrs Gwiliam would \"put her in hospital or in the ground.\"\nThe next Proceeds of Crime Act hearing is due to be held on 14 June.",
    "Two former head teachers at a school for children with special educational needs locked pupils in \"calming rooms\" with bolted doors, a report revealed.\nAn investigation was launched after concerns were raised about Odran Doran and Simon Black's leadership at The Bridge School in Ipswich.\nOfficials found multiple rooms with bolts when they visited the school.\nMr Doran, 66, and Mr Black, 62, were banned from teaching after a hearing led by the Teaching Regulation Agency.\nA report said Mr Doran was head teacher and associate head teacher of the school in its various formats from 1988 until 2017 - when he was replaced by his deputy Mr Black.\nThe school catered for pupils aged four to 16 who had \"significant\" special educational needs and many of whom were either non-verbal or pre-verbal.\nA room known as the \"soft play\" space - which had padded walls, cushions and was bolted - had been in use at the school, the report said.\nFurther \"calming rooms\" were introduced from 2015 and designed to be \"intentionally bleak\" to de-escalate a pupil's behaviour, Mr Doran told the hearing.\nIn his evidence, he said the bolt would be used \"to contain children if they were being aggressive and presenting a danger to themselves or others\".\nMr Doran retired in August 2017 - a month before Suffolk County Council started its investigation into the school - and was replaced by Mr Black.\nMr Black was found to have been involved in \"pushing and rolling\" a pupil from a hallway into a so-called calming room and then locking them inside, the report revealed.\nHe told the panel that he had been responding to a call for help and the student was in a \"heightened state\" and could not be calmed down in the corridor.\nThe panel found he engaged in inappropriate and unprofessional behaviour towards the vulnerable pupil.\nIn a previous statement, Mr Black admitted he had ignored an instruction from the local authority to remove locks from doors but then denied doing so in the latest proceedings.\nMr Doran was found to have been \"unprofessional and aggressive\" by restricting pupils movement by the use of locks and allowing them to be detained when it was not appropriate.\nThe Teaching Regulation Agency said both members of staff \"fell significantly short of the standards expected of the profession\".\nThey were banned from teaching indefinitely.\nThe BBC has contacted The Bridge School for comment.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A woman who has rescued hundreds of wild animals including zebras, lions and monkeys from homes in the UK is calling for more stringent controls around people keeping them as pets.\nLindsay McKenna, owner of Wildside Exotic Rescue in Herefordshire, has been saving non-native wild animals for 15 years.\n\"These animals come from back gardens, cages, they come from awful scenarios,\" explained Ms McKenna. \nA spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the current legislation was under regular review and those wishing to keep non-native animals would be carefully vetted and need a licence.\nMs McKenna, who funds the farm herself, began taking in wild animals after returning from conservation work in South Africa.\nAfter arriving back in the UK, she discovered a racoon living in someone's garage and Wildside Exotic Rescue was born when she decided to take it home.\nThe site currently cares for almost 200 animals including mountain lions, zebra, racoons and monkeys.\nSome were donated by owners who could no longer look after them, while others had been seized by police and local authorities.\nIt is currently legal to keep wild animals as pets, even those considered dangerous, under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976.\nThe legislation requires owners of such dangerous animals to get a licence from their local authority.\nLicences are granted based several criteria including safety and where the animal will be kept.\nBut Ms McKenna told the BBC: \"Very few [wild animals] need a licence and it is those that are deemed dangerous that do need one and the rest do not.\n\"So out of the 38 species here, only six require me to have a licence and be inspected.\n\"The rest, I could do what I like with them - I could abuse them, be cruel to them or be great with them.\"\nThe current legislation largely focuses on animals deemed dangerous. \nThis includes many primates, carnivores, larger or venomous reptiles, dangerous spiders and scorpions. \nBut Ms McKenna argued this was wrong and every non-native wild animal - regardless of whether it was dangerous or not - should require a licence with regular inspections. \nThe animal campaigner also claimed the act was \"mandating cruelty\".\n\"We want to put an end to the wild pet trade,\" she explained.\n\"At the moment it is possible [to own a wild animal] because it is legal. There are very few animals a UK home owner cannot get their hands on.\n\"If you fancy an animal, you just bring it home and pop it in your back garden. It is a stupid and as cruel as that.\"\nA Defra spokesperson said steps have been taken to increase the maximum prison sentence for animal cruelty to five years and legislation had been brought forward to prohibit primates being kept as domestic pets.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Somalia has expelled the Ethiopian ambassador from the country and ordered the closure of two consulates.\nIt accused Ethiopia of infringing on Somalia's \"sovereignty and internal affairs\".\nSomalia also recalled its ambassador from Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, for \"comprehensive consultations\".\nEthiopia's foreign ministry spokesperson Nebiyu Tedla told Reuters news agency the government did not have information on the matter.\nThe expulsion highlights an escalation in diplomatic tensions in the region following land-locked Ethiopia's port deal with the self-declared republic of Somaliland earlier this year. \nIts independence has not been internationally recognised and Somalia condemned the deal as an attack on its sovereignty. \nIn January, Ethiopia signed a deal with Somaliland to lease a 20km (12 miles) strip of coastline, so it could build a navy base.\nThe deal is not legally binding, though it is seen as a statement of intent and can lead to a treaty imposing obligations on those parties who have signed.\nIn exchange, Ethiopia reportedly told Somaliland it would offer it possible recognition in the future - which angered Somalia. \nSomaliland seceded from Somalia more than 30 years ago, but is not recognised by the African Union (AU) or the UN as an independent state.\nFollowing this deal, Somalia's President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud launched a diplomatic campaign and travelled to Eritrea and Egypt- two countries with fraught relations with Ethiopia. \nSomalia demanded a public reversal of the deal by Ethiopia but this has not happened.\nSomalia has described the deal as an act of aggression, adding that it was an \"impediment to\u2026 peace and stability\".\nEarlier this week Ethiopian delegates met officials from the semi-autonomous Somali province of Puntland, which has difficult relations with the central government.\nThis year Puntland said it would operate as a functionally independent state amid a dispute over Somali constitutional changes.\nThe two Ethiopian consulates that Somalia has ordered to close are in Hargeisa and Garowe, the capitals of Somaliland and Puntland, respectively.\nThe prospect of armed clashes between the two countries seems unlikely at this point. Ethiopia is one of the countries contributing soldiers to an AU peacekeeping mission in Somalia, which complicates the situation. \nThere are already concerns that the Islamist group al-Shabab might be using tensions between the two countries to recruit fighters and increase security threats. \nEscalations in the row between Somalia and Ethiopia could only worsen that.",
    "Councillors have been asked to refuse plans for a 2,100ft (650m) zip wire attraction in Scarborough for a second time.\nAn amended proposal for a zip line experience in the town's North Bay could be refused at a North Yorkshire Council meeting on April 11.\nBig Bang Promotions' plans are being recommended for refusal by officers over concerns it would cause \"significant harm\" to the character of the area.\nAt the last meeting in February, councillors chose to defer a decision to allow the applicant to amend the plan, but planning officers said that the changes did not \u201csignificantly reduce the overall visual or heritage impacts of the development\u201d.\nThe zip line would consist of several wires between two steel-framed towers, measuring 115ft (35m) and 62ft (19m) in height, running from the former Mr Marvel\u2019s Leisure Park to the south of the Scalby Mills Miniature Railway Station.\nPlanning officers previously said the impact of the \"visually dominant\" towers on Scarborough's conservation area was key to their decision to recommend refusal.\nAccording to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, Big Bang Promotions is now seeking temporary planning permission for five years, and would leave out most of the cladding from the launch tower, keeping \u201conly what is required for security at ground level\u201d. \nThis would leave most of the launch tower exposed in an off-white colour while the landing tower\u2019s cladding has also been amended from blue to a \u201cgreen contour graphic design\u201d.\nCouncillors on the Scarborough and Whitby area planning committee described the attraction as \u201cdesperately needed\u201d but said that changes were required to make it acceptable.\nMore than 170 locals wrote letters in support of the plan and more than 40 letters of objection were received.\nJames Field, owner of Big Bang Promotions, emphasised the economic benefits of the zip line, which he said could \u201creposition Scarborough as a forward-thinking destination\u201d as well as creating 10 full-time jobs and 40 part-time jobs. \nFollow BBC Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

    "A woman who won a work tribunal after her manager described her as \"emotional and tearful\" during her pregnancy has said the ruling felt \"bittersweet\".\nNicola Hinds, 37 and from Doncaster, said she felt \"ignored\" and was portrayed as \"hormonal\" while employed at facilities management company Mitie.\nIn February, a judge ruled Ms Hinds had been discriminated against and was unfairly constructively dismissed.\nMitie told the BBC it could not comment on individual legal cases.\nMs Hinds said she had enjoyed a great career at Mitie, which provides services such as security for many national organisations, including the BBC.\nHowever, when she shared the news of her pregnancy in April 2020, attitudes \"shifted\" and she was \"heavily encouraged\" to take on a more administrative role now that her circumstances had changed.\nMs Hinds, who was a senior regional manager, said later that year she noticed her workload was increasing and she was working longer hours \"than ever before\".\nAttempts to raise her concerns with line managers were \"ignored\", she said, and she experienced several panic attacks.\nIn an email shown to the employment tribunal, her manager, Nav Kalley, wrote: \"I was expecting this email as Nicola has become very emotional and tearful especially over the last week or so. \n\"I am very frustrated with this as she is certainly not overworked and we have been very supportive in helping her manage her workload.\"\nHe added that the matter had to be dealt with \"sensitively\" and that he wanted to try and support Ms Hinds \"as much as I can\".\nThe tribunal said Mr Kalley had been \"stereotyping\" Ms Hinds as an \"emotional, hormonal pregnant woman\" and had wanted to be seen as supportive when \"he effectively wanted her out of the way as soon as possible\".\nThe ruling read: \"The inference was that she was not fully in control of her emotions because of the pregnancy and that she was making unreasonable demands as a result, when in fact she was experiencing significant work-related stress in the advanced stages of her pregnancy, had suffered two panic attacks in short succession, felt overwhelmed, was worried about letting others down but equally concerned that she might become seriously unwell.\"\nMs Hinds said the language her manager used to describe her was \"hurtful.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour on Thursday, she said: \"Yes, I was pregnant but the hormones or the emotional feelings that I was going through at the time were not because I was a pregnant woman but because I was an exhausted employee.\"\nMs Hinds said the problems continued during her maternity leave and she was made to feel \"like a huge inconvenience\" when she did eventually return to work.\nMs Hinds said further issues and the way she was being treated led to her constructive dismissal, which is when an employee is forced to leave their job against their will due to their employer's conduct.\n\"I just felt that I could no longer work for a company that was continuously making me feel like I was an inconvenience,\" Ms Hinds said.\n\"It felt like they were trying their hardest to change everything around me to make me feel uncomfortable.\"\nIn February this year, employment judge Roger Tynan ruled that Ms Hinds was unfairly constructively dismissed and had been discriminated against.\nMs Hinds, who represented herself during the proceedings, is now in line for compensation.\nThe mother-of-two said while the result was what she had hoped for, hearing it had felt \"bittersweet\".\n\"There was no moment of fist-punching the air, there was no jumping up and down in celebration,\" she said.\n\"I felt sad that I had to go through this process and that it had taken such a long time just to get acknowledgement that what I had suffered was what I had suffered.\"\nShe now hopes her case will inspire other employers to scrutinise their own policies and leaders.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "A man who fled a mental health unit and killed his father was failed by the health board in charge of his care, an inquest has heard.\nA senior manager with Swansea Bay University Health Board admitted background information about Daniel Harrison, 37, was not shared with the clinician treating him. \nThe coroner's court at Swansea Guildhall also heard serious concerns about the security of the hospital unit were known before he absconded. \nDr Kim Harrison, 68, was punched, kicked and stamped on by his son at the family's home in Clydach, Swansea, in March 2022.\nHe admitted manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility and was detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act.\nHarrison had a long history of mental health problems, the inquest heard, but managed the condition with medication for more than a decade while living with his parents, where he started a furniture making business.\nBut the inquest heard that his mental health started to decline in 2021 with paranoia and aggressive behaviour towards his parents, who were both doctors, culminating in an alleged assault involving his landlord.\nIn March 2022 he was detained at a secure ward in Neath Port Talbot Hospital.\nStephen Jones, the nurse director for mental health and learning disabilities for Swansea Bay University health board told the court how background information about Harrison's mental decline was not given to the doctors treating him. \nThe assistant coroner for south west Wales, Kirsten Heaven, asked why it took 10 weeks for action on an independent review, which identified the failure to share information.\n\"I was asked to review the report for further information and accuracy so it remained as a draft,\" Mr Jones told the inquest. \nThe information still had not been shared, the inquest heard, when on 12 March 2022, Harrison barged past a nurse who had opened a secure door using a swipe card and made his way to his parents' house where he attacked his father.\nMr Jones also admitted the risk assessment done before Harrison's admission to the unit was inadequate due to staff not being fully trained, and that on 48 other occasions between 2019 and 2022 patients had fled through the same door Harrison used to escape. \nHe said the health board had since spent \u00a3640,000 on increased staffing and better security, and that risk assessment training was being done with staff. \nAsked by Bridget Dolan, representing Dr Jane Harrison, why the psychiatrist was not given proper background to the case, Mr Jones said: \"I absolutely agree it would have been useful [for the psychiatrist] to have this collateral information\".\n\nHe could not say why this was not done, but added that an email had gone out in December 2023 to clinicians \"reinforcing\" the professional expectation to record and seek out relevant background information on patients in a mental health crisis.\nMs Dolan also asked why a video recorded by police showing Harrison's violent behaviour towards his parents was not shared with his doctors or considered in the risk assessment. \nMr Jones told the inquest that for data protection reasons that type of video could not be shared by email.\nHe was also questioned about a \"robust plan\" of care for Harrison, after the alleged attack on his landlord and a mental health assessment in 21 April 2021.\n\"Does Swansea Bay health board accept this plan was not robust?\" Ms Dolan asked. \n\"Yes,\" Mr Jones replied. \nMs Dolan accused the health board of ignoring repeated warnings from Harrison's family his condition was worsening into psychosis. \n\"Do you accept there was an opportunity to engage with Dan in December 2021 when he was seeking help that wasn't taken,\" she asked. \n\"Yes, we should have,\" Mr Jones said, adding the health board had since recognised those failings and acted. \nThe inquest continues.

    "The US has told Israel that its ongoing support on the Gaza war is dependent on \"specific, concrete steps\" to boost aid and prevent civilian deaths.\nPresident Joe Biden spoke to Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu in the wake of the deaths of seven World Central Kitchen (WCK) staff on Monday.\nIsrael apologised for a \"grave mistake\" but WCK founder Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s said his workers were systematically targeted.\nMr Biden faces pressure to rein in unconditional military aid for Israel.\nIn a readout of the telephone call between the two leaders, which lasted less than 30 minutes, the White House said that the president \"emphasised that the strikes on humanitarian workers and the overall humanitarian situation are unacceptable\". \n\"He made clear the need for Israel to announce and implement a series of specific, concrete, and measurable steps to address civilian harm, humanitarian suffering, and the safety of aid workers,\" the summary said.\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken mirrored the White House statement when he said that if the US did not see changes from Israel, then there would be a change of US policy.\nResponding to a question of whether that could affect arms shipments to Israel, the White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said he did not want to \"preview the steps and decisions\" that were yet to be made. \nHe added that the US expected Israel to improve conditions in Gaza within \"hours and days\".\nMr Kirby however stated that US support for \"Israel's self-defence remains iron-clad. The United States isn't going to walk away from helping Israel defend itself\". \n\"That said, you can say all that and... still believe that the manner in which they're defending themselves against the Hamas threat needs to change.\"\nIsrael has yet to comment on the US statements. However, Raquela Karamson, government spokeswoman said before the Biden-Netanyahu call that Israel would \"certainly adjust our practices in the future to make sure this does not happen again\".\nThe US statements are the most strident issued so far on Israel - reflecting President Biden's \"outrage\" at the killing of the World Central Kitchen workers, and signalling that there is a limit to US support. \nThe statement however does not set out which \"US policy\" areas will be affected - but the bedrock to the US-Israel relationship is the supply of weapons.\nMr Biden's call with Mr Netanyahu came as the president faced rising domestic anger at Israel's conduct in Gaza, and growing demands from within his party to place conditions on arms transfers.\nDelaware Senator Chris Coons, a Biden confidant and member of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that he would \"vote to condition aid to Israel\" if Mr Netanyahu launched his long-threatened offensive on Rafah, where 1.5 million displaced Palestinians are camped, and made \"no provision for civilians or for humanitarian aid\".\n\"I've never said that before, I've never been here before,\" Mr Coons told CNN on Thursday. \"I've been a strong supporter of Israel the whole time I've served in Congress. \n\"The challenge is to make it clear that we support the Israeli people... but that the tactics by which the current prime minister is making these decisions don't reflect the best values of Israel or of the United States.\"\nMr Biden has sharpened his rhetoric over Israel's conduct in the nearly six-month-old war sparked by Hamas's 7 October attack, and voiced his growing frustration with Mr Netanyahu. \nHowever, military supplies including bombs, missiles and ammunition have continued to flow from the US to Israel uninterrupted. \nMr Biden on Tuesday said that he was \"outraged and heartbroken\" by the deaths of the seven WCK workers, but added that it was \"not a stand-alone incident\" in a war where many aid workers had been killed. \nHe said Israel's promised investigation into the strike \"must be swift, it must bring accountability, and its findings must be made public\".\nDemocratic congressman Jim McGovern, of Massachusetts, said that Mr Biden's call and warning to Israel on Thursday was \"quite frankly insufficient\". \n\"Simply expressing your deep concern over the terrible tragedy... quite frankly is insufficient. I welcome the shift in tone by President Biden. I think he's deeply troubled by this but I'm not sure Benjamin Netanyahu will be moved by words. President Biden has leverage and he ought to use that leverage.\"\nAccording to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, more than 33,000 people - mostly women and children - have been killed in the war. The conflict was sparked by Hamas's killing of more than 1,200 people in Israel and the taking of 240 hostages in its attack on 7 October.",

    "The Danish military was forced to temporarily close a major shipping lane and nearby airspace after a missile launcher onboard a ship malfunctioned.\nThe National Maritime Authority issued a warning for vessels to avoid part of the Great Belt strait off the coast of Denmark on Thursday afternoon due to a risk of \"falling missile fragments\".\nA naval exercise began in the area last month and is due to end on Friday.\nThe shipping lane was reopened on Thursday evening after about six hours.\nIn a statement, the Danish military said the problem with the missile occurred \"during a mandatory test where the missile launcher is activated and cannot be deactivated\". \n\"Until the missile launcher is deactivated, there is a risk that the missile can fire and fly a few kilometres away,\" the military added. \nThe missile was launched from the Niels Juel frigate, which has been part of Nato's standing naval force since 2023. \nThe warning covered an area south-west of the town of Korsor, some 4km (2.5 miles) south of the Great Belt bridge, which crosses the strait.\nThe bridge remained open to traffic, its operator said.\nThe defence ministry said the missile contained 150kg of explosives, adding that it was not armed and would not detonate if it crashed into the sea. \nIn a later statement, the ministry said specialists had \"carried out a number of different tests after which it was established that the booster was not armed and that there is no longer a risk that the missile can be launched\".\nThe incident in the Great Belt strait comes at the end of a difficult week for the Danish navy. \nOn Wednesday, the chief of defence, Gen Flemming Lentfer, was sacked for failing to report a malfunctioning weapons systems on a Danish frigate, the Iver Huitfeldt, in the Red Sea. \nDenmark's defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, said he had lost his trust in Mr Lentfer, who did not inform the defence ministry that the frigate's radar and missile systems failed as it came under attack from a drone controlled by Houthi militants. \nThe Iver Huitfeldt was helping to safeguard commercial sea traffic from Houthi attacks as they launched a campaign of support for Palestinians following Israel's offensive in Gaza. \nNeither the crew nor the ship were harmed during the deployment.

    "A humble terraced home in Bradford unlocks the childhood of literature's most famous sisters, the Bront\u00ebs.\nFor the first time in its 200-year history the terraced house in Thornton is under public ownership.\nMore than 700 investors helped a community group to complete the purchase of the house on Market Street.\nIt is hoped restoration work allowing them to open to the public will be finished by 2025 when Bradford is the UK City of Culture.\nVice chair of Bront\u00eb Birthplace Steven Stanworth said the property retained many of its original features, including the fireplace in front of which the Bront\u00eb children were born between 1816 and 1820.\nCharlotte, Patrick Branwell, Emily and Anne Bront\u00eb were all brought into the world in the property's parlour.\nThe siblings later went on to write poetry and novels, with the women originally writing under pen names.\nSome of their most famous works include Emily's Wuthering Heights, Charlotte's Jane Eyre and Anne's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.\n\"There's a presence in this building and where we're stood right now, where the girls were born, is where you can feel it,\" Mr Stanworth said.\n\"Any Bront\u00eb fan would get that tingling up the spine.\"\nMore than 200 years ago, the house would have been \"vibrant and alive\", according to Mr Stanwell, with six children, two maids and parents Patrick and Maria.\nBront\u00eb Birthplace hopes the restoration work will transform the property back to how it would have appeared in the 19th Century.\nGillian Wilson, head teacher at St Oswald's primary school in Bradford, said the story of the Bront\u00ebs gave children something to aspire towards.\n\"I brought a party of children here last year and the first thing they said to me was 'it's just a normal street, it's exactly like where we live'.\n\"To have that experience there for children to recognise that these three girls were born in this house here, and if they achieved it two hundred years ago, then our children certainly can.\"\nDirector of Bront\u00eb Birthplace Christa Ackroyd added that the property was a great example of what Bradford had to offer for City of Culture 2025.\nMs Ackroyd said: \"These girls are the perfect example of, out of difficult times, greatness can be achieved and that can be our lesson and our inspiration.\"\nShe said doing something with the house had been a \"long-held dream\", since she first fell in love with it two decades ago.\nThe project came to fruition through the help of donors and government funding, with distant relatives of the Bront\u00ebs also contributing.\nNigel West, who donated money to help purchase the house, said: \"My father's aunt was a cousin of Arthur Bell Nicholls, who was Charlotte Bronte's husband. \n\"So it's a tenuous family link, but it's been of interest to me and was a catalyst to get involved in this wonderful project.\"\nWhen the house reopens to the public after being empty for four years, organisers said visitors would be invited to sit in its community caf\u00e9 beside the fireplace or \"even stay in the bedrooms where the girls slept\".\nThey also plan a full programme for schools, universities, literary enthusiasts, artists and creatives.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "An Israeli cabinet minister has denied claims Israeli forces deliberately targeted seven World Central Kitchen (WCK) aid workers in Gaza. \nWCK founder Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s has accused Israel of targeting his workers \"systematically, car by car\".\nNir Barkat, Israel's minister of economy, told BBC News that Mr Andr\u00e9s' allegations were \"nonsense\". \nIsrael says the strikes which killed the workers were a \"grave mistake\" and has promised an investigation.\nOn Wednesday, Mr Andr\u00e9s told Reuters news agency that what the Israeli forces had done was not a \"bad luck situation where, 'oops', we dropped the bomb in the wrong place\". \nIn a separate interview with Israel's Channel 12 news, the Spanish-American celebrity chef said \"it was really a direct attack on clearly marked vehicles whose movements were known by everybody at the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]\".\nFollowing Mr Andr\u00e9s' comments, Nir Barkat told the BBC Israel was \"terribly sorry\" about killing the seven aid workers but that \"unfortunately, in wars friendly fire happens\".\nHe said \"it's part of war, we do everything we can that it will not happen and learn [from] the incident and make sure it does not happen again\". \nThe killings have drawn widespread international condemnation. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has \"demanded a thorough and transparent independent investigation\", while US President Joe Biden accused Israel of not doing enough to protect aid workers and civilians. \n\"The United States has repeatedly urged Israel to deconflict their military operations against Hamas with humanitarian operations, in order to avoid civilian casualties,\" Mr Biden said.\nAsked specifically about Mr Andr\u00e9s' concerns that his aid workers had tried to call the IDF during the separate strikes, and that they had been deliberately targeted, Mr Barkat said: \"That's nonsense, I'm sorry.\"\n\"With all due respect there's no way in the world that Israel would target people that come to give people aid,\" he said.\nHamas, he added, intentionally attacked Israeli villages on 7 October, raping and killing women.\nAccording to WCK, the aid convoy was hit while leaving the Deir al-Balah warehouse, \"where the team had unloaded more than 100 tonnes of humanitarian food aid brought to Gaza on the maritime route\".\nThe convoy was made up of three vehicles, including two that were armoured, which clearly displayed the charity's logo.\nThe vehicles were around 2.5km (1.5 miles) apart and all three were hit during the attack.\nThe bodies of six of the foreign WCK workers have been taken to Egypt to be repatriated and their 25-year-old Palestinian colleague was buried in his hometown in Rafah, southern Gaza, on Tuesday.\nWCK announced that it had suspended operations on Tuesday, putting humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip in doubt. \nAccording to Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body in charge of civilian policy in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, WCK is responsible for 60% of the non-governmental aid getting into the territory.\nWCK said it had distributed 42 million meals in the Gaza Strip - dispatching more than 1,700 food trucks and also sending close to 435,000 meals by sea.\nThe UN also announced it was pausing movements at night for at least 48 hours to evaluate the security situation.\nAnd a second charity, the American Near East Refugee Aid (Anera), which was working closely with WCK, told the BBC it has also frozen its operations in Gaza.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described the strike as unintentional.\n\"It happens in war, we check it to the end, we are in contact with the governments, and we will do everything so that this thing does not happen again,\" Mr Netanyahu said on Tuesday.\nThree of the killed aid workers were British nationals. A Polish national, an Australian, a Palestinian and a dual US-Canadian citizen were also killed.\nMore than 196 aid workers have been killed in Gaza since October, according to the US-funded Aid Worker Security Database, which records major incidents of violence against aid personnel. Not all have been killed in the line of duty.\nMuch of the Gaza Strip has been devastated during the Israeli military operations that began after Hamas-led gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages.\nAbout 130 of the hostages remain in captivity, at least 34 of whom are presumed dead.\nMore than 33,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, the Hamas-run health ministry says.",
    "There is no sign of contamination of Baltimore's Patapsco River after a ship hit a major bridge and brought the structure crashing down, officials say.\nThe ship was carrying hundreds of tonnes of hazardous materials when it struck the Francis Scott Key Bridge. Six people died in the disaster.\nResidents had voiced concern about water safety after last week's incident, which is being investigated. \nThe vessel remains trapped under the bridge and the cleanup is ongoing. \nConcerns stemmed from the fact that 56 containers with 764 tonnes of hazardous materials were on board the Dali at the time it struck the bridge, according to officials.\nSome of the containers were damaged. \nBut no contaminants have been found in the water, Maryland officials say, after samples were taken both up- and down-river. \nBaltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said he had been contacted by locals concerned about the risks to both people and wildlife.\n\"Folks have been tagging on social media videos about not being able to eat crabs this summer and it's going to be all of these things in the water,\" the mayor said, as quoted by CBS News. \n\"You heard it from the governor, you heard it from our MDE (Maryland Department of the Environment) folks, there is no contamination in the water.\"\nEight construction workers were repairing potholes on the bridge when container ship Dali veered into one of its columns on 26 March, collapsing most of the structure.\nTwo of them were rescued and the bodies of two others have been recovered. The search for the remaining four - who are presumed dead - has been put on hold due to the challenges posed by debris.\nThose involved in the complex clean-up mission have been cutting debris from the bridge into smaller pieces that can be removed and taken to a disposal site.\nShipments are suspended are the port, which is one of the busiest in the US, although a temporary route for \"commercially essential\" vessels has now opened near the collapsed bridge.\nThe Port of Baltimore is a key economic generator for the state of Maryland and a vital artery for imports and exports of US and global trade.\nExperts say it could take a month before it reopens, and years to rebuild the bridge. It is thought an investigation into last week's incident may take years.\nThe Dali container vessel - which is nearly as long as the Eiffel Tower - remains on the water.

    "A rising number of e-scooters are being seized by police as buyers fall foul of the law and disreputable sellers.\nElectric scooters are an increasingly common sight on the streets, with some selling online for as little as \u00a320.\nA BBC investigation found numerous sellers flouting guidelines by failing to mention they are illegal to ride publicly in the UK - a tactic leaving buyers out of pocket and facing police action.\nOne mum, whose child had a \u00a31,000 scooter seized, is echoing calls from authorities for sellers to be upfront.\nDays after Maryjane Holmes, from Darlington, bought the scooter for her daughter it was removed by police.\nThe 11-year-old rode it to a nearby shop but it was seized on the grounds it was not insured.\nMs Holmes was unaware of current legislation around e-scooters which treats them as motor vehicles, with riders subject to the same rules, offences and penalties as other motorists.\nUnder UK law, private e-scooters are illegal to use on public roads, while rental scooters can only be used in 20 areas permitted as part of a national trial.\nThose who ride them illegally risk having the vehicle confiscated and could receive a \u00a3300 fine, six points on their driving licence and a possible criminal record.\nMs Holmes said the seller had not informed her of the law, adding: \"I want to warn other people that this can happen.\n\"We weren't allowed the scooter back and I think we should have had a warning first.\n\"My daughter was really upset.\"\nThe BBC found evidence of several online retailers offering e-scooters to the UK market without mention of current laws.\nWe also approached a number of sellers offering e-scooters via online marketplaces and asked if they could be used legally on UK roads.\nIn every case but one, the seller said yes.\nA government spokesman said it is illegal for retailers to knowingly mislead buyers, adding: \"We have written to them numerous times to ensure they provide customers with accurate information on where e-scooters can be used.\"\nThe Association of British Insurers (ABI) has called for a review of sale regulations to ensure sellers and manufacturers \"clearly set out to buyers their legal responsibilities\".\nFigures obtained by the BBC show police forces in north east England are seizing an increasing number of e-scooters.\nData for Cleveland Police and Durham Constabulary show six were seized in 2019, compared to 24 last year.\nNorthumbria Police said 97 had been seized in the past five years, contributing to a total of 187 across the region, a small proportion of which were seized from children.\nCleveland Police said the force is currently \"working through options\" to decide on a proportionate response to the illegal riding of e-scooters \"so we do not unintentionally criminalise children or young people\".\nKevin Salter, Durham Constabulary's roads policing inspector, urged potential buyers to make sure they know the law and how to use them safely.\n\"While many people might consider an e-scooter to be a fun toy for their child, they often aren't aware of what is required should you purchase one,\" he added.\nResearch suggests e-scooters being sold to the UK market generally do not meet the country's road safety standards for motorised vehicles and, as such, cannot be insured for public use.\nThe ABI said insurers are concerned about fire risks from lithium batteries and the potential hazard e-scooters can pose.\nBut manufacturers and users say there is a growing market for the vehicles, which are used widely in other countries.\nThe founder of Swifty Scooters, which recently launched a road-safe e-scooter, believes current laws should be amended to allow less powerful electric scooters to be governed by similar rules to bicycles.\nJason Iftakhar said: \"Having kids being stopped by police is a bit much, unless pedestrians are being put at risk.\n\"We are one of the last countries in Europe to legalise this type of scooter. The laws should be simple, pragmatic and sensible.\n\"There will always be outliers where someone is being silly, but generally, a lot of people get a lot of benefit from using e-scooters.\"\nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "A mysterious anti-pothole protester calling herself \"Daventry Banksie\" says her campaign is a battle against \"an accident waiting to happen\".\nThe signs began appearing in and around the Northamptonshire town last month.\n\"Daventry Banksie\" (sic) who is female, having previously believed to be male, said she wanted to send a message \"that this [road conditions] is not on\".\nWest Northamptonshire Council says it understands \"people's frustrations\" and is prioritising \"essential work first\".\nThe Conservative-controlled council said it had received nearly 4,000 reports about potholes in Daventry in the past six months but that it was \"significant task\".\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Northampton, \"Daventry Banksie\" said she was moved to take action, having followed behind her husband as he took his motorbike for its MOT.\nShe said: \"I was thinking what on earth is he doing. He was in the middle of the road, then he was on the opposite side of the road.\n\"Suddenly I thought... I'm doing the same\u2026 it's the potholes. I'm sitting in my car watching my life on that bike. Because that's what he is. My heart was in my mouth.\"\nThe campaigner's first sign welcomed drivers to \"Pot Hole City - twinned with Grand Canyon\".\nLater, one of the hand-painted signs dubbed a roundabout \"Pot Holy Island\", while another boasted two notices warning drivers of \"hole after hole\" and invited them to \"hold on tight\".\nShe said: \"I wanted to get my political message across. I wanted to say to the people of Daventry, this is not on. We deserve better.\"\nAsked why she had chosen to stay anonymous, \"Daventry Banksie\" said: \"Because it's not about me. I want it to be like a Spartacus moment. I want everyone to say 'I am Daventry Banksie'.\"\nIn a statement, council leader Jonathan Nunn, said: \"Like all councils we face a challenge with roads deteriorating in the cold and wet winter weather and requiring urgent action.\n\"We know the state of our roads matters to the public. We spend \u00a326m across our road and transport services annually, but the reality is to properly resurface all our roads in West Northants would cost as much as \u00a3250m when our total budget for a year is just \u00a3400m.\"\nHe said: \"Some of the repairs of most concern to residents in the Daventry area are on particular busy roundabouts, where we have repaired some, with one key roundabout scheduled for later this month as it requires a deeper repair which can only be properly repaired with the certainty of warmer spring weather.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The industrial revolution in Britain may have started 100 years before the mid-18th Century assumption, a study has found.\nThe Cambridge University research reveals a 17th Century surge in people producing goods and a decline in agricultural workers.\nExperts analysed 160 million records - spanning three centuries.\nProf Leigh Shaw-Taylor said: \"The story we tell ourselves about the history of Britain needs to be rewritten.\"\n\"We have discovered a shift towards employment in the making of goods that suggests Britain was already industrialising over a century before the Industrial Revolution,\" the professor of economic history said.\n\"Britain was already a nation of makers by the year 1700.\"\nMore than 160 million records, including census data, parish registers and probate records from the Elizabethan era to the eve of World War One, were analysed to compile Cambridge University's Economies Past website. \nThis revealed a steep decline in agricultural peasantry in the 17th Century as people manufactured goods.\nWorkers included blacksmiths, shoemakers and wheelwrights and networks of home-based weavers producing cloth for wholesale.\nFor example, Norfolk was probably the 17th Century's most industrialised county, with 63% of adult men in industry by 1700. \nProf Shaw-Taylor estimated the share of the British labour force in an occupation involving manufacturing rather than agriculture was three times that of France by 1700. \nWhile he \"can't say for certain\" why the change occurred in Britain rather than elsewhere, \"the English economy of the time was more liberal, with fewer tariffs and restrictions, unlike on the continent,\" he said.\nBy the early 1800s, when William Blake was writing of \"dark satanic mills\", numbers involved in manufacturing had long been flatlining, according to the study.\nIn fact, by the mid-18th Century - traditionally considered the start of the Industrial Revolution - much of England's South and East had actually lost its long-established industries and even returned to farm labour.\nFor Norfolk, this meant the number of men working in industry dropped to 39%, while the share of the male workforce in agriculture jumped from less than a third (28%) in the 1700 to more than half (51%).\nMeanwhile, parts of Britain \"deindustrialised\", with workers moving to the coalfields and the 19th Century saw a boom in the service sector, previously considered to have begun in the 1950s.\nWorkers included sales clerks, domestic staff, professionals such as lawyers and teachers, as well as a huge increase in transport workers on the canals and railways.\nAs textile production moved out of homes, far fewer women engaged in the labour market from \"between 60-80% in 1760, back down to 43% by 1851\", the professor said. \n\"It didn't return to those mid-18th Century levels until the 1980s,\" he added.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Clinical hospital workers in Wirral have accepted a new pay deal, ending nearly six months of strike action. \nStaff agreed a deal with NHS bosses for a wage rise backdated to April 2018 for 600 workers, union officials said.\nWorkers at Arrowe Park and Clatterbridge hospitals first took strike action in August amid a campaign to be moved to a different pay band.\nWirral University Teaching Hospital NHS Trust said it was \"glad\" to reach an agreement.\nThe Unison trade union had argued clinical support workers (CSWs) on band 2 of the NHS's Agenda for Change pay scale should only be providing personal care such as bathing and feeding.\u202f\nHowever, officials said CSWs at the two hospitals had been routinely undertaking clinical tasks, such as taking and monitoring blood, performing electrocardiogram tests and inserting cannulas, for many years.\nUnison said, according to NHS guidance, staff performing these duties should be on salary band 3, which amounts to nearly \u00a32,000 per year more.   \nUnison north west regional organiser, David McKnight, described it as a \"shame\" that the trust had taken so long to reach a deal.\n\"Wirral's clinical support workers are completely dedicated to serving the local community but among the lowest paid staff in the NHS,\" he said.\n\"All they ever asked is for their pay to reflect the jobs they were carrying out.\"\nClatterbridge Hospital clinical support worker Nikki said she and her colleagues were \"over the moon\" the trust had agreed to the deal.\n\"We're the lowest-paid workers in the NHS but for years we've been plugging the gaps by performing vital clinical duties across the service,\" she said.\n\"Without our work, patients wouldn't receive the care they deserve.

    "New evidence on the Guildford pub bombings has emerged 50 years after the IRA detonated two devices in the town.\nSurrey Police told a family of one of the five people killed in the attack that the next step \"would be a new criminal investigation\", lawyers said.\nBut officers will not launch an inquiry before a new law comes in that would help shield perpetrators, they added.\nPolice said they remained committed to facilitating justice for the families of those who were killed.\nKRW Law said a post-inquest assessment had, according to Surrey Police, \"identified a potential forensic line of enquiry and the next step would be a new criminal investigation\".\nHowever, the firm said Surrey Police had stated it was not advancing any further investigations before the commencement of the Northern Ireland Legacy Act on 1 May. The act allows those involved with The Troubles to seek immunity from prosecution.\nFour soldiers and a civilian died in the blast in Guildford's Horse and Groom pub in October 1974.\nAnother bomb detonated 30 minutes later at the Seven Stars.\nThe Guildford Four and Maguire Seven were wrongly-convicted for the attacks in one of the UK's biggest miscarriages of justice. \nAn IRA terror cell later claimed responsibility.\nThose who died were 21-year-old civilian Paul Craig and soldiers Ann Hamilton, 19, Caroline Slater, 18, William Forsyth, 18, and John Hunter, 17. Sixty-five people were injured.\nCassandra Hamilton, Ann's sister, told the BBC: \"[The police] said that there was a new piece of evidence that needed to be analysed forensically.\"\nBut she said police didn't think they could get the evidence analysed before 1 May.\nShe said police wrote to the Home Secretary in October but did not get a response until January.\nShe said: \"If they had this evidence in October, then October to May is seven months. If they sent the letter in October, then obviously they had the evidence before that.\"\nMs Hamilton added that the family did not know what the evidence was - whether it was a fingerprint, or DNA, or anything else.\n\"We need answers for my sister,\" she said.\nKRW solicitor Barry O'Donnell said: \"The timing by Surrey Police in this matter raises too many questions.\"\nHe said there were questions over the nature of this \"new\" lead, over how long this new evidence has been available to Surrey Police and when decisions were taken not to investigate this \"new\" forensic evidence, and whether Surrey Police should and could continue its investigation.\nAccording to KRW, police told the family the new lead was something the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) could possibly advance after 1 May.\nSurrey Police Deputy Chief Constable Nev Kemp said: \"Since 2019, when it was announced inquests would be resumed, we have supported a lengthy disclosure process and conducted a thorough and detailed assessment of all the materials held.\n\"During this assessment, a potential forensic line of enquiry was identified and in November 2022, following consultation with Counter Terrorism Policing, it was agreed this line of enquiry should be progressed.

    "The extraordinary rise in demand for autism assessments and ADHD treatments in England has overtaken the NHS's capacity to meet it, a think tank says.\nSince 2019, there has been a five-fold rise in people waiting to see an autism specialist and a 51% increase in prescriptions for ADHD medication, according to the Nuffield Trust.\nGrowing backlogs and longer waiting times are negatively impacting people's daily lives, it warned. \nIt said a \"radical rethink\" was needed.\nNuffield Trust chief executive Thea Stein said \"pumping more money\" into the current system would not help, and it was \"frankly impossible to imagine how the system can grow fast enough to fulfil this demand\".\n\"We're at a really critical point as a society, where we're actually understanding neurodiversity and the fact that it's a much greater spectrum for the whole of society than we've ever had before,\" she told BBC News. \n\"It's a really complicated issue for us to all collectively understand as a society.\"\nOne out of every 100 people is on the autistic spectrum, it is estimated, while 2.6 million people in the UK have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) .\nThe Nuffield Trust said 24% of patients referred for ADHD in England were having to wait one to two years for an assessment. \nOn top of this, thousands of people with ADHD have been unable to get prescribed medication amid a major supply shortage. This was announced in September due to \"manufacturing issues and an increased global demand\". \nMeanwhile,172,000 adults and children are on a waiting list for an autism assessment - the highest recorded figure - according to NHS data analysed by the think tank. \nBetween October and December 2023, the median time spent on a waiting list after an autism referral rose to over nine months, compared with four months in the same period in 2019.\nAnd in Derbyshire, the waiting time was two and half years, according to the report.\nEllie Middleton, a creator, writer and consultant with autism and ADHD, said receiving her late diagnoses has \"honestly been life-saving for me\".  \nShe was diagnosed with ADHD privately. The waiting list for an initial NHS appointment was \"incredibly long\" in her local area, she said, and she was \"really struggling with not knowing what was going on\". She received an autism diagnosis through the NHS about six months later.\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: \"Before I knew what was going on I always felt like any challenges that I faced and any things that were more difficult for me were a personal problem.\n\"Getting that answer to what is actually going on for you is just so validating.\"\nThe way NHS Digital collects data has changed since 2019 - but Ms Stein is confident it remains robust.\nThe rise in demand was probably due to greater awareness of the conditions and changing social attitudes, the Nuffield Trust said.\nADHD was the second most viewed health condition on the NHS website in 2023, after Covid-19, according to NHS England. \nMs Stein warned long waits would have a \"serious effect\" on children in particular, as many schools provided extra support only after a diagnosis.\n\"We've certainly got to have a different approach within educational services that says you don't need that letter in your hand,\" she said.\nPeople should not have to have a diagnosis just \"to get a label out of it\".\nAnd wider societal change was needed \"to allow ourselves to include more people who present with more neurodiversity\".\n\"We are going to need to think in a much more creative way than simply have a conversation that says we need more NHS resources, as that isn't the solution,\" Ms Stein added.\nSir Simon Wessely, Regius Professor of Psychiatry at King's College London, said the change in demand for ADHD diagnosis and treatment was \"dramatic\" but there was no evidence to suggest the disorder was getting more common.\nHe told the Today programme that GPs are seeing some patients who are looking for \"validation\" and \"recognition\" and \"not always wanting treatment\". \n\"They don't necessarily think they are ill, they think they are different\".\nThere \"probably isn't a medical answer to that\", he said, adding it was a wider issue for society. \nThe charity Child Autism said the spike since 2019 may be party due to the suspension of some services during the pandemic, causing a backlog.\nIts chief executive, Suzy Yardley, agreed a new \"coherent UK-wide plan\" was needed.\n\"Autistic children have huge amounts to contribute, and we need an overhaul of the system to ensure this can happen\", she said.\nDr James Cusack, chief executive of the charity Autistica, said: \"It has been evident for some time that services need to adapt to the knowledge that there are more neurodivergent people than we used to think.\"\nAnd there was a \"need to focus on each person's strengths and needs so that they get the support they need earlier\".\nA Department of Health official said: \"We know it's vital to have a timely diagnosis of autism or ADHD and we are taking action",
    "A man has been found guilty of murdering a police officer by planning the armed robbery in which she was shot dead almost 20 years ago.\nPiran Ditta Khan, 75, spent nearly two decades evading justice for his part in the killing of PC Sharon Beshenivsky in Bradford on 18 November 2005.\nKhan, who was extradited from Pakistan last year, was the last of seven men involved in the robbery to face trial. \nHe had previously admitted robbery but denied the officer's murder.\nAt Leeds Crown Court on Thursday, Khan was also found guilty of two counts of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life and two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon. \nPC Beshenivsky, 38, was gunned down on her youngest daughter's fourth birthday as she arrived at the scene of the robbery at a travel agents in the city centre. \nAs she approached the entrance to the travel agents along with her colleague PC Teresa Milburn, three men burst out of the business shooting both officers. \nShot at close range and left lying on the pavement, PC Beshenivsky's injuries were instantly fatal, while PC Milburn was seriously injured.  \nThe gunman was one of three armed men who had just carried out the robbery and fled with around \u00a35,400 in cash. \nSix people were subsequently arrested and convicted of charges including murder and manslaughter, with Khan being the seventh and final to face trial.\nJurors at Leeds Crown Court were told Khan was the mastermind behind the robbery and played a \"pivotal role in planning the raid and giving instructions to the others\".\nKhan told the court he was waiting in a car and \"eating sandwiches\" with Hassan Razzaq while the raid was being carried out.\nRazzaq and his brother Faisal Razzaq were later found guilty of manslaughter, robbery and firearms offences. Raza Ul-Haq Aslam was convicted of robbery. \nMuzzaker Shah and brothers Yusuf Jama and Mustaf Jama - the three armed men who went into Universal Express - were convicted of murder, robbery and firearms offences.\nLeeds Crown Court heard how Khan had spent almost two decades evading justice having escaped to Pakistan shortly after PC Beshenivsky's death.\nHe remained there before being arrested by Pakistani authorities in 2020 and was extradited to the UK to face justice last year. \nIt's horrible sitting in court watching the last moments of someone's life on CCTV. \nWe all know what's about to happen, but Sharon Beshenivsky and Teresa Milburn had no idea. \nTheir marked police patrol car can be seen pulling into Morley Street in Bradford one Friday afternoon 18 years ago. \nThey were both due off shift in less than half an hour. It was PC Beshenivsky's daughter's fourth birthday. An attack alarm had been activated at a travel agent. They get out of their car and stroll purposefully across the road towards the front door of the building. A second or so later a horrific scene plays out. \nPC Beshenivsky is left dying on the pavement and PC Milburn is shot in the chest by three men who burst out of the door firing a pistol. \nThe CCTV shows the gunmen sprinting to their getaway car. For Sharon Beshenivsky's family, the clocks stop.\nThe man who planned the raid is coolly driving around nearby in the passenger seat of a Mercedes SLK. Moments before the robbery he and an accomplice gave the nod that the coast was clear. And then drove away. \nWhat must Piran Ditta Khan have thought when he heard others in the gang had shot two police officers? \nHe thought enough to go to ground and flee to Pakistan.\nIt took many years to get him back but now he has finally been convicted of killing Sharon Beshenivsky. \nThe 75-year-old is likely to die in prison. He can expect a very long sentence for killing a police officer.\nSpeaking outside Leeds Crown Court following Thursday's guilty verdicts, Det Supt Marc Bowes, from West Yorkshire Police, said the force had remained \"doggedly determined\" to bring all of those responsible to justice. \n\"Sharon and Teresa went to work that day fully expecting to come home to their families and friends. But due to the horrific actions of those who have now been convicted for those offences, that wasn't the case,\" he said.\nDet Supt Bowes added that he wanted to acknowledge the \"respect and dignity\" shown by PC Beshenivsky's family over the past 18 years.\n\"I do hope that today's convictions go some way in enabling them to move on with their lives,\" he said.\n\"PC Sharon Beshenivsky lost her life in the most horrific of circumstances in the line of duty. She will always be remembered.\"\nDavid Holderness, specialist prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service Yorkshire and Humberside, said: \"Piran Ditta Khan was the architect of the operation and meticulously planned the robbery that was to be carried out using firearms which, if they thought necessary, could be used to kill. \n\"Despite not firing the fatal shot, he is as guilty of Sharon's murder as the man who pulled the trigger.\"\nMr Holderness went on to thank West Yorkshire Police, the National Crime Agency",

    "A company says it has reached a \"major milestone\" in its quest to design a power plant capable of producing energy from nuclear fusion.\nFirst Light Fusion, in Yarnton, Oxfordshire, has increased the distance a projectile is fired into the fuel by more than ten times.\nThe company says the development is crucial to its design for a commercial power plant.\nMila Fitzgerald, a scientist at the company, called it an \"exciting step\".\nNuclear fusion works by heating and forcing tiny particles together to make a heavier one which releases useful energy.\nFirst Light is pursuing a new form of fusion by compressing a target containing fusion fuel, using a projectile travelling at high speed.\nThe challenge is to be able to launch a projectile accurately, while keeping it in a solid state when it hits the fusion fuel - which is a crucial part of Fusion Light's power plant design.\nAs part of its experimental programme, this month First Light successfully increased the 'standoff' distance, from which the projectile is fired, from 10mm to 10cm.\nDr Nick Hawker, Founder & CEO of First Light Fusion, said: \"As we move into the era of commercialisation of fusion energy, solving the key engineering challenges in a power plant is a core focus for the First Light team.\"\n\"To reach commercial, cost-effective, and scalable fusion energy as part of our future energy mix, we need to solve the power plant fundamentals, and in a way that works with the physics.\"\nMs Fitzgerald, who led the 'standoff' project, said: \"This is a milestone moment for First Light and the result of a huge amount of effort, time, and perseverance from the whole team.\"\nFirst Light has plans for a new, larger base in Culham - which had previously been home to the Joint European Torus (JET) facility, before experiments ended there in December.\nThe facility, which was run by the UK Atomic Energy Agency, produced a record amount of energy for a fusion reactor in its final test.\nThe UK government is hoping to build the world's first fusion power plant in Nottinghamshire, with operations beginning in the 2040s.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

    "Europe and the US need each other and are \"stronger together\", the secretary-general of Nato has said. \nJens Stoltenberg was speaking at a ceremony marking the alliance's 75th anniversary.\nWhile the US provided Europe with security, he said it also needed the militaries, intelligence and diplomatic leverage of its European allies.\n\"I don't believe in America alone just as I don't believe in Europe alone,\" Mr Stoltenberg said.\n\"I believe in America and Europe together in Nato, because we are stronger and safer together.\"\nThe Nato chief's remarks came as the alliance considered a \u20ac100bn (\u00a386bn) five-year fund to provide long-term military support for Ukraine, so aid to Kyiv is not jeopardised by political changes either in the US or other Nato states.\nA US package worth $60bn (\u00a347bn) has been stalled in Congress for months because of resistance from Republican lawmakers, as well as Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has spoken of ending the war \"in one day\".\nDuring his speech, Mr Stoltenberg said Nato must be \"doing something right\", as it had grown from 12 countries at its inception to 32. Its newest members Sweden and Finland abandoned their neutrality and joined the alliance as a result of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in response to the speech that relations between Russia and Nato had \"slid to the level of direct confrontation\" as the alliance was already \"involved\" in the conflict around Ukraine. \nAlthough Nato is a defensive alliance Mr Peskov alleged it \"was conceived, configured, created and controlled by the US as a tool of confrontation\" and was now a \"destabilising element\".\nThe 32-member alliance has agreed to initiate planning for long-term military support for Ukraine. \nSeveral countries have only backed the initiative in theory. Hungary, which has kept close ties with Russia, has warned it will not back \"any Nato proposals proposals that might draw the alliance closer to war or shift it from a defensive to an offensive coalition\". \nThe Hungarian government has long sought to distance itself from international initiatives to fund Ukraine's fight against Russia, and for a period blocked a EU plan to provide a \u20ac50bn (\u00a343bn) aid package for Ukraine.\nMr Stoltenberg acknowledged the framework of support was yet to be decided, but said Nato foreign ministers had agreed on the principle: \"Make no mistake, Ukraine can rely on Nato support now and for the long haul.\"\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters support for Ukraine within the alliance is \"rock solid\" and that he believes Ukraine will eventually become a member of Nato, Reuters reported.\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told reporters at Nato headquarters that while he did not want to \"spoil [Nato]'s birthday party\", his country needed help in improving its air defences - specifically Patriot missiles.\n\"Saving Ukrainian lives, saving the Ukrainian economy and saving Ukrainian cities depends on the availability of Patriots and other air defence systems,\" Mr Kuleba said. \nLacking air superiority and faced with formidable Russian defences, Ukraine's counter-offensive ground to a halt last year and is now at risk of being outgunned on the front line in the east. \nThe US has given Ukraine more financial aid than any other Nato state- more than $44bn (\u00a334bn) since the 2022 invasion, according to the White House in December. However, its aid has now become caught up in a political row months before the presidential election.\nRepublican candidate Donald Trump has often criticised the level of spending. He has also long complained that the US has shouldered a greater financial burden than the rest of the alliance. \nFewer than two-thirds of Nato members are on course to reach their 2% funding goal.\nHighlighting the importance of Nato's European allies to the US, Mr Stoltenberg noted it was America's allies that came to its help after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. That was the only occasion that a key principle of the alliance has been invoked, in which an attack on one ally is seen as an attack on all.\nNato allies closest to Russia have stepped up efforts to boost their armed forces. \nNorway is increasing its number of conscripted soldiers, while Denmark says it intends to extend conscription to women and increase the duration of service. Latvia and Sweden recently restarted military service, while Lithuania brought it back after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.\nNorway is increasing the number of conscripted soldiers, while Denmark says it intends to extend conscription to women and increase the duration of service.

    "Jacob Flickinger was a \"loyal and devoted\" aid worker and family man who was \"chased down\" and killed by Israel while trying to help those in need, his parents have told the BBC.  \nMr Flickinger, 33, a US-Canadian, was one of seven people killed in a strike on a World Central Kitchen convoy.\nIsrael's military apologised and called the attack a tragic mistake. It has promised a full investigation. \nHis parents however said that his death was a \"crime\" and rejected the apology.\nJohn Flickinger and Sylvia Labrecque said there was a \"hole in their hearts\", and that Jacob's wife Sandy and 18-month old son Jasper were bereft without a husband and father.\nSpeaking from Quebec, they said he and the other workers were killed while travelling on a road designated by Israel as a safe humanitarian route. \nMr Flickinger said the charity had reported 24 hours in advance that their convoy would be dropping food at a warehouse, and stayed in touch with the Israel Defense Forces throughout the process, \nBut still Israel attacked and \"they continued firing until all the workers were dead,\" he said. \"Israel owes the families and the world an explanation.\"\nHis mother, Ms Labrecque, said that Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's description of the attack as a \"tragic accident\" was - in her view - \"a joke\".\n\"He was such a good human being,\" she said of her son. \"He was extremely devoted to his work and his family.\"\nJacob, who had previously served 11 years in the armed forces, went to Gaza in March out of a desire to help others, his family said.\n\"His life has been about service,\" said Mr Flickinger, adding that even despite this, he was worried about his son travelling through a war zone as dangerous as Gaza. \n\"But [Jacob] felt the World Central Kitchen knew what they were doing there,\" he said, and his son \"knew that people were starving out there\".\nHis parents called on the US to stop sending military aid to Israel while the country was using \"food as a weapon\" - a reference to the lack of aid getting into Gaza. \n\"The US has great leverage over Israel,\" Mr Flickinger said. \nJacob's parents also called for a ceasefire, a return of all Israeli hostages held by Hamas and for more aid to war-torn Gaza. \nMr Flickinger also said he wanted the US government to launch an independent investigation into the killings of humanitarian workers, as well as for Israel to pay reparations to relatives who have lost loved ones in Gaza.\n\"Justice can start there, but most critically, end this insanity,\" he said.\n\"I grew up without having a father,\" Mr Flickinger said. \"Now my grandson will grow up without having his father.\"\nMs Labrecque said she hoped their grandson, Jasper, would serve as a reminder of their son's life and goodness. \n\"It's going to be a day-to-day job, to heal from that loss,\" she said. \"But Jasper will be a very good inspiration for us to stay strong.\"\nMr Flickinger said that he had spoken to the Canadian government, but had not heard from the White House. He said he was told about his son's death from the US embassy in Israel.\n\"I would like to hear from someone in the US government,\" he said, adding that the Canadian government had been \"very helpful\".\nWCK - founded by the famous Spanish-American chef Jose Andr\u00e9s - was one of the main suppliers of desperately needed aid to Gaza, where more than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed since the 7 October Hamas attacks.\nAround 200 humanitarian workers in total have been killed in the conflict, according to aid groups.\nAbout 1,200 Israelis were killed and 253 hostages were taken by Hamas in its 7 October attack on Israel.",
    "A man has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for helping an Islamist attacker who killed five people at a French Christmas market in December 2018.\nAudrey Mondjehi, 42, was convicted of obtaining a gun used by Cherif Chekatt, who shot and stabbed his victims in Strasbourg, north-eastern France.\nThe pair were former prison cell mates, the trial was told.\nTwo other men were handed shorter sentences for assisting Chekatt. A fourth man was acquitted.\nFive people were killed when Chekatt opened fire on the crowd at the festive market. He was shot dead by police two days later.\nOn 29 February, Mondjehi and others accused of helping him in the days before the attack went on trial at the Court of Assizes in Paris.\nArnaud Friedrich, a lawyer representing some of the victims' families, told AFP news agency it was a \"key moment\" for his clients.\nMondjehi was not convicted of a terrorism offence as the court said he did not know what Chekatt planned to use the weapon for.\nAccording to AFP, Mondjehi told his trial: \"I think deeply and feel a lot of sadness for all the victims. All my life I will regret what happened.\n\"I would never have thought that he would have done that, I never thought that he was radicalised.\"\nAt about 8pm on 11 December 2018, Chekatt - who had a string of criminal convictions and was on a watchlist of people who represent a potential threat to national security - entered the historic centre of Strasbourg armed with a revolver and a knife.\nHe opened fire, shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" (\"God is greatest\") as he did so, before killing five people at random and injuring a further 11.\nHe managed to escape the area by jumping into a taxi, before being found by police after a 48-hour manhunt.\nIslamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for the attack, and a video pledging allegiance to the group was found at Chekatt's home.

    "Drivers are facing four years of disruption after restrictions were brought in across the Tyne Bridge, as part of major repair work.\nCapacity has been reduced to one lane in both directions across the bridge, which connects Gateshead and Newcastle.\nRestrictions are set to last for at least two years, before work continues for a further 24 months until 2028.\nNewcastle City Council said it was \"delighted\" work was starting, but businesses have spoken of concerns.\nHeavy congestion is expected on other routes across the Tyne, with people advised to use public transport.\nThe four-year programme to preserve the Grade II*-listed structure is expected to be complete by summer 2028, ahead of the bridge's centenary in October that year.\nDaniel Wilkinson, managing director of Albany Contract Furniture, in Gateshead, said the work \"clearly needs to be done\" but that he was worried about the timescale.\n\"It is inevitably going to have an impact upon our business in terms of attracting customers to our premises and getting deliveries in and out,\" Mr Wilkinson told BBC Radio Newcastle.\n\"Our staff come both south and the north of the river, so their journey times to commute into work are going to be impacted, which inevitably is going to add to the disruption that we are experiencing.\"\nHowever, the project's construction manager, Stephen McClain, said the work was \"not just a lick of paint\".\n\"This is a major repair to futureproof it for the next 120 years,\" he explained.\n\"It is an icon of the North East and it's an icon from an engineering perspective.

    "The initial cost of a united Ireland would be at least \u20ac8bn (\u00a36.86bn) a year rising to potentially \u20ac20bn (\u00a317.15bn) a year, a new study has estimated.\nPublished by the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA) it focuses on subvention.\nThat is the shortfall between what is raised in taxes in Northern Ireland and the amount spent on public services.\nA Sinn F\u00e9in TD (MP) has described the \u20ac20bn figure as a \"worst-case scenario\".\nHowever, one author of the study said absorbing NI could put \"huge financial pressure\" on people in the Irish Republic.\nProf John Fitzgerald said that would result in \"an immediate, major reduction in their living standards\".\nAlong with his co-author, Prof Edgar Morgenroth, he argued that the cost of unification could be substantially reduced if Northern Ireland made major changes in its economy in order to raise its productivity.\nProf Morgenroth said some of the costs would also eventually be offset by the benefits of integration into the wider EU economy but this would take \"some considerable time\".\n\"People bought into the idea of Brexit without knowing what the exact implications were going to be...without knowing exactly what a united Ireland would look like its very difficult to do very precise calculations.\n\"I think we need to do some planning to understand what the implications might be.\"\nAsked if Ireland could afford the extra cost, Prof Morgenroth said this was a \"political question\" which people on both sides of the border must answer. \n\"I previously worked on German unification and there the costs are still mounting, and this is decades later, we are now into the trillions of euros,\" he said.\n\"But when you ask people, three-quarters say they are happy with German unification, so they are willing to pay this.\n\"That is the more important question.\"\nDonegal Sinn F\u00e9in TD P\u00e1draig Mac Lochlainn told Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 he disputed the report's methodology, and said the actual cost would be less as it assumes there would be no economic growth in Northern Ireland.\nSpeaking to RT\u00c9's Today with Claire Byrne programme, Mr Mac Lochlainn argued there was \"a real opportunity for economic growth\" due to Northern Ireland's open border with the Republic and dual-market access.\nHe added there has been a substantial growth in the all-Island economy since Brexit.\nThe Dublin-based pro-EU think tank's study looks at how the subventions would be affected under different scenarios.\nThe authors look at the subvention for 2019 as the more recent data, for 2020 and 2021, is distorted by pandemic-related spending in Northern Ireland.\nThey adjust the 2019 figures to reflect some of the differences a united Ireland would make, for example less spending on defence, more on contributions to the EU and increased corporation tax revenues.\nThat produces a subvention estimate of just under \u20ac11bn (\u00a39.4bn) meaning the Irish state would need to find that money to provide public services to the state's new population in what had been Northern Ireland.\nThe authors estimate that if social security benefits and public sector wages in Northern Ireland were immediately raised to match levels in Ireland the subvention would jump to more than \u20ac20bn, equivalent to 10% of national income.\nThe authors said this is \"a huge sum\" as total government expenditure in Ireland currently amounts to about 40% of national income.\n\"To deal with the resulting deficit, which under the most favourable circumstances would persist for many years after unification, there would have to be a dramatic increase in taxation and/or a major reduction in expenditure,\" they add.\nThe authors consider two additional scenarios which assume that the UK would either write off Northern Ireland's share of the UK's national debt or continue to pay UK state pensions to people who had made national insurance contributions.\nIn those scenarios, the initial cost falls to between \u20ac8bn-9bn per year, although those estimates do not include the uprating of benefits and pay.\nNone of the estimates consider the potential savings from reducing public sector employment in NI or the longer term impacts if Northern Ireland's economic performance was to converge on Ireland's.\nA 2021 paper by the political scientist Prof John Doyle suggested that the subvention is much smaller and would represent a deficit of less than \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.57bn) for a unified state.\nHe said that was \"within a range that a future state could cope with on a transitional basis\".\nOne of his major assumptions was that it would be \"impossible that the level of subvention impacting a united Ireland would include both pensions and debt\".\nHe has recently added to that analysis, emphasising the potentially positive longer run economic impacts of unification.\nHe concluded: \"It is hard to think of compelling arguments as to why the same policy mix in the two parts of the island, post-unity, would see Northern Ireland's economy continue to perform poorly by comparison with the south.\"",

    "The extraordinary rise in demand for autism assessments and ADHD treatments in England has overtaken the NHS's capacity to meet it, a think tank says.\nSince 2019, there has been a five-fold rise in people waiting to see an autism specialist and a 51% increase in prescriptions for ADHD medication, according to the Nuffield Trust.\nGrowing backlogs and longer waiting times are negatively impacting people's daily lives, it warned. \nIt said a \"radical rethink\" was needed.\nNuffield Trust chief executive Thea Stein said \"pumping more money\" into the current system would not help, and it was \"frankly impossible to imagine how the system can grow fast enough to fulfil this demand\".\n\"We're at a really critical point as a society, where we're actually understanding neurodiversity and the fact that it's a much greater spectrum for the whole of society than we've ever had before,\" she told BBC News. \n\"It's a really complicated issue for us to all collectively understand as a society.\"\nOne out of every 100 people is on the autistic spectrum, it is estimated, while 2.6 million people in the UK have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) .\nThe Nuffield Trust said 24% of patients referred for ADHD in England were having to wait one to two years for an assessment. \nOn top of this, thousands of people with ADHD have been unable to get prescribed medication amid a major supply shortage. This was announced in September due to \"manufacturing issues and an increased global demand\". \nMeanwhile,172,000 adults and children are on a waiting list for an autism assessment - the highest recorded figure - according to NHS data analysed by the think tank. \nBetween October and December 2023, the median time spent on a waiting list after an autism referral rose to over nine months, compared with four months in the same period in 2019.\nAnd in Derbyshire, the waiting time was two and half years, according to the report.\nEllie Middleton, a creator, writer and consultant with autism and ADHD, said receiving her late diagnoses has \"honestly been life-saving for me\".  \nShe was diagnosed with ADHD privately. The waiting list for an initial NHS appointment was \"incredibly long\" in her local area, she said, and she was \"really struggling with not knowing what was going on\". She received an autism diagnosis through the NHS about six months later.\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: \"Before I knew what was going on I always felt like any challenges that I faced and any things that were more difficult for me were a personal problem.\n\"Getting that answer to what is actually going on for you is just so validating.\"\nThe way NHS Digital collects data has changed since 2019 - but Ms Stein is confident it remains robust.\nThe rise in demand was probably due to greater awareness of the conditions and changing social attitudes, the Nuffield Trust said.\nADHD was the second most viewed health condition on the NHS website in 2023, after Covid-19, according to NHS England. \nMs Stein warned long waits would have a \"serious effect\" on children in particular, as many schools provided extra support only after a diagnosis.\n\"We've certainly got to have a different approach within educational services that says you don't need that letter in your hand,\" she said.\nPeople should not have to have a diagnosis just \"to get a label out of it\".\nAnd wider societal change was needed \"to allow ourselves to include more people who present with more neurodiversity\".\n\"We are going to need to think in a much more creative way than simply have a conversation that says we need more NHS resources, as that isn't the solution,\" Ms Stein added.\nSir Simon Wessely, Regius Professor of Psychiatry at King's College London, said the change in demand for ADHD diagnosis and treatment was \"dramatic\" but there was no evidence to suggest the disorder was getting more common.\nHe told the Today programme that GPs are seeing some patients who are looking for \"validation\" and \"recognition\" and \"not always wanting treatment\". \n\"They don't necessarily think they are ill, they think they are different\".\nThere \"probably isn't a medical answer to that\", he said, adding it was a wider issue for society. \nThe charity Child Autism said the spike since 2019 may be party due to the suspension of some services during the pandemic, causing a backlog.\nIts chief executive, Suzy Yardley, agreed a new \"coherent UK-wide plan\" was needed.\n\"Autistic children have huge amounts to contribute, and we need an overhaul of the system to ensure this can happen\", she said.\nDr James Cusack, chief executive of the charity Autistica, said: \"It has been evident for some time that services need to adapt to the knowledge that there are more neurodivergent people than we used to think.\"\nAnd there was a \"need to focus on each person's strengths and needs so that they get the support they need earlier\".\nA Department of Health official said: \"We know it's vital to have a timely diagnosis of autism or ADHD and we are taking action",

disputed the report's methodology, and said the actual cost would be less as it assumes there would be no economic growth in Northern Ireland.\nSpeaking to RT\u00c9's Today with Claire Byrne programme, Mr Mac Lochlainn argued there was \"a real opportunity for economic growth\" due to Northern Ireland's open border with the Republic and dual-market access.\nHe added there has been a substantial growth in the all-Island economy since Brexit.\nThe Dublin-based pro-EU think tank's study looks at how the subventions would be affected under different scenarios.\nThe authors look at the subvention for 2019 as the more recent data, for 2020 and 2021, is distorted by pandemic-related spending in Northern Ireland.\nThey adjust the 2019 figures to reflect some of the differences a united Ireland would make, for example less spending on defence, more on contributions to the EU and increased corporation tax revenues.\nThat produces a subvention estimate of just under \u20ac11bn (\u00a39.4bn) meaning the Irish state would need to find that money to provide public services to the state's new population in what had been Northern Ireland.\nThe authors estimate that if social security benefits and public sector wages in Northern Ireland were immediately raised to match levels in Ireland the subvention would jump to more than \u20ac20bn, equivalent to 10% of national income.\nThe authors said this is \"a huge sum\" as total government expenditure in Ireland currently amounts to about 40% of national income.\n\"To deal with the resulting deficit, which under the most favourable circumstances would persist for many years after unification, there would have to be a dramatic increase in taxation and/or a major reduction in expenditure,\" they add.\nThe authors consider two additional scenarios which assume that the UK would either write off Northern Ireland's share of the UK's national debt or continue to pay UK state pensions to people who had made national insurance contributions.\nIn those scenarios, the initial cost falls to between \u20ac8bn-9bn per year, although those estimates do not include the uprating of benefits and pay.\nNone of the estimates consider the potential savings from reducing public sector employment in NI or the longer term impacts if Northern Ireland's economic performance was to converge on Ireland's.\nA 2021 paper by the political scientist Prof John Doyle suggested that the subvention is much smaller and would represent a deficit of less than \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.57bn) for a unified state.\nHe said that was \"within a range that a future state could cope with on a transitional basis\".\nOne of his major assumptions was that it would be \"impossible that the level of subvention impacting a united Ireland would include both pensions and debt\".\nHe has recently added to that analysis, emphasising the potentially positive longer run economic impacts of unification.\nHe concluded: \"It is hard to think of compelling arguments as to why the same policy mix in the two parts of the island, post-unity, would see Northern Ireland's economy continue to perform poorly by comparison with the south.\"",
    "A man has been found guilty of murdering a police officer by planning the armed robbery in which she was shot dead almost 20 years ago.\nPiran Ditta Khan, 75, spent nearly two decades evading justice for his part in the killing of PC Sharon Beshenivsky in Bradford on 18 November 2005.\nKhan, who was extradited from Pakistan last year, was the last of seven men involved in the robbery to face trial. \nHe had previously admitted robbery but denied the officer's murder.\nAt Leeds Crown Court on Thursday, Khan was also found guilty of two counts of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life and two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon. \nPC Beshenivsky, 38, was gunned down on her youngest daughter's fourth birthday as she arrived at the scene of the robbery at a travel agents in the city centre. \nAs she approached the entrance to the travel agents along with her colleague PC Teresa Milburn, three men burst out of the business shooting both officers. \nShot at close range and left lying on the pavement, PC Beshenivsky's injuries were instantly fatal, while PC Milburn was seriously injured.  \nThe gunman was one of three armed men who had just carried out the robbery and fled with around \u00a35,400 in cash. \nSix people were subsequently arrested and convicted of charges including murder and manslaughter, with Khan being the seventh and final to face trial.\nJurors at Leeds Crown Court were told Khan was the mastermind behind the robbery and played a \"pivotal role in planning the raid and giving instructions to the others\".\nKhan told the court he was waiting in a car and \"eating sandwiches\" with Hassan Razzaq while the raid was being carried out.\nRazzaq and his brother Faisal Razzaq were later found guilty of manslaughter, robbery and firearms offences. Raza Ul-Haq Aslam was convicted of robbery. \nMuzzaker Shah and brothers Yusuf Jama and Mustaf Jama - the three armed men who went into Universal Express - were convicted of murder, robbery and firearms offences.\nLeeds Crown Court heard how Khan had spent almost two decades evading justice having escaped to Pakistan shortly after PC Beshenivsky's death.\nHe remained there before being arrested by Pakistani authorities in 2020 and was extradited to the UK to face justice last year. \nIt's horrible sitting in court watching the last moments of someone's life on CCTV. \nWe all know what's about to happen, but Sharon Beshenivsky and Teresa Milburn had no idea. \nTheir marked police patrol car can be seen pulling into Morley Street in Bradford one Friday afternoon 18 years ago. \nThey were both due off shift in less than half an hour. It was PC Beshenivsky's daughter's fourth birthday. An attack alarm had been activated at a travel agent. They get out of their car and stroll purposefully across the road towards the front door of the building. A second or so later a horrific scene plays out. \nPC Beshenivsky is left dying on the pavement and PC Milburn is shot in the chest by three men who burst out of the door firing a pistol. \nThe CCTV shows the gunmen sprinting to their getaway car. For Sharon Beshenivsky's family, the clocks stop.\nThe man who planned the raid is coolly driving around nearby in the passenger seat of a Mercedes SLK. Moments before the robbery he and an accomplice gave the nod that the coast was clear. And then drove away. \nWhat must Piran Ditta Khan have thought when he heard others in the gang had shot two police officers? \nHe thought enough to go to ground and flee to Pakistan.\nIt took many years to get him back but now he has finally been convicted of killing Sharon Beshenivsky. \nThe 75-year-old is likely to die in prison. He can expect a very long sentence for killing a police officer.\nSpeaking outside Leeds Crown Court following Thursday's guilty verdicts, Det Supt Marc Bowes, from West Yorkshire Police, said the force had remained \"doggedly determined\" to bring all of those responsible to justice. \n\"Sharon and Teresa went to work that day fully expecting to come home to their families and friends. But due to the horrific actions of those who have now been convicted for those offences, that wasn't the case,\" he said.\nDet Supt Bowes added that he wanted to acknowledge the \"respect and dignity\" shown by PC Beshenivsky's family over the past 18 years.\n\"I do hope that today's convictions go some way in enabling them to move on with their lives,\" he said.\n\"PC Sharon Beshenivsky lost her life in the most horrific of circumstances in the line of duty. She will always be remembered.\"\nDavid Holderness, specialist prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service Yorkshire and Humberside, said: \"Piran Ditta Khan was the architect of the operation and meticulously planned the robbery that was to be carried out using firearms which, if they thought necessary, could be used to kill. \n\"Despite not firing the fatal shot, he is as guilty of Sharon's murder as the man who pulled the trigger.\"\nMr Holderness went on to thank West Yorkshire Police, the National Crime Agency",

    "Many Palestinians in the Gaza Strip will be wondering how they are going to feed their families after World Central Kitchen (WCK) paused its operations in response to the killing of seven of its aid workers in an Israeli air strike. \nAnother US charity it works with, Anera, has also suspended work because of the escalating risks faced by its local staff and their families. \nTogether, they were serving two million meals a week across the Palestinian territory, where the UN has warned that an estimated 1.1 million people - half the population - are facing catastrophic hunger because of Israeli restrictions on aid deliveries, the ongoing hostilities and the breakdown of order.\nWCK's decision to pause its work also led to the \"freezing\" of a maritime aid corridor from Cyprus, which the charity helped set up last month to increase the trickle of aid getting into the north of Gaza and avert a looming famine.\nThe WCK convoy was hit on Monday night as it travelled south along the Israeli-designated coastal aid route, just after they had unloaded more than 100 tonnes of food from a barge at a warehouse in Deir al-Balah.\nThat barge was part of a four-vessel flotilla that sailed back to Cyprus with 240 tonnes of supplies that could not be brought ashore in the wake of the strike. \nThe Norwegian Refugee Council warned that \"what happened to World Central Kitchen threatens the entire aid system\" and had left it \"on the brink\".\nWCK accused the Israeli military of a \"targeted attack\" on vehicles clearly marked with the charity's logo and whose movements had been co-ordinated with Israeli authorities. The victims were British, Polish, Australian and Palestinian, and also included a dual US-Canadian citizen.\nThe military's chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, described the strike as a \"grave mistake\" that had followed \"misidentification at night\".\nHe also vowed to take \"immediate action\" to ensure that more was done to protect aid workers, including the immediate establishment of a new \"humanitarian command centre\" to improve co-ordination. \"Israel is at war with Hamas, not with the people of Gaza,\" he stressed.\nHowever, aid groups say they are not sure such promises will lead to meaningful changes. They also assert that this was not an isolated incident, with 196 Palestinian aid workers reportedly killed since the war began in October.\nJan Egeland, the secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council and a former UN humanitarian chief, told the BBC that WCK was \"among those who have the closest co-operation with the Israelis\", in terms of sharing information about their workers' locations and planned movements.\nBefore the strike, WCK was playing an increasingly prominent and important role in Gaza, with 400 Palestinian staff and 3,000 people working indirectly for it in its 68 community kitchens and distribution system. \nWCK has provided 12% of the 193,000 tonnes of aid from international organisations that had reached Gaza since October, according to data from Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body tasked with co-ordinating deliveries. However, UN agencies were responsible for 80% of the total. \nWCK's founder, the chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, told Reuters news agency on Wednesday that it was \"analysing the situation and how to keep doing the work we do\".\nAnera - which was providing 150,000 meals a day in collaboration with WCK - said it understood the consequences pausing its own work would have on Palestinians, but that its Palestinian staff had for the first time deemed the risk to their safety and that of their families \"intolerable\".\nIt said the charity's logistics co-ordinator and his son had been killed in an Israeli air strike in Deir al-Balah in March, despite the fact that the co-ordinates of the shelter where they were staying had been provided to the Israeli military.\n\"We've asked for explanation as to why that site was struck and we've received none,\" Derek Madsen of Anera told the BBC. \"These sites are known and so I think it is very difficult for us to understand how these strikes happen.\"\nProject Hope, another US-based organisation, paused its work for three days in solidarity with WCK and to \"reassess the security situation as we prioritise our staff members' safety\". \nArlan Fuller, director of emergency preparedness and response, said in a statement sent to the BBC that its employees were deeply concerned by the deaths of the WCK team, and that the strike has raised significant doubts about the effectiveness of co-ordination with the Israeli military.\nFor the people of Gaza, the suspension of WCK's operations \"means more famine, more dead children, more epidemic disease because people are so malnourished\", Mr Egeland warned. \nAt least 27 children are reported to have died as a result of malnutrition since October, according to the World Health Organization.\nMr Egeland urged Israel to start by opening the Karni and Erez border crossings with northern Gaza to allow aid convoys to drive there directly. \nMost aid co",
    "New evidence on the Guildford pub bombings has emerged 50 years after the IRA detonated two devices in the town.\nSurrey Police told a family of one of the five people killed in the attack that the next step \"would be a new criminal investigation\", lawyers said.\nBut officers will not launch an inquiry before a new law comes in that would help shield perpetrators, they added.\nPolice said they remained committed to facilitating justice for the families of those who were killed.\nKRW Law said a post-inquest assessment had, according to Surrey Police, \"identified a potential forensic line of enquiry and the next step would be a new criminal investigation\".\nHowever, the firm said Surrey Police had stated it was not advancing any further investigations before the commencement of the Northern Ireland Legacy Act on 1 May. The act allows those involved with The Troubles to seek immunity from prosecution.\nFour soldiers and a civilian died in the blast in Guildford's Horse and Groom pub in October 1974.\nAnother bomb detonated 30 minutes later at the Seven Stars.\nThe Guildford Four and Maguire Seven were wrongly-convicted for the attacks in one of the UK's biggest miscarriages of justice. \nAn IRA terror cell later claimed responsibility.\nThose who died were 21-year-old civilian Paul Craig and soldiers Ann Hamilton, 19, Caroline Slater, 18, William Forsyth, 18, and John Hunter, 17. Sixty-five people were injured.\nCassandra Hamilton, Ann's sister, told the BBC: \"[The police] said that there was a new piece of evidence that needed to be analysed forensically.\"\nBut she said police didn't think they could get the evidence analysed before 1 May.\nShe said police wrote to the Home Secretary in October but did not get a response until January.\nShe said: \"If they had this evidence in October, then October to May is seven months. If they sent the letter in October, then obviously they had the evidence before that.\"\nMs Hamilton added that the family did not know what the evidence was - whether it was a fingerprint, or DNA, or anything else.\n\"We need answers for my sister,\" she said.\nKRW solicitor Barry O'Donnell said: \"The timing by Surrey Police in this matter raises too many questions.\"\nHe said there were questions over the nature of this \"new\" lead, over how long this new evidence has been available to Surrey Police and when decisions were taken not to investigate this \"new\" forensic evidence, and whether Surrey Police should and could continue its investigation.\nAccording to KRW, police told the family the new lead was something the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) could possibly advance after 1 May.\nSurrey Police Deputy Chief Constable Nev Kemp said: \"Since 2019, when it was announced inquests would be resumed, we have supported a lengthy disclosure process and conducted a thorough and detailed assessment of all the materials held.\n\"During this assessment, a potential forensic line of enquiry was identified and in November 2022, following consultation with Counter Terrorism Policing, it was agreed this line of enquiry should be progressed. This work has been complex and has taken some time to complete.\n\"Throughout this period, we were aware of draft legislation which has now been enacted, which we knew would impact on our ability to launch a reinvestigation should we have reached that stage. \n\"However, it was right and proper, in the interests of justice, for us to continue with our assessment, and to submit items for forensic analysis.\"\nHe said: \"The timing of the return of the forensic results in August 2023 is unfortunate.\"\nHe said the enactment of the Legacy Act in 2023 meant there was now \"no prospect of reaching the stage of prosecution by the deadline of 1 May\".\nHe said the chief constable would notify the Northern Ireland Secretary of the findings and added the force was still in the process of informing families.\nMr Kemp said: \"Our priority now is to preserve the significant amount of work that has been done to date, and to ensure we do not jeopardise any course of action that could be available to the families.\"\nFollow BBC Surrey on\u00a0Facebook, and on \u00a0X.

    "Dougray Scott is to lead a parade celebrating Scottish culture through the streets of New York as part of city's Tartan Week celebrations. \nHe has been announced as this year's Grand Marshall of the 26th Tartan Day Parade.\nHe told BBC Scotland that it was an opportunity he couldn't pass up. \nThe Mission Impossible star, who is from Fife, said he couldn't turn down the opportunity to share his pride in his homeland. \nThe Emmy and Bafta-winning actor said he hoped that Americans with a connection to Scotland would turn out to watch Saturday's parade with its 1,500 participants - including bagpipers, Highland dancers, Scottish clan members and Celtic dog breeds. \nHe said he was delighted to be asked and that some \"terrific\" Scots had led the annual parade before him - including Sir Billy Connolly, KT Tunstall, Sean Connery, Karen Gillan and Sam Heughan. \nOn his own heritage, he told The Afternoon Show on BBC Radio Scotland: \"I think I've always strongly identified with being Scottish. \n\"I think we have a great country. We have a history of being welcoming and politically diverse, culturally diverse and we fight for the underdog. \n\"We have an innate approach to the world - politically, culturally - and we certainly I think are very egalitarian in our heart and soul.\n\"I\u2019m not saying that we are the greatest people on earth - we\u2019re not.\"\nScott - who is from Fife - said like anywhere else, Scotland had its \"pros and cons\". \n\"But it\u2019s my history,\" he said. \"It's where I was brought up and I have such familiarity with [it] and I do love being there. \n\"Every year I go and I stay in this place on the west coast of Scotland, and I walk and play golf and fish and recharge the batteries.\"\nHe said the location brought him \"a feeling of spiritual calmness\". \nGlasgow also has a special place in his heart, with Scott saying it was a city that he loved \"very much\". \nHe said: \"Both my parents are from there and I spent a lot of time in Glasgow growing up.\"\nHis love for his homeland has led him to develop works of Scottish fiction for the screen. \nHe recently won an International Emmy for his role in the adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel Crime. \nHe said he was really looking forward to representing Scotland in New York, and was planning to invite some friends to the parade.\nThe first parade took place as a way to recognise the contributions made by Scottish-Americans to the United States. \nA small group of people and two pipe bands marched from the British Consulate to the UN building.\nNow thousands of people will line the streets to watch the procession as it goes along Manhattan's Sixth Avenue to Central Park. \nThe parade is the centre piece of a weekend of Celtic celebrations in the city.\nScott's kilt will be in Morrison tartan, which he called \"beautiful\".  \n\"I can't wait to put it on,\" Scott said, adding: \"I don\u2019t get a chance to wear a kilt very often but I love them. \n\"I'm Scottish, we wear kilts, so why not?

    "Thieves stole tens of millions of dollars from a Los Angeles cash storage facility on Easter Sunday, with their crime only discovered the next day.\nThe theft of at least $30m (\u00a324m) is one of the biggest cash heists in LA history, local media reported.\nThere are few clues as to who carried out the crime - which was been described as \"elaborate\" - or exactly how.\nThe Los Angeles Police Department and FBI are jointly investigating the case. \nNo alarms were tripped and no one knew thieves had entered the facility, located in the San Fernando Valley, where cash from local businesses is processed and stored in a vault. \nA crew of sophisticated burglars is believed to have come in through the roof, according to local media. Only a small group of people were aware so much cash was held in the building.\nIt took until Monday, when facility employees opened the vault, to realise that the massive sum was missing. The safe did not show any outward sign of break-in.\nAccording to US media, the theft happened at a GardaWorld facility in the suburban neighbourhood of Sylmar. A news helicopter over the scene captured an apparent hole in the side of the building with debris nearby, however, it is unclear if it is related to the burglary. \nThe total surpasses any that has been taken in armoured vehicle robberies in the area, according to the Los Angeles Times.\nThe largest cash heist in LA's history was in September 1997 when $18.9m was stolen from Dunbar Armored Inc, according to the newspaper. Six men, including a former employee, were eventually arrested. \nIn 2022, an armoured truck was robbed around 55 miles (90km) north of where Sunday's heist occurred. The thieves grabbed dozens of bags containing vintage jewellery and gems while the guards were distracted. \nThe stolen items have been valued at over $100m. No arrests have been made.\nLast year, thieves at the Toronto airport stole more than $15m in gold and cash. An aircraft container carrying the goods arrived at the airport and was transported to a cargo holding facility, where police believe the heist took place.\nIt is one of the largest heists in Canada's history.",

For them, the battles that took place were where they live, it's important history for them. \n\"They are delighted that people are coming from all across the world to recreate and commemorate the lives of their ancestors, and to recognise what the locals did here, which was so vital to the support of the allies.\"\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and, X.

Since 2019, they have been joined by the national weather service of the Netherlands, which also chips in a few suggested names each year.\nIn previous years, storms have alternated between male and female names.\nHowever, for the 2023-24 season, the Met Office has altered this, naming a number of storms after prominent scientists, meteorologists and others \"who work to keep people safe in times of severe weather\".\nWhen the criteria for naming a storm are met, either the Met Office, Met \u00c9ireann or Dutch weather agency KNMI can name a storm, taking the name from the latest list in alphabetical order. \nJocelyn, the last storm to hit the UK, was named by Met \u00c9ireann after Prof Jocelyn Bell Burnell, an astrophysicist who discovered the first pulsating radio stars, or pulsars, in 1967. \nKathleen was also named by the Irish service because more significant impacts are likely to be felt in the Republic of Ireland.\nA total of seven names in the 2023-24 storm season were selected by KNMI - including Henk which was submitted by someone who visited an open day at the agency's headquarters in October 2022.\nBabet was named after a woman who put her own name forward, \"because I was born during a storm\". \nStorm Gerrit was named after a weather presenter who left the Dutch public news broadcaster NOS in 2023 after 25 years. \nStorm Ciar\u00e1n was named after Ciar\u00e1n Fearon, a civil servant who works in the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland. His job is to ensure key information is shared on river levels and coastal flooding. \nStorm Agnes, which was recognised as the first storm of the season, was named after Agnes Mary Clerke, an Irish astronomer and science writer.\nAround six to seven named storms impact the UK each year on average, which means names in the second half of the alphabet are put forward but are always unlikely to be used.\nAnd if your name is Quentin or Yasmine, don't expect to be immortalised as a force of nature. Names beginning with Q, U, X, Y and Z do not even make the shortlist.\nYou may hear some names over the coming months which are not on the British/Irish/Dutch list. \nThat is because storms are named where they originate. Storms that reach the UK are occasionally the tail end of one that started in the US several days earlier - and may have been downgraded from hurricane or cyclone status.\nThe weather agencies of the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands make up the western European storm naming group. \nPortugal, Spain, Luxembourg, France and Belgium, form the south western group that collaborate to name storms. \nNorway, Sweden and Denmark are the northern group.\nIn the US, the National Hurricane Centre names tropical storms when they have reached winds of least 40mph, using alphabetical lists that are maintained by the World Meteorological Organisation. These lists are used on a six-year cycle. ",
    "Drivers are facing four years of disruption after restrictions were brought in across the Tyne Bridge, as part of major repair work.\nCapacity has been reduced to one lane in both directions across the bridge, which connects Gateshead and Newcastle.\nRestrictions are set to last for at least two years, before work continues for a further 24 months until 2028.\nNewcastle City Council said it was \"delighted\" work was starting, but businesses have spoken of concerns.\nHeavy congestion is expected on other routes across the Tyne, with people advised to use public transport.\nThe four-year programme to preserve the Grade II*-listed structure is expected to be complete by summer 2028, ahead of the bridge's centenary in October that year.\nDaniel Wilkinson, managing director of Albany Contract Furniture, in Gateshead, said the work \"clearly needs to be done\" but that he was worried about the timescale.\n\"It is inevitably going to have an impact upon our business in terms of attracting customers to our premises and getting deliveries in and out,\" Mr Wilkinson told BBC Radio Newcastle.\n\"Our staff come both south and the north of the river, so their journey times to commute into work are going to be impacted, which inevitably is going to add to the disruption that we are experiencing.\"\nHowever, the project's construction manager, Stephen McClain, said the work was \"not just a lick of paint\".\n\"This is a major repair to futureproof it for the next 120 years,\" he explained.\n\"It is an icon of the North East and it's an icon from an engineering perspective. It's an absolute joy to be working on this scheme.\"\nThe work will see more than 900 steelwork repairs carried out, engineers said, with an expected cost in the region of \u00a332m.\nThe last work on the bridge took place more than 20 years ago.\nRestrictions will effectively halve the capacity of the bridge, which is used by up to 70,000 vehicles a day.\nPeople have been advised to avoid travel through the centres of Newcastle and Gateshead, stay on the major trunk roads and use other river crossings such as the A1, A19, Tyne Tunnel and Scotswood Bridge.\nAnneliese Hutchinson, the council's service director for climate change, compliance, planning and transport, said: \"We're asking for everyone in the North East to help us minimise the disruption that the restoration will cause to the transport network.\n\"Please follow our travel advice, make the switch to public transport or walking and cycling if you can, and together we can reduce the number of journeys on the bridge, and help keep the area moving.\"\nFor the latest traffic and travel news, listen to BBC Radio Newcastle on BBC Sounds.\nFollow BBC North East  on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

    "Organisers of the Newry arts festival have promised to take the arts to the people with events in unusual locations throughout the city. \nFrom comedy to classical music and history brought to life, audiences will have a wealth of choice.\nThere was even something for the youngest among us.\nOn Thursday morning, the Imaginarium community centre in the city was packed with infants shaking out their best moves alongside their parents.\nIt was a \"baby boogie\", soundtracked by dance classics and described as \"a highly imaginative sensory session\".\nGrainne Powell, who runs Sticky Fingers Arts at the centre, said the arts are \"essential in all aspects of society - especially for children and families\". \n\"It is so important that young people and children are given the opportunity to learn how to explore, investigate and play,\" she added. \n\"And if we give them more opportunities we can eliminate a lot of the other problems. \n\"So we need more play and more opportunities like this festival to create a sense of well being for the whole community.\" \nAmong those in attendance were Jennifer Largey and her son Fintan from Cullyhanna in County Armagh.\n\"We google searched things to do with kids and this was one of the first things that popped up,\" she said.\n\"There is a shortage of things to do for children, unless you really search and delve deep you aren't going to get many options.\n\"He's an only child so for his development I like to see him interacting with other kids. \n\"There is only so much you can get from a creche and it is so lovely seeing him interacting, playing and enjoying it.\"\nSharon Boyle and baby daughter \u00c9ada had travelled from Dundalk in County Louth for the event. \nSharon says more events like this for young children would be most welcome. \n\"It's only when you get talking to other mothers - they share information,\" she added.\n\"But it often isn't that easy to find out about events until you are in groups. \n\"I heard about this through a friend of my sister and we are so glad we came. \n\"It's really beautiful with the lights and colours - and she is just mesmerised by it all.\n\"The tunes were brilliant - proper 80s pop. \n\"That's what we do in the kitchen to occupy ourselves, get the radio on and dance away.\"\nA performance of the trial of John Mitchel in Newry Courthouse on Saturday will be among the festival's most striking sights.\nThis show will see the audience take on the role of jury, while the republican figurehead is defended by P\u00e1draig Pearse and Daniel O'Connell takes on the role of witness for the prosecution.\nEvents are taking place across Newry until 7 April in various venues, including the town hall and Newry and Mourne Museum.\nThere is also the opportunity learn new skills with workshops ranging from modern macrame to paint pouring. \nAccording to festival events officer Abby McSherry, the idea of the festival is to bring the arts to people who wouldn't necessarily go to a traditional venue.\n\"It gets the arts out to where people are,\" she said. \n\"We have arts in the theatre and galleries, but this gets out in to the coffee shops, pubs and onto the streets with theatre, art and workshops. \n\"So it's really getting the arts where people are and where they feel comfortable.\"",
    "Evacuation warnings issued by Israel to people in Gaza ahead of attacks have contained a host of significant errors, BBC analysis has revealed.\nWarnings contained contradictory information and sometimes misnamed districts. This made them confusing to Gazans seeking safety. \nExperts say such mistakes could violate Israel's international law obligations.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has rejected any assertion the warnings were confusing or contradictory.\nIn a statement, it said the alerts analysed by the BBC were only one element of its \"extensive efforts to encourage the evacuation [of] civilians out of harm's way\". \nInternational humanitarian law requires attacking forces to give effective advance warning of attacks which may affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit.\nIsrael says its warning system is designed to help civilians flee danger as it continues its war against Hamas. The system divides a map of Gaza into hundreds of numbered blocks.\nIsrael has produced an interactive online map of the blocks that geo-locates users, showing their live location and which block number they are in.\nThis IDF post from late January shows a social media post on X with a link through via QR code to the master block map.\nBut people we spoke to have described struggling to get online to access the system, as well as finding the block system difficult to understand, notwithstanding the errors.\nThe BBC analysed the IDF's Arabic language social media channels on Facebook, X and Telegram, where we found hundreds of posts containing warnings. The same warnings were often posted repeatedly. \nWe also searched for leafleted warnings which had been photographed and shared online. The IDF says it has dropped 16 million such leaflets over Gaza.\nWe have focused our analysis on warnings issued since 1 December, which is when the IDF launched its block system as a way of providing more precise instructions than previously, after coming under international pressure. \nWe grouped all of the IDF's posts and leaflets that we found after this date into 26 separate warnings. The vast majority made reference to the master block system.\nThe IDF told the BBC it also warned of impending attacks through pre-recorded phone messages and live phone calls. Due to damage to Gaza's phone network we have not been able to compile data on these phone calls. \nAnd our analysis of leaflets was limited to those we could find photographed and shared online.\nThe 26 separate warnings we found contained specific information from the IDF that people could use to escape areas of danger. But 17 of them also contained errors and inconsistencies.\nThese included:\nIn addition, one warning listed neighbourhoods as being in one district when they were actually in another. Another mixed up the block numbers of two neighbourhoods. And in a third, some blocks listed in the text were on the opposite side of Gaza to those highlighted on the accompanying map.\nWhen we put these errors to the IDF, it did not respond to the issues we raised with the maps specifically but said the text of posts had been sufficiently clear. It also said that when arrows were used to direct people to safety, \"it is obvious that the arrows point to a general direction\" and reiterated that the key information had been provided in the text.\nThese inaccuracies and errors may violate Israel's obligation under international law to provide \"effective advanced warnings\", says Janina Dill, co-director of the Oxford Institute of Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict.\nIf the majority of warnings contain errors or are unclear to the point that civilians can't understand them then, she says, \"these warnings do not fulfil the proper function they have under international humanitarian law\". \nThis, adds Kubo Macak professor of international law at the University of Exeter, undermines their function to give \"civilians the chance to protect themselves\".\nIn December, Saleh, a tech entrepreneur from Gaza City, was sheltering with his children and his in-laws in Nuseirat in central Gaza - where, he says, there was no electricity or phone signal and long periods of internet outage.\nHe saw people killed and others fleeing from a nearby school as it was being shelled, but says he had not received any IDF evacuation details.\nEventually, he found someone with a Sim card that allowed him to access data networks in Egypt and Israel and came across an evacuation warning on an Israeli government Facebook page.\n\"There was an evacuation order for several residential blocks - [but] we didn't know which block we lived in. This led to a big argument,\" Salah says.\nSalah could only access the internet intermittently, but he messaged his wife Amani, who has been in the UK since just before the war. She was able to go online and access the IDF's master block map and pinpoint where her husband was. But then, looking back at the specific evacuation warning on Facebook, the couple realised the numbered block where Salah wa",

These three countries have made up 98% of all cases and 87% of deaths from the virus.\nRegional health authorities have recorded more than 3.5 million cases and a thousand deaths.\nThe UN health agency has warned that global warming and El Nino are contributing to the worst season ever for the virus.",
    "Rescuers in Taiwan are working to reach more than 600 stranded people, a day after the island experienced its worst earthquake in 25 years.\nOne survivor has recounted how tremors unleashed rockslides \"like bullets\" around the coal mine he was working at.\nThe 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit near the eastern county of Hualien, killing nine and injuring more than 1,000.\nSome stuck in tunnels and near a national park have been rescued by helicopters, but 34 are still missing.\nThe official number of people trapped or stranded rose considerably - from about 100 to 660 - on Thursday as people started getting phone signal back in the mountainous regions. \nAlmost all are guests and staff of a remote hotel who cannot leave because of damaged roads. Officials are now trying to work out the best way to get them out. \nFood supplies have been air-dropped to dozens trapped in these areas, local reports say.\n\"The mountain started raining rocks like bullets, we had nowhere to escape to, everyone ran beside the sandbags for cover,\" the survivor, identified by his surname Chu, told Taiwan's Central News Agency.\nThree of the nine who died were hikers on a trail leading towards Taroko National Park, named after a landmark gorge, just outside Hualien.\nIn Hualien city, the capital of the county where the earthquake struck, relief efforts are proceeding quickly, with workers using excavators and other heavy equipment to demolish several damaged buildings.\nOn Thursday morning, the BBC also witnessed relief workers removing huge boulders - the size of cars - that had fallen close to railway lines so as to get normal train services running again.\nThey are also using large amounts of gravel and rocks to shore up a 10-storey structure known as the Uranus building, which has been leaning downwards since the quake struck - to prevent it from falling over in case of another aftershock. \nLocal reports said one female teacher had died in the building when she returned to rescue her cat.\nHsu Chiu-yueh, who was working opposite the Uranus building when it collapsed, told the BBC: \"It was so shaky I could barely walk. I was really scared. I felt my legs were not in control anymore. Thanks to my colleagues, they dragged me so we could get out.\"\n\"There was a lot of dust coming into our building on our way out... We [later] realised that it came from the building across the street that had partially collapsed,\" said the 50-year-old.\nAnother Hualien resident recounted how the quake threw her home into disarray.\n\"I was just getting out of bed when a clothes rack and a low cabinet fell over,\" Ocean Tsai told BBC Chinese. \n\"It kept getting stronger, and I started worrying about our belongings at home. Fortunately, apart from the motorcycle tipping over, the damage was minimal.\"\nThe earthquake, which struck 18km (11mi) south of Hualien, was followed by more than 200 aftershocks, dozens of which were at least 6.5 magnitude or more, hindering search and rescue efforts. Taiwanese authorities expect there to be more aftershocks in the next few days.\nPictures show how the road outside Hualien's Qingshui tunnel - one of many winding roads that run along Hualien's rocky coastline - had simply fallen away.\nRoutes like Qingshui are popular among tourists because of their spectacular views from the mountains out across the Pacific Ocean. But they are also known to be treacherous, not least because of the possibility of landslides.\nFurther north, the capital Taipei was also shaken violently with footage showing damaged buildings and people being evacuated. Local TV stations aired clips of smashed vehicles and stores in disarray. \n\"The earthquake is close to land and it's shallow. It's felt all over Taiwan and offshore islands... It's the strongest in 25 years,\" Wu Chien Fu, the director of Taipei's Seismology Centre said on Wednesday. \nPower cuts and internet outages were reported across the island. \nThe earthquake also triggered tsunami alerts earlier in the day on Wednesday in nearby Japanese and Philippine islands, but these alerts were later downgraded. \nWhile Taiwan has a history of quakes, both locals and foreigners who have lived in Taipei for years say this is the strongest quake they have experienced in decades. \nThe last major quake at 7.6 magnitude hit in September 1999, killing 2,400 people and destroying 5,000 buildings.\nAdditional reporting by Fan Wang in Singapore and BBC Chinese's Tzu-Wei Liu in Taipei ",

We know we're looking at least a year [until she is] back at home, going to work. We know it's a long, long road.\"\nWhile Olivia, an experienced skier, was not thought to have any memory of the crash, she did remember small bits of her holiday, Mrs Corbiere said.\n\"She's on heavy pain medication, but has her moments when she perks up. She's getting better and we never thought we'd be where we are just two weeks since her surgery,\" Olivia's sister added.\nNow, her family has begun planning trips out to help her recover in different environments, or to treat her to a concert.\nA fundraiser set up to support Olivia, a kitchen designer, through her recovery and while she is unable to work has so far raised about \u00a326,000.\nMrs Corbiere said: \"The support we had in Bulgaria was immense and that's continuing while we're in Sheffield. \n\"It's so comforting for Olivia and us that we've got the people of Sheffield, and across the UK, looking after us.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

    "Storm Kathleen will bring yet more wet and windy weather to parts of the UK over the weekend. \nMet Office warnings are in place for Friday and Saturday, with strong wind and gusts of up to 50mph (80km/h) forecast for parts of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \nThe north and west coast of Scotland and England are in store for the strongest gusts, with the Met Office warning they are expected to reach 70mph (113km/h).\nStorm Kathleen is the 11th named storm of the 2023-24 season, making it the joint most stormy period since they began to be named in 2015.\nIn the UK, the Met Office names any storm when it has the potential to cause disruption or damage.\nIt believes that it is easier to follow the progress of a storm on TV, radio, or social media if it has a name.\nThe Met Office said: \"We have seen how naming storms elsewhere in the world raises awareness of severe weather before it strikes.\"\nThe US began naming tropical storms in the 1950s.\nThe UK Met Office and Irish service Met \u00c9ireann launched their first \"Name our Storms\" campaign in 2015.\nMost years, they draw the names from a shortlist of favourites submitted by the public. Since 2019, they have been joined by the national weather service of the Netherlands, which also chips in a few suggested names each year.\nIn previous years, storms have alternated between male and female names.\nHowever, for the 2023-24 season, the Met Office has altered this, naming a number of storms after prominent scientists, meteorologists and others \"who work to keep people safe in times of severe weather\".\nWhen the criteria for naming a storm are met, either the Met Office, Met \u00c9ireann or Dutch weather agency KNMI can name a storm, taking the name from the latest list in alphabetical order. \nJocelyn, the last storm to hit the UK, was named by Met \u00c9ireann after Prof Jocelyn Bell Burnell, an astrophysicist who discovered the first pulsating radio stars, or pulsars, in 1967. \nKathleen was also named by the Irish service because more significant impacts are likely to be felt in the Republic of Ireland.\nA total of seven names in the 2023-24 storm season were selected by KNMI - including Henk which was submitted by someone who visited an open day at the agency's headquarters in October 2022.\nBabet was named after a woman who put her own name forward, \"because I was born during a storm\". \nStorm Gerrit was named after a weather presenter who left the Dutch public news broadcaster NOS in 2023 after 25 years. \nStorm Ciar\u00e1n was named after Ciar\u00e1n Fearon, a civil servant who works in the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland. His job is to ensure key information is shared on river levels and coastal flooding. \nStorm Agnes, which was recognised as the first storm of the season, was named after Agnes Mary Clerke, an Irish astronomer and science writer.\nAround six to seven named storms impact the UK each year on average, which means names in the second half of the alphabet are put forward but are always unlikely to be used.\nAnd if your name is Quentin or Yasmine, don't expect to be immortalised as a force of nature. Names beginning with Q, U, X, Y and Z do not even make the shortlist.\nYou may hear some names over the coming months which are not on the British/Irish/Dutch list. \nThat is because storms are named where they originate. Storms that reach the UK are occasionally the tail end of one that started in the US several days earlier - and may have been downgraded from hurricane or cyclone status.\nThe weather agencies of the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands make up the western European storm naming group. \nPortugal, Spain, Luxembourg, France and Belgium, form the south western group that collaborate to name storms. \nNorway, Sweden and Denmark are the northern group.\nIn the US, the National Hurricane Centre names tropical storms when they have reached winds of least 40mph, using alphabetical lists that are maintained by the World Meteorological Organisation. These lists are used on a six-year cycle. ",

    "Sculptures created for a charity art trail in York have been temporarily removed after they were targeted by vandals for a second time. \nTwo of the sculptures were left with large cracks in incidents on 2 and 3 April, with vandals having been seen rocking back and forth on one of the so-called \"Snooks\".\nOne of the Snook sculptures was previously damaged after being \"kicked, hit with force or climbed on\" in March, according to tourist organisation Make It York.\nThe sculptures are due to be auctioned off later in support of St Leonard's Hospice and the York Creates Fund.\nCCTV footage revealed the sculpture known as the Iron Snook, located at the Eye of York, was targeted by a group of five people rocking the sculpture until it hit the ground, causing damage. \nThe group also toppled several picnic benches provided by York BID. \nMeanwhile, a second sculpture, known as the Yorky Roasty Snooky sculpture, located at St Sampson\u2019s Square, was found with large cracks across the body. \nMake it York apologised for any inconvenience caused to those visiting the city to walk the trail. \nSarah Loftus, the company's managing director, said: \"We are deeply saddened by these acts of vandalism.\n\"Defacement is not only an act of vandalism, but an assault on our city\u2019s culture and the good cause of the project long term.\u201d\nThe sculptures have been temporarily repaired, and signage and barriers have been put in place to minimise further damage and safety to visitors. \nJames Wainwright, head of fundraising at St Leonard\u2019s Hospice said: \u201cThis senseless act of vandalism could mean we have fewer sculptures for the fundraising auction at York Barbican on 9 May.\u201d\nEach character on the trail, which was launched at the start of March, is sponsored by a business or organisation based in the city.\nThe Snooks were created by illustrator and mural artist Sian Ellis, who is Sheffield-based and has worked on many charity sculpture trails across the UK.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

    "An lecturer who left his job after complaining about flooding was awarded more than \u00a344,000 in compensation.\nKevin Hope won a complaint of constructive dismissal against the Capital City College Group.\nThe group runs further colleges, including City and Islington College, which provide courses to students in business, arts and technology.\nA tribunal found repeated flooding and a dispute with a lab technician led to Mr Hope's resignation.\nThe lecturer, who was described as \"a sculptor of some standing\", was employed as a 3D lecturer in art and design and used a workshop called G27.\nAn employment tribunal, held in Watford, heard G27 suffered serious and frequent flooding.\nWater contaminated the electrical fittings and pooled around high voltage heavy-duty tools and equipment.\nConstructive dismissal is when somebody is forced to leave a job against their will because of the employer's conduct.\nIt may be one serious incident or a series of incidents that are serious when taken together.\nWorkers with a case for constructive dismissal should leave the job immediately as employers may argue that, by staying, the conduct or treatment was accepted.\nSource: Gov.UK\nFrom about July 2017, Mr Hope reported various problems including emailing a technician about a lack of resources and personal protective equipment (PPE) over the previous years.\nRepresentations were also made to that technician's manager to intervene.\nOn 1 September 2020, Mr Hope had a face-to-face discussion with the technician about these failures. \nA few days later he was told the technician had raised a formal grievance against him.\nIn turn, Mr Hope raised a formal grievance against the technician in October 2020 and in April 2021 he lodged a second.\nHe said that flooding in August 2021 was the last straw and he resigned.\nThe tribunal found both the flooding and the relationship with the technician were each an effective cause of his resignation. \nThe judgement continued: \"It follows that the grievance failure, being so concerned with these, was an effective cause of his resignation.\n\"Having found above that the grievance failure was a repudiatory breach and an effective cause of his resignation, it follows that the claimant has established that he was constructively dismissed.\"\nA case of unfair dismissal was rejected.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A fraudster who stole more than \u00a3300,000 from three elderly people has been moved from Cardiff Prison because of threats, a court has heard. \nFormer soldier Layne Perry claimed to be a millionaire, but was living in a rented caravan in Trecco Bay, Porthcawl, in Bridgend county.\nIn December, Perry, 39, originally from Bridgend, was jailed for seven years.\nHe appeared at Cardiff Crown Court by video from HMP Berwyn, Wrexham, for a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing. \nPerry's barrister Justin Hugheston-Roberts told Judge Lucy Crowther further bank accounts belonging to Perry had been discovered.\nHe said his client was \"anxious to get the matter resolved\" and explained that Perry had been moved from Cardiff to Wrexham because of what he described as \"threats to his personal safety\".\nThe court heard that Perry's three victims had said their lives had been destroyed by his greed and cruelty. \nVal Gwiliam, 72, from Bridgend, said the distress caused by Perry led her to consider taking her life.\nDetectives are still trying unravel the complex finances and trace cash and assets Perry gained during the 18-month fraud. \nPerry met two of his victims, Ms Gwiliam and her husband Charlie, 67, at stables in the Vale of Glamorgan, where they both kept horses.\nHis third victim, Sharan Jones, 71, from Rhondda Cynon Taf, is the mother of Perry's sister's partner Theo.\nPerry met her at a Christmas party and offered to help with her finances after the death of her husband in 2017.\nAfter gaining her trust and access to her online bank accounts, he took her money and set up loans and credit cards in her name. He did the same with the Gwiliams.\nHe told all three he had made a fortune in gold, showing them bags of cash and even a gold bar. He persuaded Mr Gwiliam to invest in a business scheme involving the buying and selling of gold. \nMr Gwiliam said he had been pressured into it and did not want to do it.\nHe became close to all three. The Gwiliams said they thought of him as a son.\nBut all the time he was taking money from them, leaving them facing huge credit card bills and final demands for unpaid loans.\nAll three believed he was a wealthy and generous friend who wanted to share his good fortune with them, taking them on helicopter rides and VIP trips to the races. \nIn fact, he was spending their savings, or money from loans and credit cards on the lavish trips and high end restaurants.\nThe true scale of the fraud was only uncovered when the Gwiliams realised he had redirected their mail.\nWhen Mr Gwiliam told him and his wife were going to report the fraud to the police, Perry warned him the stress of his barrister's cross examination of Mrs Gwiliam would \"put her in hospital or in the ground.\"\nThe next Proceeds of Crime Act hearing is due to be held on 14 June.",

They previously paid 12%. From Saturday, they will be paying 8%.  \nAmong those who have welcomed the cut is part-time teacher Beth Langton-Clarke, who said the money could help to pay for a family holiday.\n\"It has been tough,\" she said. \"But this will make a big difference.\"\nShe said the family finances could be improved by about \u00a3800 a year as a result of the change.\nBut she said it had come after they had cut back on spending - particularly food - and constantly telling the children they would be going on fewer outings owing to rising costs.\n\"It would be nice to put some money into savings again.

That is because of the continued freeze on income tax thresholds - a factor known as fiscal drag.\nThe start of April would normally see the income thresholds at which different bands of tax are paid going up in line with prices. \nHowever, government policy means this has not happened with income tax since 2021 and, under current plans, the freeze will continue until 2028.\nThe result is more people paying tax and more people paying higher rates of tax than would otherwise have been the case.\nCombining the impact of the thresholds freezes and the NI cuts, independent think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimates that for every \u00a31 given back to workers (including the self-employed) this year by the NI cuts, \u00a31.30 will have been taken away due to the threshold changes between 2021 and 2024, with this rising to \u00a31.90 in 2027.\nThere are winners and losers from the tax changes. The average earner on about \u00a335,000 has benefitted more from the cut in NI than the hit from frozen tax thresholds. \nHowever, the very top earners have seen their taxes rise owing to changes in tax policy.\nMeanwhile, fiscal drag - as well as rising minimum pay rates - mean somebody working 35 hours a week on the minimum wage is now having to pay tax on almost \u00a38,300 of their earnings. Last year it would have been \u00a36,400.  \nSimilarly, it is estimated that 1.6 million pensioners will be drawn into paying tax by 2027-28.\nScotland has different tax bands to the rest of the UK.\nA range of benefits received by millions of people, such as universal credit, are rising by 6.7%, in line with the rate of rising prices (as of September).\nBenefits are fully devolved in Northern Ireland, but changes will be similar to those for the rest of the UK.",
    "A group of pensioners say their plans for a happy retirement have been ruined after fees were hiked on flats they bought in an independent living complex.\nThe leasehold residents live in two-bedroom apartments in Village 135 in Wythenshawe, Manchester.\nIn April, service charges and ground rent increased by 19% to almost \u00a37000 a year, which one residents says has caused \"worry and stress\".\nLandlords Wythenshawe Community Housing Group (WCHG) said the hike was needed to pay off a backlog of costs that had grown due to inflation.  \nSusannah Walaitis is a leasehold owner-occupier at the 135-bed apartment block on Hollyhedge Road. \nThe 70-year-old said the hike, which saw her paying \u00a3582 a month, had caused her \"physical and mental worry and stress\", and put pressure on her finances.\n\"We\u2019re not getting this increase in our pensions, we have to deal with the cost of living like everyone else,\" she told BBC Radio Manchester.\nMs Walaitis, who said she was \"disgusted\" by the increase, pleaded with her landlords to \"get your act together\".\nLucy Tan, 78, agreed with the sentiments of Ms Walaitis.\nShe moved into her apartment in 2018, and said she was impressed when she first saw the property.\n\"I thought, wow, it is really beautiful.\"\nBut the 19% increase this month left her \"lost for words\", she said. \n\"We feel the charge is unfair,\" she said, adding leasehold residents had to pay for the upkeep of a building where everything was built \"not to standard size\", meaning costs went up.\nThe service charges in the flats pays for things like staffing, cleaning, gardening and energy bills in communal areas. \nPaul Seymour, an executive director at WCHG said the 19% rise was needed to pay off deficit in the service charge that had grown after years of high-inflation. \nThe residents had been billed annually, but there had been a shortfall after costs increased above what was expected, he said. \nMr Seymour said he hoped a increase of this size \"will not be imposed in future years\", with inflation falling.\nSebastian O'Kelly is from the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, a charity which campaigns to reduce the service charges on blocks of flats. \nHe said the Grenfell Tower disaster was a watershed moment for the industry which \"put the spotlight on blocks of flats up and down the country\". \n\"There's been huge bills for remediation, waking watch and professional fees for building safety issues.\"\nThe campaigner said this had \"concentrated the minds of anybody living in a block of flats\".\n\"How vulnerable they are when it comes to major bills and how imbalanced the powers are between them and the freehold owner.\" \nAt the opening of Parliament in November, the King announced government plans to strengthen the law around leasehold properties and to tackle \"the exploitation of millions of homeowners through punitive service charges\".\nA spokeswoman from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: \"Charges like these are completely unacceptable without proper justification.\n\"That is why we are committed to strengthening protection for leaseholders, and are bringing forward reforms through the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Bill.\"\nWhy not follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X and Instagram?

    "The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.\nAbout 1,200 people were killed, and more than 250 were taken to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\nMore than 33,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. \nBritain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. \nThe land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. \nTensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. \nThis stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.\nThe declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.\nTo Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.\nBetween the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.\nViolence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.\nIn 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. \nThat plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.\nIn 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.\nIt was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.\nFighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.\nHundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"\nBy the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. \nJordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. \nJerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.\nBecause there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.\nIn a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.\nMost Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.\nNeither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.\nIsrael still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.\nIn the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.\nSettlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.\nGaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.\nJust 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.\nIn the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.\nIsrael occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.\nIsrael withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.\nThere are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. \nThese include: \nIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.\nA negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.\nIn a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people.

    "Ukraine has carried out a drone attack against targets in southern Russia and claims to have destroyed six Russian planes at an airbase in Rostov region.\nSecurity sources told BBC Ukrainian eight more aircraft were badly damaged, while 20 service personnel could have been killed or injured.\nThe Morozovsk base houses Su-27 and Su-34 aircraft used on the front line in Ukraine, the sources said.\nThere has been no word from Russia on reports of an airfield attack.\nThe BBC has been unable to independently verify the reports.\nHowever, Russian officials said that more than 40 drones had been aimed at the region, which borders Ukraine.\nBBC Russian military analyst Pavel Aksyonov says an attack by so many drones over a short space of time could have overwhelmed air defences.\nMeanwhile, four people were killed and over 20 wounded in Russian missile strikes on the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, Ukrainian officials said.\nThe eastern city of Kharkiv also came under air attack, with local authorities reporting two deaths from the Russian bombardment.\nIn Zaporizhzhia, regional governor Ivan Fedorov said several high-rise blocks and private homes were damaged. \nTwo missiles struck first, and then - after rescuers and police arrived - three more hit, he added. Ukrainian media said several journalists were among the injured.\nEarlier, Ukraine's air force said that overnight and into Friday, Russia had attacked Odesa and Dnipropetrovsk regions and Kharkiv with 13 drones and five missiles. \nAll the drones were shot down, it said, but energy facilities were damaged in Odesa region, as well as residential buildings in Kharkiv. \nAlso, Russian troops continued their slow advance in Donetsk region. Ukrainian officials said the town of Chasiv Yar was coming under constant bombardment amid reports that Russian forces had reached the outskirts.\nReporting the Rostov attacks, the Russian defence ministry said Saratov, Kursk, Belgorod and Krasnodar regions had also been targeted. It said all the drones involved were shot down.\nIn Rostov's Morozovsk district, an electrical sub-station was hit, leaving about 600 people without power for a few hours, Rostov governor Vasily Golubev said on his Telegram channel.\nHe added that there had been some damage to a 16-storey residential block.\nIn a later post, he said eight people had been injured by explosives detonating on one of the fallen drones during an investigation of the site \"not far from the aerodrome\".\nUkraine has stepped up drone attacks on targets within Russia recently, targeting military and energy facilities.\nIt has warned repeatedly that its army is facing severe ammunition shortages, but has set a target of producing a million drones domestically this year.\nOn Tuesday it claimed responsibility for a drone attack in Tatarstan, more than 1,300km (807 miles) from the Ukraine-Russia border. \nThe strikes, targeting a drone factory and an oil refinery, are the deepest into Russian territory since the start of the war. Twelve people were reported injured.",
    "C\u00e9sar Nebrera pours out a cup of coffee he has brewed on a stove in the boot of his car. The old green Kia saloon sits in the shade of a carob tree just off the main road near Ibiza Town.\n\"I miss the basic things that make life comfortable, like being able to stand up in your own home, being able to cook properly, or even open a drawer and pull out some socks,\" he says.\n\"Those are the kinds of things that you miss out on when you live in a car.\"\nC\u00e9sar's Kia has been his home for the past three years. He works as a chef, but with rental costs on the Spanish island of Ibiza having spiralled, he cannot afford to live in a flat.\n\"In Ibiza, accommodation is very expensive, and it's getting more and more expensive,\" he says. \"And the cost of renting is completely out of kilter with what you earn. So living like this is an alternative. It's less comfortable, but it allows me to keep living on the island.\"\nIbiza is one of the four main Mediterranean islands that make up Spain's Balearic Islands. The others are Majorca, Menorca, and Formentera.\nMany local professionals in Ibiza are living in similarly precarious conditions because of high rental costs. Last year, the IGC, a representative body of the civil guard police force, said that \"three or four\" of its officers were living in vehicles on the island.\nOther locals have resorted to living in tents, or in extremely basic shared accommodation.\nDaniel Granda, spokesman for the Sindicato de Inquilinas de Ibiza y Formentera, an organisation that represents local tenants, says such situations are becoming commonplace.\n\"A lot of people end up in quite miserable conditions, and we're starting to see slums across the island,\" he says. \"Without the possibility of finding accommodation that allows us to live normally, those of us who live on the island have the feeling that we are being pushed off it.\"\nHigh interest rates and a recent cost-of-living crisis have deterred many Spaniards from buying property, creating an increase in demand for rented accommodation, which has pushed rental costs up. Rental prices across the Balearic Islands have increased by an average of 18% over the past year alone, compared with a 12% average increase nationwide.\nHowever, Ibiza's status as a tourism hub situated in a relatively small area has supercharged this phenomenon on the island, leading to much steeper increases, in some cases up to 40 or 50% over the last year alone.\nIsabel Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez, who has searched for affordable accommodation on the island, says that a single room costs between \u20ac700 and \u20ac1,000 ($760 and $1,086; \u00a3600 and \u00a3857) per month, while a modest flat can cost around \u20ac1,500.\nIsabel, who works as a cashier in a supermarket, and her partner, who has a job in a five-star hotel, had to move out of their rented apartment when it was sold. Since then, they have been living with Isabel's mother-in-law. Originally from the central Spanish region of Castilla La Mancha, Isabel says that she and her family are now considering moving back to the mainland, purely because of the housing situation.\n\"The problem in other parts of Spain is that there isn't much work,\" she says. \"Here there's all the work you could want, but there isn't anywhere to live.\"\nUnemployment in Ibiza Town, the island's capital, is at just under 5%, compared to 8% in Madrid or 19% in the Andalusia region's capital Seville.\nWith a population of just 160,000, Ibiza received close to four million tourists last year, a new record, and 84% of its economic activity is linked to tourism, according to the local government. While its hotels, restaurants and clubs provide plenty of employment, a large portion of its housing is only available at short-term tourist rates, and local workers are priced out of the market.\nThe conservative regional government of the Balearic Islands, which came into power last year, has chosen not to implement a housing law approved by the Spanish government in Madrid which seeks to cap rentals in areas of the country where they have soared.\nInstead, the local authorities mainly attribute the housing problem to homeowners in residential areas of Ibiza who are flouting the law by offering their properties for short-term rental, when local laws state they must rent for at least six months at a time. The local government says that since 2019 it has imposed around \u20ac4m euros in fines related to illegal activity in the tourism sector.\n\"The problem is that you earn much more money renting for days or for weeks than if you rent according to the law,\" says Juan Miguel Costa, head of tourism in Ibiza. \nHe says that regional and municipal authorities need to work together \"to attack that idea of impunity that there has been on the island, that it's very easy to offer an apartment [for tourism] illegally in a residential building, or offer a property as a holiday home without a holiday licence.\"\nMr Costa also attributes the rental increase to many homes remaining unused throughout the year, because of owners'",
    " US Army Colonel Estee Pinchasin looks out at the thousands of tonnes of twisted, broken steel and concrete jutting out from the dark waters of Maryland's Patapsco river, and delivers her assessment: an \"unforgiving mangled mess\".\n\"That's the best way to describe this,\" the fatigue-clad veteran says from the deck of an Army-operated salvage vessel, the Reynolds. \"It's hard to explain steel that is cantilevered, bent and smashed with so much force.\"\nThe \"mess\" Col Pinchasin has been tasked with clearing is the tattered remnants of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, strewn around - and embedded into - the Dali, a massive 948ft (289m) cargo ship that now sits motionless under an expanse of shredded metal, with partially crushed shipping containers hanging from its sides.\nThe mangled mess is self-explanatory. But why unforgiving? Because, put simply, anything and everything here is a potential threat to the lives of salvage crews.\nThe Dali's collision with the bridge in the early hours of 26 March brought the structure down in a matter of seconds, leaving six workers dead and the ship stuck. This has prompted a huge response that has included the US Army Corps of Engineers, Navy, Coast Guard, Maryland authorities and specialist private firms. \nThe effort aims to unblock the 700ft (213m) wide and 50ft (15m) deep shipping channel, re-float and remove the Dali and clear whatever remains of the estimated 3,000 to 4,000 tonnes of debris from the wider Patapsco. \n\"Those things are happening simultaneously,\" Col Pinchasin, the Army Corps of Engineers Baltimore district commander, told the BBC. \"But the priority is for the channel, because we need to get those people back to work and help all the businesses that are affected.\" \nThe port is one of the busiest on the East Coast of the United States and a key regional hub for goods including steel, aluminium and agricultural equipment. It is used by car-makers including General Motors and Honda. As many as 15,000 jobs depend on it, including 8,000 directly employed there. \nThe mission has turned the area into a hub of activity, buzzing with small US Navy sonar vessels and police boats, workers testing spark-emitting hydraulic shears, and - so far - seven huge crane barges, including the Chesapeake, a 1,000-tonne capacity crane once used by the CIA to build a ship used to recover a Soviet submarine from the bottom of the Pacific. \nPiece by piece, debris will eventually be disassembled and lifted onto barges to be taken away. \n\"With every layer of debris they remove, they have to go back in and survey the wreckage to see if it reacted the way we thought it was going to,\" Col Pinchasin said. \"Are there any instabilities? Are they things we missed? What did we not see?\" \n\"They need to have discipline and be very self-critical.\" \nThe dangerous work of making these determinations has so far fallen on teams of divers who inspect both the ship and the vast, unseen debris field beneath the surface. \nThey are often unable to see more than a foot or two in the muddy brown waters of the Patapsco, forcing them to be guided by operators in nearby surface vessels. \nTheir assessments, Col Pinchasin said, are essential to ensuring that larger pieces of debris can be dismantled and removed safely.  \n\"The pieces might be mangled, but there's a lot of force pent-up in how they're sitting right now,\" she said, gesturing at a large chunk of metal protruding from the shipping channel. \n\"If you were to cut one of those things, and there's tension there you don't know about and it snaps, people can be in a lot of danger,\" she added. \"We need to know what's connected, and that's why the divers have to go in. They have to feel and reach to verify\u2026 but it's like they have their eyes closed.\" \nA separate team of divers, drawn from the ranks of the Maryland State Police, stands ready to dive if and when investigators believe they have found the remains of the three men still missing from the collapse. \nThe continued search for those men, she added, continues to weigh heavily on the minds of those involved in the salvage operation. \n\"These are families that did not get to celebrate Easter together,\" she said. \"This is very solemn ground.\" \nThose involved in the operation and maritime experts say that the scope of the operation has few, if any comparisons. \nAn initial $60m (\u00a347.4m) in emergency funds have been earmarked to cover the work. The true cost may be much higher, with one politician, Maryland Democrat David Trone, telling CBS that the cost could eventually rise to $1bn. \n\"The scale is the biggest challenge, but also the complexity,\" said Captain Dan Hoban, a British Royal Engineer who was on a routine exchange with the US Army Corps of Engineers when the bridge collapsed. \n\"It's a really messy situation. From an engineering perspective, we are trying to figure out where the cuts are going to be made and then incorporate that into a lifting plan,\" added Capt Hoban, who has been helping with t",
    "It has been nearly six months since Hamas fighters broke through from Gaza into Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking hundreds hostage. \nIn response, Israel vowed to \"crush and destroy Hamas\" so that it no longer posed any threat, and to bring all the hostages home.\nIn the brutal war that has followed, at least 33,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and large parts of Gaza have been destroyed. \nIsrael says it has killed thousands of Hamas fighters and destroyed much of the vast network of tunnels beneath Gaza, which Hamas has used to carry out attacks. \nBBC Verify has combed through public statements and social media posts by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and assessed the evidence behind Israel's stated aims.\nBefore 7 October, Hamas was thought to have about 30,000 fighters in Gaza, according to reports quoting IDF commanders. \nMany of Hamas's senior political figures such as Ismail Haniyeh, widely considered to be the group's overall leader, live abroad. But many of its military leadership structure are thought to be inside Gaza. \nIn a recent statement, the IDF said it had killed about 13,000 Hamas fighters since the start of the war, although it did not say how it calculated that figure. \nIsrael also publishes the names of individual Hamas leaders it says have been killed. \nA total of 113 people have been named in this way since October, the overwhelming majority of whom were reported killed in the first three months of the war. By comparison, the Israeli army did not report any senior Hamas leaders killed in Gaza this year until March. \nOn 26 March, the IDF said it had killed Marwan Issa, deputy commander of Hamas's military wing. Considered one of Israel's most-wanted men, he would be the group's most senior leader to be killed since the war began. The US has said it believes he was killed, but Hamas has not confirmed it.\nThe IDF publishes names of individuals who it says are senior Hamas leaders who have been killed, but it is not possible to verify whether they are members of the group. One of those named in this category was Mustafa Thuraya, who was working as a freelance journalist in southern Gaza when his vehicle was hit in January.\nWe also found duplicate names in the list, which we have discounted from the total.\nOutside Gaza, Hamas political leader Saleh al-Arouri died in an explosion in Beirut's southern suburb of Dahiyeh in January. Israel is widely considered responsible for that attack.\nHowever, experts we spoke to said many of the group's prominent leaders in Gaza, including Yahya Sinwar, are still believed to be alive. \n\"The IDF hasn't been able to get to the top brass of the Hamas leadership,\" says Mairav Zonszein, a senior analyst on Israeli-Palestinian affairs at the International Crisis Group.  \n\"Both on a symbolic level of getting to the main leaders, and also on the level of replacing Hamas as the holder of the territory, that's something that it hasn't been able to achieve,\" Ms Zonszein says.\nAccording to Israeli official figures,  253 people were taken hostage on 7 October. Of these:\nThe youngest confirmed living hostage is 18 and the oldest aged 85. \nOf the remaining 129 hostages, Israel says at least 34 are dead.\nHamas says the number of dead hostages is higher - the result of IDF air strikes. But it is not possible to verify these allegations.\nThe two youngest hostages taken in the Hamas attacks were Ariel and Kfir, who were 4 years and 9 months old respectively at the time of their abduction. Their deaths have been reported, but not confirmed.\nAs part of its pledge to eliminate Hamas, Israel promised to destroy the group's extensive tunnel network beneath Gaza, which it uses to move goods and people.\n\"Think of the Gaza Strip as one layer for civilians and then another layer for Hamas. We are trying to get to that second layer that Hamas has built,\" IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus said in October.\nHamas has previously said that its tunnel network stretches for 500km (311 miles), although there is no way to independently verify this.  \nWe asked the IDF how many tunnels, and what proportion of the total tunnel network, they had destroyed. In their reply, they said their forces had \"destroyed a great deal of the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza\".\nThe IDF has occasionally shown evidence of Hamas tunnels they've uncovered. For example, in November, the IDF released video footage of part of a tunnel network underneath the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City which it said was being used as a command centre.\nTo try to determine the extent of the overall network uncovered by the Israeli forces, BBC Verify has reviewed all the IDF messages on the social media platform Telegram referencing tunnels in Gaza, between 7 October 2023 and 26 March 2024. \nOf these, 198 mentioned the discovery of tunnels, where the army said it had located tunnels or tunnel shafts. Another 141 messages claim that a tunnel has been destroyed or disman",
    "Sierra Leone's president has declared a national emergency over rampant drug abuse.\nKush, a psychoactive blend of addictive substances, has been prevalent in the country for years.\nPresident Julius Maada Bio called the drug a \"death trap\" and said it posed an \"existential crisis\".\nOne of the drug's many ingredients is human bones - security has been tightened in cemeteries to stop addicts digging up skeletons from graves.\nGroups of mostly young men sitting on street corners with limbs swollen by kush abuse is a common sight in Sierra Leone.\nWith a bandage around his ankle, one recovering addict told the BBC the drug has a tight grip on him.\n\"I don't like doing this, but I cannot leave it because I enjoy it,\" he said. \nThere is no official death toll, but one doctor told the BBC that \"in recent months\" hundreds of young men had died from organ failure caused by kush in the capital, Freetown.\nThe psychoactive substance also takes a toll on mental health - the Sierra Leone Psychiatric Hospital, the country's only institution of its kind, says between 2020 and 2023, admissions linked to kush surged by almost 4,000% to reach 1,865. \nAnd the spike in kush use has seen Freetown's main cemeteries request police security to protect themselves from young men digging up skeletons - ground-up human bone is one of the many ingredients used to make kush, although it is not clear why.\nIn a nationwide broadcast on Thursday night, President Bio said: \"Our country is currently faced with an existential threat due to the ravaging impact of drugs and substance abuse, particularly the devastating synthetic drug kush.\"\nHe added that there had been \"escalating fatalities\" among kush users.\nThe president also directed officials to set up a National Task Force on Drugs and Substance Abuse, which will primarily focus on \"combatting the kush crisis\".\nHe said centres will be set up in every district and \"adequately staffed by trained professionals to offer care and support to people with drug addiction\". \nAt present, Freetown is home to the country's only functioning drug rehabilitation centre. The 100-bed facility was hurriedly set up in an army training centre earlier this year.\nExperts have described it as \"more of a holding centre than a rehab\" because of its lack of adequate facilities.\nAs well as addressing treatment, the president said law enforcement agencies should \"dismantle the drug supply chain through investigations, arrests, and prosecutions\".\nDeputy Mayor of Freetown Kweku Lisk told the BBC that his office had requested security from the police in order to tackle gravediggers.\nAt the moment, there is a night-time police deployment at the Kissy Road cemetery, a large unfenced site in an eastern suburb.\nMr Bio's administration has been criticised by people who say it lacks the strategy and drive to respond to kush abuse.\n\"Such is the vacuum left by the lack of adequate response that communities have often had to take the law into their own hands and have responded to the crisis sometimes in a disjointed and crude manner\", said a foreign diplomat in Sierra Leone. \nThis sentiment has been echoed by callers on some local radio talk shows and on social media.\nDr Abdul Jalloh, head of the Sierra Leone Psychiatric Hospital, said Mr Bio's emergency declaration is \"the right step\" and will be \"crucial in addressing drug use\".\n\"It signifies the prioritisation of resources, attention and intervention to combat this growing epidemic,\" he said. \nSome 63% of the hospital's current patients were admitted with kush-related problems.\nMarie, a mother who lost her 21-year-old son to kush, said: \"There is a lot the authorities must do beyond the president's address last night to combat this scourge.\"",
    "Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas have been at war since early October. \nIt began when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on Israel from Gaza - the deadliest in Israel's history. \nAn Israeli military campaign has followed, which has killed thousands in the Palestinian territory.\nOn the morning of 7 October, waves of Hamas gunmen stormed across Gaza's border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people. Hamas also fired thousands of rockets. \nThose killed included children, the elderly and 364 young people at a music festival.\u202f \nHamas took more than 250 others to Gaza as hostages.\nThe BBC has also seen evidence of rape and sexual violence during the Hamas attacks.\u202f \nHamas became the sole ruler of Gaza after violently ejecting political rivals in 2007.\nIt has an armed wing and was thought to have about 30,000 fighters before the start of the war.\nThe group, whose name stands for Islamic Resistance Movement, wants to create an Islamic state in place of Israel. Hamas rejects Israel's right to exist and is committed to its destruction. \nHamas justified its attack as a response to what it calls Israeli crimes against the Palestinian people. \nThese include security raids on Islam's third holiest site - the al-Aqsa Mosque, in occupied East Jerusalem - and Jewish settlement activity in the occupied West Bank.  \nHamas also wants thousands of Palestinian prisoners in Israel to be freed and for an end to the blockade of the Gaza Strip by Israel and Egypt - something both countries say is for security. \nIt has fought several wars with Israel since it took power, fired thousands of rockets and carried out many other deadly attacks.  \nIsrael has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes and sent troops into Gaza in 2008 and 2014. \nHamas, or in some cases its armed wing alone, is considered a terrorist group by Israel, the US, the EU, and the UK, among others. \nIran backs Hamas with funding, weapons and training.\nIsrael immediately began a massive campaign of air strikes on targets in Gaza, in response to the Hamas attack. \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's aims were the destruction of Hamas and the return of the hostages.  \nIsrael launched a ground invasion three weeks later. It has also bombarded Gaza from the sea. \nAttacks were initially focused on northern Gaza, particularly Gaza City and tunnels beneath it, which Israel said were the centre of military operations by Hamas. \nAll 1.1 million people living in the north were ordered by Israel to evacuate south for their safety. \nFollowing a temporary truce in late November, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) extended ground operations to southern Gaza.  \nTroops reached the heart of the second biggest city, Khan Younis, where the IDF said it believed top Hamas commanders were hiding. The IDF also pushed into refugee camps in central Gaza.\nMore than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed, and tens of thousands injured by Israeli strikes since the start of the war, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. It says most were women and children.   \nMr Netanyahu said in March that 13,000 Palestinian fighters had been killed, while about a month earlier the IDF said it had killed about 9,000 Hamas fighters, in addition to more than 1,000 of the attackers inside Israel on 7 October. It has not said how it came to this figure. \nIsrael says more than 250 of its soldiers have been killed in Gaza.\nHomes and other buildings in Gaza have suffered from extensive damage and destruction.  \nMost of the 253 men, women and children abducted by Hamas were civilians. \nThey included elderly people and those with disabilities and medical conditions. The youngest was nine months old. \nIn Gaza, Hamas hid them in tunnels and fighters' homes. Unconfirmed reports suggest some have been held by other militant groups. \nDuring November's truce, 105 hostages (81 Israelis and dual nationals, and 24 foreigners) were released in exchange for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.\nFour hostages had previously been freed by Hamas and three rescued by the IDF - one on 29 October and two on 12 February.\nThree hostages were accidentally killed by Israeli troops who mistook them for Hamas fighters. \nThe UN and aid agencies say Gaza is suffering severe shortages of food and other essentials including fuel and medicine. This is particularly acute in northern Gaza, where it is especially difficult to deliver aid which enters the territory from the south.\nA UN-backed report says the situation across Gaza is turning into a man-made famine. A number of children have starved to death in northern Gaza, the UN says.\nHumanitarian agencies and Israel have blamed each other. Agencies say Israeli security checks on aid going into Gaza are complex and arbitrary, causing major delays. Israel denies impeding aid and says agencies are failing to distribute the aid that is allowed in.\nHowever Israel has agreed to open a crossing into northern Gaza and allow its nearby port of Ashdod to receive shipments ",
    "Economic concepts like subvention, productivity and identifiable expenditure are not the usual materials of political passion in Northern Ireland.\nBut this week they took centre stage as a new report attempted to estimate the initial costs of Irish unification.\nThe work by Dublin-based economists, John Fitzgerald and Edgar Morgenroth, looked at how much it costs to deliver public services in Northern Ireland and how those costs could be carried across to a unified state.\nThe reaction was a taster of the economic arguments for and against unification, should a border poll be called anytime soon. \nOfficial data shows that Northern Ireland raises less in tax than it spends on public services with the gap filled by money from central government - a subvention.\nAll regions of the UK aside from London and the south east of England require a subvention and in Northern Ireland's case the headline figure is usually estimated at about \u00a310bn.\nFitzgerald and Morgenroth made some adjustments to that number; for example, subtracting Northern Ireland's share of UK defence spending.\nBut they still concluded that on day one of unification, the Irish state would have to find substantial additional resources to fund public services for citizens in the northern six counties.\nTheir central estimate was \u20ac11bn (\u00a39.4bn) or about 5% of Irish national income, meaning tax increases, more borrowing or spending cuts in the unified state.\nTheir lowest estimate was \u20ac8bn (\u00a36.8bn) with a highest estimate of 20bn (\u00a317.1bn), based on the assumption that public sector pay and benefits in Northern Ireland would immediately be raised to match levels in the republic.\nFor unionists, the numbers bolster the argument that being part of the large UK state gives Northern Ireland a degree of economic protection and that conditions would be harsher in a united Ireland.\n\"This report shows that we are much better off being British,\" said the Traditional Unionist Voice party (TUV), adding that supporters of unity had been confronted with \"cold, hard financial reality\".\nAn economic analysis is only as good as its underlying assumptions and across nationalism there were critiques that the assumptions in this study were limited, static and pessimistic, leading to unreliable conclusions.\nIn a social media post, the SDLP's Stormont leader, Matthew O'Toole, said it is important that those who favour Irish unity should not present \"blithely optimistic pictures\" nor should \"self-evidently motivated, even jaundiced, political and diplomatic assumptions be bolted onto what purports to be an economic analysis\".\nHis point being that when considering a post-referendum negotiation on the terms on which Northern Ireland would leave the UK the study \"appears designed to present the most pessimistic case\".\nAnother major plank of criticism is that the analysis did not really attempt to engage with the possibility that Northern Ireland's economic performance could improve as it was integrated with the Republic.\nOne current major difference between the two economies is productivity, a measurement of the amount of economic output generated by each worker.\nIn the long-term, rising profits, wages and living standards are dependent on rising productivity. \nA 2022 study by Dublin's Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) suggested that productivity in NI is about 40% lower than in the Republic of Ireland, even when excluding the impacts of multinational companies in the Republic. \nThe contention for advocates of unity is that if Northern Ireland's productivity performance converged even partially then worries about the subvention would start to go away.\nProf John Doyle, a political scientist at Dublin City University, said the analysis by Fitzgerald and Morgenroth only considers this in a superficial way. \n\"The report mentions the possibility of economic change, but the headline figures assume no change at all. The UK is a highly-centralised economy, with only London producing a fiscal surplus. \nThere is no trajectory of 'catching up' for Northern Ireland or indeed other UK regions.\n\"There is no reason to believe that with the same tax and policy model as the south that Northern Ireland would remain such a weak economy, compared to say Cork and Kerry.  \n\"If they reached that level no subvention would be required, and productivity, wages and living standards would improve.\"\nProf Morgenroth remains unconvinced by this \"productivity catch-up\" idea, pointing to the experience of German unification where, 30 years on, productivity differences persist and the eastern part of the country continues to receive big fiscal transfers.\nWhat we have heard this week is not the last word on the economics of unification. \nIn fact the last few years have seen a serious academic engagement with cross-border issues as well as the possibilities of constitutional change and its economic implications.\nTwo separate projects have funded research on a range of topics.\nThe Irish government's Shared I",
    "The chancellor has praised a Tory MP for apologising after he admitted he gave other MPs' personal phone numbers to someone on a dating app.\nJeremy Hunt said William Wragg had been \"courageous\" in telling the Times he was sorry for the \"hurt\" he had caused.\nMr Wragg told the newspaper he had been \"scared\" because the individual had \"compromising things on me\".\nIt follows reports at least 12 men in political circles received unsolicited messages, raising security concerns.\nThe men are reported to include a government minister, advisers and political journalists based at Westminster.\nSome had been sent naked images, and two MPs are reported to have responded by sending images of themselves.\nMr Wragg has not been suspended as a Conservative MP and the party's whips office - in charge of party discipline - is not commenting, citing an ongoing police investigation. \nHowever, some MPs have privately expressed surprise that Mr Wragg has not lost the Conservative whip. At least one Tory MP has contacted the whips' office to say he should be suspended from the parliamentary party. \nThe BBC has attempted to contact Mr Wragg, who is standing down as an MP at the general election, for comment.\nA Leicestershire Police spokesperson said the force was \"investigating a report of malicious communications\" that had been made to them last month.\nThe Metropolitan Police said it was in contact with Leicestershire Police and Parliament's security team, adding: \"We will assess any reports made to us accordingly.\"\nOne former MP, who is gay, has told the BBC he was targeted by someone calling themselves \"Charlie\", who claimed - wrongly - that he had previously worked for Mr Wragg.\n\"The last part of that message was 'Westminster misses you\u2026' and that was basically something that friends usually do say anyway to make me feel better,\" he added.\n\"I was starting to feel bad actually. I was embarrassed thinking I'm speaking to someone who knows who I am and I'm trying desperately not to come across as rude.\"\nThe next message said: \"I've just become single so I'm hanging out with the Westminster gays.\"\nThe former MP explained he was in a relationship, but further flirtatious messages followed. After \"Charlie\" sent an explicit image, the former MP blocked him.\nBBC News has also seen similar messages sent from the same number to a political journalist.\nThe BBC has also spoken to a man who works for an MP, who was messaged \"out of the blue\" last autumn by someone calling themselves \"Abi\" with a female profile picture.\nThe staffer said they claimed to know him from work, and mentioned an event he had attended.\nBut he grew suspicious when he asked who they were, and they replied with information that was \"clearly wrong\".\nHe said he ignored them, but they continued to message him. He told the BBC he learned five or six months later that someone else had received messages from a person with the same number and similar picture.\nThe MP's staff member said he would be \"very surprised\" if Mr Wragg had his number, and he cannot recall ever having met him.\nSpeaking to reporters earlier, Mr Hunt said the reports of unsolicited messages were a \"great cause for concern\" but Mr Wragg had \"given a courageous and fulsome apology\".\nHe added that the reports should be a \"lesson\" to both MPs and members of the public that they need to be careful about cyber-security.\nIt is unclear who is behind the unsolicited messages. Some MPs have expressed concerns that a foreign power, such as China and Russia, could be involved.\nCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has written to MPs telling them it would be \"unwise\" to speculate, and promising to keep them \"updated on developments\".\nMr Wragg, who is vice chair of the influential 1922 committee of backbench Tory MPs, told the Times said he had sent intimate pictures of himself to a man he met on gay dating app Grindr.\n\"They had compromising things on me. They wouldn't leave me alone,\" added the 36-year-old, who has been MP for Hazel Grove in Greater Manchester since 2015.\n\"They would ask for people. I gave them some numbers, not all of them. I told him to stop. He's manipulated me and now I've hurt other people.\n\"I got chatting to a guy on an app and we exchanged pictures. We were meant to meet up for drinks, but then didn't. Then he started asking for numbers of people. I was worried because he had stuff on me. He gave me a WhatsApp number, which doesn't work now.\n\"I've hurt people by being weak. I was scared. I'm mortified. I'm so sorry that my weakness has caused other people hurt.\"\nConservative MP Sir Charles Walker said it would be \"madness\" for Mr Wragg, a friend of his, to quit as an MP.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's PM programme Mr Wragg had \"been subject to a sting operation by a very clever and manipulative operator\". \nHe added: \"I think a lot of people may think that what Will did was misguided, and even stupid, but I also believe that there's a lot of compassion out there.\n\"I'm not excusing what Will has done, but I do ",
    "A man has been jailed for attempted murder after chasing his victim down a street before unleashing a flurry of gunshots.\nHayden Frost fled the scene in Birmingham in September on an e-bike while his male target was left with a bullet wound to the neck, said police.\nFrost was sentenced to 32 years in prison at the city's crown court on Wednesday.\nThe 26-year-old, from Laburnum Avenue in Solihull, had been convicted of attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.\nPolice said Frost had travelled on the e-bike to the Marston Green Tavern, a pub in Marston Green, Solihull, on 9 September where his victim was socialising with friends.\nShortly after 23:00 GMT, Frost followed the man to the Iron Horse Pub on Flaxley Road in the Stechford area of Birmingham, where he was recorded on CCTV hiding in a bush.\nThe man later got in a car and Frost followed him to Craneberry Road in Chelmsley Wood, Solihull.\nIn the early hours of 10 September, as he was walking to a cashpoint, Frost chased him and shot towards his head before fleeing.\nThe shooting was captured by CCTV cameras, which police said led to Frost\u2019s arrest and conviction.\nThe West Midlands force said the victim suffered a wound to the neck, with the bullet travelling down to his right shoulder where fragments still remained.\nAs well as physical injuries, he was also left with psychological scars including fearing being left on his own when out in public, police added.\nThe force said the motive for the attack remained unknown.\nDet Insp Francis Nock said: \u201cFrost was calculating - dressed in black he followed his victim on an e-bike, where he hid and waited for him to be alone and vulnerable.\n\u201cHe then carried out what must have been a terrifying attack on his victim who was forced to run for his life as bullets were discharged.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cGuns have no place on the streets of the West Midlands and this sentence sends out a clear message that people who do carry weapons and decide to use them will face many years behind bars.\u201d\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "When Sian Williams was offered tickets to see Taylor Swift in concert, she jumped at the chance.\nBut within seconds of transferring \u00a3250, she knew she'd been scammed.\n\"It makes me angry because it was so realistic,\" said the mum-of-two from Gwynedd, who thought she was buying from a trustworthy mutual friend.\nConsumer watchdogs are warning others to beware of similarly sophisticated online cons.\nSian had promised her 18-year-old daughter Efa she would take her to see Swift's The Eras Tour this summer after finishing her A-level exams. \nAfter missing out on the official ticket sale in 2023 - Swift's show in Cardiff due to take place this June sold out in minutes - she was put in touch with someone who claimed to have four tickets to the US pop idol's Liverpool date.\n\"I didn't think anything of it because it was a friend of a friend,\" said Sian, from Blaenau Ffestiniog.\nThey asked for \u00a3500 for four tickets, providing screenshots of each and details about the seating arrangements.  \nBut Sian and Efa's bank account set-up meant they could only transfer a maximum of \u00a3250 at a time, which they began to do after sharing their details with the scammer via WhatsApp.\nSensing something was not right, the family then refused to pay the second instalment and instead contacted their bank, which has since started an investigation.  \nSian said the scammer \"absolutely impersonated\" her mutual friend, adding that people should be careful not to do \"unwise things in the heat of the moment\" because \"once that money's sent it can't be retrieved\".\n\"It's just \u00a3250 that's literally gone to waste,\" she added. \n\"We're out of pocket and still haven't got any tickets.\"\nSian added that, as a seasoned ticket buyer, she thought she was \"quite savvy online\" but has chosen to share her experience in an effort to prevent it from happening to others.\nAlso, last month saw 24-year old Indigo Jones from Swansea contacted by friends asking if she was still selling her Taylor Swift tickets.\nShe quickly realised her social media accounts had been hacked and her profiles used by scammers to advertise tickets that didn't exist.\n\"I feel so so guilty, especially because there's nothing I can do about it other than to try raising awareness about it,\" she said. \nIndigo added that, while some of her friends were contacted by a hacker posing as her, nobody that she knows of has lost money or been defrauded as a result.\n\"Personally I think this is something I would have fallen for as well, because it did look so real,\" she said.\nEmily Seymour, a consumer expert at Which?, described ticket scams such as these as \"really common\".\nShe added that fraudsters target people \"desperate\" to see big shows who are \"under pressure to make a quick purchase\".\nHer advice is to \"take a moment\" before rushing into buying anything and to check that you are sending your money to a legitimate person.\nIf you are worried you have been victim to an online scam, she suggests contacting your bank to report the fraud as soon as possible and discuss the protections they may provide.\n\"You can also contact Action Fraud or the police in terms of getting that money back,\" she added.\n\"Unfortunately, if you've made a bank transfer, directly paying from your account into somebody else's, it's a bit more difficult to get your money back.\n\"We'd really recommend you don't use that method of payment.\"\nHave you been scammed when buying Taylor Swift tickets?

    "A report suggesting that hundreds of thousands of dementia patients in England face missing out on revolutionary new drugs because of the \"limited\" diagnostic capacity of the NHS is the lead in the Guardian. \nIt says that two \"ground-breaking\" drugs could get the green light to be available on the NHS within weeks. But the paper says it has seen analysis - produced by experts from organisations including Alzheimer's Research UK - which says the NHS lacks the capacity to identify those who may be eligible in time and that the effectiveness of the drugs relies on a prompt and early diagnosis of patients. \nFears that US presidential candidate Donald Trump may \"meddle\" in the UK's election campaign make the front of the i. The former US national security advisor John Bolton has told the paper that it's \"entirely possible\" Mr Trump would not care about the conventions of not interfering. This week it says Donald Trump hailed Nigel Farage, who is the honorary president of Reform UK, as a \"prophetic leader\" and said he awaited his \"next move\". \nBut the paper quotes the former Foreign Office minister Sir David Lidington as saying that a Trump intervention would \"probably be bad news for whoever he supported, as opinion polls show he is deeply unpopular in the UK\".\nThe Times says a vote by NHS consultants to back a pay agreement in England puts \"pressure\" on junior doctors to do the same. Some senior doctors will now get a pay-rise of 19%. The paper says the agreement has added to \"frustration\" in government and the NHS that junior doctors have been less willing to talk about accepting any deal that does not meet their demand for a 35% rise. It reports that ministers are now pressing the juniors' leaders to resume talks.\nThe Mail's front page reveals that civil servants at the Office for National Statistics are planning to strike after being asked to return to the office for two days a week. The paper says staff have worked at home since the start of lockdown and want to keep the option of doing so full-time. But it says ministers are keen to have people back at their desks because of fears that working from home has reduced productivity and increased waiting times for services. \nA number of the front pages carry photos of the actors Sacha Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher who have announced they filed for divorce at the end of last year after nearly 14 years of marriage. The  Sun reports that it comes days after the actress Rebel Wilson said some scenes in 2016 film Grimsby made her feel like she was being \"sexually harassed\". His spokesmen vehemently denied any impropriety, saying her description of shooting the film is \"demonstrably false\".\nThe Times investigates the growing trend of cat owners taking their pets out and about on leads and harnesses. It says the so-called \"adventure cat\" movement has taken hold on social media, with people posting pictures of their feline friends going hiking and even paddle-boarding - and Facebook groups sharing tips on dog-free areas for walks in inner city parks. But it carries a warning from the animal welfare charity, the RSPCA, which says the experience may not be right for every pet as many cats like \"a sense of control\".",
    "A retired rabbi has agreed to return \u00a32.35m to two charities after he failed to distribute the money over a number of years.\nBarry Marcus MBE was found to be holding the funds in personal accounts, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said.\nHis accounts were frozen after an NCA investigation proved the money had not been used to fund the charitable causes for which it was intended.\nThe 74-year-old was the rabbi at the Central London Synagogue until 2018. \nHe received an MBE in the 2015 New Year's Honours list for his work on Holocaust education. \nThe funds were received from Dalaid, an organisation that aims to relieve poverty and advance Jewish education, and the Schwarzschild Foundation, which aims to provide education and the relief of poverty for women and girls in the orthodox Jewish faith. \nBoth charities said they were unaware that the funds had not been distributed, the NCA said.\nNo criminal charges have been brought against Mr Marcus.\nThe NCA began investigating in October 2022 after the retired rabbi received more than \u00a31m between January and September of that year, the bulk of which had originated from the charities.\nHe transferred a substantial proportion of the money to his other UK accounts and accounts overseas and the NCA's initial inquiries could not establish a legitimate explanation for the payments. \nBetween November 2022 and March 2023 the NCA applied for four account-freezing orders over funds totalling \u00a31,183,072 held by Mr Marcus.\nHe maintained that he had distributed a substantial amount of money in accordance with the charity's intentions. But the NCA said Mr Marcus was unable to provide satisfactory documentation to substantiate this.\nOn 31 January this year, the retired rabbi formally agreed to return more than \u00a32m to the charities, almost double the funds identified and frozen in the UK. \nOn 12 March Westminster Magistrates' Court varied the four account-freezing orders to allow the frozen funds to be returned to the two charities.\nIn June 2023 the Charity Commission opened inquiries into the operation and governance of both charities. \nThese inquiries continue and the Charity Commission is ensuring that funds returned to the charities are properly applied. \nTim Quarrelle, NCA branch commander for asset denial, called it a \"fantastic result\".\n\"It follows a challenging and complex NCA investigation that ran over 18 months, showing the commitment of our officers to pursue every line of inquiry,\" he said.\n\"We are particularly grateful to our colleagues at the Charity Commission who are investigating issues relating to these charities in parallel.\"\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Critics are split over Netflix TV drama Ripley, based on Patricia Highsmith's bestselling thriller novels, which stars Andrew Scott as the fraudster.\nThe Guardian's Lucy Mangan called the actor \"absolutely spellbinding\", giving the show five stars.\nBut Variety's Amaride Tinubu said he was \"utterly charmless\" in the role.\nSet in 1960s New York, Scott plays the ruthless Tom Ripley, sent to Italy by a shipping magnate to convince his son to return home to the family business. \nThere have already been several adaptations of Highsmith's five books, including the Oscar-nominated 1999 film The Talented Mr Ripley, starring Matt Damon as Ripley, Jude Law as wealthy son Dickie Greenleaf and Gwyneth Paltrow as his girlfriend Marge.\nIn the new version, Dakota Fanning plays Marge and Johnny Flynn stars as Dickie.\nMangan said the latest version was a \"scintillating and noirish adaptation\", saying Scott had his \"every ounce of his talent, ineffable charm and lightly reptilian hotness on display\".\nShe added: \"Fans of the book and what has come to be seen - until, possibly, now - as the definitive screen version of it, Anthony Minghella's The Talented Mr Ripley, will know the plot. But its fresh execution is quite something.\n\"Malevolence bleeds into everything. Every moment of beauty ultimately ends up poisoned. It's wonderful.\"\nTinubu, by contrast, said of the show: \"Twisted and deeply disturbing, this Ripley feels more sinister and stilted than its predecessors, making the show arduous rather than enticing.\"\nShe added: \"Ripley stumbles in part because Tom is void of seduction and likability.\n\"The series has none of the homoeroticism of Minghella's film, which is disappointing because Scott's sensuality has radiated off the screen in other roles.\"\nThe Independent's Adam White said Scott was \"all wrong\" for the role, but that the series was an \"otherwise decent adaptation\", giving it three stars. \n\"Where Highsmith envisaged Ripley as an eerily calm social climber, who is charming and naive when he's not beating people around the head with the oar of a boat, Scott plays him as more of an overt ghoul - someone oozing sociopathic menace in the corners of fancy ballrooms,\" he wrote.\nComparing the series with previous adaptations, he added: \"Ripley isn't at all the disaster it could have been, primarily because its source material is so strong that you'd have to be incredibly dense to screw it up too badly. \n\"But it's haunted by the spirit of past adaptations, unable to wrestle free from the shackles of earlier perfection.\"\nHowever, in the Times, Carole Midgley called the show \"a Hitchcockian work of art\" in \"unrelenting monochrome\".\nShe praised its lead actor, saying: \"Scott, as you would expect, is outstanding - mesmeric as the polite, clever but ruthless psychopath.\"\nMidgley, who gave the show four stars, also said modern viewers \"may make comparisons with Saltburn, the upstart interloper running rings around the wealthy\".\nThe series is written and directed by Steven Zaillian, who won a screenwriting Oscar for Schindler's List and was nominated for films including The Irishman and Gangs of New York. \nHollywood Reporter's Daniel Fienberg broadly praised the show but said the \"elephant in the room\" was Scottt's age.\n\"At 47, Andrew Scott is too old for the fledgling sociopath that Tom Ripley is supposed to be in the first of Highsmith's novels in the series. He's the right age for later Ripley adventures.\"\nBut he added: \"Scott blends Damon's close-to-the-bone fragility and Alain Delon's simmering impenetrability [in 1960's Purple Noon] in making this uncertain Tom Ripley his own. \n\"He's unsteady and forgettable one moment and suave and canny the next, completely believable navigating between the two.\"\nFienberg also said the series was worthy of further instalments. \"If the streamer treats Ripley as a drama instead of a limited series, it's the sort of smart and meticulously produced literary adaptation - think TV for grownups in a Queen's Gambit or The Crown vein - that's worthy of across-the-board award consideration.\"\nEmpire magazine's John Nugent gave the show four stars, saying: \"Andrew Scott - who only last year was so extraordinarily humane and vulnerable in All Of Us Strangers - offers a markedly different Ripley than any we're used to: gone is the smoothness of Delon or the boyish charm of Damon. \n\"His Ripley, an established grifter from the start, is cold-blooded... the psychopathy immediately on the surface.\"\nNugent called the show \"a baroque, beautifully crafted vision\", adding: \"Inevitably, this is a less obviously inviting take on this tale... But it is rare to find television this genuinely ambitious or finely tuned.\" \nVulture's Roxana Hadadi was also full of praise for the show, saying: \"Andrew Scott's phenomenal take on Patricia Highsmith's con man anchors a deliciously mean adaptation.\"\nShe added: \"There's an unapologetic cunning at the heart of this series, and a mercurial spirit that's as slippery as blood on ",
    "Passengers at Northern Ireland airports may continue to face limits on the amount of liquid they can carry in hand luggage this summer.\nBelfast City and Belfast International airports could not confirm if they will meet the 1 June deadline to install scanners to end the 100ml liquid limit.\nThe deadline has already been extended for Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester.\nThe main Northern Ireland airports have advised passengers to prepare for security as normal.\nBelfast International said scanners would be in place this summer while Belfast City Airport said the move would be implemented at the \"earliest opportunity\". \nThe rules requiring liquids to be taken through security, in containers of 100ml or less in a clear plastic bag, were introduced in 2006 after a plot to bomb a transatlantic flight was foiled.\nThe new scanners use CT X-ray technology to provide 3D images so items can be left inside bags and liquids up to two litres will be permitted. \nThey are already used in some other countries including the US, although ministers claim the UK is the first in the world to attempt such a wide-scale roll-out.\nAirports were originally told to bring in new scanners by 2022, before the deadline was moved to 1 June this year. \nProblems cited by airports include supply chain issues and the need for major construction to be carried out in order to have the scanners installed. \nThe X-ray machines, similar to CT scanners used in hospitals, are very heavy and, in some instances, floors will need to be reinforced. \nA spokesperson for Belfast International Airport said phase one of a \u00a3100m investment programme was  \"currently under way\" with the construction of a new security building adjacent to the current terminal building. \n\"This ultra-modern \u00a325m facility will transform the passenger security experience by implementing the required Next Generation Security screening equipment meaning passengers will no longer have to remove liquids or electronics from their luggage,\" they added. \nThe spokesperson said the new building would be operational by this summer.\n\"As we are building an entirely new facility we plan to phase passengers through the new facility over the busy summer peak,\" the spokesperson continued.\n\"At this time passengers should still come to the airport prepared to follow the 100ml liquids rule for hand luggage.\"\nA spokesperson for Belfast City Airport said preparations were at an \"advanced stage\" and they were \"aiming for implementation at the earliest opportunity\".  \nThey also advised passengers to \"prepare for security as normal\".\nThe City of Derry Airport has also been approached for comment.

    "The sudden decision by McDonald's to take over ownership of its branches in Israel has thrust the franchise company Alonyal and its chief executive Omri Padan into the spotlight.\nMcDonald's will buy back all of its Israeli restaurants after global sales slumped due to a boycott of the brand over its perceived support for Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza.\nThe fast-food giant uses a franchise system which means that individual operators are licensed to run outlets and employ staff. But the broader company came in for criticism after Mr Padan offered free meals to Israeli forces around the start of the Israel-Gaza war on 7 October.\nA boycott was sparked after Muslim-majority countries such as Kuwait, Malaysia and Pakistan issued statements distancing themselves from the firm for what they saw as support of Israel.\nMr Padan, however, is not new to controversy related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the 30 years the businessman has been operating restaurants for McDonald's in Israel, he has been at the centre of a number of disputes.\nIn 2013, the Israeli businessman angered Israel's settler movement when he refused calls to open a branch of the fast-food chain in the settlement of Ariel in the occupied West Bank. Mr Padan's company Alonyal was asked to set up a restaurant in a shopping centre but declined, saying the firm had a policy of staying out of the occupied territories. \nAt the time, the firm said the decision had not been co-ordinated with McDonald's headquarters in the US.\nIsrael has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land the Palestinians want as part of a future state - in the 1967 Middle East war.\nThe vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.\nMr Padan is one of the founders of the group Peace Now, which opposes all settlements and views them as obstacles to peace. Peace Now says he is no longer a member of the group, which was founded in 1978. \nA leader of the Yesha Council, the settlers' umbrella organisation, said at the time that McDonald's had gone from being a for-profit company to one with an \"anti-Israeli political agenda\".\nAlonyal's decision resurfaced in 2019 when McDonald's won a tender to run a restaurant and hot dog stand at Israel's Ben-Gurion Airport. \nIn response, several letters of protest were sent by settlement leaders in the West Bank that called on the finance and transportation ministries, as well as the Israel airport authority, to block the move. Protests were also held outside the fast-food chain's restaurants in Tel Aviv.\nAnd on Thursday, it was abruptly announced that Alonyal would sell the sprawling franchise back to the US food giant.\nThe terms of the deal were not disclosed by McDonald's, although a reputation management expert, who has worked on behalf a number of large companies but did not want to speak on the record, said that those outraged by the decision to offer free meals to Israeli forces may be \"angry that this deal makes Mr Padan possibly a very rich man\".\nThey might be pleased though, about the effect the boycott has had. \nMr Padan's departure comes after McDonald's said that the Israel-Gaza conflict had \"meaningfully impacted\" performance in some overseas markets in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nFor the unit that includes the Middle East, China and India, sales growth stood at 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2023 - far below market expectations.\nAt the start of the year, McDonald's chief executive Chris Kempczinski blamed the backlash on \"misinformation\".\nThe boycott was also described as \"disheartening and ill-founded\" by the firm, which relies on thousands of independent businesses to own and operate most of its more than 40,000 stores around the world. About 5% are located in the Middle East.\nThe brand management expert said: \"I get it. They are buying back the franchises to regain control but I'm not sure they have.\"\nThey also questioned where the company might draw a line: \"Does this mean [McDonald's] will now need to act and offer deals in other areas where reputational damage has been caused?\"\nOn Thursday, McDonald's said that it \"remains committed to the Israeli market and to ensuring a positive employee and customer experience in the market going forward.\" \nIt also thanked Alonyal for building the brand in Israel, while Mr Padan said: \"We are encouraged by what the future holds.\"\nBBC News did not receive further comment from Mr Padan or Alonyal through McDonald's.",
    "Care workers in three Scottish council areas have started a strike in a dispute over equal pay that unions claim could bankrupt local authorities.\nThe row concerns whether the pay in jobs mostly done by women is equivalent to the pay in jobs deemed to be of equal value which are mostly done by men.\nThe GMB union warned that councillors \"have their heads in the sand\" over the matter, and that if it is not resolved soon then there will be a \"disastrous\" impact on communities. \nHome care workers will begin four days of action in Falkirk, with strikes planned for care staff in West Dunbartonshire and Renfrewshire next week.\nThe issue regarding equal pay in councils has been running for several years.\nSome councils, including Glasgow, are in the process of settling claims that run into hundreds of millions of pounds.\nHowever, the GMB say other councils are not acting quickly enough, amongst fears the cost of settling the claims could lead to more cuts in services.\nLouise Gilmour, GMB Scotland secretary, has written to First Minister Humza Yousaf urging him to support the creation of a new specialist body to decide on equal pay claims across the country.\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \u201cCouncils are responsible for meeting their legal obligations to their employees, including on equal pay.\n\u201cIn the face of a profoundly challenging financial situation, the Scottish government is making available record funding of more than \u00a314bn to councils in 2024-25 \u2013 a real-terms increase of 2.5% compared with the previous year.\u201d\nThe GMB's Louise Gilmour claimed that councils were \"approaching equal pay claims like the Titanic approaching the iceberg.\"\nShe added: \"The scale of these claims are unimaginable for local authorities already being forced to cut services.\n\u201cWomen who have been underpaid for far too long will still win these claims, however, and, unless that process is properly managed now, the impact on our councils and the communities they serve could be disastrous.\u201d\nThe union has claimed that some workers in Falkirk are only paid \u00a312.70 an hour and that the council rejected the union's appeal against a refusal to upgrade their jobs. \nFalkirk Health and Social Care Partnership stated they have communicated directly with people who may be affected.\nThey told BBC Scotland News that their Care and Support at Home service will \"operate on a reduced capacity\" during the strike.\nA spokesperson added: \"Falkirk Council is committed to upholding equal pay and continues to engage with GMB colleagues to resolve this matter and minimise disruption for those in need of our care and support at home services\u201d.\nKatherine Crawford, the chief executive of charity Age Scotland, said the impact of the GMB action could be substantial.\nShe stated:  \"We\u2019re sure that the decision to strike was not taken lightly as the impact on those who rely on the support of carers could be substantial.\n\"It\u2019s important that older people in this position have their needs met and we would urge the health and social care partnerships to ensure robust temporary care measures are in place and continue in urgent and meaningful discussions with the union to resolve this matter.\u201d\nWorkers in West Dunbartonshire will strike on 10 April and 11 April, while Renfrewshire workers will walk out on 9 April and 10 April.

    "Late on Thursday night, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) convened a meeting for a group of international journalists at the defence ministry building in Tel Aviv. The IDF then set out for us the results of their initial inquiry into the killing of seven aid workers in Gaza.\nRetired Maj Gen Yoav Har-Even described how the IDF's drone operators mistook an aid worker carrying a bag for a gunman, and then targeted one of the World Central Kitchen vehicles with a missile.  \nThe IDF then described how two people escaped that vehicle and got into a second car, which was hit by another missile from a drone.\nThe military confirmed that there were survivors from the second explosion, who managed to get into the third vehicle - which was then also hit by a missile.  \nBy the end, all the aid workers were dead.\nThe IDF's investigation concluded that the army unit involved had believed the vehicles they were tracking from the sky had been taken over by Hamas gunmen, and that they were not aware of the coordination procedures put in place between the military and World Central Kitchen for that evening. \nIt also said they also did not know the cars belonged to the charity, and the three air strikes were in violation of the army's own procedures.\nThe evidence from the investigation has been passed to the Military Advocate General - the Israeli army's top legal authority - to determine if there has been any criminal conduct.\nIn addition, the army has sacked the major in charge of fire support. The brigade's chief of staff, a colonel, has also been sacked. The divisional commander, brigade commander and the general in charge of the IDF's Southern Command have been formally reprimanded.\nThe IDF sought to explain the context leading up to the fatal events of that evening.\nThe aid workers had been overseeing the distribution of food aid that had arrived on a ship from Cyprus and unloaded at a recently constructed jetty in the northern Gaza strip. Under coordination with the IDF, the World Central Kitchen team were transferring these supplies to a warehouse a few kilometres further south.  \nDuring this process, the IDF says their drone operators spotted a gunman riding on the roof of a large aid lorry that was being escorted by the WCK team. They played those of us at the briefing a somewhat blurry video - which has not been released to the public - showing a figure holding a gun, on top of the lorry. At one point the gun is fired, showing up clearly on the slowed-down black and white footage.  \nAt this stage the military contacts World Central Kitchen but they are in turn unable to reach the team on the ground - where phone communication is patchy and aid agencies say they are prohibited by the IDF from using radios.\nThe drone footage also appears to confirm that at night, the stickers on the roof of the World Central Kitchen vehicles, with the charity's logo, are not visible to the drone operator. \nThe military then tracks the convoy, including the aid lorry, to a warehouse. Then the convoy splits - the aid lorry remains in the warehouse and four SUV-type cars emerge. One of those vehicles heads north, and is then shown to contain gunmen, with weapons clearly visible from the drone footage, as they emerge next to another aid warehouse. The IDF say that these gunmen were not targeted, because of their proximity to an aid facility.\nMeanwhile, three remaining vehicles belonging to World Central Kitchen begin to head south.\nThe drone team, the army says, now working under the assumption that they are dealing with Hamas militants and not an aid convoy, had misidentified one of the aid workers as a gunman, and claimed to have seen them enter one of the three WCK cars.\nNo footage of this moment was provided, but the military investigation concluded that it was a \"misclassification... they saw that it's a rifle but at the end of the day it was a bag\".\nUnder the mistaken belief that one vehicle now contained a gunman, authorisation to fire a missile is sought, and granted by superior officers. At 23:09 the first vehicle is struck, two minutes later the second, and at 23:13 the third final, fatal strike is launched.\nThe military's conclusions are that three major failings occurred:",
    "A woman has been convicted of fraud after taking \u00a3386,000 from her elderly stepfather.\nGeraldine Skevington-Roberts, 69, from Mill Green, Turvey, close to Bedford, was found guilty of two charges of fraud by abuse of position.\nShe was said to have used her power of attorney over Donald Skevington's affairs to \"enrich herself\".\nThe woman, who has a stage four cancer diagnosis, was sentenced to two years in prison suspended for 12 months.\nJudge Ross Johnson told her: \"Serious offending of this nature ordinarily would merit immediate custody, given the breach of trust, age and vulnerability of the victim, but there are exceptionally strong personal mitigation features in the form of your medical health.\"\nProsecutor Andrew Price told Luton Crown Court Mr Skevington had been living in a care home and before he died, aged 94 in October 2021, the defendant's sister realised large amounts of money had gone, and contacted the police.\nMr Price said the defendant cashed in \u00a3143,000 of the man's shares and made \u00a3243,000 from bank transfers.\n\"It is suspected money was moved overseas for a property, which is corroborated by the defendant opening a bank account in Slovakia,\" Mr Price said.\nMoney was also spent on Amazon, travel, health and beauty. Finance with BMW had been cleared and a large amount went to a debt recovery company, he said.\nThere were also payments for gym membership and purchases at TK Maxx.\nOn 7 March 2019, when Mr Skevington's assets were dissipated, the defendant signed a disclaimer meaning she no longer had legal power of attorney - a position she had held since October 2017.\nSkevington-Roberts told the jury she felt \"sad and betrayed\" when the police were contacted by her sister.\n\"It came out of the blue. I did not know why my sister had done this to me,\" she said.\nShe claimed that Mr Skevington said he wanted her to have the money.\nDefence barrister David Walbank KC said, that when she was arrested, the bulk of the money was still sitting in her accounts.\n\"There was no evidence she was to grab it all for herself and leave him penniless,\" he said. \"She was continuing to spend the money on his behalf.\"\nEarlier this week, the judge ruled Skevington-Roberts had no case to answer on a charge that she abused her position to buy Mr Skevington's home - Todsbrook House in Turvey.\nHe already said he would pass a suspended jail sentence because of her \"exceptional health issues\".\nMr Price said there would be a confiscation hearing at a later date.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "On Friday morning, New Yorkers were all asking each other the same question: \"Did you feel that?\"\n\"Did you feel that?\" Medhi Mammadov's co-workers asked each other as their office on the 27th floor of the iconic Woolworth Building began to shake.\n\"Did you feel that?\" Julie Hendricks-Atkins' colleagues chirped from their cubicles in Lower Manhattan.\n\"DID ANYONE FEEL THAT?\" a resident of the Greenpoint neighbourhood in Brooklyn exclaimed as he burst out of his brownstone. \n\"What's going on!\" A woman across the street shouted back.\n\"There was an earthquake!\" he declared.\nThe Brooklynite's assessment was correct: at 10:23 local time, New York City and other parts of the north-east had experienced a mild 4.8 magnitude earthquake, originating near Lebanon, New Jersey.\nThe tremor was strong enough to be felt, but not powerful enough to cause serious harm. \nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul reported \"no life-threatening situations,\" and damage appeared relatively minimal - a few cracks in the sidewalk in New Jersey, and some items that fell off shelves and smashed.\nA residential block in in Newark, New Jersey evacuated homes that sustained structural damage, but there were no injuries reported.\nSome people were understandably jolted by the quake. New Yorkers said they could feel their buildings shake, perhaps not the most pleasant experience if you're perched in one of the city's many skyscrapers.\n\"It was really freaky,\" Danielle Guida, who was at a gym in Midtown Manhattan, told the BBC. \"People were definitely scared.\"\nRazia Sultana, a city employee, said she and her colleagues grabbed their coats and were prepared to evacuate before the rumbling stopped.\nBut it takes quite a lot to rattle New Yorkers, and for many of them, not even an earthquake was enough. What was one more disturbance in a city that operates in a constant state of controlled chaos? The merciful lack of damage gave them free range to make light of the quake, or ignore it altogether.\nMs Hendricks-Atkins said that at first she mistook the shaking for the constant thrum of construction taking place outside her office.\n\"I didn't believe that it's an earthquake, because I wasn't expecting an earthquake in New York!\" Mr Mammadov said as he took an unflustered stroll past City Hall.\nThe BBC asked a New York City schoolteacher, who did not want to be named, how her young class reacted to the quake.\n\"They thought it was a ghost,\" she texted back.\nBy lunchtime, New Yorkers seemed to forget about it. Riders on the subway completely ignored the shrill chime of the emergency alerts that authorities pushed to their cell phones.\nOfficials have warned New Yorkers to be mindful of aftershocks, which are common following an initial earthquake. When they did rumble in, most people were nonchalant. \nA trio of subway workers shared a laugh deep under Brooklyn, with two conductors shouting across the platform at each other that they had felt \"nothin.\"\nCharles Walter, the third employee, joked that he thought the earthquake was his stomach rumbling.\nX, formerly known as Twitter, was, predictably, a scene. \n\"I AM FINE\" the Empire State Building declared, shortly after the rattling subsided. \n\"Earthquake, or vibe shift?\" one New York Times reporter inquired.\nThe posts were not all fun and games, though.\nIn an ominous message, conservative congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia warned that, \"God is sending America strong signs to tell us to repent. Earthquakes and eclipses and many more things to come.\"\nShe did not specify what exactly America did wrong.\nBack on the picturesque block in Greenpoint, the Brooklyn resident continued to ask each of his neighbours, who had all poked their heads out of their brownstones like a pack of urban meerkats, if they had felt the quake.\nThe man then turned to the BBC and asked if I had felt the jolt.\nYour correspondent, who was standing on the pavement during the memorable event, had felt nothing. \nPhil McCausland contributed to this report.",
    "Senior doctors in England have ended their pay dispute with the government.\nConsultants belonging to two major trade unions have backed a fresh pay deal.\nIt means some will receive a pay increase of nearly 20% for the financial year 2023-24. \nIt follows four strikes by consultants in recent months. However, junior doctors in England remain in dispute with ministers over pay, and have a fresh mandate to strike.\nJunior doctors and consultants are among several groups of health workers who have been taking industrial action at various points since 2022.\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) and the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) said 83% of members voted to back the pay offer, which was made last month.\nIt was the second time a pay offer had been put to members of the BMA. The last one, made in early December, was narrowly voted against.\nConsultants got a 6% pay rise in April 2023 and were then offered an extra sum worth nearly 5% on average at the end of last year.\nBut the amount extra individual consultants got varied considerably from nothing to an extra 12.8%.\nThe new offer included an extra 2.85% for those between four and seven years into their consultant careers - the group that was getting the smallest rise under the previous offer.\nThis pay rise will be backdated to March 2024, which means some senior doctors will see their pay increase by nearly 20%.\nOn top of this, consultants will be eligible for a separate pay rise for the 2024-25 financial year, which is just starting.\nThe offer also includes a commitment to reform the doctors' pay review body to take into account earnings over time and wages in other countries. \nDr Vishal Sharma, BMA consultants committee chair, said: \"We've reached this point not just through our tough negotiations with the Government, but thanks to the resolve of consultants, who took the difficult decision to strike, and did so safely and effectively, on multiple occasions, sending a clear message that they would not back down.\"\nHealth and Social Care Secretary Victoria Atkins said she was \"pleased\" the offer had been accepted.\n\"Consultants will now be able to focus on providing the highest quality care for patients and we can consolidate our progress on waiting lists - which have fallen for the past four months,\" she said.\nNurses and other health workers ended their strike action last year after receiving a 5% rise and a one-off payment of \u00a31,655.\nHowever, the government and BMA remain a long way from solving the junior doctors' pay dispute. \nMembers of the BMA in England want a 35% pay increase over the coming years.\nThey have a fresh six-month strike mandate after talks collapsed late last year. However, no new strike dates have been announced yet.\nIn Wales, junior doctors remain in dispute with their government over pay and have taken strike action. Consultants and specialty and specialist (SAS) doctors have voted to strike over pay for 48 hours later this month.  \nJunior doctors in Northern Ireland recently went on strike over pay, while consultants are to be balloted for industrial action.",
    "Dev Patel is done with playing goofy characters and comedy sidekicks.\nIn his new film Monkey Man - which he starred in, directed and produced himself - Dev has created a British Asian action hero. \nBut he doesn't want it compared to James Bond.\n\"As a huge fan of the genre, I was so frustrated not to be represented,\" the actor, best known for his roles in Lion and Slumdog Millionaire, tells BBC Asian Network's Nikita Kanda.\nFrom Hollywood to Bollywood, via Hong Kong, he says action cinema has skipped characters he could relate to. \n\"There was nothing in between that represented my existence, my identity, my duality of culture,\" says Dev, who has Gujarati Indian heritage and grew up in London. \n\"I just wanted to infuse all of the things that I ran away from as a child.\"\nEnter Monkey Man, the action thriller which follows an anonymous protagonist dubbed 'Kid', as he hunts down a group responsible for his mother's death. \nDev's been working on the script for 12 years - \"not that I'm counting,\" he says, adding that he became \"a man possessed\" as it took over his life.\nHe describes production as a \"Trojan horse\" - on the surface, it's an action film but \"it has a lot to say\".\n\"It's got a real political, social resonance. It's a revenge film about faith and how faith can be the most elegant weapon.\"\nOne thing it's not trying to be is James Bond.\n\"I don't want to be James Bond - I want to be Monkey Man,\" Dev says.\nSince Daniel Craig retired his Bond in 2021, there's been endless speculation about who might replace him with some saying it's time for the British spy to be played by a non-white actor.\nBut Dev says with Monkey Man, he \"wanted to create our own stories and our own fresh world\".\n\"I wanted to broaden our horizons so we're not fighting over the same role.\"\nHe hopes as well that seeing a British Asian in an action film will open the gate for a wider diversity in roles.\n\"When I started writing this, the only roles I was getting offered were to be the comedy sidekick or the guy that hacks the [computer] mainframe for the big, cool guy,\" says Dev.\nHe started his career playing the hapless Anwar in Channel 4's teen drama Skins, and then starred in the 2008 film Slumdog Millionaire.\nIt wasn't until his 2016 role as Saroo in Lion, for which he received an Oscar nomination, that he says he felt he could move away from those stereotypes.\n\"That film was the first time I really got to be soulful on camera,\" he says.\n\"It really changed my career and made people see me differently than that goofy, awkward dude in Slumdog [Millionaire] and Skins.\"\nMonkey Man was Dev's directorial debut and the first time he's been behind the camera as well as in front of it.\n\"It was a very chaotic process,\" he says, adding he'd only originally planned to be the lead actor.\n\"But I just wanted to make a film that young 14-year-old Dev would be proud and excited to see,\" he says.\n\"And we kind of stopped at nothing to do it.\"\nThat's not an exaggeration, as filming was disrupted by the pandemic and he says he \"broke my hand in the first action scene\".\n\"Everything that could have possibly gone wrong, went wrong for me.\"\nIt doesn't seem to have done too much damage as Monkey Man has picked up a string of positive reviews as well as a standing ovation at an early SXSW screening ahead of its UK release on Friday. \n\"I was sick and tired of seeing the same faces and the same franchises rehashed,\" Dev says. \n\"This is original, this is our culture, this is vibrant and I hope people go out and watch it and support it.\"\nWatch Dev's full interview with Nikita Kanda on YouTube or listen back on BBC Sounds. \nListen to Ankur Desai's show on BBC Asian Network live from 15:00-18:00 Monday to Thursday - or listen back here.",
    "A new Muslim from Leeds said people had welcomed her into their families during the month of Ramadan.\nChloe Sparks, 27, converted to Islam last year and has fasted from sunrise to sunset for the first time this Ramadan.\nHowever, Chloe said she started to feel \"a bit lonely\" after realising that her Muslim friends were spending the month surrounded by family and she was spending a lot of time alone.\nSheikh Bilal Brown from New Beginnings, a charity dedicated to working with converts, said Ramadan could be a difficult time for new Muslims and \"it's so important for converts to have a community around them during Ramadan\".\nThe holy month of Ramadan sees billions of Muslims worldwide refrain from eating and drinking during daylight hours for 30 days.\nThe month is seen as a time for reflection and increased worship.\nFor new Muslims like Ms Sparks, who are not only fasting for the first time but also fasting alone, the month can have its own challenges. \nShe said: \"It's only really when I heard people talk about their experiences of Ramadan, spending a lot of time with their families, extended family and friends, that it made me start to feel a bit lonely and realise I was on my own.\n\"As soon as I became Muslim I was so excited to give fasting a try but I was quite nervous and I told myself it's OK in the first few days to go easy on myself and have some water if I needed to.\"\nHowever, Ms Sparks said that one day before Ramadan started she changed her mind and she decided to \"dive right in\" and fast the full 30 days. \n\"It's been such an amazing experience,\" she said, praising how her community rallied around her.\nShe said: \"There's a lot of community support for new Muslims here in Leeds, there's lots of organisations and I've honestly never felt so welcome or supported.\n\"Most of my support comes from the really amazing friends I've made... people welcome you in like you're their own family.\"\nSheikh Brown, 44, co-founded New Beginnings in 2020 after realising that there was a lack of support for people who had recently converted to Islam. \nRecalling his own experience, as a convert to Islam himself, Sheikh Brown said he was a bit lonely at first \"because you're Muslim on your own and you don't have a family with you to share the experience with\", but added he did have his friends for support.\nNew Beginnings offers converts education around the rules of Ramadan to help ease them into it, but it also provides them with an online community where they can connect with each other.\n \"Converting to Islam in itself is a very lonely experience, I don't think the Muslim community understands how lonely it can be,\" Sheikh Brown said.\nHalifax-based food blogger and born Muslim Arooj Jamil began volunteering with New Beginnings in 2022 after the group asked her to cater an event.\nShe said that initially she did not know much about the challenges converts faced when they first came to Islam.\n\"I've not really had much exposure to converts or people discovering Islam for the first time,\" she said.\n\"As a born Muslim I've been surrounded by the South Asian Muslim community and always felt like I was part of something bigger... whereas for a convert their journey can be quite isolating and challenges that wouldn't even cross my mind they face on a daily basis.\"\nShe said that born Muslims like herself had a responsibility to reach out to newer members of the religion and help ease their loneliness, especially during Ramadan. \n\"A lot of new Muslims don't have anybody to break their fasts with... it's important we open our homes up and extend that invite without judgement.\"\nThis year she led a collaboration with Yorkshire-based restaurant MyLahore, which ran giveaways, distributed restaurant vouchers and sponsored the end-of-year Eid party.\nAsghar Ali, chief executive of the MyLahore restaurant chain, said he loved the work New Beginnings did for new Muslims during Ramadan, and that when he first started the business he vowed to never say no when an organisation reached out and asked for support.\n\"Ramadan is such a blessed month anyway and there is huge reward, so the fact that we're even given that opportunity, you know, we've grasped it,\" he said.\n\"Just the fact that we're opening the fast for so many different people is an amazing thing and opportunity to be involved with.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

    "Staff at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) have voted to strike in protest at plans requiring them to be in the office for at least 40% of the working week. \nIn a ballot of PCS trade union members, more than 70% of voted in favour of strike action with a turnout of 50%.\nAn ONS spokesperson said its plans were \"in the best interests of the ONS and all our colleagues\".\nBut PCS boss Fran Heathcote accused the ONS of \"undermining\" staff's goodwill.\nShe said the new working plans were being implemented in a \"heavy-handed way, heedless of the consequences\".\nShe urged the ONS, which collects and analyses data about the UK, to \"immediately pause implementation of the policy and talk to us about reaching a sensible resolution of this issue, which does not carelessly disadvantage staff\".\nThe proportion of people working from home increased dramatically when the Covid pandemic hit, but the government has more recently made clear its desire to see more civil servants coming into the office.\nEarlier this year, Cabinet Office minister Baroness Neville Rolfe said there were \"clear benefits from face-to-face, workplace-based collaborative working\".\nLast year Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the office should be the \"default\" location for workers and expressed the concern about a \"loss of creativity\" if remote working practices were made permanent. \nCurrent civil service guidance says most civil servants should spend at least 60% of their time in the office. \nIn November 2023, the ONS - which is a government organisation but independent of ministers - announced that from January its workers would have to spend a minimum of 20% of working hours in the workplace, rising to 40% from April.\nThe PCS union said this would mean \"considerable disruption, especially for staff with childcare and other caring arrangements\" and accused the ONS of refusing union requests to consider \"a more gradual and flexible transition\".\nIn the ballot, which ended this week, 73% voted in favour of strike action and 84% supported action short of a strike. Six hundred members took part in a the vote - half of those balloted.\nAn ONS spokesperson said: \"There are robust plans in place across the organisation to mitigate against disruption and maintain essential services should any industrial action take place.\"",

He's a friend, my heart goes out to him and I certainly don't hold any ill-will towards him. I want him to know that.\"\nOn Thursday, the former MP, who is gay, told the BBC he was first contacted via WhatsApp on the evening of 11 March.\nThe message was from a number he did not recognise from someone calling themselves Charlie who claimed to remember them from their time working in Parliament. \n\"The last part of that message was 'Westminster misses you\u2026' and that was basically something that friends usually do say anyway to make me feel better,\" he told BBC News.\n\"I was starting to feel bad actually. I was embarrassed thinking I'm speaking to someone who knows who I am and I'm trying desperately not to come across as rude.\"\nThe next message said: \"I've just become single so I'm hanging out with the Westminster gays.\"\nThe former MP explained he was in a relationship but further flirtatious messages followed.\nAfter \"Charlie\" sent an explicit image, the former MP blocked him.\nBut it was only after he read a story on the news website Politico that he realised he had been the subject of what appears to be a coordinated scam.\n\"My heart did start racing because I thought everything you're saying from the start, from the name of the individual, the familiarity, this is too close to be just a coincidence,\" the former MP told the BBC.\nBBC News has seen messages sent from the same number also from someone calling themselves \"Charlie\" to a political journalist.\nThese messages also talk about the recipient being \"missed\" around Westminster and asking whether the journalist is still single or not.\nConservative MP Bob Seely said he had \"great sympathy\" for Mr Wragg.\nHe told BBC Newsnight that the incident is \"not the first\", adding: \"I'm afraid this is part of a modern political life, whether it's honeytraps, cyber-attacks or phishing of some kind or other.\"\nA Parliamentary spokesperson said: \"Parliament takes security extremely seriously and works closely with government in response to such incidents. \n\"We provide members and staff with tailored advice, making them aware of security risks and how to manage their digital safety. We are encouraging anyone affected who has concerns to contact the Parliamentary Security Department.\"",
    "Prolonged wet weather has impacted farming across the south-west of England, with farmers saying \"they have never known anything like this\".\nArable farmers have been unable to plant spring crops and livestock farmers said they were short of feed.\nDavid Braine, BBC senior meteorologist, said the region had seen twice the normal amount of rain in March.\nDevon dairy farmer Robert Taverner said morale within the industry was at an \"all time low\".\nHe said his cows, which are usually out to pasture \"day and night\", had only been going out for three or four hours a day. \nAs a result, Mr Taverner, from Kennford, said extra winter food was required which could add \"an extra 1p\" on each litre of milk he produced. \nHe said: \"The winter's been incredibly wet this year and it's been month after month of really wet weather. \n\"Talking to other farmers they've never known a period like this and it's made the ground incredibly wet at capacity and it's meant that we haven't been able to graze our cows as we normally would.\"\nCarina Perkins, a senior analyst in retail and e-commerce in food supply chains, said supermarkets were \"going to do everything they can\" to keep prices down, but \"continued problems\" with the weather could result in price increases. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio Cornwall she said: \"We could see more imports, we could also see lower quality produce on the shelf. \n\"Supermarkets have already relaxed their specifications on vegetables so they could be slightly smaller and misshapen.\n\"It's been relentless.\"\nMr Taverner said: \"I think it's good that people are starting to realise that food is important and food security is important, but morale of farmers is really at an all time low and this weather caps it all.\n\"I know neighbours that have got arable, their corn didn't go in, their wheat and barley didn't go in at the right time or in good conditions in the autumn, they haven't been able to fertilise it properly in the spring and the crops are looking really poor.\n\"Lambing is happening now and that has been happening in really bad conditions. So the sheep are suffering and the lambs are suffering.\"\nFarmer Steve Penberthy, from Porthleven, in Cornwall, said the amount of lambs he had lost had doubled this year.\nHe said: \"We'd expect to lose about 10-15% as a normal figure during lambing. \n\"I think our losses this year, rough calculation, I don't really like to think about it too much, I think we're up to about 30% this year and that's mainly probably the weather.\"\nMr Penberthy said it was \"very difficult to bring lambs back\" once they had succumbed to hypothermia from being \"constantly cold, wet and covered in mud\".\nIn Cullompton, in Devon, arable farmer Richard Clarke said trying to harvest crops was \"a nightmare\".\nHe said: \"We should have a third of our crop planted for this coming season and it's just too wet.\n\"We're going to be in the middle of April in a minute and we've got a lot of planting to do for our spring crops. \n\"We haven't got our early crops in and we start lifting again in the beginning of July, we haven't even planted those crops yet, they should have been in in January.\"\nHowever, James Grigg, a farmer from Bideford who expected to lose 15% of his yield due to the weather, said the situation would \"come right\" in the end. \n\"It's not very nice being out there, the likes of us, we are generally at a stop. \n\"When the weather is like this you can't do nothing about it. You just have to grin and bear it, it will come right.\"\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram. Follow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Staff at one of Britain's biggest trade unions, the GMB, have called off a strike against their own management.\nLast month, staff members in the GMB's North East, Humber and Yorkshire region voted to take strike action from 8 April. \nBut with days to go, the walkout has been cancelled.\nA GMB spokesperson said the strike being called off was \"good news for staff and our members\". \nThe staff had claimed that insufficient action had been taken to implement recommendations of a report which had branded the union \"institutionally sexist\".\nThe union, the third biggest in the UK, had asked the lawyer Karon Monaghan KC to investigate allegations of sexual harassment and the wider culture in the organisation in 2020.\nFour years on, one employee in the region previously told BBC News: \"We were all promised after the Monaghan report that the horrendous culture of sexism and outright misogyny within GMB would be tackled, yet we've gone backwards.\n\"More and more of the staff are sharing their stories of harassment.\n\"We've therefore been left with no choice to ballot to take this action\"\nGMB staff had claimed a taskforce set up to carry out reforms had been disbanded, and alleged that disciplinary procedures were not being followed and their own Unite union representatives have been intimidated.\nSources have told BBC News that \"a hard bargain had been struck\" by the staff - who are represented by another union, Unite.\nThis has led to the potential return of Ms Monaghan to monitor progress and look again at the culture in the union.\nHer original 2020 report had called for a \"complete transformation\" in the union culture, which had been a \"hostile environment for women\" and was host to a \"bully-boy atmosphere\". \nIf Ms Monaghan is unavailable to re-examine progress, then she - rather than the union's management - will be able to nominate another independent figure.\nA staff working group will also monitor action taken to implement any outstanding recommendations from the original Monaghan report.\nWhen the current general secretary Gary Smith was elected to the top union post in 2021 he promised to implement the report in full.\nA GMB spokesperson told BBC News: \"All sides have approached the discussions positively, addressing a wide range of issues in good faith. \n\"There is full commitment to continuing this dialogue and working towards a better union together.\"",
    "Passengers at Northern Ireland airports may continue to face limits on the amount of liquid they can carry in hand luggage this summer.\nBelfast City and Belfast International airports could not confirm if they will meet the 1 June deadline to install scanners to end the 100ml liquid limit.\nThe deadline has already been extended for Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester.\nThe main Northern Ireland airports have advised passengers to prepare for security as normal.\nBelfast International said scanners would be in place this summer while Belfast City Airport said the move would be implemented at the \"earliest opportunity\". \nThe rules requiring liquids to be taken through security, in containers of 100ml or less in a clear plastic bag, were introduced in 2006 after a plot to bomb a transatlantic flight was foiled.\nThe new scanners use CT X-ray technology to provide 3D images so items can be left inside bags and liquids up to two litres will be permitted. \nThey are already used in some other countries including the US, although ministers claim the UK is the first in the world to attempt such a wide-scale roll-out.\nAirports were originally told to bring in new scanners by 2022, before the deadline was moved to 1 June this year. \nProblems cited by airports include supply chain issues and the need for major construction to be carried out in order to have the scanners installed. \nThe X-ray machines, similar to CT scanners used in hospitals, are very heavy and, in some instances, floors will need to be reinforced. \nA spokesperson for Belfast International Airport said phase one of a \u00a3100m investment programme was  \"currently under way\" with the construction of a new security building adjacent to the current terminal building. \n\"This ultra-modern \u00a325m facility will transform the passenger security experience by implementing the required Next Generation Security screening equipment meaning passengers will no longer have to remove liquids or electronics from their luggage,\" they added. \nThe spokesperson said the new building would be operational by this summer.\n\"As we are building an entirely new facility we plan to phase passengers through the new facility over the busy summer peak,\" the spokesperson continued.\n\"At this time passengers should still come to the airport prepared to follow the 100ml liquids rule for hand luggage.\"\nA spokesperson for Belfast City Airport said preparations were at an \"advanced stage\" and they were \"aiming for implementation at the earliest opportunity\".  \nThey also advised passengers to \"prepare for security as normal\".\nThe City of Derry Airport has also been approached for comment.

    "An Ethiopian bank has put up posters shaming customers it says have not returned money they gained during a technical glitch.\nNotices bearing their names and photos could be seen outside branches of the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) on Friday.\nThe bank says it has recovered almost three-quarters of the $14m (\u00a312m) it lost, its head said last week.\nHe warned that those keeping money that is not theirs will be prosecuted.\nLast month, an hours-long glitch allowed customers at the CBE, Ethiopia's largest commercial bank, to withdraw or transfer more than they had in their accounts.\nMost of the money was reportedly withdrawn by university students and 490,000 transactions were made before CBE realised there was a problem.\nOne student at Jimma University in western Ethiopia told the BBC's Amharic service: \"I know someone who bought a smart phone and a laptop and has no money at hand to return. \n\"There are some who bought internet packages for a year and others who paid off their debts.\"\nSince the CBE demanded the money be returned and threatened those who don't do so with arrest, thousands have voluntarily given back excess funds, the bank said.\nOutside a CBE branch in the capital, Addis Ababa, a poster displaying the images of 28 people reads: \"Those who did not return the money they inappropriately took from Commercial Bank of Ethiopia.\"\nThe identities of those who have allegedly kept the money are also displayed on the bank's website, accompanied by their bank account numbers.\nThe CBE uploaded the images to its site in four lists, which were compiled according to the amount of money the clients allegedly took.\nThe first list to be published was of clients said to have taken between $1,890 (\u00a31,500) and $5,300 (\u00a34,200).\nOn publishing these lists, the CBE said on its social media platforms that \"there are individuals who have not used repeated opportunities to return the money they took illegally.\" \nThe bank added that it was \"forced\" to release the individuals' identities after giving several warnings and extending deadlines for returning the money.\nIn an interview with the BBC's Newsday programme following the glitch, CBE boss Abe Sano said the bank was already in the process of reporting customers to the police.\n\"There is no way that they can escape because they are digital [transactions] and they are our customers. We know them. They are traceable and they are legally accountable for what they did,\" he said.\nA CBE employee told the BBC it was harder to find money transferred to other banks than to trace sums moved to another CBE account.\nMore than 38 million people hold accounts at the CBE, which was established 82 years ago.\nThe bank has never explained exactly what caused last month's glitch, but said it was not the result of a cyber-attack and that customers should not be worried as their personal accounts were intact.",
    "A charity withdrew a job offer to a Christian over concerns his views on homosexuality could affect vulnerable clients, a tribunal has heard.\nSocial worker Felix Ngole, 46, claims Leeds-based mental health charity Touchstone discriminated against him.\nAn employment tribunal has heard fears emerged over how his views could affect vulnerable people he might deal with.\nA Touchstone spokesperson said Mr Ngole could not give assurances he would meet all the job's needs.\nMr Ngole has claimed Touchstone Leeds discriminated against him directly and indirectly because of his religious beliefs when they refused him the job as a hospital discharge mental health support worker in Wakefield in 2022.\nHe has also claimed he was a victim of harassment. \nOn Friday, Kathryn Hart, Touchstone's director of people and culture, told the hearing in Leeds how Mr Ngole had out-performed all other candidates in his interview.\nHe was provisionally offered the job pending references, she added.\nBut Mrs Hart said when those references arrived they were brief and inadequate, prompting a colleague to search on the internet for Mr Ngole's name.\nThat search immediately disclosed news articles about how Mr Ngole had won a Court of Appeal case after Sheffield University tried to stop him completing his degree following social media posts he made about homosexuality and same-sex marriage being a sin.\nMrs Hart told the tribunal that immediately \"rang alarm bells\", because the role involved dealing with extremely vulnerable people who were being discharged from hospital after mental health problems, many of whom were LGBT.\nShe was asked by Michael Phillips, representing Mr Ngole, whether she thought the existence of the online news articles outlining his client's belief was enough to cause problems even if he never brought up the subject with service users.\nMrs Hart said many of the LGBT service users being discharged from hospital had suffered extensive rejection in their lives and were likely to research the background of those charged with supporting them.\nShe said it was possible that seeing the articles about Mr Ngole meant \"they could end up back in hospital\", adding that many clients in that situation were known to have suicidal thoughts.\nMrs Hart said Mr Ngole was invited back for a meeting in July 2022 to discuss whether his views and ethos aligned with those of Touchstone and whether he could fulfil the role.\nShe said Mr Ngole became hostile during the meeting, and \"he did not give any assurance he would be able to meet all the needs of the job\".\n\"That's why we withdrew the job offer,\" she explained.\nMrs Hart outlined concerns she had during the meeting about how Mr Ngole would work with LGBT service users, but also about his engagement with equality training within the organisation, which she said provided mental health services to 10,000 people across Yorkshire. \nShe told the tribunal she believed Mr Ngole's \"values and ethos were not aligned with the Touchstone's, which are anti-discriminatory\".\nIn a witness statement heard earlier this week by the tribunal, Mr Ngole said: \"As a Christian, I do not see any conflict in working with and for people from the LGBT community.\n\"That said, there is a distinction between respecting and loving the person and yet lovingly and respectfully disagreeing with their views and/or behaviours.\"\nMr Ngole has also denied claims vulnerable people may have killed themselves if he had been given the job, after Mr Phillips summarised part of an expert's report submitted by Touchstone as saying his employment by the charity \"may lead to the death of some service users\".\nThe Cameroon-born former asylum seeker is a grandfather-of-two who has also worked as a youth pastor, housing officer and teacher.\nThe tribunal has previously heard that Mr Ngole had been a Christian since the age of four and believed in the literal truth of the Bible.\nThe hearing continues.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

    "When Sian Williams was offered tickets to see Taylor Swift in concert, she jumped at the chance.\nBut within seconds of transferring \u00a3250, she knew she'd been scammed.\n\"It makes me angry because it was so realistic,\" said the mum-of-two from Gwynedd, who thought she was buying from a trustworthy mutual friend.\nConsumer watchdogs are warning others to beware of similarly sophisticated online cons.\nSian had promised her 18-year-old daughter Efa she would take her to see Swift's The Eras Tour this summer after finishing her A-level exams. \nAfter missing out on the official ticket sale in 2023 - Swift's show in Cardiff due to take place this June sold out in minutes - she was put in touch with someone who claimed to have four tickets to the US pop idol's Liverpool date.\n\"I didn't think anything of it because it was a friend of a friend,\" said Sian, from Blaenau Ffestiniog.\nThey asked for \u00a3500 for four tickets, providing screenshots of each and details about the seating arrangements.  \nBut Sian and Efa's bank account set-up meant they could only transfer a maximum of \u00a3250 at a time, which they began to do after sharing their details with the scammer via WhatsApp.\nSensing something was not right, the family then refused to pay the second instalment and instead contacted their bank, which has since started an investigation.  \nSian said the scammer \"absolutely impersonated\" her mutual friend, adding that people should be careful not to do \"unwise things in the heat of the moment\" because \"once that money's sent it can't be retrieved\".\n\"It's just \u00a3250 that's literally gone to waste,\" she added. \n\"We're out of pocket and still haven't got any tickets.\"\nSian added that, as a seasoned ticket buyer, she thought she was \"quite savvy online\" but has chosen to share her experience in an effort to prevent it from happening to others.\nAlso, last month saw 24-year old Indigo Jones from Swansea contacted by friends asking if she was still selling her Taylor Swift tickets.\nShe quickly realised her social media accounts had been hacked and her profiles used by scammers to advertise tickets that didn't exist.\n\"I feel so so guilty, especially because there's nothing I can do about it other than to try raising awareness about it,\" she said. \nIndigo added that, while some of her friends were contacted by a hacker posing as her, nobody that she knows of has lost money or been defrauded as a result.\n\"Personally I think this is something I would have fallen for as well, because it did look so real,\" she said.\nEmily Seymour, a consumer expert at Which?, described ticket scams such as these as \"really common\".\nShe added that fraudsters target people \"desperate\" to see big shows who are \"under pressure to make a quick purchase\".\nHer advice is to \"take a moment\" before rushing into buying anything and to check that you are sending your money to a legitimate person.\nIf you are worried you have been victim to an online scam, she suggests contacting your bank to report the fraud as soon as possible and discuss the protections they may provide.\n\"You can also contact Action Fraud or the police in terms of getting that money back,\" she added.\n\"Unfortunately, if you've made a bank transfer, directly paying from your account into somebody else's, it's a bit more difficult to get your money back.\n\"We'd really recommend you don't use that method of payment.\"\nHave you been scammed when buying Taylor Swift tickets?

    "There are renewed concerns over levels of violence in French schools after two young teenagers were the victims of attacks, one of them fatal.\nA 15-year-old boy named as Shamseddin died in hospital on Friday.\nThe news came a day after he was beaten by a group of youths near his school in Viry-Chatillon, in the southern Paris suburbs.\n\"This extreme violence is becoming commonplace,\" said the town mayor, Jean-Marie Vilain.\nMr Vilain told French media the boy was walking home after a music class at about 16:30 local time on Thursday when he was set upon by a group of youths.\nAccording to witnesses, he was punched and kicked by the attackers, who were wearing balaclavas.\nHe was taken to the Necker hospital, a top paediatric hospital in Paris, but doctors were unable to save his life.\nOne 17-year-old teenager has been arrested by French police in the Viry-Chatillon murder case, the local prosecutor announced later. Police are still looking for other assailants.\nOn Tuesday, in another incident in the southern city of Montpellier, a 14-year-old girl named as Samara was placed in an artificial coma after she was beaten by a group shortly after leaving school.\nThree adolescents - a girl and two boys of roughly the same age as Samara - have been arrested and admitted taking part in the attack, police said. Samara has since regained consciousness. \nThe girl's mother told French media that Samara had been bullied by another girl at the school because she refused to follow Islamic dress codes. \n\"Samara puts on a bit of make-up. And this other girl wears the headscarf. All the time, she kept calling her an unbeliever,\" she said on French television on Wednesday.\n\"My daughter dresses like a European. Every day there were insults. It was physically and psychologically unbearable.\"\nHowever, the prosecutor's office in its initial report on the attack made no mention of a religious connection, saying the background was an argument over photographs shared on Snapchat.\nAnd speaking Thursday evening on another French television channel, Samara's mother read out a statement accusing the far-right of trying to use the attack to their own advantage.\n\"My daughter is a practising pious Muslim. She fasts during Ramadan and prays five times a day. Please do not use us to sully the name of our religion,\" she said.  \nThe attacks have further heightened concerns about violence in schools,  against a background of gangs, cyber-bullying and pressure to conform to Islamic rules. \nLast week, the headteacher of a school in Paris resigned saying he feared for his life after receiving death threats for telling a girl to remove her head covering in accordance with French law.   \nIn the same week, several schools had to shut because of hoax bomb threats made by people claiming to be Islamic radicals. \nIn recent years, two teachers have been murdered by Islamist radicals.\nSamuel Paty was decapitated on the street in a Paris suburb in 2020, while Dominique Bernard was killed at his school in Arras in October last year. \nEarlier on Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron said schools needed to be \"shielded\" from \"uninhibited violence among our teenagers and sometimes among increasingly younger ones\".\nReacting to the two attacks, Marine Le Pen of the hard-right National Rally said: \"When will the government finally sit up and take the full measure of the savagery which is gnawing at our society?\"\nJean-Marie Vilain, the mayor of Viry-Chatillon, was in tears as he spoke to journalists of the death of Shamseddin, who - he said - left a mother and a younger sister with their lives in ruins.\n\"We have to teach our children that there is good and there is bad. And when you do something bad, you get punished.  And maybe we need to learn again how to punish,\" he said. ",

    "People visiting beaches this weekend are being warned to take extra care as wind gusts of up to 70mph (112km/h) are forecast on the Welsh coast. \nStorm Kathleen could bring large swells leading to \"unpredictable seas and challenging conditions\", the RNLI said. \nIt is urging people to stay \"well back\" from the water's edge. \nA yellow weather warning for wind is in place for all of Wales' coastal areas on Saturday.\nThe Met Office warning, in place from 08:00 BST to 22:00 on Saturday, said Storm Kathleen would bring \"very windy weather\" to western areas of the UK. \nThe forecaster warned that injuries and danger to life could occur from \"large waves and beach material being thrown onto sea fronts, coastal roads and properties\". \nMet Office meteorologist Greg Dewhurst said UK western coastal areas could see gusts of between 60 and 70mph. \nStorm Kathleen - the 11th named storm in eight months - was named by Met Eireann, the Irish met office, because more significant impacts are likely to be felt in the Republic of Ireland. It is only the second time in a UK storm season that the letter K has been reached in the alphabet. \nOn Friday, Snowdon Mountain Railway, which runs on Yr Wyddfa, or Snowdon, said all its services over the weekend had been cancelled due to Storm Kathleen.\nZip World Tower near Aberdare, Rhondda Cynon Taf, also announced it would be closed over the weekend due to poor weather. \nThe RNLI has urged those planning to visit the coast to \"take extra care\" and to only go to lifeguarded beaches if they plan to go into the water. \nIt said that people should not enter the water on a beach that is red-flagged, while beaches with no flags do not have lifeguards. \nThe weather conditions forecast for the weekend \"pose an increased risk to those visiting the coast\", said the RNLI's Chris Cousens.\nHe urged people not to enter the water alone, to let other people know of plans and to \"always carry a means for calling for help should you need it\". \n\"If you're walking on the coast be aware of your surroundings and stay well back from the water's edge. The weather conditions increase the likelihood of tidal surges that could sweep you out to sea,\" he said. ",
    "This was the Rolls-Royce of car crash interviews. A purring engine of privilege collided with a barrage of perfectly timed questions.\nIt used to be said that history is written by the winners. Now it's the Netflix script. \nA new film, called Scoop, is an account of Prince Andrew's downfall on a special Saturday evening edition of the BBC's Newsnight programme in 2019. And it is told from the perspective of those who got this famous interview, which can still be watched in full on the BBC iPlayer.\nSpecifically, it's the story of the producer Sam McAlister, who wrote the book and now, played by Billie Piper and appearing with the celebs at the glitzy premieres, has made the leap to being Sam Mc A-lister.\nThe Netflix film pushes into the foreground some of those who make the news but without getting much credit - the behind-the-scenes producers and those who do the legwork of booking guests.\nBut at the very centre of this film is Prince Andrew, played with fleshy self-absorption by Rufus Sewell. And this account won't improve the Duke of York's already battered reputation.\nHe comes across as needy, lacking in self-awareness, and emotionally dependent on his mother the late Queen and his private secretary, Amanda Thirsk, who becomes the link for Sam McAlister to secure the interview.\nThe prince's private secretary speaks protectively of him: \"Too loyal for his own good sometimes.\" And the film captures that rather stifling, self-regarding, claustrophobic palace world, which completely falls apart when confronted with Emily Maitlis's politely brutal questioning.\nActor Rufus Sewell has said he used the character of David Brent, the deluded but endlessly hopeful manager from the Office, as a reference point.\nThis film shows the prince rehearsing for the Buckingham Palace interview, but it doesn't explain the logic of answers that will forever associate him with going for a pizza in Woking - \"a very unusual thing for me to do\" - and the \"peculiar medical condition\" that meant he couldn't sweat.\nMore to the point he couldn't really convincingly express regret - and that 49 minute interview, and the questions it raises about links to Jeffrey Epstein, continues to haunt him and the Royal Family every time he appears in public.\nBut rather like The Crown, Netflix's other royal drama based on real life, it's likely to raise questions about the blurred boundaries between drama and documentary.\nThere's an on-screen disclaimer that \"certain elements have been fictionalised for dramatic purposes\" - but it might be hard for viewers to separate what was from the original interview and the moments of dramatic licence that have been added.\nPrince Andrew is seen getting cross with palace staff about wrongly rearranging his teddy bears. It's a neat piece of storytelling about failing to see the bigger picture, but is that one of the \"fictionalised for dramatic purposes\" scenes that didn't really happen?\nAt a pre-launch screening, one of the biggest audience reactions was when Rufus Sewell as Prince Andrew turns to see Gillian Anderson as Emily Maitlis entering the room ahead of the interview, dressed for battle.\n\"Trousers,\" exclaims the Prince Andrew character, with a fruity harrumph, as though taken aback by a female interviewer wearing trousers. It seemed to encapsulate a sense of underlying sexism and being hopelessly out of date.\nExcept in a questions and answers session after the screening, McAlister was asked if Prince Andrew had really said that - and she said she hadn't heard him say it. \nWould the viewer know the difference between the actual words, in the meticulously recreated interview, and the parts which are dramatic devices? Is that fair?\nMaitlis herself, in real life rather than as played by Anderson, talked in 2019, before the interview, about the importance of timing in such on-screen interrogations.\n\"If you interrupt somebody too early, if you miss it and don't interrupt at all, that's the difference between a good interview and a bad interview. It's about the absolute moment,\" she said.\nBut it's not a particularly sympathetic portrayal of the TV interviewer. Anderson previously played Margaret Thatcher in The Crown - and with a performance full of husky, haughty froideur, this can oddly feel like Thatcher playing Emily Maitlis.\nThe hierarchies of BBC News are also questioned. The senior staff in Newsnight are depicted as out of touch, patronising and part of the entitled chattering classes, when they're berated by McAlister for \"mistaking talking to ourselves for news\".\nBut Scoop is intended as a celebration of holding power to account. And going into the BBC's headquarters McAlister is seen giving a \"Good morning George\" to the statue of another ex-BBC staffer, George Orwell.\nIf the 102-minute film is about the voices of those usually ignored, another part of this story is the seriousness of the backdrop and the real-life people portrayed or referred to in the film.\nThe claims about Jeffrey Epstein and his con",

    "People visiting beaches this weekend are being warned to take extra care as wind gusts of up to 70mph (112km/h) are forecast on the Welsh coast. \nStorm Kathleen could bring large swells leading to \"unpredictable seas and challenging conditions\", the RNLI said. \nIt is urging people to stay \"well back\" from the water's edge. \nA yellow weather warning for wind is in place for all of Wales' coastal areas on Saturday.\nThe Met Office warning, in place from 08:00 BST to 22:00 on Saturday, said Storm Kathleen would bring \"very windy weather\" to western areas of the UK. \nThe forecaster warned that injuries and danger to life could occur from \"large waves and beach material being thrown onto sea fronts, coastal roads and properties\". \nMet Office meteorologist Greg Dewhurst said UK western coastal areas could see gusts of between 60 and 70mph. \nStorm Kathleen - the 11th named storm in eight months - was named by Met Eireann, the Irish met office, because more significant impacts are likely to be felt in the Republic of Ireland. It is only the second time in a UK storm season that the letter K has been reached in the alphabet. \nOn Friday, Snowdon Mountain Railway, which runs on Yr Wyddfa, or Snowdon, said all its services over the weekend had been cancelled due to Storm Kathleen.\nZip World Tower near Aberdare, Rhondda Cynon Taf, also announced it would be closed over the weekend due to poor weather. \nThe RNLI has urged those planning to visit the coast to \"take extra care\" and to only go to lifeguarded beaches if they plan to go into the water. \nIt said that people should not enter the water on a beach that is red-flagged, while beaches with no flags do not have lifeguards. \nThe weather conditions forecast for the weekend \"pose an increased risk to those visiting the coast\", said the RNLI's Chris Cousens.\nHe urged people not to enter the water alone, to let other people know of plans and to \"always carry a means for calling for help should you need it\". \n\"If you're walking on the coast be aware of your surroundings and stay well back from the water's edge. The weather conditions increase the likelihood of tidal surges that could sweep you out to sea,\" he said. ",
    "A Tory MP has said he is one of the men to have been sent unsolicited explicit messages in a suspected honeytrap plot targeting Westminster. \nBosworth MP Luke Evans said he contacted the police after becoming \"a victim of cyber-flashing and malicious communication\".\nIt has been reported that up to 13 men have received suspicious messages, raising security concerns. \nThe men are thought to include a government minister and advisers. \nSome had been sent naked images, and two MPs are reported to have responded by sending images of themselves.\nIt comes after fellow Conservative MP William Wragg made an apology, having admitted giving some MPs' personal phone numbers to a man on a gay dating app.\nThe Met Police has confirmed it is \"carrying out an investigation following reports that a number of unsolicited messages were sent to MPs over recent months\".\nEarlier this week, Leicestershire Police said it was \"investigating a report of malicious communications\" that had been made to them last month.\nDescribing his own experience in a video on Facebook, Mr Evans said: \"A month ago I was a victim of cyber-flashing and malicious communications.\"\nHe said the first set of messages came when he was with his wife, and received \"a one-time open photo on WhatsApp of an explicit image of a naked lady\".\nTen days later he received a further set of messages and was able \"to record conversations and catch photos and videos of the messages\", he added.\nMr Evans said he reported the messages to the police as well as the chief whip in Parliament. \n\"I wanted it to be private because there is an ongoing police investigation,\" he said, but added that in recent days he had been \"hounded by journalists\". \n\"I'm just pleased I blew the whistle, reported it to the authorities and it's now being looked into.\"\nOn Thursday, Mr Wragg admitted sending some MPs' numbers to someone he met on dating site Grindr.\nThe Hazel Grove MP told the Times he had been \"scared\" because the individual had \"compromising things on me\" and \"wouldn't leave me alone\".\nMr Wragg - who is stepping down at the next election - said he was \"mortified\", adding: \"I'm so sorry that my weakness has caused other people hurt.\"\nThe BBC has spoken to two people in political circles who have been targeted by unwanted messages.\nOne ex-MP, who is gay, said he received messages from someone calling themselves \"Charlie\" who claimed, incorrectly, that he had previously worked for Mr Wragg.\nThe former MP explained he was in a relationship, but further flirtatious messages followed. After \"Charlie\" sent an explicit image, the former MP blocked him.\nSomeone who works for an MP told the BBC they received a message last autumn from someone calling themselves \"Abi\".\nThe staffer said this person claimed to know him from work, and mentioned an event he had attended.\nBut he grew suspicious when he asked who they were, and they replied with information that was \"clearly wrong\".\nHe said he ignored them, but they continued to message him. He told the BBC he learned five or six months later that someone else had received messages from a person with the same number and similar picture.\nThe MP's staff member said he would be \"very surprised\" if Mr Wragg had his number, and he cannot recall ever having met him.\nA House of Commons spokesperson said it took security \"extremely seriously\" and provided MPs and staff with \"tailored advice\" to make them aware of risks online.\n\"We are encouraging anyone affected who has concerns to contact the Parliamentary Security Department,\" they added.",

    "A retired rabbi has agreed to return \u00a32.35m to two charities after he failed to distribute the money over a number of years.\nBarry Marcus MBE was found to be holding the funds in personal accounts, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said.\nHis accounts were frozen after an NCA investigation proved the money had not been used to fund the charitable causes for which it was intended.\nThe 74-year-old was the rabbi at the Central London Synagogue until 2018. \nHe received an MBE in the 2015 New Year's Honours list for his work on Holocaust education. \nThe funds were received from Dalaid, an organisation that aims to relieve poverty and advance Jewish education, and the Schwarzschild Foundation, which aims to provide education and the relief of poverty for women and girls in the orthodox Jewish faith. \nBoth charities said they were unaware that the funds had not been distributed, the NCA said.\nNo criminal charges have been brought against Mr Marcus.\nThe NCA began investigating in October 2022 after the retired rabbi received more than \u00a31m between January and September of that year, the bulk of which had originated from the charities.\nHe transferred a substantial proportion of the money to his other UK accounts and accounts overseas and the NCA's initial inquiries could not establish a legitimate explanation for the payments. \nBetween November 2022 and March 2023 the NCA applied for four account-freezing orders over funds totalling \u00a31,183,072 held by Mr Marcus.\nHe maintained that he had distributed a substantial amount of money in accordance with the charity's intentions. But the NCA said Mr Marcus was unable to provide satisfactory documentation to substantiate this.\nOn 31 January this year, the retired rabbi formally agreed to return more than \u00a32m to the charities, almost double the funds identified and frozen in the UK. \nOn 12 March Westminster Magistrates' Court varied the four account-freezing orders to allow the frozen funds to be returned to the two charities.\nIn June 2023 the Charity Commission opened inquiries into the operation and governance of both charities. \nThese inquiries continue and the Charity Commission is ensuring that funds returned to the charities are properly applied. \nTim Quarrelle, NCA branch commander for asset denial, called it a \"fantastic result\".\n\"It follows a challenging and complex NCA investigation that ran over 18 months, showing the commitment of our officers to pursue every line of inquiry,\" he said.\n\"We are particularly grateful to our colleagues at the Charity Commission who are investigating issues relating to these charities in parallel.\"\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "This was the Rolls-Royce of car crash interviews. A purring engine of privilege collided with a barrage of perfectly timed questions.\nIt used to be said that history is written by the winners. Now it's the Netflix script. \nA new film, called Scoop, is an account of Prince Andrew's downfall on a special Saturday evening edition of the BBC's Newsnight programme in 2019. And it is told from the perspective of those who got this famous interview, which can still be watched in full on the BBC iPlayer.\nSpecifically, it's the story of the producer Sam McAlister, who wrote the book and now, played by Billie Piper and appearing with the celebs at the glitzy premieres, has made the leap to being Sam Mc A-lister.\nThe Netflix film pushes into the foreground some of those who make the news but without getting much credit - the behind-the-scenes producers and those who do the legwork of booking guests.\nBut at the very centre of this film is Prince Andrew, played with fleshy self-absorption by Rufus Sewell. And this account won't improve the Duke of York's already battered reputation.\nHe comes across as needy, lacking in self-awareness, and emotionally dependent on his mother the late Queen and his private secretary, Amanda Thirsk, who becomes the link for Sam McAlister to secure the interview.\nThe prince's private secretary speaks protectively of him: \"Too loyal for his own good sometimes.\" And the film captures that rather stifling, self-regarding, claustrophobic palace world, which completely falls apart when confronted with Emily Maitlis's politely brutal questioning.\nActor Rufus Sewell has said he used the character of David Brent, the deluded but endlessly hopeful manager from the Office, as a reference point.\nThis film shows the prince rehearsing for the Buckingham Palace interview, but it doesn't explain the logic of answers that will forever associate him with going for a pizza in Woking - \"a very unusual thing for me to do\" - and the \"peculiar medical condition\" that meant he couldn't sweat.\nMore to the point he couldn't really convincingly express regret - and that 49 minute interview, and the questions it raises about links to Jeffrey Epstein, continues to haunt him and the Royal Family every time he appears in public.\nBut rather like The Crown, Netflix's other royal drama based on real life, it's likely to raise questions about the blurred boundaries between drama and documentary.\nThere's an on-screen disclaimer that \"certain elements have been fictionalised for dramatic purposes\" - but it might be hard for viewers to separate what was from the original interview and the moments of dramatic licence that have been added.\nPrince Andrew is seen getting cross with palace staff about wrongly rearranging his teddy bears. It's a neat piece of storytelling about failing to see the bigger picture, but is that one of the \"fictionalised for dramatic purposes\" scenes that didn't really happen?\nAt a pre-launch screening, one of the biggest audience reactions was when Rufus Sewell as Prince Andrew turns to see Gillian Anderson as Emily Maitlis entering the room ahead of the interview, dressed for battle.\n\"Trousers,\" exclaims the Prince Andrew character, with a fruity harrumph, as though taken aback by a female interviewer wearing trousers. It seemed to encapsulate a sense of underlying sexism and being hopelessly out of date.\nExcept in a questions and answers session after the screening, McAlister was asked if Prince Andrew had really said that - and she said she hadn't heard him say it. \nWould the viewer know the difference between the actual words, in the meticulously recreated interview, and the parts which are dramatic devices? Is that fair?\nMaitlis herself, in real life rather than as played by Anderson, talked in 2019, before the interview, about the importance of timing in such on-screen interrogations.\n\"If you interrupt somebody too early, if you miss it and don't interrupt at all, that's the difference between a good interview and a bad interview. It's about the absolute moment,\" she said.\nBut it's not a particularly sympathetic portrayal of the TV interviewer. Anderson previously played Margaret Thatcher in The Crown - and with a performance full of husky, haughty froideur, this can oddly feel like Thatcher playing Emily Maitlis.\nThe hierarchies of BBC News are also questioned. The senior staff in Newsnight are depicted as out of touch, patronising and part of the entitled chattering classes, when they're berated by McAlister for \"mistaking talking to ourselves for news\".\nBut Scoop is intended as a celebration of holding power to account. And going into the BBC's headquarters McAlister is seen giving a \"Good morning George\" to the statue of another ex-BBC staffer, George Orwell.\nIf the 102-minute film is about the voices of those usually ignored, another part of this story is the seriousness of the backdrop and the real-life people portrayed or referred to in the film.\nThe claims about Jeffrey Epstein and his con",
    "There are renewed concerns over levels of violence in French schools after two young teenagers were the victims of attacks, one of them fatal.\nA 15-year-old boy named as Shamseddin died in hospital on Friday.\nThe news came a day after he was beaten by a group of youths near his school in Viry-Chatillon, in the southern Paris suburbs.\n\"This extreme violence is becoming commonplace,\" said the town mayor, Jean-Marie Vilain.\nMr Vilain told French media the boy was walking home after a music class at about 16:30 local time on Thursday when he was set upon by a group of youths.\nAccording to witnesses, he was punched and kicked by the attackers, who were wearing balaclavas.\nHe was taken to the Necker hospital, a top paediatric hospital in Paris, but doctors were unable to save his life.\nOne 17-year-old teenager has been arrested by French police in the Viry-Chatillon murder case, the local prosecutor announced later. Police are still looking for other assailants.\nOn Tuesday, in another incident in the southern city of Montpellier, a 14-year-old girl named as Samara was placed in an artificial coma after she was beaten by a group shortly after leaving school.\nThree adolescents - a girl and two boys of roughly the same age as Samara - have been arrested and admitted taking part in the attack, police said. Samara has since regained consciousness. \nThe girl's mother told French media that Samara had been bullied by another girl at the school because she refused to follow Islamic dress codes. \n\"Samara puts on a bit of make-up. And this other girl wears the headscarf. All the time, she kept calling her an unbeliever,\" she said on French television on Wednesday.\n\"My daughter dresses like a European. Every day there were insults. It was physically and psychologically unbearable.\"\nHowever, the prosecutor's office in its initial report on the attack made no mention of a religious connection, saying the background was an argument over photographs shared on Snapchat.\nAnd speaking Thursday evening on another French television channel, Samara's mother read out a statement accusing the far-right of trying to use the attack to their own advantage.\n\"My daughter is a practising pious Muslim. She fasts during Ramadan and prays five times a day. Please do not use us to sully the name of our religion,\" she said.  \nThe attacks have further heightened concerns about violence in schools,  against a background of gangs, cyber-bullying and pressure to conform to Islamic rules. \nLast week, the headteacher of a school in Paris resigned saying he feared for his life after receiving death threats for telling a girl to remove her head covering in accordance with French law.   \nIn the same week, several schools had to shut because of hoax bomb threats made by people claiming to be Islamic radicals. \nIn recent years, two teachers have been murdered by Islamist radicals.\nSamuel Paty was decapitated on the street in a Paris suburb in 2020, while Dominique Bernard was killed at his school in Arras in October last year. \nEarlier on Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron said schools needed to be \"shielded\" from \"uninhibited violence among our teenagers and sometimes among increasingly younger ones\".\nReacting to the two attacks, Marine Le Pen of the hard-right National Rally said: \"When will the government finally sit up and take the full measure of the savagery which is gnawing at our society?\"\nJean-Marie Vilain, the mayor of Viry-Chatillon, was in tears as he spoke to journalists of the death of Shamseddin, who - he said - left a mother and a younger sister with their lives in ruins.\n\"We have to teach our children that there is good and there is bad.

But I can\u2019t, so I\u2019ll say it to all of you now, instead,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYou are trapped by an inhumane, unaccountable inspection system \u2013 but you don\u2019t have to put up with it any more. If you feel despair, you need help and hope \u2013 not to think that suicide is a way out.\u201d\nOfsted downgraded Mrs Perry's school from \"outstanding\" to \"inadequate\" because of safeguarding concerns, after visiting in November 2022.\nMrs Perry said she had not been allowed to talk about the Ofsted result to anyone and spent the next eight weeks \"constantly returning obsessively to the trauma of the inspection\".\nShe died in January 2023.\nA coroner ruled in December that the inspection \"contributed\" to Mrs Perry's death and said there was a risk of further deaths \"unless action is taken\".\n Ofsted apologised fully the following month for the role it played in Mrs Perry's suicide and promised a review of lessons to be learned.\nIt has now rolled out an updated policy for complaints about inspections, following a consultation last year, which it said would allow complaints to be escalated earlier.\nOfsted chief inspector Sir Martyn Oliver said all inspections \"should be carried out professionally and with courtesy, empathy and respect\".\n\"But should anyone have concerns, we will always want to resolve them as quickly as possible,\" he said.\n\"I want to assure providers that we will acknowledge any mistakes made and take steps to put them right.\"\nSpeaking to journalists after her speech, Prof Waters said it was \u201cdisappointing\u201d that Ofsted\u2019s independent learning review had not yet started.\nLabour has previously said Ofsted's system of one-word judgements \"can\u2019t capture the breadth of school life\".\nAsked about the party's proposal to replace them with a \u201cschool report card\u201d - which it has previously said would \"give more information on what's happening in schools\" - Prof Waters said: \u201cI don't really know what it means.\u201d\nIn her speech, she also said there would be \u201cno point\u201d in calling for Ofsted to be abolished - as the NEU has done - but it should change and become \u201cbetter and kinder\u201d.\nNEU members described Ofsted as \u201ctoxic\u201d in a debate after Prof Waters\u2019 speech.\nSpeakers voted for the NEU to campaign for the Health and Safety Executive and the government to agree that Ofsted was \u201ca stressor that has been a considerable factor\u201d in work-related suicides.\nIf you're affected by the issues in this report, you can find support from BBC Action Line.",
    "\"Freedom of speech and belief are at an end in Scotland if the accurate description of biological sex is deemed criminal,\" wrote JK Rowling this week.\nThe author was referring to the introduction on April Fool's Day of a law which criminalised the \"stirring up of hatred\" against various minority groups, as well as streamlining and extending other aspects of hate crime law. \nHer objections focused on the inclusion of transgender identity as a protected characteristic given that women, as defined by biological sex, were not afforded specific protection.\nMs Rowling lives in Edinburgh but was abroad when she posted her comments on social media, in which she described ten transgender women as men, and dared Police Scotland to act.\n\"If what I've written here qualifies as an offence under the terms of the new act, I look forward to being arrested when I return to the birthplace of the Scottish Enlightenment,\" she wrote.\nScotland's national police force quickly decided that Ms Rowling's posts were not criminal and declined the invitation to arrest her, saying it had received complaints but would not be taking any action. \nPerhaps freedom of speech in Scotland was still going strong after all.\nIf so, it might have come as a surprise to those who had been listening only to critics of the Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act 2021, including the entrepreneur Elon Musk, the podcaster Joe Rogan and the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. \nMr Sunak had strongly implied that the law was silencing certain views when he told broadcasters: \"We're not going to be doing anything like that here in England. We should not be criminalising people saying common sense things about biological sex.\"\nFor clarity, England already has specific hate crime offences relating to race, religion and sexual orientation.\nThere is also a more general protection from hatred throughout the UK, including on social media, in the Communications Act 2003 which states that it is an offence to send a message which is \"grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character\".\nThe fact that, so far at least, no one has been criminalised in Scotland for \"saying common sense things\", might have been less surprising to a parade of lawyers and academics who had warned in advance that the new law was being misrepresented around the world.\n\"I've not seen any sensible lawyer who thinks misgendering will become a crime tomorrow,\" wrote Roddy Dunlop KC, Dean of the Faculty of Advocates, on the eve of the act coming into force.\nDr Andrew Tickell, a law lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University, insisted the legislation had a relatively high bar for criminality, stressing its free speech provisions, including a \"right\" to express ideas that \"offend, shock or disturb.\"\nEven Adam Tomkins, a professor of public law at Glasgow University who actually voted against the bill when he was a Conservative MSP (because he objected to its applying in private homes) agreed that it was \"fairly safe\" in terms of free speech.\n\"It's not a hate crime under this legislation to misgender somebody,\" he told BBC Scotland News, adding \"even if somebody finds it really upsetting, really offensive, it's not a hate crime because it's not something that a reasonable person would regard as a threat or as abusive.\"\nOthers are more concerned. Joanna Cherry KC, the SNP MP for Edinburgh South West, argues that protection in the new law for the belief that biological sex is immutable could and should have been more robust.\nOf course the law is not just about the issue of gender. The consultation which led to its introduction was supported, for example, by the Scottish Council of Jewish Communities which said that it enabled \"society to signal its abhorrence of prejudice and hatred against identifiable groups.\"\nThat support had followed a joint campaign involving the Jewish and Muslim communities which urged Scotland to do more to tackle \"the hatred and extremism that affects us all.\"\nWithin the Scottish government, there is a deep sense of frustration that so much of this week's public and media debate has focused on the issue of gender rather than the other protected characteristics in the act.\nThere is no doubt that the intervention of one of the most successful living authors on earth transformed the issue into a global news story but it is also clear that, had ministers chosen a different path, the narrative could have developed differently.\nFirst, the SNP-led government could have proposed including specific protection for women as a group in the law rather than tackling that issue separately.\nIt could have included a specific free-speech clause relating to the belief that a man cannot become a woman.\nIt could have taken language in the bill which protects expressions of \"antipathy, dislike, ridicule or insult\" towards religion, and applied it to related protected characteristics, which include age, disability, sexual orientation, transgender identity and being intersex.\nInstead of supp",
    "A disease that kills Britain's native red squirrel has moved north of Scotland's central belt for the first time.\nScientists have confirmed the death of a red squirrel from the squirrelpox virus in Dunfermline in Fife - an area previously unaffected by the disease.\nExperts said it was a \"worrying development\" and a \"major threat\" to Scotland's northerly red squirrels. \nThe first Squirrelpox outbreak in Scotland was in 2007 near Lockerbie.\nSince then the disease has appeared in various red squirrel populations across the south of Scotland.\nHowever, this is the first time a case has been confirmed north of Scotland's central belt.\nSquirrelpox is a virus carried by grey squirrels, which does not affect them, but can be rapidly lethal when passed to the UK's native red squirrels.\nGrey squirrels were introduced to the UK from North America by the Victorians and have since displaced red squirrels in most of England and Wales, with more than 75% of the UK's total remaining population now in Scotland.\nA walker found the dead red squirrel with ulcers and scabs around its eyes and mouth in woodland north of Dunfermline in March.\nThe University of Edinburgh's Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies has now confirmed it had squirrelpox following a post-mortem examination.\nThe Scottish Wildlife Trust said the news could have serious consequences for the area's red squirrel population.\nLiam Wilson, of the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies in Edinburgh, said: \"This is a worrying development for red squirrels in Scotland, as this case north of the central belt may be the prelude to squirrelpox expansion both locally and further northward, although more investigative work is required to fully assess this risk.\n\"This case also highlights the key role members of the public have in wildlife conservation, as this case was detected from the submission of a dead red squirrel by a member of the public.\n\"If any members of the public come across further dead red squirrels in and around Dunfermline, these can be posted to us for examination using detailed guidelines.\"\nSquirrelpox symptoms include ulcers, scabs and weeping lesions on the face, paws and genitalia, all of which can prevent red squirrels from eating, drinking or moving.\nIt is usually fatal within two weeks and an outbreak can cause local populations to drop dramatically.\nNicole Still, the Scottish Wildlife Trust's saving Scotland's red squirrels programme manager, said: \"We are extremely concerned about this latest news.\n\"We are asking the local community in Dunfermline to take immediate action and protect red squirrels by taking in all garden and woodland wildlife feeders for the next month, as these can contribute to the spread of the disease from greys to reds and between reds once infected.\n\"We are also asking for everybody to keep a close eye out for, and take photos of, any sick-looking red squirrels and email these into us, as well as report all sightings of both species to our website to inform local efforts.\"",
    "US President Joe Biden vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to help Baltimore recover from a deadly bridge collapse that blocked the city's port. \nHe added the government will \"help you rebuild and maintain all the business and commerce that's here now\".\nAlong with killing six workers, the collapse trapped a massive ship in one of the busiest ports on the East Coast, used by companies such as Amazon. \nSo far, $60m (\u00a347.4m) has been earmarked for the clean-up effort. \nThe final cost of clearing the waterway and rebuilding the bridge is likely to be far higher, with some lawmakers estimating it could rise to hundreds of millions of dollars. One, Maryland Democrat David Trone, told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that he believes the cost could be as high as $1bn. \nOn Friday, Mr Biden re-iterated a previous commitment to help Baltimore fund the recovery process and rebuilding effort. \n\"I fully intend...that the federal government [will] cover the cost of building this entire bridge. All of it,\" he said, calling on Congress to authorize funding \"as soon as possible\". \nA few hours after the president's remarks, officials in Baltimore announced that dive teams had recovered the body of a third construction work at the site of the bridge collapse. \nThe body of Maynor Yasir Suazo-Sandoval was found at around 10:30 local time on Friday, Unified Command said.\nThe bodies of two other victims - Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes, 35, and Dorlian Ronial Castillo Cabrera, 26, were recovered last week. \nThe remaining three victims have not yet been found, but Colonel Roland Butler Jr, the superintendent of Maryland Department of State Police, said he was \"fully committed to finding closure for each of these families.\"\nDuring his visit, Mr Biden, who has family ties to the city, took an aerial tour of the collapsed area alongside Maryland Governor Wes Moore and other senior officials involved in the salvage effort, before meeting with emergency personnel. \nSpeaking in the Baltimore suburb of Dundalk - with the cargo ship, the Dali, and the ruined bridge clearly visible - Mr Biden said the federal government will \"move heaven and earth\" to rebuild the bridge \"as rapidly as humanly possible\". \nHe added that the reconstruction effort will be done with \"union labour and American steel.\" \nThe port is a vital economic hub that is linked to more than 15,000 jobs.\n\"Folks, we all need to step up,\" he added, \"Amazon, Home Depot...and other companies all rely on this port, and they have committed to keep workers on payrolls.\" \nIn his remarks, Mr Biden also directed a message to the families of the \"working, strong, selfless\" men who died in the accident, with whom he was also scheduled to meet during his visit. All six were immigrants from Mexico and Central America. \n\"Never forget the contributions these men made to this city,\" he said. \"We're going to keep working hard to recover each of them.\" \nIn a 5 April letter to senior members of House and Senate committees focused on infrastructure, transportation, public works and the environment, Office of Management and Budget Director Shalonda Young wrote that the administration would pursue \"all avenues to recover the costs of past, current and future work\". \nIn the wake of the crash, the \"unified command\" responsible for the response opened two smaller temporary shipping channels in the area to allow limited maritime traffic to pass through.\nBy the end of April, officials hope to open a limited access channel 280ft (80m) wide and 35ft (10m) deep to allow one-way traffic for barge containers and some other vessels that carry cars and equipment.\nThe entire, permanent channel is expected to be clear and ready for use by the end of May, the unified command said in a statement earlier this week. \nThat timeline, however, may change due to weather and unexpected complications with the salvage effort. \n\"This is going to take time,\" Mr Biden said.

    "Thames Water has seen its troubles deepen after its parent company defaulted on part of its huge debt pile.\nKemble Water has formally told lenders it failed to meet a deadline to pay interest on \u00a3400m of debt due on Tuesday.\nThe water giant has also asked lenders not to take any action as it explores its options.\nThames Water's 16 million customers will not be affected.\nThis notification confirms an announcement on 28 March that Kemble would be unable to repay its lenders as interest and principal payments - including a loan repayment of \u00a3190m due at the end of April - come up.\nIt has issued a formal notice to its bondholders, but asked them to take \"no creditor action\" in order to enable a \"stable platform\" for negotiations. Companies sell bonds to investors to raise the funds they need, paying the money back over time with a premium.\nBeing in default renders Kemble Water effectively insolvent but that will not affect the underlying utility business that supplies water and waste services to 1 in 4 people in the UK.\nThe company has been engulfed by a crisis which has seen shareholders refuse to pay a \u00a3500m lifeline injection that would have shored up its finances, as well as fierce criticism over Thames Water's handling of leaks and sewage treatment.\nThe future of Thames Water has been uncertain since fears emerged that it could collapse last June, with the latest developments raising questions around a potential restructure.\nThe company has been struggling with debts of \u00a314.7bn.\nBut the new boss of Thames Water - and the regulator Ofwat - insist that the company has enough cash and overdraft facilities to see it through to May of next year. \nWhile the dominos are falling at the parent company, these will fall short of triggering a collapse.\nHowever, at some point Thames Water will need to raise new money. The current shareholders which include UK and Canadian pension funds as well as Chinese and Gulf State investors pulled the planned \u00a3500m cash injection when Ofwat rejected proposals to raise customer bills by 40% above inflation by 2030.\nKemble, which is funded entirely through dividends paid out by Thames Water, said it expects it will be able to provide a further update in \"the coming weeks\".\nRegardless of what happens, water supplies to Thames Water's customers will continue as normal.",

It is only the second time in a UK storm season that the letter K has been reached in the alphabet. \nOn Friday, Snowdon Mountain Railway, which runs on Yr Wyddfa, or Snowdon, said all its services over the weekend had been cancelled due to Storm Kathleen.\nZip World Tower near Aberdare, Rhondda Cynon Taf, also announced it would be closed over the weekend due to poor weather. \nThe RNLI has urged those planning to visit the coast to \"take extra care\" and to only go to lifeguarded beaches if they plan to go into the water. \nIt said that people should not enter the water on a beach that is red-flagged, while beaches with no flags do not have lifeguards. \nThe weather conditions forecast for the weekend \"pose an increased risk to those visiting the coast\", said the RNLI's Chris Cousens.\nHe urged people not to enter the water alone, to let other people know of plans and to \"always carry a means for calling for help should you need it\". \n\"If you're walking on the coast be aware of your surroundings and stay well back from the water's edge. The weather conditions increase the likelihood of tidal surges that could sweep you out to sea,\" he said. ",
    "A 2p cut in National Insurance (NI) has come into effect.\nHowever, previous changes to the way tax is calculated mean the amount people pay overall is rising. \nThe starting rate for NI changed from 10% to 8% for 27 million workers on 6 April 2024.\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt, who announced the measure in the Budget, said this was worth about \u00a3450 a year to an employee on an average salary of \u00a335,000.\nTwo million self-employed workers also got a cut in the main rate of NI.\nContributions on all earnings between \u00a312,570 and \u00a350,270 have been cut from a rate of 9% to 6%. The government has said that is worth \u00a3350 to a self-employed person earning \u00a328,200. \nNI was also cut at the start of the year. Since 6 January, millions of employees have been paying 10% on their earnings between \u00a312,571 and \u00a350,270. They previously paid 12%. \nThe government has said that when combined with the latest cut, a worker on \u00a335,000 will save about \u00a3900 a year.\nFor the self-employed, Class 4 NI contributions on all earnings between \u00a312,570 and \u00a350,270 were already due to be cut from a rate of 9% to 8% in April. They will no longer pay a separate category of NI called Class 2 contributions. \nThe NI rate on income and profits above \u00a350,270 remains at 2%. \nThe government uses National Insurance contributions (NICs) to pay for benefits and help fund the NHS. \nNI rates apply across the UK. You start paying NI when you turn 16 and earn over \u00a3242 a week, or have profits of more than \u00a312,570 a year. \nIt is not paid by people over the state pension age, even if they are working. \nEligibility for some benefits, including the state pension, depends on the NI contributions you make across your working life.\nThe government records how many years of contributions you have made. Paying a lower rate of NI does not mean you contribute fewer years. \nIf you do not work, for example because you are a carer or claim benefits, you might be able to receive NI credits instead, which mean you will still qualify for the relevant benefits. \nYou can also make voluntary contributions to plug gaps in your record.\nDespite the NI cuts in January and April, millions will still pay more tax overall because of changes to the tax thresholds. \nThese are the income levels at which people start paying NI or income tax, or have to pay higher rates. \nThese used to rise every year in line with inflation. \nHowever, the NI threshold and tax-free personal allowance - the amount you can earn every year before you have to pay income tax - have been frozen at \u00a312,570 until 2028. Higher-rate tax will continue to kick in for earnings above \u00a350,270. \nFreezing the thresholds means that more people start paying tax and NI as their wages increase, and more people pay higher rates. \nIt will create 3.2 million extra taxpayers by 2028, and 2.6 million more people will pay higher rates, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which conducts independent assessments of the government's economic plans. \nAccording to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think thank, the freeze cancels out the benefits of the NI cuts for some workers. \nIn the upcoming financial year, an average earner will have a tax cut of about \u00a3340 - from the combined tax changes - and people earning between \u00a326,000 and \u00a360,000 will be better off. \nBut by 2027, the average earner would be only \u00a3140 better off - and only people earning between \u00a332,000 and \u00a355,000 a year would be better off.\nIncome tax is paid on earnings from employment and profits from self-employment during the tax year, which runs from 6 April to 5 April the following year.\nIncome tax is also paid on some benefits and pensions, income from renting out property, and returns from savings and investments above certain limits. \nThe Basic rate is 20% and is paid on annual earnings between \u00a312,571 and \u00a350,270. \nThe Higher rate is 40%, and is paid on earnings between \u00a350,271 and \u00a3125,140.\nOnce you earn more than \u00a3100,000, you also start losing your tax-free personal allowance. \nYou lose \u00a31 of your personal allowance for every \u00a32 that your income goes above \u00a3100,000. \nAnyone earning more than \u00a3125,140 a year no longer has any tax-free personal allowance. \nThe additional rate of income tax is 45%, and is paid on all earnings above \u00a3125,140 a year. \nThese apply in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nSome income tax rates are different in Scotland. \nIn Scotland a new 45% band has taken effect. The top rate has also risen from 47% to 48%.\nFor most families, income tax is the single biggest tax they pay. \nBut for less well-off households, a greater share of family income goes on taxes on spending, known as indirect taxes. \nFor the poorest fifth of households, VAT is the biggest single tax paid.\nYou can look at the amount of tax raised as a proportion of the size of the economy, or GDP. \nIn 2022 - the most recent year for which international comparisons can be made - that figure was 35.3%.\nThat puts the UK right in the middle of the G7 group of big econom",

    "When Sian Williams was offered tickets to see Taylor Swift in concert, she jumped at the chance.\nBut within seconds of transferring \u00a3250, she knew she'd been scammed.\n\"It makes me angry because it was so realistic,\" said the mum-of-two from Gwynedd, who thought she was buying from a trustworthy mutual friend.\nConsumer watchdogs are warning others to beware of similarly sophisticated online cons.\nSian had promised her 18-year-old daughter Efa she would take her to see Swift's The Eras Tour this summer after finishing her A-level exams. \nAfter missing out on the official ticket sale in 2023 - Swift's show in Cardiff due to take place this June sold out in minutes - she was put in touch with someone who claimed to have four tickets to the US pop idol's Liverpool date.\n\"I didn't think anything of it because it was a friend of a friend,\" said Sian, from Blaenau Ffestiniog.\nThey asked for \u00a3500 for four tickets, providing screenshots of each and details about the seating arrangements.  \nBut Sian and Efa's bank account set-up meant they could only transfer a maximum of \u00a3250 at a time, which they began to do after sharing their details with the scammer via WhatsApp.\nSensing something was not right, the family then refused to pay the second instalment and instead contacted their bank, which has since started an investigation.  \nSian said the scammer \"absolutely impersonated\" her mutual friend, adding that people should be careful not to do \"unwise things in the heat of the moment\" because \"once that money's sent it can't be retrieved\".\n\"It's just \u00a3250 that's literally gone to waste,\" she added. \n\"We're out of pocket and still haven't got any tickets.\"\nSian added that, as a seasoned ticket buyer, she thought she was \"quite savvy online\" but has chosen to share her experience in an effort to prevent it from happening to others.\nAlso, last month saw 24-year old Indigo Jones from Swansea contacted by friends asking if she was still selling her Taylor Swift tickets.\nShe quickly realised her social media accounts had been hacked and her profiles used by scammers to advertise tickets that didn't exist.\n\"I feel so so guilty, especially because there's nothing I can do about it other than to try raising awareness about it,\" she said. \nIndigo added that, while some of her friends were contacted by a hacker posing as her, nobody that she knows of has lost money or been defrauded as a result.\n\"Personally I think this is something I would have fallen for as well, because it did look so real,\" she said.\nEmily Seymour, a consumer expert at Which?, described ticket scams such as these as \"really common\".\nShe added that fraudsters target people \"desperate\" to see big shows who are \"under pressure to make a quick purchase\".\nHer advice is to \"take a moment\" before rushing into buying anything and to check that you are sending your money to a legitimate person.\nIf you are worried you have been victim to an online scam, she suggests contacting your bank to report the fraud as soon as possible and discuss the protections they may provide.\n\"You can also contact Action Fraud or the police in terms of getting that money back,\" she added.\n\"Unfortunately, if you've made a bank transfer, directly paying from your account into somebody else's, it's a bit more difficult to get your money back.\n\"We'd really recommend you don't use that method of payment.\"\nHave you been scammed when buying Taylor Swift tickets?

    "A retired rabbi has agreed to return \u00a32.35m to two charities after he failed to distribute the money over a number of years.\nBarry Marcus MBE was found to be holding the funds in personal accounts, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said.\nHis accounts were frozen after an NCA investigation proved the money had not been used to fund the charitable causes for which it was intended.\nThe 74-year-old was the rabbi at the Central London Synagogue until 2018. \nHe received an MBE in the 2015 New Year's Honours list for his work on Holocaust education. \nThe funds were received from Dalaid, an organisation that aims to relieve poverty and advance Jewish education, and the Schwarzschild Foundation, which aims to provide education and the relief of poverty for women and girls in the orthodox Jewish faith. \nBoth charities said they were unaware that the funds had not been distributed, the NCA said.\nNo criminal charges have been brought against Mr Marcus.\nThe NCA began investigating in October 2022 after the retired rabbi received more than \u00a31m between January and September of that year, the bulk of which had originated from the charities.\nHe transferred a substantial proportion of the money to his other UK accounts and accounts overseas and the NCA's initial inquiries could not establish a legitimate explanation for the payments. \nBetween November 2022 and March 2023 the NCA applied for four account-freezing orders over funds totalling \u00a31,183,072 held by Mr Marcus.\nHe maintained that he had distributed a substantial amount of money in accordance with the charity's intentions. But the NCA said Mr Marcus was unable to provide satisfactory documentation to substantiate this.\nOn 31 January this year, the retired rabbi formally agreed to return more than \u00a32m to the charities, almost double the funds identified and frozen in the UK. \nOn 12 March Westminster Magistrates' Court varied the four account-freezing orders to allow the frozen funds to be returned to the two charities.\nIn June 2023 the Charity Commission opened inquiries into the operation and governance of both charities. \nThese inquiries continue and the Charity Commission is ensuring that funds returned to the charities are properly applied. \nTim Quarrelle, NCA branch commander for asset denial, called it a \"fantastic result\".\n\"It follows a challenging and complex NCA investigation that ran over 18 months, showing the commitment of our officers to pursue every line of inquiry,\" he said.\n\"We are particularly grateful to our colleagues at the Charity Commission who are investigating issues relating to these charities in parallel.\"\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A man has been jailed for attempted murder after chasing his victim down a street before unleashing a flurry of gunshots.\nHayden Frost fled the scene in Birmingham in September on an e-bike while his male target was left with a bullet wound to the neck, said police.\nFrost was sentenced to 32 years in prison at the city's crown court on Wednesday.\nThe 26-year-old, from Laburnum Avenue in Solihull, had been convicted of attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.\nPolice said Frost had travelled on the e-bike to the Marston Green Tavern, a pub in Marston Green, Solihull, on 9 September where his victim was socialising with friends.\nShortly after 23:00 GMT, Frost followed the man to the Iron Horse Pub on Flaxley Road in the Stechford area of Birmingham, where he was recorded on CCTV hiding in a bush.\nThe man later got in a car and Frost followed him to Craneberry Road in Chelmsley Wood, Solihull.\nIn the early hours of 10 September, as he was walking to a cashpoint, Frost chased him and shot towards his head before fleeing.\nThe shooting was captured by CCTV cameras, which police said led to Frost\u2019s arrest and conviction.\nThe West Midlands force said the victim suffered a wound to the neck, with the bullet travelling down to his right shoulder where fragments still remained.\nAs well as physical injuries, he was also left with psychological scars including fearing being left on his own when out in public, police added.\nThe force said the motive for the attack remained unknown.\nDet Insp Francis Nock said: \u201cFrost was calculating - dressed in black he followed his victim on an e-bike, where he hid and waited for him to be alone and vulnerable.\n\u201cHe then carried out what must have been a terrifying attack on his victim who was forced to run for his life as bullets were discharged.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cGuns have no place on the streets of the West Midlands and this sentence sends out a clear message that people who do carry weapons and decide to use them will face many years behind bars.\u201d\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "A 123-year-old railway viaduct famous for its use as a Harry Potter film location is to have \u00a33.4m-worth of repairs done to it.\nNetwork Rail said the work would start on the Glenfinnan Viaduct in Lochaber this month.\nThe repairs include improvements to the structure's protection against water erosion and also the stone ballast beneath the track.\nThe viaduct, along with the Jacobite steam train, appeared in 2002's Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\nNetwork Rail said there would be no disruption to ScotRail services along the West Highland Line during the work.\nThe Jacobite steam train journeys were suspended last month in a wrangle over safety regulations.\nNetwork Rail said the repairs would not not change the appearance of the structure \u2013  which is the longest concrete viaduct in Scotland.\nEngineers from Network Rail and principal contractor AmcoGiffen will also assess the condition of the crossing while carrying out the improvements.\nProject manager Laura Craig said: \"The viaduct is an iconic landmark which attracts visitors from across the world, so we\u2019ve worked hard to develop a solution which will help preserve the structure, respect its historic significance while minimising the visual impact of our work.\"\nNetwork Rail said it was working with the local landowner, Highland Council, to make sure work was carried out as sensitively as possible. \nThe company said this included using carefully selected stone for the repairs that match the existing masonry.\nHighland Council's economy and infrastructure chairman Ken Gowans said: \u201cThe scenic rail journey has become a hugely popular route between Fort William and Mallaig. \n\"It is very popular with Harry Potter fans and attracts visitors from across the world. \n\"In addition, it also provides a valued service to those living and working in the communities it passes through, so it is essential that repair works and works to safeguard the route's future are carried out.\u201d\nNetwork Rail said residents and businesses near Glenfinnan would receive letters outlining the planned work programme and would also be kept informed of progress. \nCommunity drop-ins are also being planned.",
    "Passengers at Northern Ireland airports may continue to face limits on the amount of liquid they can carry in hand luggage this summer.\nBelfast City and Belfast International airports could not confirm if they will meet the 1 June deadline to install scanners to end the 100ml liquid limit.\nThe deadline has already been extended for Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester.\nThe main Northern Ireland airports have advised passengers to prepare for security as normal.\nBelfast International said scanners would be in place this summer while Belfast City Airport said the move would be implemented at the \"earliest opportunity\". \nThe rules requiring liquids to be taken through security, in containers of 100ml or less in a clear plastic bag, were introduced in 2006 after a plot to bomb a transatlantic flight was foiled.\nThe new scanners use CT X-ray technology to provide 3D images so items can be left inside bags and liquids up to two litres will be permitted. \nThey are already used in some other countries including the US, although ministers claim the UK is the first in the world to attempt such a wide-scale roll-out.\nAirports were originally told to bring in new scanners by 2022, before the deadline was moved to 1 June this year. \nProblems cited by airports include supply chain issues and the need for major construction to be carried out in order to have the scanners installed. \nThe X-ray machines, similar to CT scanners used in hospitals, are very heavy and, in some instances, floors will need to be reinforced. \nA spokesperson for Belfast International Airport said phase one of a \u00a3100m investment programme was  \"currently under way\" with the construction of a new security building adjacent to the current terminal building. \n\"This ultra-modern \u00a325m facility will transform the passenger security experience by implementing the required Next Generation Security screening equipment meaning passengers will no longer have to remove liquids or electronics from their luggage,\" they added. \nThe spokesperson said the new building would be operational by this summer.\n\"As we are building an entirely new facility we plan to phase passengers through the new facility over the busy summer peak,\" the spokesperson continued.\n\"At this time passengers should still come to the airport prepared to follow the 100ml liquids rule for hand luggage.\"\nA spokesperson for Belfast City Airport said preparations were at an \"advanced stage\" and they were \"aiming for implementation at the earliest opportunity\".  \nThey also advised passengers to \"prepare for security as normal\".\nThe City of Derry Airport has also been approached for comment.

    "Care workers in three Scottish council areas have started a strike in a dispute over equal pay that unions claim could bankrupt local authorities.\nThe row concerns whether the pay in jobs mostly done by women is equivalent to the pay in jobs deemed to be of equal value which are mostly done by men.\nThe GMB union warned that councillors \"have their heads in the sand\" over the matter, and that if it is not resolved soon then there will be a \"disastrous\" impact on communities. \nHome care workers will begin four days of action in Falkirk, with strikes planned for care staff in West Dunbartonshire and Renfrewshire next week.\nThe issue regarding equal pay in councils has been running for several years.\nSome councils, including Glasgow, are in the process of settling claims that run into hundreds of millions of pounds.\nHowever, the GMB say other councils are not acting quickly enough, amongst fears the cost of settling the claims could lead to more cuts in services.\nLouise Gilmour, GMB Scotland secretary, has written to First Minister Humza Yousaf urging him to support the creation of a new specialist body to decide on equal pay claims across the country.\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \u201cCouncils are responsible for meeting their legal obligations to their employees, including on equal pay.\n\u201cIn the face of a profoundly challenging financial situation, the Scottish government is making available record funding of more than \u00a314bn to councils in 2024-25 \u2013 a real-terms increase of 2.5% compared with the previous year.\u201d\nThe GMB's Louise Gilmour claimed that councils were \"approaching equal pay claims like the Titanic approaching the iceberg.\"\nShe added: \"The scale of these claims are unimaginable for local authorities already being forced to cut services.\n\u201cWomen who have been underpaid for far too long will still win these claims, however, and, unless that process is properly managed now, the impact on our councils and the communities they serve could be disastrous.\u201d\nThe union has claimed that some workers in Falkirk are only paid \u00a312.70 an hour and that the council rejected the union's appeal against a refusal to upgrade their jobs. \nFalkirk Health and Social Care Partnership stated they have communicated directly with people who may be affected.\nThey told BBC Scotland News that their Care and Support at Home service will \"operate on a reduced capacity\" during the strike.\nA spokesperson added: \"Falkirk Council is committed to upholding equal pay and continues to engage with GMB colleagues to resolve this matter and minimise disruption for those in need of our care and support at home services\u201d.\nKatherine Crawford, the chief executive of charity Age Scotland, said the impact of the GMB action could be substantial.\nShe stated:  \"We\u2019re sure that the decision to strike was not taken lightly as the impact on those who rely on the support of carers could be substantial.\n\"It\u2019s important that older people in this position have their needs met and we would urge the health and social care partnerships to ensure robust temporary care measures are in place and continue in urgent and meaningful discussions with the union to resolve this matter.\u201d\nWorkers in West Dunbartonshire will strike on 10 April and 11 April, while Renfrewshire workers will walk out on 9 April and 10 April.

    "US President Joe Biden vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to help Baltimore recover from a deadly bridge collapse that blocked the city's port. \nHe added the government will \"help you rebuild and maintain all the business and commerce that's here now\".\nAlong with killing six workers, the collapse trapped a massive ship in one of the busiest ports on the East Coast, used by companies such as Amazon. \nSo far, $60m (\u00a347.4m) has been earmarked for the clean-up effort. \nThe final cost of clearing the waterway and rebuilding the bridge is likely to be far higher, with some lawmakers estimating it could rise to hundreds of millions of dollars. One, Maryland Democrat David Trone, told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that he believes the cost could be as high as $1bn. \nOn Friday, Mr Biden re-iterated a previous commitment to help Baltimore fund the recovery process and rebuilding effort. \n\"I fully intend...that the federal government [will] cover the cost of building this entire bridge. All of it,\" he said, calling on Congress to authorize funding \"as soon as possible\". \nA few hours after the president's remarks, officials in Baltimore announced that dive teams had recovered the body of a third construction work at the site of the bridge collapse. \nThe body of Maynor Yasir Suazo-Sandoval was found at around 10:30 local time on Friday, Unified Command said.\nThe bodies of two other victims - Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes, 35, and Dorlian Ronial Castillo Cabrera, 26, were recovered last week. \nThe remaining three victims have not yet been found, but Colonel Roland Butler Jr, the superintendent of Maryland Department of State Police, said he was \"fully committed to finding closure for each of these families.\"\nDuring his visit, Mr Biden, who has family ties to the city, took an aerial tour of the collapsed area alongside Maryland Governor Wes Moore and other senior officials involved in the salvage effort, before meeting with emergency personnel. \nSpeaking in the Baltimore suburb of Dundalk - with the cargo ship, the Dali, and the ruined bridge clearly visible - Mr Biden said the federal government will \"move heaven and earth\" to rebuild the bridge \"as rapidly as humanly possible\". \nHe added that the reconstruction effort will be done with \"union labour and American steel.\" \nThe port is a vital economic hub that is linked to more than 15,000 jobs.\n\"Folks, we all need to step up,\" he added, \"Amazon, Home Depot...and other companies all rely on this port, and they have committed to keep workers on payrolls.\" \nIn his remarks, Mr Biden also directed a message to the families of the \"working, strong, selfless\" men who died in the accident, with whom he was also scheduled to meet during his visit. All six were immigrants from Mexico and Central America. \n\"Never forget the contributions these men made to this city,\" he said. \"We're going to keep working hard to recover each of them.\" \nIn a 5 April letter to senior members of House and Senate committees focused on infrastructure, transportation, public works and the environment, Office of Management and Budget Director Shalonda Young wrote that the administration would pursue \"all avenues to recover the costs of past, current and future work\". \nIn the wake of the crash, the \"unified command\" responsible for the response opened two smaller temporary shipping channels in the area to allow limited maritime traffic to pass through.\nBy the end of April, officials hope to open a limited access channel 280ft (80m) wide and 35ft (10m) deep to allow one-way traffic for barge containers and some other vessels that carry cars and equipment.\nThe entire, permanent channel is expected to be clear and ready for use by the end of May, the unified command said in a statement earlier this week. \nThat timeline, however, may change due to weather and unexpected complications with the salvage effort. \n\"This is going to take time,\" Mr Biden said.

    "Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas have been at war since early October. \nIt began when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on Israel from Gaza - the deadliest in Israel's history. \nAn Israeli military campaign has followed, which has killed thousands in the Palestinian territory.\nOn the morning of 7 October, waves of Hamas gunmen stormed across Gaza's border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people. Hamas also fired thousands of rockets. \nThose killed included children, the elderly and 364 young people at a music festival.\u202f \nHamas took more than 250 others to Gaza as hostages.\nThe BBC has also seen evidence of rape and sexual violence during the Hamas attacks.\u202f \nHamas became the sole ruler of Gaza after violently ejecting political rivals in 2007.\nIt has an armed wing and was thought to have about 30,000 fighters before the start of the war.\nThe group, whose name stands for Islamic Resistance Movement, wants to create an Islamic state in place of Israel. Hamas rejects Israel's right to exist and is committed to its destruction. \nHamas justified its attack as a response to what it calls Israeli crimes against the Palestinian people. \nThese include security raids on Islam's third holiest site - the al-Aqsa Mosque, in occupied East Jerusalem - and Jewish settlement activity in the occupied West Bank.  \nHamas also wants thousands of Palestinian prisoners in Israel to be freed and for an end to the blockade of the Gaza Strip by Israel and Egypt - something both countries say is for security. \nIt has fought several wars with Israel since it took power, fired thousands of rockets and carried out many other deadly attacks.  \nIsrael has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes and sent troops into Gaza in 2008 and 2014. \nHamas, or in some cases its armed wing alone, is considered a terrorist group by Israel, the US, the EU, and the UK, among others. \nIran backs Hamas with funding, weapons and training.\nIsrael immediately began a massive campaign of air strikes on targets in Gaza, in response to the Hamas attack. \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's aims were the destruction of Hamas and the return of the hostages.  \nIsrael launched a ground invasion three weeks later. It has also bombarded Gaza from the sea. \nAttacks were initially focused on northern Gaza, particularly Gaza City and tunnels beneath it, which Israel said were the centre of military operations by Hamas. \nAll 1.1 million people living in the north were ordered by Israel to evacuate south for their safety. \nFollowing a temporary truce in late November, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) extended ground operations to southern Gaza.  \nTroops reached the heart of the second biggest city, Khan Younis, where the IDF said it believed top Hamas commanders were hiding. The IDF also pushed into refugee camps in central Gaza.\nMore than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed, and tens of thousands injured by Israeli strikes since the start of the war, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. It says most were women and children.   \nMr Netanyahu said in March that 13,000 Palestinian fighters had been killed, while about a month earlier the IDF said it had killed about 9,000 Hamas fighters, in addition to more than 1,000 of the attackers inside Israel on 7 October. It has not said how it came to this figure. \nIsrael says more than 250 of its soldiers have been killed in Gaza.\nHomes and other buildings in Gaza have suffered from extensive damage and destruction.  \nMost of the 253 men, women and children abducted by Hamas were civilians. \nThey included elderly people and those with disabilities and medical conditions. The youngest was nine months old. \nIn Gaza, Hamas hid them in tunnels and fighters' homes. Unconfirmed reports suggest some have been held by other militant groups. \nDuring November's truce, 105 hostages (81 Israelis and dual nationals, and 24 foreigners) were released in exchange for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.\nFour hostages had previously been freed by Hamas and three rescued by the IDF - one on 29 October and two on 12 February.\nThree hostages were accidentally killed by Israeli troops who mistook them for Hamas fighters. \nThe UN and aid agencies say Gaza is suffering severe shortages of food and other essentials including fuel and medicine. This is particularly acute in northern Gaza, where it is especially difficult to deliver aid which enters the territory from the south.\nA UN-backed report says the situation across Gaza is turning into a man-made famine. A number of children have starved to death in northern Gaza, the UN says.\nHumanitarian agencies and Israel have blamed each other. Agencies say Israeli security checks on aid going into Gaza are complex and arbitrary, causing major delays. Israel denies impeding aid and says agencies are failing to distribute the aid that is allowed in.\nHowever Israel has agreed to open a crossing into northern Gaza and allow its nearby port of Ashdod to receive shipments ",
    "Thames Water has seen its troubles deepen after its parent company defaulted on part of its huge debt pile.\nKemble Water has formally told lenders it failed to meet a deadline to pay interest on \u00a3400m of debt due on Tuesday.\nThe water giant has also asked lenders not to take any action as it explores its options.\nThames Water's 16 million customers will not be affected.\nThis notification confirms an announcement on 28 March that Kemble would be unable to repay its lenders as interest and principal payments - including a loan repayment of \u00a3190m due at the end of April - come up.\nIt has issued a formal notice to its bondholders, but asked them to take \"no creditor action\" in order to enable a \"stable platform\" for negotiations. Companies sell bonds to investors to raise the funds they need, paying the money back over time with a premium.\nBeing in default renders Kemble Water effectively insolvent but that will not affect the underlying utility business that supplies water and waste services to 1 in 4 people in the UK.\nThe company has been engulfed by a crisis which has seen shareholders refuse to pay a \u00a3500m lifeline injection that would have shored up its finances, as well as fierce criticism over Thames Water's handling of leaks and sewage treatment.\nThe future of Thames Water has been uncertain since fears emerged that it could collapse last June, with the latest developments raising questions around a potential restructure.\nThe company has been struggling with debts of \u00a314.7bn.\nBut the new boss of Thames Water - and the regulator Ofwat - insist that the company has enough cash and overdraft facilities to see it through to May of next year. \nWhile the dominos are falling at the parent company, these will fall short of triggering a collapse.\nHowever, at some point Thames Water will need to raise new money. The current shareholders which include UK and Canadian pension funds as well as Chinese and Gulf State investors pulled the planned \u00a3500m cash injection when Ofwat rejected proposals to raise customer bills by 40% above inflation by 2030.\nKemble, which is funded entirely through dividends paid out by Thames Water, said it expects it will be able to provide a further update in \"the coming weeks\".\nRegardless of what happens, water supplies to Thames Water's customers will continue as normal.",
    "Arsenal footballer Oleksandr Zinchenko says he would leave the UK to fight in Ukraine if he was called up.\nThe 27-year-old told BBC Newsnight he has donated about \u00a31m to help people in his home country since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.\nHe said Ukraine has become a \"shield\" for Europe and called for more support.\nOn Wednesday, the country's president signed into law a bill lowering the military mobilisation age from 27 to 25.\nThis would allow the country to call up more people to replenish its reserves and comes after President Volodymyr Zelensky said in December that the country would need 500,000 more soldiers to be mobilised.\nBBC Newsnight asked the footballer whether he would answer a call-up to fight, if he saw more value in that than staying to play football in the Premier League.  \n\"I think it's a clear answer. I would go [to fight]\", he said.\nHe added that he had former school friends fighting on the frontline.\n\"It's tough to understand that just recently we've been in the same school, we were playing in the playground or on the football pitch, and now they have to defend our country,\" he said.\n\"And, honestly, [it's] so hard to accept this, but it is what it is. We cannot give up.\"\nMr Zinchenko said the situation in the country is \"super tough\" but he and his family were \"proud of our president\".\n\"I know maybe some people might think that it's much easier \u2026 for me being here [in London] rather than being there [in Ukraine].

And my kids will teach their kids. This is not acceptable.\"\nIn February, President Zelensky said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed during Russia's full-scale invasion and tens of thousands of civilians had died in areas of the country occupied by Russia.\nIn the first few days of the invasion, Mr Zinchenko said he sent money to help refugees in Ukraine, and his donations have amounted to over \u00a31m.\nHe added that he knows of hundreds of children whose parents have died in the war.\nThe Arsenal star said: \"What is my duty now?

    "Two senior Israeli military officers have been sacked after seven aid workers were killed in missile strikes in the Gaza Strip. \nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) called the killing of staff from World Central Kitchen (WCK) a \"grave accident\". \nDrone operators did not follow rules and thought WCK's cars were carrying Hamas gunmen, its inquiry says.\nWCK called the IDF's apology \"cold comfort\" for the aid workers' families and urged an independent investigation.\nThe IDF launched an internal investigation into the deaths after coming under intense international pressure to explain the circumstances.\nIts findings were published on Friday alongside an admission of \"serious failure\" and the announcement that an IDF colonel and major were being dismissed as a result.\nThree commanders have been formally reprimanded for their overall responsibility in the strikes, which the IDF said were carried out in breach of army rules.\nThe IDF said those who carried out the attack could also face criminal prosecution. \nIn the space of four minutes on 1 April, seven people working for WCK were killed when three missiles destroyed their cars one by one.\nThe charity's team had been authorised by the Israeli military to help transfer aid supplies from the coast to a warehouse, but a series of mistakes and miscommunications on the part of the IDF made them a target.\nIn a briefing for journalists on how the incident played out, the IDF said its drone operator identified what appeared to be a gunman on top of one of the aid trucks being escorted by WCK.\nAfter the aid convoy reached its warehouse destination, a car carrying what the IDF said were gunmen headed north, while the WCK aid workers began driving south in vehicles marked with the charity's logo.\nThe investigation found those markings were not visible at night, and attempts to contact the aid workers failed.\nAfter a drone operator mistook a bag being held by an aid worker for a gun, the military unit began targeting it with missile strikes.\nThe IDF's internal investigation also found:\nThe unit involved in the attack has been suspended from duties and evidence has been passed on to the Military Advocate General, the Israeli army's top legal authority, the IDF said.\nIn response, World Central Kitchen said the IDF had taken \"important steps forward\" by disciplining those involved in the attack but called for an independent investigation. \nA statement read: \"It is also clear from their preliminary investigation that the IDF has deployed deadly force without regard to its own protocols, chain of command and rules of engagement.\n\"We demand the creation of an independent commission to investigate the killings of our WCK colleagues. The IDF cannot credibly investigate its own failure in Gaza.\"\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington was carefully reviewing the inquiry and would assess what steps Israel was taking \"to ensure that something like this can never happen again\".\nPoland's Deputy Foreign Minister Andrzej Szejna demanded a criminal inquiry. One of the seven aid workers killed was a Polish national.\nThe deaths have contributed to growing international anger at how Israel is conducting the war, which has led to calls for countries to stop supplying Israel with weapons in recent days.\nOn Thursday, US President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Washington's ongoing support was contingent on more aid being allowed into Gaza and additional measures being introduced to protect aid workers.\nIsrael later said it had approved the opening of two routes into Gaza for humanitarian deliveries. It is not clear when these would be opened or under what conditions.\nThe Erez Gate in northern Gaza will be reopened for the first time since the start of the war, and the Israeli container port of Ashdod - which is close to Gaza - will accept humanitarian supplies. More aid from Jordan will also be allowed to enter via the Kerem Shalom Crossing. \nThere are serious concerns about the welfare of Gazans after aid organisations suspended their operations in the wake of Monday's attack. \nThe United Nations (UN) has warned an estimated 1.1 million people - half the population - are facing catastrophic hunger because of Israeli restrictions on aid deliveries, the ongoing hostilities and the breakdown of order.\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said 196 aid workers had died since the conflict began and called for a \"meaningful increase\" in the amount of supplies allowed into Gaza.\nMeanwhile, the head of Hezbollah in Lebanon - which is closely allied with Iran - said Tehran would soon respond to an air strike on its diplomatic compound in Syria, which killed a senior general. Israel is widely believed to be behind the strike.\nIsrael has taken steps to prepare for a potential Iranian response, including blocking GPS in much of the country in an effort to hinder guided missiles and drones.\nOn Friday, Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah said: \"The Iranian response is co",
    "Arsenal footballer Oleksandr Zinchenko says he would leave the UK to fight in Ukraine if he was called up.\nThe 27-year-old told BBC Newsnight he has donated about \u00a31m to help people in his home country since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.\nHe said Ukraine has become a \"shield\" for Europe and called for more support.\nOn Wednesday, the country's president signed into law a bill lowering the military mobilisation age from 27 to 25.\nThis would allow the country to call up more people to replenish its reserves and comes after President Volodymyr Zelensky said in December that the country would need 500,000 more soldiers to be mobilised.\nBBC Newsnight asked the footballer whether he would answer a call-up to fight, if he saw more value in that than staying to play football in the Premier League.  \n\"I think it's a clear answer. I would go [to fight]\", he said.\nHe added that he had former school friends fighting on the frontline.\n\"It's tough to understand that just recently we've been in the same school, we were playing in the playground or on the football pitch, and now they have to defend our country,\" he said.\n\"And, honestly, [it's] so hard to accept this, but it is what it is. We cannot give up.\"\nMr Zinchenko said the situation in the country is \"super tough\" but he and his family were \"proud of our president\".\n\"I know maybe some people might think that it's much easier \u2026 for me being here [in London] rather than being there [in Ukraine]. I really hope that this war will end soon,\" he said.\nThe Arsenal defender began his football career with Russian team Ufa in 2016, and said he no longer talks to his friends or former teammates that are in Russia.\n\"Since the invasion really few [have] texted mebut I stopped any communication since February 2022. They sent me some messages and I can't blame them because this is not their fault,\" he said.\n\"I cannot tell them, 'Guys, do the protests outside and all these things', because I know they can be [put] in prison.\n\"But I have a question to the people of Russia - how do you live in the country where you don't have a freedom of speech at all?\"\nHe said Russians used to call Ukrainians their \"brothers\" and \"sisters\", but the invasion has shown \"all of us Ukrainians that we can't be friends with them any more\".\n\"We will never forget what they have done to us, to our people,\" he said. \"And that's what I will teach my kids as well. And my kids will teach their kids. This is not acceptable.\"\nIn February, President Zelensky said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed during Russia's full-scale invasion and tens of thousands of civilians had died in areas of the country occupied by Russia.\nIn the first few days of the invasion, Mr Zinchenko said he sent money to help refugees in Ukraine, and his donations have amounted to over \u00a31m.\nHe added that he knows of hundreds of children whose parents have died in the war.\nThe Arsenal star said: \"What is my duty now? How can I help as much as I can to my country, to my people, over there and all these things?\n\"I can't be more proud than I am right now to be Ukrainian.\n\"I have a dream that this war will end very, very soon, and we can rebuild our Ukraine like we really want [to].\"\nAdditional reporting by Tetiana Kharchenko and Jasmin Dyer.\nWatch the full interview on BBC Newsnight on BBC2 at 22:30 GMT and on BBC iPlayer.",
    "Plans to restore a historic theatre building in Derby have been set out after it was at risk of becoming dilapidated. \nGuildhall Theatre in Market Place had been disused since 2019 and needed \u00a310m of repairs to prevent it from falling into disrepair, the city council said.  \nWork on the Grade II listed building is expected to cost \u00a324.55m, partially funded by Levelling Up funding. \nRestoration works are expected to begin in 2025 and be complete by late 2027. \nIt follows the injection of \u00a320m from the government's Levelling Up fund, which will be evenly split between the council and Derby Theatre, owned by the University of Derby, also set for a revamp. \nDerby City Council's cabinet is due to agree terms for the use of funding in a meeting next week. \nThe authority said it expects the projects will bring \u00a32.7m per year to the local economy.\nAccording to the council, the Guildhall restoration includes a new ground floor caf\u00e9 and box office, a remodelled auditorium with more seating, refurbished dressing rooms and a new service lift included in the improvements. \nA new courtyard is also planned to be created adjacent to the city's Market Hall, which is also undergoing an extensive renovation. \nWork will also be carried out at 30 and 31 Market Place, which adjoins the historic Guildhall, the authority said.\nIt will be funded by the Levelling Up grant and \u00a314.55m from the council's capital budget. \nDerby Theatre's \u00a310m share of the Levelling Up funding will be used to complete a \"state-of-the-art new accessible studio theatre and learning and research hub\". \nNadine Peatfield, deputy leader of the city council, said the authority was \"on a mission to put culture at the heart of [the] city\".\n\"By bringing the Guildhall Theatre back into use, we can not only restore one of our historic buildings but create more space for community-led arts groups to perform right in Derby's cultural heart,\" she said. \nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

Economists had forecast job gains of about 200,000.\nAnalysts said the strong figures could delay cuts to US interest rates. \nThe US central bank's key interest rate is currently at the highest level in more than two decades, in a range of 5.25%-5.5%. \nAnalysts have expected the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates this year to avoid a harsh slowdown triggered by high borrowing costs. \nBut a stronger-than-expected economy has raised doubts about how soon those cuts might come. \n\"The blockbuster 303,000 increase in non-farm payrolls in March supports the Fed's position that the resilience of the economy means it can take its time with rate cuts, which might now not begin until the second half of this year,\" said Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics. \nThe Fed raised interest rates sharply in 2022 to try to slow the economy and ease the pressures that were pushing up prices at the fastest rate in decades. \nPrice inflation in the US has since cooled, dropping to 3.2% in February, without the big jump in unemployment some had feared would follow the rise in borrowing costs. \nEconomists said the labour market has been helped by government spending in areas such as high tech manufacturing and infrastructure.\nAn influx of more than three million immigrants last year has also added to the workforce, which analysts say may be helping to keep a lid on wages, allowing the jobs boom to proceed without reigniting inflation. \nIn March, the average hourly pay was up 4.1% from a year earlier, roughly in line with expectations and near a three-year low. \nPresident Joe Biden hailed the latest figures as a \"milestone in America's comeback\".\nBut Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, warned that the strong jobs growth could make returning the inflation rate to the Fed's 2% target difficult. \nThe report signals that \"the economy has plenty of excess energy that may need to be tamed by continued higher rates,\" she said, noting that some analysts are now betting rate cuts will not come until 2025.  \nHigher interest rates in the US have put pressure on economies around the world, as they entice investors to America and away from other countries. \n\"The Federal Reserve's dashboard still has some warning lights to deal with before signalling the all-clear for cutting,\" she said.

    "Food charity World Central Kitchen (WCK) has called for an independent investigation into the killing of seven of its staff by Israeli drone strikes in Gaza.\nIt comes after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said \"grave mistakes\" led to the fatal targeting of the workers.\nAn Israeli military inquiry led to two senior officers being dismissed.\nHowever, the CEO of the aid group said the Israeli military \"cannot credibly investigate its own failure in Gaza\".\nIn a statement, Erin Gore continued: \"[The IDF's] apologies for the outrageous killing of our colleagues represent cold comfort. It's cold comfort for the victims' families and WCK's global family.\"\nShe said Israel must take \"concrete steps\" to ensure the safety of aid workers operating on the ground in Gaza, where several organisations have suspended operations in light of the deaths.\nIsrael is under pressure from key Western partners to publish the full findings of its investigation, which have not been made public.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had received the Israeli report and was \"reviewing it very carefully\". He said the US will be \"looking to see not just what steps are being taken, but the results that follow from them\".\nThe Biden administration is facing mounting pressure from some Democrats over its military support to Israel. On Friday, more than three dozen members of Congress, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, signed a letter urging the US president and Mr Blinken to \"reconsider\" the authorisation of an arms package transfer to Israel.\nThe letter called for the US to withhold further arms transfers pending an investigation into the airstrike that killed the aid workers, or if Israel \"fails to sufficiently mitigate harm to innocent civilians in Gaza.\"\nIn the space of four minutes on 1 April, the seven aid workers were killed when three missiles destroyed their cars one by one as they engaged in humanitarian work.\nThe charity's team had been authorised by the Israeli military to help transfer aid supplies from the coast to a warehouse. The IDF said a series of mistakes and miscommunications resulted in them being mistaken for Hamas operatives and targeted.\nIsrael's military said a \"number of armed gunmen\" were in the vicinity of the convoy, but drone operators wrongly tracked cars carrying aid workers.\nThe army apologised after admitting its soldiers did not follow protocols and were not given crucial information about the pre-approved aid mission.\nAs well as the dismissal of a colonel and a major, three IDF commanders have been formally reprimanded and the drone unit responsible has been suspended.\nUK Foreign Secretary Lord David Cameron said British officials were \"carefully reviewing the initial findings\" and called the dismissal of two officers a \"first step\". \nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, he said: \"These findings must be published in full and followed up with a wholly independent review to ensure utmost transparency and accountability.\"\nAdditional material from the IDF investigation - including video footage purporting to show a Hamas gunman on top of an aid lorry - was shown to journalists in a private briefing ahead of the IDF's public apology, but only a summary of the findings has been made publicly available. \nThe Israeli investigation was carried out via a pre-existing disciplinary procedure which deals with allegations of military misconduct, and was overseen by a reservist major general. \nIDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari described the report as being carried out by a \"professional, independent body that is outside of the chain of command\".\nOn Friday, he told a press conference the findings would be made public in a \"clear and transparent manner\" after being presented in full to WCK and representatives of countries whose citizens were killed in the incident. \nHe said IDF soldiers were \"certain they were targeting Hamas\" but described the strikes as a \"tragedy\" stemming from a \"terrible chain of errors\".\nAlso on Friday, United Nations Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said 196 aid workers had died in Gaza since the conflict began, adding \"we want to know why each of them was killed\". \nHe told a press conference: \"The Israeli government has acknowledged mistakes - but the essential problem is not who made the mistakes, it is the military strategy and procedures in place that allow for those mistakes to multiply time and time again.\n\"Fixing those failures requires independent investigations and meaningful and measurable changes on the ground.\"\nThe deaths have contributed to growing international pressure over how Israel is conducting the war, which has led to calls for countries to stop supplying Israel with weapons in recent days.\nOn Thursday, US President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Washington's ongoing support was contingent on more aid being allowed into Gaza and additional measures being introduced to protect aid workers.\nIsrael later said it had approved the open",

    "Unpaid carers in Northern Ireland are being left behind as a new employment law comes into force in the rest of the UK, campaigners say.\nThe law gives those caring for sick or disabled relatives or friends a right to five days' annual, unpaid leave.\nIt does not cover Northern Ireland as employment rules are devolved.\nThe Department for the Economy said it intends to bring forward an employment rights bill and that the right to carer's leave will be considered.\nBut charity Carers NI said one in three local carers are leaving work because of caring demands.\nThe charity has urged the economy minister to provide paid leave for carers in Northern Ireland.\nThere are more than 220,000 people providing unpaid care for sick or disabled family members and friends in Northern Ireland.\nHelen Todd's role as an unpaid carer started in 2012 when her son Josh was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of four. \nShe and her husband David shared the caring responsibilities, but in 2017 David was diagnosed with brain cancer and severe-acquired brain injury. \nHelen then became a sole carer for them both while working full-time.\n\"It was relentless,\" she said.\n\"It was overnight care. It was care during the day. It was hospital appointments. It was reviews. It was medical care.\n\"I used to joke about the fact that I would go to my full-time paid job to escape and have a break from my unpaid caring job, which was my other full-time job,\" she said. \nThe 42-year-old said she was \"keeping two people alive\".\n\"I wasn't being paid, it wasn't a choice. I was becoming an expert in people's care,\" she said.\nIn May 2023, David, who is now 44, went into a care home and Helen re-evaluated her life.\nDespite loving her work and the company she was working for, she took a career break.\n\"Caring relentlessly for two people for six years and working full-time had taken its toll on me,\" she said.\n\"I was mentally and physically exhausted.\" \nThe Bangor woman started her own business, which meant she could work her own hours as well as make time for herself.\n\"I could go to the gym. I could go for a walk if I wanted to,\" she said.\nShe said she no longer had to rely on the generosity of her employers to give her short notice leave or to understand her situation.\nHelen told Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme that carer's leave would have made a difference.\nShe \"used to dread\" getting an email or letter with another hospital appointment or review for David or Josh, and she allocated her annual leave \"very carefully\" to ensure she could cover their care, while also working out how to take time for herself.\n\"Knowing you've got time allocated where you're able to go 'that's for that hospital appointment' and you can use annual leave to do something nice for yourself is incredible.\"\nFrom 6 April 2024, employees in England, Scotland, and Wales will be entitled to unpaid leave to give or arrange care for a 'dependant' who has:\nThe dependant does not have to be a family member. It can be anyone who relies on them for care.\nEmployees are entitled to carer's leave from their first day of work for their employer. Their employment rights (like holidays and returning to their job) are protected during carer's leave.\nEmployees can take up to one week of leave every 12 months.\nCarers NI said the new law represents \"a landmark change\" which is going to benefit many unpaid carers. \nBut Craig Harrison from the organisation said it is also \"financially penalising people for taking time away from work to provide care\".\nCampaigners in Northern Ireland not only want to see parity with the rest of the United Kingdom, but Mr Harrison said: \"There's a really significant moral, financial and economic case for the economy minister to go one step further and to deliver that leave on a paid basis\".\n\"Every year we see thousands of people across Northern Ireland who are forced out of work entirely, because that juggling act is too difficult,\" he said.\n\"Introducing some form of paid carer's leave could be a real game changer for those people and it would really give them the time and the space that they need to make their loved ones health appointments and other caring needs fit around work, without burning themselves out or without having to leave their jobs as a result.\" \nNatasha McClelland, from Coleraine, works full-time and cares for two children who both have complex needs.\nHer employer does provide extra support for staff with caring roles, giving her a \"security net\" and making an important difference to her being able to stay in a job. \n\"When caring emergencies happen, my stress levels are massive but knowing that I can use carer's leave means I can focus on that without worrying about work or losing wages ,\" she told BBC Radio Foyle.\n\"At the same time, this isn't a legal right in Northern Ireland and it very much limits career progression, because I know that other workplaces don't have the same policies or protections in place.\"\nBut she said it was time for politi",
    "It was 25 years ago when Kate Russo saw her very first total solar eclipse. \nThe Australian psychologist was living in Northern Ireland at the time and had always wanted to witness the spectacle in person.\nShe was in between her Masters and PhD studies in her 20s when, in 1999, the path of totality happened to cross nearby over the southern coast of France. \n\"I thought it was going to be just my first - my only - experience of an eclipse,\" Ms Russo said. \"Something you haven't experienced and then you do and you're like, 'that's pretty cool.'\"\nInstead, what she saw that day changed her life forever, sparking a life-long journey of studying and chasing solar eclipses around the globe. \nOn Monday, Ms Russo will watch her 14th total solar eclipse, this time in Uvalde, Texas. She is one of many eclipse chasers who have arrived in North America in recent days. \nExperts estimate that more than a million people from inside and outside North America will travel towards the path of totality. \nMany are individuals who have combined their love of astronomy, exploration, science and travel into a mission to see as many eclipses in their lifetime as possible. \nSome are driven by their love of space and desire to understand the universe around them. Others, like Ms Russo, pursue the indescribable feeling that comes with seeing a total solar eclipse in person. \nThe 51-year-old recalled how standing in the shadow of the moon for the first time was an \"immersive and emotional\" experience.\nA total solar eclipse, by definition, occurs when the moon's shadow covers the sun's rays entirely, plunging those in the shadow's path into darkness for a few minutes. \nBut Ms Russo said experiencing it was much more than that.\nShe described feeling a drop in temperature and the wind picking up around her, as if a storm was approaching. She also noticed the colours of her surroundings being drained in the absence of the sun's rays, except for an orange, reddish glow around the horizon and a thin ring of light in the sky - also known as the corona. \n\"Moments before you're looking at the sun,\" she said of the moment the eclipse begins. \"Now, there's just a hole in the sky where the sun should be. It's like everything is turned upside down.\"\nMs Russo said the experience inspired her to study people's emotional response to witnessing a total solar eclipse.\nAlmost always, she said, there is a predictable sequence in which people take in an eclipse: it begins with a sense of wrongness and primal fear, followed by a feeling of connectedness and insignificance. Then comes the euphoria, and the desire to repeat those feelings all over again. \nEven those who are more scientifically minded, she noticed, can't help but stare at an eclipse with awe. \n\"Regardless of culture or your language, people have that same experience and it makes them feel part of something greater.\" \nIt is a feeling that David Makepeace, another eclipse chaser from Toronto, Canada, knows very well. \nMr Makepeace, 61, who is about to catch his 19th solar eclipse, said the experience evokes existential questions for him. \n\"How could we possibly live in a solar system that is that beautiful? That has that much of an emotional punch to it?\" he's wondered. \"How could that possibly be?\"  \nPaul Maley, a 76-year-old retired data analyst and flight control specialist who worked at NASA for 41 years, said the desire to chase an eclipse is akin to an addiction of sorts.\n\"Once you get to see something that is this unique, you want more of it,\" he said. \nMr Maley, who lives in Arizona, has seen 83 eclipses since 1970 - including annular, partial and total solar eclipses - across 42 countries. \nHis love of chasing them inspired him to launch a tourism company which takes dozens of people on trips to see eclipses around the world. Some of his guests are seasoned, he said. Others are catching their very first eclipse. \nTo mark the 8 April event, Mr Maley launched a boat cruise off the coast of Cabo San Lucas in Mexico with nearly 200 passengers. \nBeing on the water gives him mobility should the cloud cover change, he said, offering him the best possible chance of capturing a spectacular eclipse. \nAlso en route to Mexico is British eclipse chaser and retired material scientist Patrick Poitevin, who is on a quest to catch his 26th total solar eclipse. \nMr Poitevin, who lives in Derbyshire, said he often tries to combine his love of scientific innovation and astronomy when chasing eclipses - challenging himself with different projects or views for each one he catches. \nBut for this upcoming eclipse, he said he intends to sit back and watch with only a pair of binoculars in hand. \nMr Poitevin noted how this particular eclipse is slated to last four and a half minutes in Mexico. This, he said, will give him and others the chance to take in the view - maybe spot a few planets, stars, and even a comet. \nFor those catching their first-ever solar eclipse this year, the seasoned chasers had one piece of",

This has been increased to \u00a380,000.\nIt won't start to be reduced until one parent earns more than \u00a360,000 - up from \u00a350,000. \nPayments are reduced as a result of the High Income Child Benefit Charge (HICBC). \nThe HICBC rules have been criticised for unfairly penalising single parents and families with one high earner. \nA household where two parents earn \u00a360,000 - with a total household income of \u00a3120,000 - can get the full amount. \nBut if a household has one parent who earns just above \u00a360,000, their child benefit will be be reduced, and cut altogether once they earn more than \u00a380,000.  \nIn the Budget, Mr Hunt also announced a consultation about letting HMRC collect information about all the adults in the child's house. \nThis would mean that from April 2026, child benefit claims would be based on total household income instead of the highest earner's wage - a move that has been broadly welcomed.\nYou can claim child benefit 48 hours after you've registered a birth, or as soon as a child comes to live with you.\nIf you claim at a later point, payments can be backdated for up to three months.\nYou can claim online, by post or by phone.\nYou need the following documents:\nClaiming child benefit for a child under the age of 12 means you automatically get National Insurance (NI) credits, which count towards your state pension.\nThese credits can help fill gaps in your NI record if you're not working or if you don't earn enough to pay NI contributions.\nThe government advises that you should still fill in the child benefit claim form, even if you opt out of getting payments, so that you can get NI credits.\nDoing so also means your child will automatically get an NI number when they turn 16. Otherwise they will have to apply for one.\nIf a family splits up, the amount of child benefit paid depends on how many children there are, and where they live. \nIf you have two children and one stays with each parent, you would both get \u00a325.60 a week for each child. \nIf you share custody of one or more children, only one of you can claim child benefit for them. \nThe eldest will still be entitled to \u00a325.60 and any younger children will get \u00a316.95 each. \nIf two families join together, the eldest child in the new family qualifies for the higher rate, and any other eligible children get the smaller amount.

    "Parents of some children who visited a south Wales hospital are being contacted by health officials after two measles cases were confirmed in the area.\nPublic Health Wales said it was contacting parents of children who attended the children's emergency assessment unit (CEAU) at The Grange University Hospital in Cwmbran, Torfaen, \"at specific times\" over the Easter weekend.\nParents who do not receive a text message do not need to take any action, the health body said.\nMeasles is a highly contagious disease which is spread by coughs and sneezes.\nIt can be prevented through the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination.\nBeverley Griggs, public health consultant for Public Health Wales, said the two confirmed measles cases were \"in the Gwent area\". \n\"As part of our investigations, we have identified a number of patients who attended the CEAU at Grange Hospital at specific times between 30 March and 2 April,\" she said.\n\u201cThe parents of these patients will receive a text message with a link with further information about what they should look out for in their children, and what they should do if they have concerns.\"\nMs Griggs said contacts who had not received the MMR vaccine were at \"increased risk\" of measles and would therefore be asked to stay away from school, nursery of childcare settings for two weeks.  \n\"This is routine public health action and is intended to prevent further transmission of the infection,\" she said.\n\u201cIf you do not receive a text message from us, then please be reassured that you do not need to take any action or be concerned.\n\u201cHowever, we are reminding parents that measles is highly contagious and can have serious consequences, particularly for young children.  It is therefore important that anyone who was exposed to the infection is vigilant for any symptoms in their children.\u201d\nCommon symptoms of measles include a high fever, sore and red eyes, coughing, and sneezing.\nSmall white spots may also appear inside the mouth.\nA blotchy red or brown rash usually appears after a few days, typically on the face and behind the ears, before spreading to the rest of the body.\nMeasles normally clears up within seven to 10 days. However, complications can include pneumonia, meningitis, blindness and seizures.\nBabies and young children, pregnant women and those with a weakened immune system are at increased risk.\n",

    "He's the Steps star who's sold millions of records - but could Ian H Watkins really be getting a 5, 6, 7, 8ft statue in his honour in a genteel Welsh town?\nHis H nickname stands for hyperactive, but some in Cowbridge are asking if the relevant H is at the start of hoax.\nAfter the story went viral, comedian Joe Lycett hinted he may just be behind it, revealing he has been \"seeding silly fake news\" to the media.\nAnd tragedy or not, the council has had no application for an 8ft H statue.\nThe group behind the proposals is said to go by the name Cultural Cowbridge - although BBC Wales inquiries failed to find anyone who had heard of it.\nAccording to those reports, the statue would go up outside The Bear Hotel in the centre of the Vale of Glamorgan town.\nBut The Bear owner Julian Hitchcock said he had no inkling, and it \"ruined my cereal\" when he heard his hotel mentioned when the story was discussed on BBC Radio 2. \nThe singer has been with Steps since the five-piece released their debut single 5, 6, 7, 8 in 1997, and went on to years of chart success with hits like Tragedy. These days he is also a possibly unlikely member of Cowbridge with Llanblethian Town Council, and to prove it, his photo is on the council's website alongside the other members. \nIn a post on Instagram the 47-year-old - who is originally from the Rhondda Cynon Taf village of Cwmparc - said he was \"absolutely bowled over\" by the statue idea.\nHe said: \"Super proud of this! It'll be a little strange seeing myself across the street when I pop into town!\n\"If little Ian, from the Rhondda could see this, he would be blown away! Thanks to everyone for your wonderful messages!\"\nFellow singers were quick to congratulate him, with Sophie Ellis Bextor writing: \"Amazing! Congratulations\", Debbie Gibson posting: \"I'm coming to take a picture with your statue someday. But not before I meet the real you! Congrats!\", and Myleene Klass adding: \"This is incredible!\"\nBut Mr Hitchcock admitted he would be shocked if the statue did appear in \"sleepy old Cowbridge\" - a market town once described by The Sunday Times as the best place to live in Wales.\n\"But the pavement outside the hotel is nothing to do with me,\" said Mr Hitchcock. \"So, if the council see fit to deem H worthy of a statue then so be it. H has done lots of good things for Cowbridge. \n\"As have lots of other people.\"\nCowbridge singer and actor Aubrey Parsons believed it was \"a wind-up\".\n\"I don't think anyone has ever heard of the group Cultural Cowbridge,\" he said.\nThere were, he thought, others \"more deserving of a statue\", even though he said H had done a lot for the town, including founding the town's Pride event in 2022.\nBut he did not believe it: \"It can't be right, it's up there with the spaghetti trees and the Cottingley fairies.\"\nEliza Hogg, social media manager for Cowbridge's Jon Ian boutique, said it was the \"talk of the town\".\n\"I don't know if it's a hoax, I thought it's close to April Fool's so maybe it's that,\" she said.\nMae Ballantyne, a resident for 49 years, had never heard of Cultural Cowbridge.\n\"I hope it's a hoax as there are more deserving people,\" she said. \"Because otherwise you'll have a crowd of old ladies knocking down statues and tearing up chairs.\"\nDuke of Wellington pub assistant manager Andy Ingram said: \"H is a great personality, he's always chirpy and always got time for a chat when he comes in the pub. \n\"But I don't think the statue should be outside The Bear. It needs to be near the town hall. Maybe on the Pride bench and people could have a photo on there with the statue.\"\nLynne Chamberlain, who lives opposite The Bear, would oppose any statue plans. She called it \"a stupid idea\" and believed an H statue should go elsewhere: \"Then I wouldn't have to look at it every morning\".\nSuzanne Cumpston, of Cowbridge's Sam Smith Travel, said: \"Can't help thinking this is an out-of-date April fool.\"\nThe town council posted on Instagram: \"Cowbridge Town Council are aware of a story in the press regarding a statue outside of The Bear Hotel.\n\"The council has not received notification of any planning applications for the statue.\" \nThe council's deputy town clerk, Clair Davis, believed it was an \"April fool's prank published too late\".\nIt was, she added, \"absolutely nothing to do with us\".\n\"I've spoken to a lady from Vale of Glamorgan council and she has received a complaint about it because of a statue being placed in the middle of Cowbridge,\" Ms Davis said.\nNeither was Ms Davis aware of Cultural Cowbridge. \n\"We've Googled them and cannot come up with anything,\" she said.\nA Vale of Glamorgan council spokesman said: \"I think it was an April fool.\" \nH has been approached for comment, and no contact details could be found for Cultural Cowbridge to ask for one.\nOn Friday morning, comedian Lycett hinted the whole thing was a wind-up for his show Late Night Lycett. \nSpeaking to Radio 2's Breakfast show, he said: \"There's a game we're going to play for the next week, there's a lot of fake n",

    "New York's police department is to pay $17.5m (\u00a314m) in a class action case led by two Muslim women who were forced to remove their hijabs while having mugshots taken.\nThe 2018 case argued that Jamilla Clark and Arwa Aziz suffered violations of religious freedom and privacy.\nLawyers say more than 3,600 people are eligible for pay-outs under the deal. \nPolice policy changed four years ago to allow hijabs. The city said the case had \"resulted in a positive reform\".\nThe compensation deal must still be approved by the federal judge overseeing the case, however. \nAccording to court records, Ms Clark wept and begged to put her hijab back on while police took her photo. \n\"When they forced me to take off my hijab, I felt as if I were naked, I'm not sure if words can capture how exposed and violated I felt,\" Ms Clark said in a statement on Friday. \n\"I'm so proud today to have played a part in getting justice for thousands of New Yorkers. This settlement proves I was right all those years ago when I said it was wrong to remove my hijab for a mugshot. \n\"I hope no New Yorker ever has to experience what I went through.\"\nLawyers for the women argued that the police policy enforcing the removal of head coverings violated their rights to privacy, as well their religious freedoms.\nIn a statement to the New York Times, the city's law department said the agreement \"carefully balances the department's respect for firmly held religious beliefs with the important law enforcement need to take arrest photos\".\n\"This resolution was in the best interest of all parties.\"\nThe money is expected to be split among thousands of plaintiffs who were arrested between March 2014 to August 2021. Lawyers say individuals could receive payments of approximately $7,000 to $13,000.\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the largest Muslim advocacy group in the US, praised the women, saying that the change will affect people of other faiths who also wear religious head covers. \n\"We send our appreciation to the Muslim women who bravely persisted with this litigation, prompting policy change that benefit many with similar religious garb requirement,\" said CAIR's New York Executive Director Afaf Nasher.",

    "A retired Bristol detective, who acted as a family liaison officer in the case of murdered Bijan Ebrahimi, would have been sacked for gross misconduct for sending a \"racist\" text about two Black colleagues, a misconduct panel has ruled.\nFormer Detective Constable Simon Jones sent a WhatsApp message to Detective Constable Robert Corry about the pair who were late to a briefing, saying: \u201cIf that was you and me, we would get the sack.\u201d\nA misconduct panel concluded the text suggested an \"element of prejudice towards the two officers based in part at least on their ethnicity\".\nFollowing a two-day hearing, the panel decided on 5 April that ex-Det Con Jones would have been dismissed without notice, had he still been serving with the police force. Instead he will be placed on a barring list preventing him from working for the police or other law enforcement agencies.\nLegally Qualified Chair Callum Cowx said: \u201cThe panel found that this could only be interpreted as a racist remark but could not go so far as to find that this was an inherently racist officer, based on the paucity of the evidence.\u201d\nOne of Mr Jone's roles during nearly 26 years with the force was serving as a liaison officer for the family of Mr Ebrahimi. He was an Iranian refugee from Bristol with special needs, who was beaten to death and set alight in the street by his neighbour in 2013.\nAn investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission concluded the city's police systematically discriminated against him and showed \"all the hallmarks of racial bias\".\nThe role Mr Jones played in supporting Mr Ebrahimi's family was highlighted in mitigation by his Police Federation representative Sgt Tony Henley after the misconduct panel found gross misconduct proven against the former detective.\nHe said Mr Jones had an unblemished police career and had not intended to cause any harm in his messages, which were made in private, on a personal device while off duty in April 2020.\nSgt Henley said: \"These texts could well be described as a single lapse of judgement.\n\"Mr Jones wholeheartedly states that he is not a racist and wholeheartedly disagrees with the finding that he made any racist comments and that the finding is not at all congruent with the evidence presented.\"\nBut the panel agreed with barrister Mark Ley-Morgan, acting on behalf of the force, that the only possible outcome was dismissal had Mr Jones still been a serving officer.\nFormer Det Con Corry, who resigned before the hearing, was also found to have committed misconduct for failing to challenge Jones.\nAssistant Chief Constable Will White said afterwards: \"The impact on the two officers who were at the centre of the messages has been significant.\n\"This has had a profound and lasting impact on them.\n\"Racism has no place in our service.\n\"I hope that today\u2019s outcome shows them that the wider organisation is committed to driving out racism and bad culture and will not tolerate behaviour of this kind.\n\"It\u2019s a clear signal to everyone who works for Avon & Somerset Police that racist views, comments or behaviour go against everything we stand for, and expressing these views in any forum is wholly unacceptable, damaging and will not be tolerated.\n\"It also shows the importance of being an upstander, and challenging these unacceptable behaviours when they are seen or heard.\"\nNeither officer attended the hearing and both men had denied the allegations.",
    "Every night since August 2022, a small crowd has gathered outside the Washington DC Central Jail, through frigid winter nights and under spring rain, to protest against the US justice system. \nThe protesters outside the red-brick buildings of the facility pray, discuss the news, and broadcast telephone calls with prisoners inside the jail, where hundreds of accused or convicted rioters have been held in the three years since the 6 January 2021 storming of the Capitol. \nIn recent months, as Donald Trump has gripped the Republican Party's presidential nomination, the protesters have taken heart from the ex-president's vocal public support for those who attacked Congress.\nAt rallies, Mr Trump plays a version of the national anthem recorded by the J6 Prison Choir - an anonymous group of prisoners thought to include several violent offenders. \nOn Wednesday, he posted a video of the song on his Truth Social account, describing them as \"January 6th hostages\" - a term he has increasingly used in reference to the rioters.\nOn a recent chilly evening, Micki Witthoeft was one of a handful of protesters and live-streamers outside the jail. The mother of Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old military veteran who was shot and killed by law enforcement after breaching the Capitol building, Ms Witthoeft said she had received a call from Mr Trump just that day in which he promised to \"do his best\" for the prisoners should he return to office.\n\"President Trump is a man of his word,\" she said. \"We don't really think everybody on January 6 was innocent of all things, but we just want them to be adequately and accurately charged and sentenced.\"\nWhen a mob of Mr Trump's supporters breached the US Capitol to try to stop the certification of Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election, the images of police and security officers under attack and armed rioters surging into the centre of American democracy shocked the country.\nAround 140 police officers were assaulted, according to justice department figures. In total, more than 1,350 people have been arrested since then. Nearly 30 January 6 inmates are reported to be currently held in the DC jail, most of them charged with assaulting officers.\nAs part of his re-election bid, Mr Trump has promised to pardon many of the January 6 rioters but has never detailed the specific criteria he might use.\nAt times he has distinguished between non-violent rioters and those who \"got out of control\", but his focus at campaign events largely centres on unsubstantiated claims that both he and they are victims of political persecution.\nWhile political strategists say the focus could hurt Mr Trump electorally - particularly among independent and moderate voters he must win over to defeat Joe Biden - they see the messaging as a bid to keep his loyal base of supporters motivated.\n\"They've been treated terribly and very unfairly,\" Mr Trump said last month at a rally in Dayton, Ohio, going on to describe the prisoners as \"unbelievable patriots\". \n7 January 2021: \"I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem\u2026 to those who broke the law, you will pay.\" (Televised speech)\nJuly 2021: \"There was such love at that rally... the crowd was unbelievable and I mentioned the word love, the love in the air, I've never seen anything like it.\" (Fox News interview)\nJanuary 2022: \"If I run and if I win, we will treat those people from Jan 6 fairly\u2026 And if it requires pardons we will give them pardons.\" (Texas rally)\nMay 2023: \"I am inclined to pardon many of them.

They've been treated terribly and very unfairly.\" (Ohio rally)\n3 April 2024: \"January 6th hostages with President Donald J. Trump\", with a video featuring the J6 Prison Choir song (Truth Social post)\nMr Trump's attacks on the legal system for alleged political bias against the Capitol rioters echo his public outbursts about his own legal travails. \nHe faces four criminal indictments, including one that accuses him of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election. And embracing the 6 January defendants, observers say, bolsters his claim to supporters that the legal system is \"rigged\".\n\"The political prisoners narrative seems to be an effort to frame the Jan 6 attack as a lawful political protest,\" said Barbara McQuade, a University of Michigan law professor and author of the book Attack from Within: How Disinformation is Sabotaging America.

The police also spotted a number of large dark stains on the floor in the main bedroom, which later turned out to be Holly's blood, Mr Aspden said. \nMetson told officers his wife had been abusive to him, showing them a bite mark on his forearm, and she had left home with a local mental health support group on 19 March.\nPolice subsequently found Metson had told lies to officers, who later returned to conduct a search of the flat.\n\"At one point Mr Metson joked she might be hiding under the bed,\" said Mr Aspden.\nThe following day a walker \"made a grim discovery\" when he noticed plastic bags floating in the River Witham at Bassingham, one of which contained a human hand, he said.\nPolice divers recovered 224 remains of Ms Bramley's body but some of her body parts were never found, the court heard.\nMr Aspden said it was likely the 26-year-old was stabbed multiple times in the bedroom before being moved to the bathroom where she was dismembered.

    "A woman who as a teen witnessed her mother being shot dead by her estranged husband has said he posed a \"silent but deadly\" risk in the relationship - \"like carbon monoxide poisoning\".\nGeorgia Gabriel-Hooper was 14 at the time of the murder in Newport, Shropshire, in 2018.\nNow aged 20, she campaigns against domestic abuse and has used the occasion of what would have been mother Cheryl Hooper's 58th birthday to share her experience of the events and her work.\nThe campaigner remembered that while Andrew Hooper appeared \"charming\" at first, he was actually controlling. \"You can't see it, you can't smell it until it's too late - unfortunately, that's how a lot of coercive control works,\" she said.\nMrs Hooper was killed outside her home before her husband shot and injured himself nearby. \nMs Gabriel-Hooper told BBC Radio Shropshire: \"The campaigning I do, the talking, everything in the domestic abuse arena, has been the most cathartic thing. It's probably helped me heal and recover more than anything else.\n\"I've found some really good friends who unfortunately lost their parents in the same way, and having that support system is completely invaluable.\"\nMs Gabriel-Hooper, who on her mother's birthday lamented the things the pair had missed, has also recounted her experiences in an episode of the BBC Radio 4 series, Life Changing. \nIn the interview with Dr Sian Williams, she recalled being taken to Hooper's farm at the age of seven when her mother first met him.\nAs time went on, the coercive control he exerted slowly emerged.\n\"We lived in an environment where if we went out, we didn't know what we were going to come home to,\" she explained.\n\"He didn't necessarily kick off or start an argument. He was very much a silent treatment kind of person, and he would play mind games by not telling you why he was upset.\"\nAfter being found guilty of murder by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court in June 2019, Hooper was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 31 years.\nThe trial heard how the farmer suspected his wife was having an affair, and, on the night she was killed, tracked her to a pub in Wolverhampton.\nIf you, or someone you know, has been affected by domestic abuse or violence, you can find details of support available on the BBC Action Line at bbc.co.uk/actionline.

    "The boat race is not normally that relevant to 16 million people. Watching the socially privileged engage in a time-honoured and exclusive duel on the Thames is not everyone's cup of tea.\nBut this year's contest between Oxford and Cambridge came with a quite literal health warning that will resonate with customers of Thames Water and millions more around the UK used to hearing about the sewage in our rivers and beaches.\nThe boat race crews were given safety advice to avoid swallowing water splashed up from the Thames. After the race, the Oxford rowers criticised sewage levels in the river. \nThe new boss of Thames Water must also feel like he's up to his neck in excrement, though in his case it is the financial kind. Because Britain's biggest water company is, quite simply, drowning in debt.\nThe immediate red alert is at Thames Water's parent company, Kemble. It is owned by some of the biggest pension and sovereign wealth funds in the world but this week it told its lenders it couldn't pay its debts.\nKemble defaulted on interest payments on a \u00a3400m loan, and said it doesn't have enough cash to pay back a loan of \u00a3190m due at the end of this month.\nThis renders Thames' parent company effectively insolvent. That matters because it was supposed to pump more than \u00a33bn in new money into the company that supplies clean water and removes waste for a quarter of the UK.\nLast week, Kemble shareholders halted a \u00a3500m down-payment on that promised cash injection when regulator Ofwat rejected plans to raise customer bills by 40% above inflation over the next five years.\nThe purpose of Kemble is to inject money into Thames and then eventually receive dividends which can be paid out to owners, which include foreign and domestic pension funds as well as Chinese and Gulf state wealth funds. Given Thames' precarious financial position, current shareholders have not taken any payouts since 2017.\nPrevious owners Australian firm Macquarie took out nearly \u00a33bn in dividends and allowed its debt pile to triple between 2006 and 2017.\nKemble's new shareholders have told the BBC they are not prepared to throw more capital at a company that is losing money and they appear to have reconciled themselves to the fact their shares are worth nothing,\nThe amber alert is at Thames Water itself, which is ring-fenced, regulated, \u00a314.7bn in debt and 100%-owned by parent company Kemble. The new boss, Chris Weston, tried to allay fears by saying it had enough in cash and overdraft facilities to keep ticking over till next May, but at some point Thames will need a fresh cash injection.\nSo what next?\n\"Eventually, possibly,\" the chief executive told the BBC last week. \"But that is a way off yet.\"\nThe Treasury, the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs and Ofwat have been wargaming a situation in which Thames is put into a Special Administration Regime, which would see financial consultants run the company on the government's behalf. \nWhen energy company Bulb went bust in 2021 and was placed under special administration, consultants at Teneo were hired. The same firm has reportedly been approached by Thames.\nBut what would that mean for Thames customers and/or taxpayers?\nThames is not making enough money to cover its costs. That means that either bills to customers will have to rise or taxpayers across the UK would have to foot a shortfall that could run into billions if it remains in public ownership beyond next May. \nThat could be a tough sell to voters outside the southeast of England in an election year.\nA possibility. Throughout this crisis, Ofwat has insisted that Thames Water - despite its eye watering \u00a314.7bn of debt - is a company that generates \u00a32bn a year in inflation-linked income, which might be attractive to someone.\nHowever, any potential new owner would have to be prepared to make lower - if any - returns on their investment than the current shareholders, who have been pretty patient having not taken any dividends from the parent company since 2017.  \nRisky. In financial lingo, this is called \"taking a haircut\". Agreeing to reduced debt repayments from one of the UK's most active borrowers from the financial markets may make other water companies see a rise in their borrowing costs, which would make life harder for other utilities who rely on lenders.\nJust like landlords who pass on higher borrowing costs to their tenants, customers of all water companies could suffer if markets deemed the loans to be more risky and therefore make them more expensive.\nA likely outcome. The tap will still run, the loo will still flush whatever happens in the short term. All sides have been clear on that.\nAs one person close to the situation said: \"We will be having this same conversation in a year's time\". That might suit the current government, who do not want to oversee the potential failure of a privatised utility in an election year.\nThe challenges facing Thames Water are formidable. In Finsbury Park, north London, the company is replacing",
    "Residents protesting over the expansion of a quarry have tried to stop lorries entering and leaving the site.\nPeople have been at the Craig yr Hesg site, in Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf, every day since Tuesday.\nDemonstrators are worried the expansion could affect their health, homes and the environment.\nThe quarry owners said the work was tightly regulated and offered to revisit an offer to give 11.4 acres of unused land to the community.\nExpansion plans were originally rejected by Rhondda Cynon Taf council, but that was over-ruled by Climate Change Minister Julie James after an appeal in October 2022. \nThe site produces pennant sandstone, which is used in roads, and an extra 10 million tonnes will be quarried at the expanded site until 2047.\nThis week's daily demonstrations follow an initial protest last week.\nClaire Allen, who lives on the nearby Glyncoch estate, said: \"We are trying to save our community. We are scared at the moment. Our houses have all got cracks.\n\"There's a school right next to where they are blasting, our children are up there\".\nOther residents were concerned about loss of environment, including a hillside used for walking.\nAnne Marie Coggins, who believes her home has been damaged by the work, said: \"When they blast it's like an earthquake. My property literally vibrates.\"\nSelena Young, of Glyncoch, is concerned about the effects that airborne dust is having on her family's health, with the expansion potentially taking the quarry within 200m (650ft) of her back garden\nShe added: \"At the moment my house shakes when the quarry blasts. I have dust all over my cars and in the house.\n\"We have to continually clean and if we're in the garden we have to breathe all of that in.\"\nHeidelberg Materials said: \"We understand local concerns about the loss of amenity space.\n\"The frustrating thing is that we had discussions nearly a decade ago with the local authority about us donating 11.4 acres of quarry unused quarry land for community use.\n\"At the time our offer was turned down, but we'd be happy to revisit this. \n\"The potential air quality and dust effects from quarries are well understood and are already tightly managed. Extensive monitoring, carried out by Rhondda Cynon Taf, shows full compliance\".",
    "The owners of a care home that was set to accommodate unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (UASC) in Kent have pulled out of a deal with the council.\nIt comes after they said a letter to residents, outlining the plans, had been sent by Kent County Council \"without prior arrangement\" before a final decision.\nOcean Heights Residential Home in Sheppey will now be commissioned to provide residential care for elderly and disabled residents, its owners said. \nThe leader of the council, Roger Gough, described the withdrawal from the sale as \"disappointing\".\nThe council had previously said it was so overwhelmed by the number of UASC arrivals, it might have to stop taking local youngsters into care.\nBut the High Court ruled last year that it must take \"every possible step\" to increase its capacity to accommodate those arriving in the county.\nGovernment funding is now being used to acquire seven new properties to serve as reception centres for UASC.\nIn a letter sent to those living near Ocean Heights in March, the council said works would start \"very soon\" to allow it to open for children arriving in spring and summer.\nIt added that the temporary home would provide 50 places to children aged 16 and 17. But the move has prompted protests from some residents. \nLiz and Ernie Batten, the owners of the property, said they understood the council \"needed to address the growing speculation by providing clear communication\" to locals.\n\"But we are disappointed that such a letter was sent out without prior agreement in advance of a full decision,\" they said.\n\u201cWe considered all the facts of the proposed use and have advised KCC of our intention to withdraw from the transfer.\"\nThey added that they hoped its use as a home for elderly and disabled residents would \"serve to fill the void created by local closures\".\nMr Gough said the council had been \"transparent\" about the arrangements for new reception centres. \n\"Given our legal responsibilities, and the High Court's direction, we are establishing the additional reception centres and will identify other suitable locations to accommodate the increasing numbers of unaccompanied minors arriving on our shores.\"\nFollow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "Northern Ireland's most senior judge says she's open to the possibility of reform in family courts.\nDame Siobhan Keegan said she doesn't want \"a mystique about family courts sitting in private\" and \"making decisions the public don't understand\".\nHer comments come as some victims of domestic abuse described their court experiences as intimidating.  \nOne woman who spoke anonymously to BBC News NI said: \"I don't trust the court system.\"\nBBC News NI has spoken to three people about their experiences of the family courts.\nWarning: Details of domestic abuse are contained below.\nJanet, not her real name, says her claims of domestic abuse against the father of her child weren't taken seriously by the family court. \n\"There was emotional and verbal abuse in our relationship and there was the threat of physical abuse. \n\"After we separated he was intimidatory and I was red flagged as a serious case of domestic abuse and had a non-molestation order in place. \n\"One day a police officer turned up with a summons to a family court. \n\"When we got there the judge basically said the non-molestation order was gone, adding:  'We don't need it' and I was accused of fabrication.\n\"I was never asked about the abuse; it wasn't entertained as relevant.\"\nJanet was keen to point out that she had never been involved with social services, adding that her older children have a \"normal relationship with their father\".\nShe now finds herself sending her distressed child to their father.\n\"To this day my child doesn't want to go to him, sometimes they come back with bruises. I don't have faith in any of it anymore. \n\"No one has ever been interested in my concerns about my child's safety.

    "A trainee anaesthetist who stole drugs from the NHS hospital where he worked so he could inject his girlfriend with them during sex has been jailed.\nJonathon Dean stole drugs including morphine from Whipps Cross Hospital, in Leytonstone, east London, in December 2018 and told the woman he \"could have done anything\" to her.\nSentencing Dean, Judge Philip Grey said the 32-year-old was \"playing God\".\nDean, from Poplar, was jailed for two years and one month.\nJudge Grey told Dean: \"You stole anaesthetic drugs to get your sexual kicks. That was entirely clear from your messages at the time.\"\nHe said the offending was about \"wanting chemically enhanced sex and being in a position of dominance and power\".\nHe said that the offending struck \"at the heart of the trust that's placed\" in the medical profession.\nDuncan O'Donnell, prosecuting, said Dean \"had formed a consensual sexual relationship\" with the woman.\n\"That relationship involved high risk sexual intercourse using painkillers and other items.\"\nConcerns were raised to the medical director of Whipps Cross Hospital when the young woman presented herself to another hospital.\nDean admitted at an earlier hearing to nine counts of the theft of drugs, including cyclizine, ondansetron, propofol, midazolam and morphine.\nHe also pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.\nMr O'Donnell said Dean had been placed on administrative duties following an investigation, but he was still able to use his swipe card in 2023 - which was finally deactivated after it was identified that he had taken the drugs.\nIn defence, Aisha Khan said: \"The ultimate punishment is him not being able to work in this profession.\"\nShe said her client was \"intoxicated by the fantasy and excitement that was being offered\" by his relationship with the woman.\nThe barrister described Dean as \"a man who has suffered from addiction\", and said he was \"ashamed for what has occurred\".\nShe said that he had apologised \"unreservedly\" in a letter to the judge, and she read some of this out.\nIn one part, he wrote that he \"cannot undo what I have done\u2026 what I can do is apologise - I do so unreservedly.\n\"I let a lot of people down and brought shame on myself and my profession.\"\nThe judge jailed Dean for 25 months and ordered that needles and other medical items from his home be confiscated.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The family of a man who was sent speeding tickets after being fatally struck by a lorry said the letters had caused them \"more pain\".\nShafiqul Haidhar, 39, was hit while awaiting recovery on the hard shoulder of the M1 in Leicestershire on 23 August last year.\nThe father of five had been travelling in his own car before being involved in an earlier, unrelated, crash.\nHis brother said the letters had caused \"added trauma\".\nMr Haidhar, a maths teacher from Barking in east London, had driven to the county on the day he died.\nHis family said he was near junction 20 of the motorway when his car crashed into the central reservation.\nLeicestershire Police received a call from a member of public at 05:58 BST, and National Highways attended to help Mr Haidhar on to the hard shoulder to wait for recovery.\nAccording to a report from the police watchdog, seen by the BBC, no police resources were assigned and the force log was shut at 06:24.\nAfter learning of the crash, Mr Haidhar's brother - Kaisor Ahmed - said he called Leicestershire Police over concerns about his sibling's mental health and safety.\nHe claims he called several times and \"begged\" someone to go to his brother and take him to a safe space.\n\"I told them he was vulnerable and that it wasn't safe for him to be there because of his mental health,\" he said.\n\"I said just take him to a police station or something and I would pick him up.\"\nLater, at 07:47, Mr Haidhar was struck by the lorry and died at the scene.\nFollowing his death, three prosecution notices for speeding were sent by Northamptonshire Police, Thames Valley Police and the Metropolitan Police, to Mr Haidhar's home address.\nMr Ahmed, 42, who was supporting the family at home at the time, said he was left angry and overwhelmed by the letters.\nHe called Northamptonshire Police to advise them of his brother's death, and the force withdrew its initial letter. \nMr Ahmed also called the Met after a further final notice was sent by the force to his brother's house, and \"the offence was immediately cancelled\".\nHowever, Thames Valley Police's notices, which were automated - according to the force - were escalated to a court summons.\nThe case was discontinued in March once Oxford Magistrates' Court was notified, and a letter to confirm the withdrawal was then sent to the family's home, addressed to Mr Haidhar. \nMr Ahmed said: \"Why should this be my problem? \n\"I'm trying to support my family - it's just causing more pain. We should not have to suffer from the added trauma like this.\n\"The Met Police came to my house to tell me my brother was dead and then they sent these letters.\"\nThames Valley Police and the Met said they understood the distress caused to Mr Haidhar's family. \nA Thames Valley Police spokesperson said: \"Since the fatal incident was not within Thames Valley Police's jurisdiction, we would not have automatically been notified of [Mr Haidhar's] death, and as such, would not have been in a position where we could discontinue the proceedings any sooner than they were by the court.\"\nA Met spokesperson explained its system automatically generates a new notice if an initial one goes unanswered.\nThe spokesperson added: \"When the team dealing with traffic prosecutions became aware of Mr Haidhar's tragic death, the offence was immediately cancelled.\"\nMr Haidhar's death is also the subject of an ongoing investigation by the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).\nThe IOPC is investigating Leicestershire Police over the calls made to the force by Mr Ahmed about his brother's welfare.\nAn inquest into Mr Haidhar's death has been suspended while the IOPC inquiry continues. \nLeicestershire Police said it was unable to comment due to the ongoing investigation. \nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "The owners of a care home that was set to accommodate unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (UASC) in Kent have pulled out of a deal with the council.\nIt comes after they said a letter to residents, outlining the plans, had been sent by Kent County Council \"without prior arrangement\" before a final decision.\nOcean Heights Residential Home in Sheppey will now be commissioned to provide residential care for elderly and disabled residents, its owners said. \nThe leader of the council, Roger Gough, described the withdrawal from the sale as \"disappointing\".\nThe council had previously said it was so overwhelmed by the number of UASC arrivals, it might have to stop taking local youngsters into care.\nBut the High Court ruled last year that it must take \"every possible step\" to increase its capacity to accommodate those arriving in the county.\nGovernment funding is now being used to acquire seven new properties to serve as reception centres for UASC.\nIn a letter sent to those living near Ocean Heights in March, the council said works would start \"very soon\" to allow it to open for children arriving in spring and summer.\nIt added that the temporary home would provide 50 places to children aged 16 and 17. But the move has prompted protests from some residents. \nLiz and Ernie Batten, the owners of the property, said they understood the council \"needed to address the growing speculation by providing clear communication\" to locals.\n\"But we are disappointed that such a letter was sent out without prior agreement in advance of a full decision,\" they said.\n\u201cWe considered all the facts of the proposed use and have advised KCC of our intention to withdraw from the transfer.\"\nThey added that they hoped its use as a home for elderly and disabled residents would \"serve to fill the void created by local closures\".\nMr Gough said the council had been \"transparent\" about the arrangements for new reception centres. \n\"Given our legal responsibilities, and the High Court's direction, we are establishing the additional reception centres and will identify other suitable locations to accommodate the increasing numbers of unaccompanied minors arriving on our shores.\"\nFollow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "A lawyer for four people wrongly accused over the 1974 Guildford pub bombings has criticised police after new evidence emerged on the attack.\nLawyer Alastair Logan said the timing of Surrey Police revealing the lead was \"another attempt to avoid public scrutiny\" on the Guildford Four.\nOfficers will not launch a fresh inquiry before a new law comes in that would help shield perpetrators.\nSurrey Police have not yet responded to the criticism.\nHowever, the force said it remained committed to helping to achieve justice for the families of the five people who were killed in the bombings.\nDetectives had told families of victims that they had \"identified a potential forensic line of enquiry and the next step would be a new criminal investigation\", lawyers said. \nHowever, KRW Law said Surrey Police had stated it was not advancing any further investigations before the commencement of the Northern Ireland Legacy Act on 1 May. The act allows those involved with the conflict to seek immunity from prosecution.\nFour soldiers and a civilian died in the blast in Guildford's Horse and Groom pub in October 1974.\nAnother bomb detonated 30 minutes later at the Seven Stars.\nThe Guildford Four and Maguire Seven were wrongly-convicted for the attacks in one of the UK's biggest miscarriages of justice. The Guildford Four were jailed for murder in 1975 and the Maguire Seven were convicted on explosives charges the following year.\nMr Logan said: \"The information given by Surrey Police has all the hallmarks of yet another attempt to prevent public scrutiny.\"\nHe said that police \"had evidence in 1974-5 that demonstrated that the Four were innocent\" but actively concealed it.\nThe criticism follows a plea for answers by the family of victim Ann Hamilton, who was a 19-year-old soldier when Guildford was hit.\nAnn's sister Cassandra Hamilton and her lawyers said there were questions over the nature of the new evidence, how long police have had it, when decisions were made and whether the force could and should continue its investigation.\nThe other people who died in the attack were 21-year-old civilian Paul Craig and soldiers Caroline Slater, 18, William Forsyth, 18, and John Hunter, 17. Sixty-five people were injured.\nThe IRA's Balcombe Street unit admitted carrying out the Guildford and Woolwich attacks in the 1970s, but no-one else was prosecuted after the Guildford Four's release in 1989. The BBC has been shown, confidentially, the IRA confessions.\nBridie Brennan, sister of wrongly-jailed Gerry Conlon, said police should reveal the nature of the evidence now. \nMrs Brennan, 67, said: \"It's almost 50 years and the longer it goes on, the more people are not going to be around here on this earth. \n\"How long are we going to wait just to find out whether we are going to get the truth?\"\nShe asked how long it would take for police to reveal the new lead, adding: \"They should say what evidence they have found.\"\nGerry Conlon died in June 2014 aged 60 and Carole Richardson died of cancer aged 55. Paddy Armstrong continued to call for papers on IRA files to be released. Paul Hill has spoken to the BBC about his wrongful imprisonment in the past.\nThe Guildford Four served 15 years before they were freed. Mrs Brennan's father, Guiseppe Conlon, one of the Maguire Seven, died in jail.\nSurrey Police said in November 2022, that following consultation with Counter Terrorism Policing, it was agreed its new line of inquiry should be progressed.\nDeputy Chief Constable Nev Kemp said police were aware of draft legislation but continued to assess the case after an inquest concluded in 2022, and submitted items for forensic analysis.\nHe said forensic results came back in August 2023, but the enactment of the Legacy Act a month later meant there was \"no prospect of reaching the stage of prosecution by the deadline of 1 May\".\nFollow BBC Surrey on\u00a0Facebook, and on \u00a0X.

    "British author Lynne Reid Banks, who wrote books including The L-Shaped Room and The Indian in the Cupboard, has died at the age of 94.\nThe writer died of cancer \"peacefully with her family around her\" on Thursday, her agent James Wills said.\nShe made her mark as a writer of children's literature, with her other works including Harry the Poisonous Centipede and I, Houdini.\nShe \"leaves a massive legacy of wonderful work\", said her son.\nGillon Stephenson added that he received messages daily from people telling him \"what a difference she has made\".\nBanks, who was born in Barnes, Surrey - now part of west London - in 1929, once said: \"I'm not very good at living with characters that I don't like.\n\"I have to see something attractive about them in order to want to explore them.\"\nShe was referring to Jane Graham, the lead character in her classic The L-Shaped Room - the tale of a middle-class girl cast out of the family home after her father learns she is pregnant. \nThe 1961 book fed the fevered imaginations of young girls growing up in an era when sex was still often barely acknowledged at home, but feminism was hovering on the global horizon.\nIt was Reid Banks' first novel - a contemporary page-turner and a forerunner of today's popular YA (Young Adult) genre.\nSuch was its popularity that within two years of publication it had been turned into a big-budget film starring Leslie Caron and directed by Whistle Down the Wind's Bryan Forbes - a film Reid Banks said it took her 20 years to forgive for its cavalier treatment of her characters.\n\"I felt them so real in my imagination that I didn't like them being altered,\" she told journalist Andrew Whitehead in 2000.\nReid Banks' mother - \"always my sternest critic \" - was less impressed with her daughter's debut. \"If even one young woman reads this book and thinks there is something brave and gallant, and independent, about having a baby in this way - you will have lot to answer for,\" she told her.\n\"I never thought of any responsibility of that kind,\" said Reid Banks later. \"I simply wrote a story.\"\nHer mother said The L-Shaped Room felt \"very, very real\" and told her daughter many would assume that the tale of a single girl left pregnant and alone after an unsatisfactory sexual encounter was a \"thinly-veiled autobiography\".\nBut - aside from a fleeting night when she ran away to \"down-at-heel\" Fulham after a family row - Jane and Lynne had little in common.  \nReid Banks, who was evacuated to Canada with her mother during World War Two, returning to the bomb-damaged streets of London at the age of 15.\nHaving secured a place at drama school Rada, she \"failed dismally\" in her first ambition - to become an actress like her adored mother - and wound up working at ITN as one of the UK's first female television journalists.\n\"We 'girl reporters' - there were just two of us - became minor celebrities,\" the author wrote in the Guardian in 2011, recalling how she \"forged intrepidly through strike-mobs\", attended film premieres and \"brought real people... into the audience's living rooms\".\n\"Benny Hill once honoured me with a sketch in which I was sent up as eager-beaver 'girl reporter Linseed Cranks' - those were the days.\"\nThe role suited Reid Banks' exhibitionist nature - but being \"booted off\" to the job of backroom scriptwriter did not. The L-Shaped Room followed, written \"at a company typewriter in company time\". \n\"I had no plan, no design - it was simply something that grew,\" she explained. It took nearly two years to complete, but its status as a bestseller was immediate. \nReid Banks abandoned London soon after for the fledgling nation of Israel - in pursuit of love, namely the sculptor, Chaim Stephenson, whom she had met while under contract to ITN. \nStephenson was living on a kibbutz, and the pair married in Cyprus, Reid Banks went on to spend nearly a decade on the kibbutz, teaching English and raising the couple's three sons, Adiel, Gillon and Omri. \nThe demands of family life meant writing took a back seat - she produced one novel in eight years.\nReturning to England, Stephenson became a full-time artist and Reid Banks took up her pen once more, completing Jane's story with two sequels to The L-Shaped Room - The Backward Shadow and Two is Lonely.\nBut it was in children's literature that she made her mark, most notably with the 1980 bestseller The Indian in the Cupboard - inspired by her son Omri and a shabby bathroom cabinet.\nFour further books followed in the series - as did a 1995 Hollywood film starring Steve Coogan - cementing the author's international reputation.\nShe went on to write more than 40 published works in all genres, including a biography of the Bronte family - The Dark Quartet - but children's works dominated and led to her travelling all over the world visiting schools.\nShe delighted in inspiring young minds and in 2013 was given the JM Barrie Award \"in recognition of a lifetime's achievement in delighting children\".\nRe-reading The L-Shaped Room 50 yea",

    "A lawyer for four people wrongly accused over the 1974 Guildford pub bombings has criticised police after new evidence emerged on the attack.\nLawyer Alastair Logan said the timing of Surrey Police revealing the lead was \"another attempt to avoid public scrutiny\" on the Guildford Four.\nOfficers will not launch a fresh inquiry before a new law comes in that would help shield perpetrators.\nSurrey Police have not yet responded to the criticism.\nHowever, the force said it remained committed to helping to achieve justice for the families of the five people who were killed in the bombings.\nDetectives had told families of victims that they had \"identified a potential forensic line of enquiry and the next step would be a new criminal investigation\", lawyers said. \nHowever, KRW Law said Surrey Police had stated it was not advancing any further investigations before the commencement of the Northern Ireland Legacy Act on 1 May. The act allows those involved with the conflict to seek immunity from prosecution.\nFour soldiers and a civilian died in the blast in Guildford's Horse and Groom pub in October 1974.\nAnother bomb detonated 30 minutes later at the Seven Stars.\nThe Guildford Four and Maguire Seven were wrongly-convicted for the attacks in one of the UK's biggest miscarriages of justice. The Guildford Four were jailed for murder in 1975 and the Maguire Seven were convicted on explosives charges the following year.\nMr Logan said: \"The information given by Surrey Police has all the hallmarks of yet another attempt to prevent public scrutiny.\"\nHe said that police \"had evidence in 1974-5 that demonstrated that the Four were innocent\" but actively concealed it.\nThe criticism follows a plea for answers by the family of victim Ann Hamilton, who was a 19-year-old soldier when Guildford was hit.\nAnn's sister Cassandra Hamilton and her lawyers said there were questions over the nature of the new evidence, how long police have had it, when decisions were made and whether the force could and should continue its investigation.\nThe other people who died in the attack were 21-year-old civilian Paul Craig and soldiers Caroline Slater, 18, William Forsyth, 18, and John Hunter, 17. Sixty-five people were injured.\nThe IRA's Balcombe Street unit admitted carrying out the Guildford and Woolwich attacks in the 1970s, but no-one else was prosecuted after the Guildford Four's release in 1989. The BBC has been shown, confidentially, the IRA confessions.\nBridie Brennan, sister of wrongly-jailed Gerry Conlon, said police should reveal the nature of the evidence now. \nMrs Brennan, 67, said: \"It's almost 50 years and the longer it goes on, the more people are not going to be around here on this earth. \n\"How long are we going to wait just to find out whether we are going to get the truth?\"\nShe asked how long it would take for police to reveal the new lead, adding: \"They should say what evidence they have found.\"\nGerry Conlon died in June 2014 aged 60 and Carole Richardson died of cancer aged 55. Paddy Armstrong continued to call for papers on IRA files to be released. Paul Hill has spoken to the BBC about his wrongful imprisonment in the past.\nThe Guildford Four served 15 years before they were freed. Mrs Brennan's father, Guiseppe Conlon, one of the Maguire Seven, died in jail.\nSurrey Police said in November 2022, that following consultation with Counter Terrorism Policing, it was agreed its new line of inquiry should be progressed.\nDeputy Chief Constable Nev Kemp said police were aware of draft legislation but continued to assess the case after an inquest concluded in 2022, and submitted items for forensic analysis.\nHe said forensic results came back in August 2023, but the enactment of the Legacy Act a month later meant there was \"no prospect of reaching the stage of prosecution by the deadline of 1 May\".\nFollow BBC Surrey on\u00a0Facebook, and on \u00a0X.

    "A teenager only has months left to undergo life-changing spinal surgery after a recent planned operation was cancelled.\nKatie Steel, 17 - who has the condition scoliosis - was due to go into the operating theatre on Thursday.\nBut she was woken up after being prepared for surgery and told she had not had it.\nHer mother Clare Steel was told that there were not enough intensive care staff to care for her afterwards.\nShe said that her daughter cannot have the surgery past her 18th birthday, which is in December, due to age limitations on the type of surgery Katie needs.\nNHS Lothian apologised to patients who were affected by delays.\nMs Steel, a Labour councillor for Clydebank Central, said her family had been through \"an absolute trauma\".\nKatie's condition will progressively worsen without the surgery, she added.\nKatie's mum told BBC Scotland's The Nine that by the time the surgery was cancelled, her daughter had already gone through her pre-operation procedures\nShe had spent several hours with the pain team, the surgeon and the physiotherapist, as well as getting X-rays and blood tests at the Edinburgh Royal Hospital for Children and Young People (RHCYP).\n\"By this point Katie had been in a sleep, she had been given her pre-meds and she was quite calm and settled,\" Ms Steel said.\n\"We were really happy about that because she had been anxious about going in to have surgery that could take eight or nine hours.\n\"Then we were waking her up and she thought she'd had the surgery, but we had to tell her that she hadn't and she wasn't going for it.\"\nLast year, a BBC Disclosure investigation into Scotland's NHS revealed claims that nursing shortages at the RHCYP were contributing to some children waiting up to three times longer than pre-pandemic for spinal surgery.\nAnd in March, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) said the number of children waiting for some services had more than doubled in the past 11 years.\nMs Steel said she was angry for her daughter's sake.\n\"I didn't anticipate that we could get to that late stage, where the surgeon and anaesthetist are all standing by and ready, and then at the very last second the intensive care team tell us we can't go through with it,\" she said.\n\"It's utterly appalling. We were upset, we were shocked - I just didn't want to leave the hospital without Katie having her much-needed surgery.\n\"She'd already waited months and months on the list to have the surgery.\"\nScoliosis is where the spine twists and curves to the side.\nIt can affect people of any age, from babies to adults, but most often starts in children aged 10 to 15.\nScoliosis can improve with treatment, but it is not usually a sign of anything serious and treatment is not always needed if the case is mild.\nKatie's mother added added: \"How can you explain something like that to someone who has been anticipating and having all these emotions and all the pain, everything that her body is doing to her with her scoliosis?\n\"Today should've been the first day post-op for Katie, we should've been caring for our daughter today but that hasn't happened. \n\"Katie is a really major case so the intensive care team know months in advance and other things had been planned like blood transfusions, it's a whole process and it all had to be cancelled.\n\"It's critical she gets the surgery before her 18th birthday.\n\"So her surgeon is looking at dates for next month and this really needs to get done. But this could happen again and that's a concern we have now.\"\nTracey Gillies, the medical director of NHS Lothian, said: \"We are not able to discuss individual patients without their consent and would always urge any patients and their families with concerns to contact us directly.\n\"We know that rescheduling elective procedures can be very upsetting for our patients and their families and apologise sincerely to those who are affected by delays.\n\"We have been open and honest about the significant pressures being experienced across our entire healthcare system and their negative impact on elective procedures and waiting times.\"",
    "Almost 200 jobs are being cut at Swansea University as a result of \"financial challenges\" in higher education.\nThe institution confirmed 189 employees had volunteered for redundancy since a scheme opened in September.\nThe cuts come as an academic called on the Welsh government to review higher education funding.\nProf Dylan Jones-Evans said there was an over-reliance on recruiting foreign students, who pay higher fees.\nHe said that was compounding a difficult financial situation for universities.\n\"There have been changes to the visa system and there are less foreign students coming to Wales,\" Prof Jones-Evans told Newyddion S4C.\n\"That has created a big financial hole and some institutions are already cutting courses and staff.\"\nStudent visa rules for international students came into force this year, which mean foreign students can no longer bring dependents to the UK, except in special circumstances.\nAccording to Universities UK, there was a 44% drop in international enrolments for postgraduate courses in January this year after a survey of 70 UK universities. \nProf Dylan Jones-Evans is calling on the Welsh government to review the way Welsh higher education is funded.\nHe said: \"If we want a strong higher education sector in Wales that can make a difference to the nation, we need to look again (at) what we want from that sector.\"\nThe University of South Wales has also launched a voluntary redundancy scheme to cut costs.\nCardiff University and Cardiff Metropolitan University said they were not currently cutting jobs but were facing financial problems and redundancies could yet be on the cards.\nDirector of Cardiff University's Wales Governance Centre, Prof Richard Wyn Jones, said universities typically lost money on domestic students.\nHe said: \"That model is obviously unsustainable. The signs have been there for years, but there has been no political will from any political party to do anything about it.\n\"The crisis has been festering and people have been burying their heads in the sand. A review is certainly needed.\"\nUniversities Wales, which represents Welsh institutions, called the fall in demand from foreign students \"concerning\".\nIt said: \"It is clear that policy changes by UK government last year, alongside increased competition from other countries, have had a significant impact on the UK's attractiveness to international students. \n\"It is troubling that current policy and rhetoric seems to be undermining the success of the UK government's own international education strategy.\"\nThe Home Office said it was focused on striking the right balance between tackling net migration - the numbers coming to and from the country - and attracting the brightest students to the UK.\nThe Welsh government said it recognised the monetary pressures universities were facing. \nA spokesman said: \"Ministers have been engaging regularly and constructively with sector leaders on this.\"",

They're scared that if they let go of it, they're not going to create decent art - but suffering is just one colour on the wheel. \n\"It can definitely be inspiring, but some of my favourite songs come from when I'm genuinely peaceful and really happy.\"\nMusgraves was born in the tiny town of Golden, Texas, and has been making music since she first picked up a mandolin at the age of eight.\nAs a child, she was a champion yodeller, and sang the national anthem at the 2002 Winter Olympics - but it was her songwriting that really caught people's attention.\nIn her teens, her parents paid for her to record three independent albums, while her grandmother worked as a live agent, calling up venues and telling them they just had to hear her granddaughter's voice.\nAfter high school, Musgraves moved to Austin and became a working songwriter, supplying tracks for the TV show Nashville and supplementing her income by dressing up as Cinderella and painting kids' faces at birthday parties.\nThen, in 2012, one of her songs, Mama's Broken Heart, was recorded by Miranda Lambert and reached number two on the US country charts. \nThe success helped her secure a record deal of her own, and her major-label debut, Same Trailer, Different Park, went on to win the Grammy Award for best country album.\nEven then, she was testing the boundaries of country music - singing about drug use and small-town hypocrisy, despite the advice of her record label boss to tone the lyrics down.\n\"He literally said, 'You know, Kacey, sometimes in business you just gotta do some things you're not proud of,'\" she told fans at a listening event earlier this month. \"I said, 'I don't want to play it safe... I don't respect that at all'.\"\nThe attitude paid off. A liberal star in the conservative world of country, Musgraves has attracted fans who'd previously felt alienated by the genre; and won over pop audiences by touring with Harry Styles and writing campy disco anthems like High Horse and the blissed-out love song Oh, What A World.\nBoth songs featured on the breakthrough Golden Hour album, which was written as she fell for her then-husband, Ruston Kelly - who she says opened her mind \"to a kind of love I never really envisioned for myself\".\nWhen the Grammys named it album of the year, Musgraves looked bewildered. \"What?\" she declared over and over again, clutching her purse to her chest.\nBut unexpected as it was, the award changed her outlook.\n\"When you win something like that, you can go one of two ways. You can develop a scarcity mindset of, 'Oh my God, everything else I do after this has to achieve the same thing or I'll see it as a failure'. Or you can look at it as validation for following no compass other than your own. \n\"I sort of went in the latter direction. I would rather someone says, 'OK, this album's not really for me, I'll catch her on the next record', than try to remake Golden Hour eight times.\"\nStar-Crossed fitted that brief almost too well. Sequenced as a Greek tragedy, it chronicled the end of her marriage, and was often as confusing as the emotions it tried to capture. \nMusgraves leaned further int",
    "Plans for 485 new homes have been refused over fears the development would \"erode\" the identity of a nearby village.\nIf approved, the proposals would have seen hundreds of new homes built near Newmarket Road, in Bury St Edmunds.\nWest Suffolk Council refused the application and stated it would encroach \"significantly\" on the village of Westley.\nIn planning documents, developers said they believed the homes were sustainable and would have \"lasting benefits\" for the area.\nCouncillors said the development was \"too close\" to Westley and there was no justification on why it encroached on the designated buffer.\n\"The buffer seeks to protect Westley from being subsumed by Bury St Edmunds so housing and the road being closer to Westley than defined in the Statutory Local Plan will undermine that policy requirement and erode Westley's identity as its own village,\" the council said.\nPrior to the decision, developers said in planning documents the \"importance of ensuring that this proposed scheme does not lead to coalescence with Westley is an important constraint\". \nThe new homes - which would have been of mixed tenure, size and price -  were proposed for the eastern side of the site with a \"green buffer\" provided to \"protect the setting and identity\" of the village.\nCouncillors also refused the application over concerns the \"proposed development does not demonstrate that it will not have an unacceptable impact on highway safety\".\nThey feared it could have \"severe impacts\" on local infrastructure. Plans for a new relief road to give access to the site were also considered unacceptable.\nIssues mentioned with the relief road included that it was too wide, there was no detail about street lighting and the walking and cycling infrastructure did not \"encourage non-car modes of travel for all groups of society\".\nTwo new roundabouts - one on Newmarket Road to the north, and a second on Westley Road to the south - were also proposed but the council said the scheme \"does not fully justify\" their inclusion.\nIt said roundabouts \"are known to be inherently dangerous for non-motorised forms of traffic\" and the application has not designed them \"to take account of the needs of cyclists and pedestrians\".\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Almost 15,000 wheelie bins were reported as uncollected in one month in a city.\nWaste and recycling collections across Southampton have faced severe disruption following a change to the working system.\nThe city council moved in January from allowing waste crews to go home when their round was done to enforcing contracted hours.\nLeaders said the change was to \"cap\" an equal pay liability that had arisen.\nIt said it had emerged that one group of council workers had different terms and conditions to others.\nMembers of the overview and scrutiny management committee quizzed officers and the Labour administration on the disruption.\nThe council subsequently published details about missed bins in February.\nResidents made reports to the council that the following collections were not made:\nThe council document said the total of 14,944 did not provide a \"comprehensive picture\" of all missed bins, as not all residents across the city would have made reports.\nConservative councillor Jeremy Moulton said the true figure was \"likely around 50%, which is tens of thousands more than 15,000 quoted\".\nIn a Facebook post, he said: \"You only have a two-day window to make [a] report online... Any later and [the] council website won't let you report it.\"\nCouncil leader Lorna Fielker said: \"Bulk bin collections have returned to normal and the backlog from all shared bins in flats and commercial premises in Southampton has been cleared.\n\"I understand the frustration of residents affected by service disruption and the council has deployed additional crews to help clear missed collections and excess waste.\"\nHowever, the committee's chairman, Liberal Democrat councillor Richard Blackman, said a rise in recent complaints to him indicated that \"disruption will continue for some time to come\". \nHe said: \"If the administration can't get a grip on the problem then it will face further rigorous questioning from the overview and scrutiny management committee.\"\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

    "Social housing residents in Shropshire have said a delayed refurbishment project on their homes is making their families ill.\nWork on Sandpits Avenue and Sandpits Close in Ludlow started two years ago, but was disrupted by a change of contractor.\nTenants said shoddy workmanship had left holes, gaps and draughts at a time when bills were rising, including their rent and heating.\nLandlord Connexus has apologised, but said it was committed to the \u00a36m project to improve items like windows and insulation.\nLuke Griffiths told BBC Radio Shropshire: \"We've had new windows fitted with big gaps underneath which have let draughts come in.\n\"The mould's got so bad in areas of our house, the kitchen cupboards have been falling off.\"\nHe added that his two young children had suffered health problems, which started after work on the cavity wall insulation.\n\"They didn't fill the holes in properly, so it's blasted polystyrene balls into the kitchen, layers of dust all over my house and my son was eight weeks old. \n\"He's had chest infection after chest infection, bronchiolitis, bronchitis.\"\nMr Griffiths said: \"We've got our heating on pretty much all the time, just to keep the house warm. It's a shambles, it really is.\"\nHis neighbour Lee Bowker said: \"There's ceilings with holes in them, smoke alarms hanging down - these haven't been corrected yet.\"\nHe added: \"The contractors, they come in then get moved. For whatever reason, it all came to a stop. Things need to move forward rather than being put back all the time.\"\nLocal councillor Andy Boddington called for an urgent meeting with Connexus.\nThe Liberal Democrat said: \"This is the worst thing we've had in Ludlow for decades. If you go round the houses, you think: 'God, this is disgraceful.'\"\nIn a statement, Connexus said: \"To get back on track, our new contractor has been on site completing work on properties where it had already started, as well as on five empty homes which will be completed in the next few weeks.\"\nIt added that it had written twice to tenants to explain the delay, and would continue to keep customers updated as work progressed.\nMr Griffiths said his message to the landlord was simple: \"You're just leaving us to live in this situation and it's not fair, it's not on. \n\"You need to have a look and see what damage you're doing to the families, and you really need to sort your act out.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Anti-seagull measures in south-west Scotland are to continue, after a meeting heard the birds' population is in decline. \nDumfries and Galloway Council (DGC) has spent tens of thousands of pounds to combat the issue of \"dive-bombing\" birds scavenging food during their breeding season.\nThe authority is planning to conduct its first seagull headcount in four years to assess the success of its \"gull management strategy\".\nSince the measures were introduced two years ago, complaints about the birds have dropped by more than 75%.\nThe region, including its main towns of Dumfries, Stranraer and Annan, has long-standing issues with the urban gulls swooping and taking food, as well as noise and mess problems. \nCouncillors have voted for the action plan - which includes egg and nest removal, and installing spikes on roofs - to continue for a third year. \nDGC's communities committee on Tuesday highlighted that the local authority spent all of its allocated \u00a384k on the issue across 2023-4. \nIt has put aside the same amount again for 2024-5, with the hope it is reducing the number of attacks on both residents and visitors.\nComplaints about the birds have fallen from 158 in 2021-22, to 96 across 2022-23, and 39 during 2023-24.\nBut with NatureScot reporting that avian flu has seen seagull numbers decline nationwide, it is not fully clear how successful DGC's efforts have been. \nAnd despite Tuesday's vote, some councillors expressed concern about gulls and the welfare of chicks.\nIndependent member David Slater questioned whether those removing nests were trained and worries that \"when eggs are taken away, they are actually throwing away live chicks\".\nHe said: \"How do they know how long the eggs have been incubated? It takes 28 days to hatch a seagull egg, and in the last week they are fully formed and whistling to each other.\n\u201cThere\u2019s other methods that could be used, it\u2019s a disgrace in this day and age.\u201d\nBen Dashper, of the SNP, feels \"there needs to be some sort of narrative around protection as well\".\nDGC's community protection manager, Sandra Harkness, said its programme was \"gull management, and not just eradication\", and that no chicks had been removed.\nShe said: \"It\u2019s about managing the population so they can live with residents, and not cause the level of distress they have been doing.\"\nWhile it is illegal to harm seagulls or remove their nests, an application can be made through NatureScot for a licence to remove nests and eggs.\nDGC had 37 licences for egg and nest removal granted by Nature Scot, with a permitted 660 eggs and 326 nests removed during 2023-24.\nThe action plan has seen 36 public buildings \"gull-proofed\" by contractors, who use spikes and other means to limit nesting opportunities.\nFollow the BBC for the South of Scotland on X. \nListen to news for Dumfries and Galloway on BBC Sounds.

    "A care home with faulty alert buttons has been put into special measures after managers failed to protect residents at high risk of falls, inspectors have said.  \nRiseley House Care Home in Macclesfield has been downgraded to inadequate by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).\nInspectors found repeated safety breaches at the home run by Laurel Bank Residential Care Home Limited.\nCare home owner Edmund Carley said improvements were under way.\nHe said \"swift action\" had been taken to employ consultants and use new software to improve care at the home under an \"ongoing programme of investment\".\nKaren Knapton of the CQC said an inspection in January found residents were at \"continued risk of harm\".\nTwenty-two people were living at the home, which cares for older people and adults with dementia, as well as those being rehabilitated after being discharged from hospital. \nInspectors found \"widespread shortfalls\" in leadership, with no CQC registered manager at the site, adding the risk to harm had \"increased\" since the last visit by the watchdog in 2023.\nRisks and safety were \"not sufficiently managed\",  the lift was not serviced, and residents were not assessed under mental health regulations to see if they had \"capacity to make decisions about their care\", they said.\nMs Knapton, the regulator's deputy director of operations in the north of England, said bosses at the home had failed to act on problems highlighted at the previous inspection last year.\nThese included safety issues, lack of detailed and consistent records, unsafe medicine storage, poor reporting of falls and ineffective equipment used to monitor residents at risk of falling.\nThe CQC has served two warning notices calling on the provider to ensure good governance systems are put in place, and safe care is provided. \nBut some residents shared positive feedback about the staff, and the home's relationship with the local GP surgery and hospital was praised.\nMs Knapton said the home's bosses had been told to oversee \"rapid, widespread improvements\" before inspectors return within six months.\nThe CQC \"won't hesitate to take further action if people aren't receiving the high level of care they deserve\", she said. \nMr Carley said he expected the improvements being made at the home would be highlighted in the next CQC inspection and he was \"confident the team is delivering care to a high standard\".\nWhy not follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X and Instagram?

It is wonderful to hear the crowd laughing,\" he said.\nLuke dresses as a clown and plays the \"booze-a-phone\", which is a series of bottles hung from a length of wood and tuned by filling each bottle with varying amounts of water. \nIt is then played like a xylophone, with Luke using the same beaters as his forbear.\n\"It is amazing to be holding the very same beaters that my great-great-grandfather used over 100 years ago. One of them is heavily taped up, but I would never replace them,\" he said.\nLuke's grandfather, 84-year-old Mike Austin, is a descendent of the Ginnett family, and has run and worked in circuses. \nHe said: \"It was emotional to see Luke playing an instrument that has such a history for me. \n\"My father Len 'Spider' Austin and my grandfather Albert were clowns, the latter dubbed 'Bandbox', who performed for Queen Victoria in Scotland in 1893.\"\nPatrick Austin, 47, said he was proud his son was \"bringing new life to the long established business\".\nCircus Ginnett can be seen at Bretton Park in Peterborough until 14 April, before moving on to Market Harborough and Huntingdon.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Plans for new large solar farms are facing growing opposition.\nA public meeting to discuss the plans was held by James Gray MP and campaign group, Stop Lime Down Solar Park on Wednesday in Malmesbury, Wiltshire.\nThe development aims to create 500MW of clean energy, said to be enough to power 115,000 homes. \nDeveloper Island Green Power said the farm would give a \"net gain in biodiversity\".\nSpeaking at the meeting, which was attended by 550 residents, the MP for North Wiltshire said he had \"never come across an issue as big as this\" during his 30 years of service to the area.\nA petition opposing the plans has been signed by more than 9,000 people.\nThe government will respond to the petition if it reaches 10,000 signatures.\nThe development is proposed to cover 2,000 acres (810 hectares) of agricultural land spanning six villages, including Sherston, Hullavington and Stanton St Quintin, near Malmesbury.\nThe sites would be connected to the National Grid's substation in Melksham, the proposals say. \nMike Tarrant has lived in Sherston for 45 years.\nHe told the meeting: \"We just don't want this.\n\"It's the wrong thing in the wrong place.\n\"We get thousands of people visit the whole area, a lot of people stay in Sherston for their holidays.\n\"And to drive six or seven miles and all you can see is bright shiny mirrors.\n\"It's just not the way it should be.\"\nSara Sorby lives in Rodbourne, close to the planned park.\nShe said she's \"not against renewable energy\", but worries that building such a big development will lead to \"tearing up\" the countryside.\nFormer Mayor of Malmesbury, Lesley Bennett, said the solar farm would be \"hugely beneficial\". \nShe said the solar panels would be \"virtually invisible\" when developers screen the farm with hedges.\n\"It's not going to be an affront to the landscape.\"\nGrowing up near the Watchfield solar arrays, she said: \"They're beautiful.\n\"You can go and walk amongst them, you can see the wild flowers, they have sheep in there sometimes to eat the grass, sky larks above them.\n\"It's just a lovely place.\"\nNatasha Worrall, project development manager at Island Green Power, said Lime Down Solar Park would provide \"a significant amount of clean electricity for businesses and homes in the region\".\n\"As well as providing clean electricity, which helps us move away from polluting fossil fuels, it is our ambition to design the project in a way that also boosts and enhances local wildlife by delivering a net gain in biodiversity.\"\nShe added: \"We are dedicated to responsible land use and believe that the development and delivery of utility-scale farms can co-exist harmoniously with their environment,\" she added.\nThe developer is running a six-week public consultation that ends on 26 April.",
    "A woman is pleading with people to understand the \"endless pain\" that speeding can cause, after the death of her son.\nJakki Hartland said she no longer enjoyed life after her son Ross Hartland was killed by a driver who was travelling at 82mph down the A5 in Shenstone, which had a speed limit of 70mph, in July 2022.\nThe speed was so high that the momentum forced 40-year-old Mr Hartland's car off the road and into a tree, causing it to overturn, police said.\nSean Bee, who was 22 at the time of the collision, pleaded guilty to causing death by driving without due care and attention in October.\nThe defendant, from Swindon Village near Cheltenham, was sentenced to 16 months in prison at Stafford Crown Court in January and disqualified from driving for 32 months. \nMr Hartland, who was from Walsall, suffered serious head and chest injuries and was rushed to hospital, where he spent 12 days in intensive care before the decision was made to switch his life support machine off.\n\"Ross was the heartbeat of every social setting he was in. I know it\u2019s a cliche, but he really did light up a room,\" his mother said.\n\"He was also incredibly generous, especially with his time, which is particularly cruel when you consider that he didn\u2019t even have that much of it in the end.\n\"I\u2019d be lying if I said that life was, in any way, good. I walk around with this knife pushed deep into my heart.\"\nMr Hartland's family have been deeply affected by his death. \nOne of his nieces was thrown into a panic when she was taking driving lessons, after driving past a roundabout near where he was hit, police said. \nHis death has left his youngest niece, aged seven, petrified of the road, drivers, and even moderate speed.\nAnd when his mother's phone was chewed by a family dog, she was distraught at the prospect of losing her son's voicemails.\n\u201cThankfully, I managed to get them all back, but I didn\u2019t care what the cost was,\" she said. \n\"I could live without money and without a phone, but I couldn\u2019t live without his voice.\"\nMs Hartland said the death of her son had opened her eyes to how hazardous the road could be, and how even the most careful drivers were not immune to the reckless actions of others.\n\"It only takes that one person to be unsafe and irresponsible, to disregard the law and to show a complete thoughtlessness and disrespect for everyone else and suddenly you\u2019ve ended one life and destroyed dozens more,\" she said.\n\"If I can just reach even one person to alert them, first-hand, to the very real dangers and consequences of speeding, then I hope I am still able to do some good. \n\"Even in death, I want my son\u2019s life to continue to have meaning.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Israel's military says it has recovered the body of a man taken hostage and held in Gaza, in an overnight operation in Khan Younis.\nElad Katzir was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October.\nHis body has been brought back to Israel, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israeli Security Agency (ISA) said.\nHe was identified by medical officials, and his family has been informed.\nThe IDF and ISA said in a joint statement: \"The body of the abductee Elad Katzir, who according to intelligence was murdered in captivity by the Islamic Jihad terrorist organisation, was rescued overnight from Khan Yunis and returned to Israeli territory.\"\nThey said his remains were located using \"precise\" intelligence.\nHe was buried in the Khan Younis refugee camp, at a site used by \"terror operatives\", a Times of Israel report said.\nInformation about the grave was obtained about a week ago and confirmed on Friday evening. Hours later his body was exhumed and returned to Israel, the report added.\nMr Katzir, 47, was abducted from Nir Oz with his mother Hanna, 77.\nShe was released along with 104 other hostages during a six-day ceasefire at the end of November.\nHis father, Avraham, was murdered in the kibbutz, the IDF and ISA said. \nMr Katzir's sister, Carmit Palty Katzir, blamed Israeli authorities for her brother's death in a post on social media, saying he would have returned alive had they agreed a new truce deal.\n\"Our leadership is cowardly and driven by political consideration, which is why this deal has not happened yet,\" she wrote on Facebook.\n\"Prime Minister, war cabinet, and coalition members: Look at yourself in the mirror and say if your hands didn't spill blood.\"\nIn January, Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad published a video purporting to show Mr Katzir speaking from captivity in Gaza. \nPrisoners of war and hostages are protected under international humanitarian law, and so the BBC does not broadcast the full details of material which may have been filmed under duress.\nIn the video, Mr Katzir said he had been close to dying more than once, and called on the Israeli government to stop the war and bring him and other hostages home. He also repeatedly said he loved and missed his family. \nIsraeli media said that according to IDF estimates Mr Katzir was murdered by his captors in mid-January, soon after the video was published.\n\"Our mission is to locate and return the abductees home,\" the IDF and ISA said on Saturday. \nThey said they are \"working in full coordination with the relevant national and security bodies and will continue until the task is complete\".\nHamas has said it will send a delegation to Egypt on Sunday for a new round of ceasefire talks.\nIsrael said it was undecided on whether to attend, adding that it would be \"more political theatre than actual progress\", Reuters news agency quoted an Israeli official as saying.\nThe 7 October Hamas attacks killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians.\nSome 33,137 people have been killed in Gaza since then, the Hamas-run health ministry says - many of them women and children. This includes at least 46 deaths over the past 24 hours, a ministry statement said. \nAccording to Israel, 253 Israelis and foreigners were taken during the attacks.\nAbout 129 hostages remain unaccounted for after being kidnapped - at least 34 of them are presumed dead.\nIsrael gives a slightly higher official figure because it includes four people taken hostage in 2014 and 2015. Two of these are believed to have died.",
    "Health bosses in North-West England have reported a significant increase in uptake of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab.\nThere has been a big push for parents and carers to get their children vaccinated, amid rising measles cases.\nLatest figures showed there had been 54 confirmed cases across the North West since 1 October 2023.\nGreater Manchester was one of several areas flagged up as being most at risk due to a lower uptake.\nDr Paula Cowan, North West regional medical director for primary care and a GP in Wirral, said: \"The World Health Organization (WHO), are looking for a 95% uptake in MMR, measles, mumps and rubella vaccination.\n\"What we're seeing in the North West is around the 85% mark so we really did a big push to encourage people to come forward for those vaccinations.\"\nShe added: \"I suppose people felt it (measles) had gone away and it hasn't gone away, and that's why we really needed to push the vaccination programme and encourage people to come forward.\"\nSince January, the NHS, UK Health Security Agency and local authorities had been urging millions of parents and carers to book their children and young people in for missed MMR vaccinations to protect them from becoming seriously unwell.\nThe new figures published by the NHS showed that between 1 January and 24 March a total of 360,964 MMR vaccinations were delivered.\nThis was up almost a quarter (23%) from 293,847 in 2023. It included 187,737 first doses and 171,635 second doses.\nTens of thousands more vaccinations were said to have been delivered nationally in the first three months of this year, compared to the same period in 2023.\nThe most significant increase in vaccinations was for those aged five to 25, with 75,499, four times as many vaccinations, in the first three months of 2024 than 18,433 in the same period last year.\nMore than a million parents and carers of children aged six to 11, including thousands in the North West, were invited to book an appointment with their child's GP practice.\nThroughout February and March, over a million children and young adults aged 11 to 25 in Greater Manchester, London and the West Midlands were also encouraged to book an appointment.\nThese areas were said to be most at risk due to the number of people not up-to-date on their MMR vaccinations.\nWhy not follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X and Instagram?

    "At least seven people have been killed in Russian drone attacks on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, officials say. \nMayor Ihor Terekhov said six people were killed when Iranian-made Shahed drones hit several buildings, including apartment blocks, early on Saturday.\nAnother person was killed in a second strike on a residential area, he added.\nAttacks on Kharkiv, the closest big city to the Russian border, have been intensifying in recent weeks. \nUkrainian officials have said the city might be the target of a future Russian offensive. \n\"This attack on peaceful residents of Kharkiv once again proves that Russia is a terrorist state,\" Mr Terekhov wrote on the Telegram messaging app after the first attack. \nAt least 11 people were injured by the attack in the residential Shevchenkivskyi district, according to the local prosecutor's office.\nIt said high-rise buildings, administrative buildings, dormitories, a kindergarten, shops, cafes and cars were damaged. \nUnverified photos published by Ukrainian police showed rescuers at the scene, with damaged and burning buildings visible. \nLocal police said Moscow fired two missiles, followed by \"repeated shelling\", and then drones which attacked during the rescue operations.\nVolodymyr Tymoshko, of the local police force, said on social media: \"When all relevant services were working at the site of the missile hit, enemy drones arrived.\"\nUkraine's second-largest city has suffered extensive damage from months of Russian bombardment since President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nPolish authorities said fighter jets had been scrambled in response to the latest missile attacks on Ukraine.\nAuthorities in Kyiv said air defences had been activated to repel an attack on the capital. \nUkraine's military said its air defences destroyed 28 of 32 drones and three of six missiles launched by Russia.\nOn Thursday, Russian forces attacked Kharkiv with drones, leaving at least four dead, according to Ukrainian officials. \nAnd on Friday, authorities said four people were killed and more than 20 wounded in Russian missile strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia.",
    "Former prime minister Boris Johnson has said it is \"shameful\" to call for the UK to end arms sales to Israel.\nThree Britons were among seven aid workers killed in air strikes in Gaza carried out by Israel's army on Monday.\nIt has led the Lib Dems, SNP and some Labour and Conservative MPs to urge the UK to reassess how it supports Israel.\nThe Foreign Office said it keeps advice on Israel's adherence to the law under review, adding that this is confidential. \nWriting in his Daily Mail column, Mr Johnson said it would be \"insane\" for the UK to end military support, which he said would be \"willing the military defeat of Israel and the victory of Hamas\".\nMr Johnson, a former foreign secretary, wrote: \"Remember that in order to win this conflict, Hamas only has to survive. All they need at the end is to hang on, rebuild, and go again. \n\"That's victory for Hamas; and that is what these legal experts seem to be asking for.\" \nMore than 600 lawyers, including former Supreme Court justices, this week wrote to the government saying weapon exports to Israel must end because the UK risks breaking international law over a \"plausible risk of genocide\" in Gaza. Israel rejects the claim of genocide as \"wholly unfounded\".\nThree Britons were among the World Central Kitchen (WCK) workers who died in the strikes: John Chapman, 57, James \"Jim\" Henderson, 33, and James Kirby, 47.\nWCK founder Jose Andres claimed the Israeli military knew of his aid workers' movements and targeted them \"systematically, car by car\".\nIsraeli officials reacted by sacking two senior military officers over the strikes, which it has described as a \"grave mistake stemming from a serious failure\".\nMr Johnson said it was \"shattering\" to see the deaths, but Israel was sending warnings of their attacks and \"trying to use precision munitions\".\nForeign Secretary Lord David Cameron previously said the UK would carefully review findings of the initial Israel Defense Forces (IDF) report into the incident, which was released on Friday.\nMr Johnson accused Lord Cameron of being silent on the issue, saying the foreign secretary had \"gone into a kind of purdah\" on arms sales.\nMuch of the Gaza Strip has been devastated during the IDF military operations which began after Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages.\nMore than 33,137 people have been killed in Gaza since then, with 75,815 injured, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nReacting to Mr Johnson's comments, a UK Foreign Office spokesman said: \"We keep advice on Israel's adherence to international humanitarian law under review and ministers act in accordance with that advice, for example when considering export licences.\n\"The content of the government's advice is confidential.\n\"Decisions on export licences are based on the Strategic Export Licensing Criteria. We would make public any decision to suspend or revoke existing licences.\"\nBritish arms sales to Israel are lower than those of other countries, including Germany and Italy, and dwarfed by the billions supplied by its largest arms supplier, the US.",

    "A 12-year planning row has come to an end after the owner of a mansion agreed to demolish its top floor.\nTheatre producer Adam Spiegel, who has worked on Hairspray and The Mousetrap, built Arcady in Cley-next-the-Sea in 2014.\nHe had gained planning permission but North Norfolk District Council said the \"dominant\" and \"intrusive\" home was not built as authorised.\nMr Spiegel, who has agreed to replace the upstairs floor with a pitched roof, declined to comment, said the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nMr Spiegel and his wife Gay had been locked in a dispute with North Norfolk District Council (NNDC) since 2012.\nThat year, they lodged their first application to knock down a small bungalow in Holt Road to make way for a larger, modernist home.\nThe application was rejected by NNDC, but a successful appeal to the Planning Inspectorate gave a green light to Arcady - which means \"rustic paradise\".\nBuilding work began in 2016 but the council found the property was not being built to the approved plan, saying it was too high.\nMr Spiegel was told he would have to make a new application, however construction work continued and no new application was made.\nThe structure caused uproar among villagers in the coastal community.\nPeople complained it was \"lit up like a Christmas tree\" at night, while others criticised its design as \"dystopian\" and resembling a medieval castle.\nMr Spiegel lost a subsequent appeal and the Planning Inspectorate said it required demolition of the unauthorised house by 18 October 2024.\nIn January 2024, Mr Spiegel lodged a new application with NNDC, which proposed the demolition of the second floor of the three-storey property for it to then be rebuilt.\nThe new designs replaced the flat roof with a pitched design, which aimed to better fit with the character of the more traditional properties surrounding it.\nHowever, the new structure will in fact end up being taller than the existing building at the apex of the roof.\nIan Scholfield, agent for the applicant, argued the redesign had been a collaborative and inclusive process and had been created following a public consultation event in the village.\nThe plans were approved by the planning committee by 12 votes to one, with one abstention.\nMore than 30 letters in favour were submitted to the council, while 20 people objected.\nNeighbour Jane Platt told the meeting the land levels were \"unlawful\", arguing the ground floor was at bedroom height of neighbouring homes.\nShe said the developer had taken a \"jazz-hands\" approach to rebuilding plans and complained it would be taller than it is now.\nMs Platt also highlighted that, of the people living in nine properties in Newgate Green, six households had objected.\n\"If this was a popularity contest, well done,\" she said.\nCouncillors voiced concerns about the project and struggled to consider the proposal in its own right, considering the history.\nCouncillor Peter Fisher described it as a \"strange edifice\" and resigned himself to the fact that the new design was \"probably the best we are going to get\".\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A campaign group has said it is \"shocking\" that the infrastructure minister has not intervened over plans to expand a Belfast Lough oil terminal.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Infrastructure (DfI) said minister John O'Dowd \"gave the matter careful consideration\".\nThe Cloghan Point terminal is located outside Whitehead in County Antrim.\nIt is currently used to store part of the Republic of Ireland's strategic reserve of diesel and gas oil.\nHowever, it is to be developed into a facility for importing oil to be stored on the site before being distributed across Northern Ireland and further afield.\nA planning application was submitted to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, and in September 2023 the council's planning committee voted to approve the expansion despite hundreds of letters of objection.\nIt has faced opposition from local residents concerned over a big increase in the site's use as well as climate change issues.\nIn some cases, planning decisions that are deemed to have a regional impact can be \"called in\" by the Department for Infrastructure.\nBut the DfI spokesperson said that Mr O'Dowd had considered the plans \"in line with all of his statutory obligations\".\nThey added that he \"has now written to Mid and East Antrim Council to inform them that the application will not be referred to the department for determination\".\nAs the minister has decided not to intervene, Mid and East Antrim Borough Council have said they will now officially issue the planning permission.\nHilary McCollum from the Stop Whitehead Oil Terminal group said she \"just doesn't understand\" how an argument can be made that the expansion of Cloghan Point will not have a regional impact.\n\"We all know we are in a climate crisis, we know we need to reduce fossil fuel use. And yet we are going to have another new oil terminal that's able to bring in oil from bigger tankers.\n\"That suggests to me an increase in oil imports into Northern Ireland.\n\"If you are increasing the amount of fossil fuels being brought in, how is that going to impact on Northern Ireland's strategy to reach net zero by 2050?\"\nMs McCollum said that \"sometimes things go wrong\".\n\"If there's an oil spill at Cloghan Point, or if there's, worst case, an explosion at Cloghan Point, that is not just going to affect the Mid and East Antrim area, that would affect the whole of Belfast Lough, it would affect north Down,\" she said.\nThe terminal was constructed more than 40 years ago and originally used to facilitate distribution of heavy fuel oil to Kilroot Power Station and Ballylumford Power Station in Islandmagee.",
    "Former prime minister Boris Johnson has said it is \"shameful\" to call for the UK to end arms sales to Israel.\nThree Britons were among seven aid workers killed in air strikes in Gaza carried out by Israel's army on Monday.\nIt has led the Lib Dems, SNP and some Labour and Conservative MPs to urge the UK to reassess how it supports Israel.\nThe Foreign Office said it keeps advice on Israel's adherence to the law under review, adding that this is confidential. \nWriting in his Daily Mail column, Mr Johnson said it would be \"insane\" for the UK to end military support, which he said would be \"willing the military defeat of Israel and the victory of Hamas\".\nMr Johnson, a former foreign secretary, wrote: \"Remember that in order to win this conflict, Hamas only has to survive. All they need at the end is to hang on, rebuild, and go again. \n\"That's victory for Hamas; and that is what these legal experts seem to be asking for.\" \nMore than 600 lawyers, including former Supreme Court justices, this week wrote to the government saying weapon exports to Israel must end because the UK risks breaking international law over a \"plausible risk of genocide\" in Gaza. Israel rejects the claim of genocide as \"wholly unfounded\".\nThree Britons were among the World Central Kitchen (WCK) workers who died in the strikes: John Chapman, 57, James \"Jim\" Henderson, 33, and James Kirby, 47.\nWCK founder Jose Andres claimed the Israeli military knew of his aid workers' movements and targeted them \"systematically, car by car\".\nIsraeli officials reacted by sacking two senior military officers over the strikes, which it has described as a \"grave mistake stemming from a serious failure\".\nMr Johnson said it was \"shattering\" to see the deaths, but Israel was sending warnings of their attacks and \"trying to use precision munitions\".\nForeign Secretary Lord David Cameron previously said the UK would carefully review findings of the initial Israel Defense Forces (IDF) report into the incident, which was released on Friday.\nMr Johnson accused Lord Cameron of being silent on the issue, saying the foreign secretary had \"gone into a kind of purdah\" on arms sales.\nMuch of the Gaza Strip has been devastated during the IDF military operations which began after Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages.\nMore than 33,137 people have been killed in Gaza since then, with 75,815 injured, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nReacting to Mr Johnson's comments, a UK Foreign Office spokesman said: \"We keep advice on Israel's adherence to international humanitarian law under review and ministers act in accordance with that advice, for example when considering export licences.\n\"The content of the government's advice is confidential.\n\"Decisions on export licences are based on the Strategic Export Licensing Criteria. We would make public any decision to suspend or revoke existing licences.\"\nBritish arms sales to Israel are lower than those of other countries, including Germany and Italy, and dwarfed by the billions supplied by its largest arms supplier, the US.",
    "An \"alliance of authoritarian powers\" is working more closely together against Western democracies, the head of Nato has warned.\nJens Stoltenberg told the BBC that Russia, Iran, China and North Korea are increasingly aligned.\nHe also said he was confident allies of the Nato military alliance would agree a long-term funding deal for Ukraine by July.\nBut he suggested Ukraine might have to decide on some \"kind of compromises\".\nMr Stoltenberg was speaking to Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, in an interview to be broadcast on Sunday morning.\nOn the Middle East conflict, he said it was \"very important\" that the US and other Nato countries conveyed \"a very clear message to Israel\" that they have to do \"significantly more\" to protect civilians and aid workers after the World Central Kitchen convoy attack.  \nMr Stoltenberg took over as the leader of Nato, the Western defence alliance, 10 years ago. \nSpeaking to mark the 75th anniversary of the organisation, he told me the world was now \"much more dangerous, much more unpredictable\" and \"much more violent\". \nHe said there is an \"authoritarian\" alliance giving each other practical support that is \"more and more aligned\". \nThe Nato chief explained: \"China is propping up the Russian war economy, delivering key parts to the defence industry, and in return, Moscow is mortgaging its future to Beijing.\" \nRussia was providing technology to Iran and North Korea in return for ammunition and military equipment, he added.  \nMr Stoltenberg told me that Nato had to work with other countries beyond its geography - such as Japan and South Korea - to \"stand up against this stronger alliance of authoritarian powers\". \nThe Nato chief has been trying to persuade other countries to commit more money to the war effort in Ukraine in recent days in the hope of a five-year, 100bn euro (\u00a386bn) fund. He said he was confident he would get an agreement by July, despite some countries expressing hesitation this week.  \nLong-term support was vital now, and to rebuild the country after the conflict, he said.\n\"Even if we believe and hope that the war will end in the near future, we need to support Ukraine for many years, to build their defences to deter future aggression,\" he said.\nSign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.\nHowever, while Mr Stoltenberg said that military support was vital to repel Russian forces from Ukraine and force Putin to give up his goals of occupation, he also suggested that Ukraine might ultimately have to make concessions too.\n\"At the end of the day, it has to be Ukraine that decides what kind of compromises they're willing to do, we need to enable them to be in a position where they actually achieve an acceptable result around the negotiating table,\" he said.\nHe said he was not calling for Ukraine to offer concessions now, and added that \"real peace\" would be achievable when \"Ukraine prevails\". But his language is notable because President Volodymyr Zelensky has always been adamant that he would never negotiate with Putin despite some calls on him to do so, including from the Pope.\nMr Stoltenberg refused to be drawn on whether he was concerned about the possible return of Donald Trump to the White House, saying only that he was sure the US would continue to be an important ally, whoever was in charge.  \nBut his remarks about the way regimes around the world are working together are a reminder for Western leaders of the complicated and dangerous diplomatic jigsaw they have to piece together.\nMore than two years into the conflict in Ukraine, our politicians must grapple with the reality that what is happening there is affected by decisions not just in Moscow and Kyiv but also in Washington DC, Brussels and London, as well as Beijing, Tehran and even Pyongyang.  \nMeanwhile, six months into the Middle East conflict in Gaza, as Jeremy Bowen writes, solutions are affected by decisions not just by Israelis and Palestinians, but also Iranians, politicians in the US, the Gulf States and the UK. \nMost recently, this has centred on a row over arms sales, prompting criticism of the government from all sides. The latest intervention came on Saturday morning from one former Conservative prime minister, Boris Johnson, to another, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron. \nForeign policy is rarely the overwhelming driver of votes and public opinion in the UK. This is partly because opposition parties traditionally try to avoid fights at home about battles abroad.  \nIt's also partly because voters' top priorities normally centre on their own lives and the prospects for their families. But that does not mean that the public doesn't care, or is immune from the horror they see unfolding on their screens every day, or hasn't been affected by world events - take, for instance, the huge energy price rises caused by the Ukraine conflict. \nAnd conflicts around the world in all their complexities are increasi",
    "In 2024, high-octane pop and dance music are out and folksy singer-songwriters are in, if new chart data is anything to go by.\nThree of the four biggest hits of the year so far have come from Noah Kahan, Teddy Swims and Benson Boone, according to the UK's Official Charts Company.\nKahan's pain-tinged folk track Stick Season, which was originally released back in 2022, became the most popular song of the first three months of this year after spending seven weeks at the top of the charts.\nSwims' addiction-themed Lose Control comes in second, after spending the past 13 weeks in the top 10.\nNext on the list is Sophie Ellis-Bextor's resurgent 2001 hit Murder on the Dancefloor - followed by Boone's viral heartbreak hit Beautiful Things.\nThe appetite for Kahan's music in particular has been steadily growing. A recent deluxe re-release of his third studio album, also titled Stick Season, and a collaboration with Brit Award winner Sam Fender on the track Homesick, have helped propel the 27-year-old into mainstream stardom.\nA profile of the Vermont artist by Billboard noted his wide-reaching influence, predicting that \"2024 may be the moment the greater sound of modern pop bends around him\". \nElements of his \"detailed storytelling, vulnerable vocals [and] scruffy guitar strums that could lead a song anywhere from folk to rock to country to pop\" can be heard in other artists, the music magazine said.\nSwims' ascent to stardom has been a little different - the 31-year-old Georgia native has been putting out songs since 2019, but only recently has perfected his sound, a blend of R&B, soul and rock.\nLose Control comes from his first album - I've Tried Everything But Therapy - which was released last year but didn't break the UK top 20 at the time.\nBoone is another newcomer - rising to fame on TikTok and American Idol, although he decided to drop out of the TV talent show after getting through the auditions.\nBeautiful Things is his biggest hit to date and features on his debut album Fireworks And Rollerblades, which came out on Friday.\nThe 21-year-old has been able to create a level of hype around his music online thanks to more than six million followers on TikTok, which has helped propel this song in the charts. In fact, all three have been fuelled by social media success.\nAnd all three bring a vulnerability to their music through their lyrics and vocal range, choosing to incorporate folk elements into their guitar-led tracks.\nMeanwhile, Michael Marcagi, another emerging US singer-songwriter, is about to embark on his first UK tour.\nMartin Talbot, who runs the Official Charts Company, tells the BBC they are all \"staking a claim for drums and guitars on the current Official Singles Chart Top 10\".\nHe adds: \"There is a growing interest in guitar and storytelling music over recent years, spanning country, Americana, folk and roots.\"\nBillboard's executive digital director Katie Atkinson said on the magazine's Pop Shop podcast that the rise of this new crop of singers is \"a country-fuelled trend\".\nIt is \"drawing a straight line\" from more clear-cut country singers, she said - with artists like Chris Stapleton, Luke Combs and Zach Bryan having seen huge success in the US over the past year.\nCountry music certainly has its British fans, but it is yet to achieve the same levels of success in the UK.\nBeyonc\u00e9's country-inspired album, Cowboy Carter, which was released last week, may help to boost the genre on radio and streaming playlists this year.\nHer first single from the album, Texas Hold 'Em, sits at number seven in the list of the biggest songs of the year so far after spending four weeks at number one in February and March.\nCountry music journalist and podcaster Holly Smith says songs like Stick Season are resonating with listeners because of the themes they cover.\n\"Noah Kahan has this emotional heart that's vulnerable and honest and connects with people,\" she tells the BBC. \"He's able to blend that with a very conventionally rock and pop sound that's catchy, and that gets people.\"\nOf the rising stars, Boone is the least aligned with the country sound, she says. \"But because his lyrics are confessional, because he's got this kind of acoustic vibe, it slots nicely into country, so it's easy to see how people are making that connection.\"\nThe UK's relationship with country music certainly isn't a new one - the Country Music Association's Country to Country festival has been selling out arenas in cities including London and Glasgow for more than 10 years, with established US stars such as Brad Paisley and Carly Pearce on this year's line-up.\nThe genre connects well with fans on TikTok, Smith says. \"Country music has a way of very simple, conversational storytelling that has always made it relatable, and social media loves that because social media has a way of boiling things down and distilling them,\" she says.\nSmith adds that the \"easily digestible lyrics\" and the cowboy aesthetic all help boost its appeal to audiences.\nAnother ",
    "Footballer Shaun Whiter was changing his friend's tyre on the side of the road in July 2016 when his life changed in an instant.\nA drink-driver smashed into him, crushing his legs, which later had to be amputated.\nThe 35-year-old, who lives in Hertford, had to give up his career and learn how to walk again.\nHere, in his own words, he explains why he would never go back to his old life and how grateful he is for his new one.\nEight years ago, I was enjoying my life, playing semi-professional football for Newmarket Town. I also worked as an estate agent in the Stansted area, and I had a great social life.\nI had just finished work for the day and met some friends to play golf. We were sitting in the clubhouse watching football on TV when my friend, who had left earlier, called me to say he had got a flat tyre so I went to go and help him.\nWe were on the pavement when a car came out of nowhere and smashed into us. He drove off and left us and I just remember thinking, \"why is he not helping us?\".\nI was squeezing the grass, in horrific pain. I was just trying to stay alive and I didn't look at my legs but I knew they had been crushed.\nMy friend was badly injured but he managed to call 999 and he saved my life. An air ambulance arrived and they put me in a coma, I was told later that I Iost five and a half pints of blood. When I woke up I was in Addenbrooke's hospital and they had amputated my legs.\nI was very emotional during the month I spent in hospital. At my lowest point, I kept thinking, 'Why did it happen, why me, what am I going to do with my life now?'\nIt was a huge adjustment going home but I had a lot of support from the football community and my family and some of my friends are tradesmen so they made adaptations to my home.\nI went to a rehab clinic where I was told I would never be able to run or swim, but I wasn't going to accept that. I think if I had done, and was living in a wheelchair, I might have taken to drink and drugs and gone down a dark path.\nI changed clinics and met two amazing people who brought me back to life - a physio called Kat Sizer and Jamie Gillespie, a prosthetist. They made me believe in myself and they worked out a plan so that I could be active again.\nTwo years on from the accident, I went for my first run, which was an incredible day. In 2021, I ran the London Marathon on blades, raising \u00a310,000 for the East Anglian Air Ambulance. It was a very emotional day.\nWhen I run, I sometimes think about the man who drove off and left me dying at the side of the road. \nI think to myself, \"you're not taking this away from me too\". I channel that anger into making me run faster. He only served 13 months in prison and has never shown any real remorse, but I try not to think about him apart from that. It's a waste of energy and I try my best to stay positive.\nBefore the marathon, I decided to climb Snowdon and I scrambled up using my hands. When I got to the top, I had a cry and let all the emotion out. When I got to the bottom, I decided I was going to ask a family friend, Hollie, who I had not spoken to in a while, out for a date.\nWe fell in love and now we have two sons, Kian aged three, and Owen who is 18 months. We are getting married in May and we couldn't be happier.\nBeing a parent with a physical disability can be difficult. It's very daunting to start with but it has given me even more motivation to stay fit and be the best father I can be.\nIt has also made me want to raise more awareness of dangerous driving, from drink-driving to people being distracted on their phones, and I share my story with professional sportsmen and women around the country.\nA lot of them drive powerful cars. I was hit by a Ford Focus but if it had been a bigger car, I would be dead. Some of them are still learning to drive, and I just want to protect them. If I can just put that thought in their head about being careful, I've done my job.\nAfter the accident, I started coaching the youth team at Ipswich Town and I recently went back to give them a talk. \nI also just went to talk to a group of young footballers at Chelsea and I kicked a football for the first time since my accident. I never thought that would be possible and it was a full circle moment for me.\nI want to make a difference and give back to the football community. I would love to complete an A to Z of football clubs, and give talks at them all. I would also love to do a triathlon one day. I can't wait to marry Hollie. She's my best friend and my hero. Without her support I wouldn't have been able to achieve any of this. \nThere have been so many positives that have come out of what happened to me, I wouldn't change a thing. I'm trying my best to make something good come out of it all. I can definitely say my life is better now than it ever was before.  \nAs told to Charlie Jones.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

    "The UK continues to stand by Israel's right to defend its security, Rishi Sunak has said, six months on from the start of the Israel-Gaza war.\nBut the prime minister said the nation remains \"appalled\" by the deaths of three British aid workers in an Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) strike this week.\nHe repeated calls for a \"humanitarian pause\" to allow more aid into Gaza.\nSeparately, the UK announced a Royal Navy ship is to be deployed to the region to help deliver aid.\nThe Foreign Office has pledged \u00a39.7m for aid, equipment and expertise to help an international effort to establish a maritime aid corridor between Cyprus and Gaza.  \nMeanwhile, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron warned that the UK's backing of Israel's right to self defence was \"not unconditional\". \nHe wrote in the Sunday Times that \"we expect such a proud and successful democracy to abide by international humanitarian law, even when challenged in this way\".\nHis comments came almost a week after seven humanitarian aid workers were killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza, an incident he described as \"tragic and avoidable\".\nSunday marks six months since Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages. \nAbout 129 hostages remain unaccounted for, with at least 34 presumed dead.  \nSince then, 33,137 people have been killed in Gaza, with more than 75,815 injured, the Hamas-run health ministry says.\n\"Six months later, Israeli wounds are still unhealed,\" said Mr Sunak. \"Families still mourn and hostages are still held by Hamas.\n\"And after six months of war in Gaza, the toll on civilians continues to grow - hunger, desperation, loss of life on an awful scale.\" \nHe said the UK had been \"straining every sinew\" to get aid into Gaza and that it \"must be flooded in\". He also repeated calls for an immediate humanitarian pause, leading to a \"long-term sustainable ceasefire\". \n\"We continue to stand by Israel's right to defeat the threat from Hamas terrorists and defend their security,\" said Mr Sunak. \n\"But the whole of the UK is shocked by the bloodshed, and appalled by the killing of brave British heroes who were bringing food to those in need.\"\nIsrael faced harsh criticism from its allies last week, after an IDF unit attacked a convoy of World Central Kitchen (WCK) vehicles from the air. \nSeven people were killed in the attack, including three British military veterans who were acting as the convoy's security team: John Chapman, 57, James \"Jim\" Henderson, 33, and James Kirby, 47.\nIsrael said the attack was a \"grave accident\" and has sacked two military officers after carrying out an inquiry.  \nMr Sunak's comments come after former prime minister Boris Johnson said it would be \"shameful\" for the UK to end arms sales to Israel.\nMr Johnson was responding to calls from some MPs to stop selling weapons to Israel after the IDF attack on the WCK aid workers. \nMore than 600 lawyers, including former Supreme Court justices, this week wrote to the government saying weapon exports to Israel must end because the UK risks breaking international law over a \"plausible risk of genocide\" in Gaza. Israel rejects the claim of genocide as \"wholly unfounded\".\nLabour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy also called for Israeli hostages to be returned home and condemned the \"intolerable death and destruction\" of the IDF's military campaign. \nMr Lammy called for \"an immediate ceasefire\".\nAnnouncing the \u00a39.7m aid package for Gaza, Lord Cameron warned in a statement of a real prospect of famine. \nThe foreign secretary said the UK, along with the US, Cyprus and other partners, will set up a temporary pier off the coast of Gaza. \nThe international plan, which aims to be up and running by early May, will see tens of thousands of tonnes of aid transported from Cyprus to Gaza via the pier. \nThe Foreign Office said the UK was continuing to call for urgent changes to the system, known as the deconfliction mechanism, for protecting humanitarian aid workers.",

    "\"It's a pain you can't describe,\" Raylene Nixon says quietly.\n\"It's something that you feel deeper than a broken heart - it's pain in your soul.\"\nIn 2021, she sat in a sterile room and watched Australian police footage of her son's death in real time, as he gasped for air and pleaded for help.\n\"Choke him out,\" one officer can be heard yelling in the body camera video, before another places Steven Nixon-McKellar in a neck restraint. \nMoments later, the 27-year-old Aboriginal man lost consciousness. Paramedics failed to resuscitate him, as his throat was obstructed by vomit.\nMr Nixon-McKellar is one of 562 Indigenous Australians to die in custody since 1991 - the year a landmark inquiry, intended to turn the tide on the issue, released hundreds of recommendations. \nBut few of those proposals have been implemented, studies suggest, and Indigenous people continue to die at alarming rates in prison cells, police vans, or during arrest. \nLast year was the most lethal on record, according to government data.  \nPolice advocates insist officers are using necessary force when confronted with life-threatening situations, and that each death is thoroughly examined.\nBut critics say there is a \"culture of impunity\" in which \"police are investigating police\" in cases alleging excessive force. They point to the fact that there has never been a conviction of a police or corrections officer over an Indigenous death in their care.   \n\"We're sending a message to society about what is and isn't acceptable behaviour,\" criminologist Amanda Porter says.\n\"And in Australia at the moment - it's open season.\"\nMr Nixon-McKellar died during his attempted arrest following an anonymous call to Queensland police suggesting he had been driving a stolen vehicle. \nThe officers involved have defended their use of the chokehold - which is now banned - on the basis that he was \"fighting\" them at the scene, making it difficult to deploy a taser or pepper spray. \nBut Ms Nixon questions whether they might have acted differently that day, had her son been white. \n\"The only thing they knew about him was the colour of his skin,\" she tells the BBC.\nThe findings from a coroner's inquiry into his death will soon be made public. \nHis case bears similarities to the death of David Dungay Jr inside a Sydney prison in 2015, a nationally famous incident which has been compared to George Floyd's death in the US.\nLike Mr Floyd, Mr Dungay also repeatedly yelled \"I can't breathe\" in his final moments. \nA diabetic, the 26-year-old had been trying to eat a packet of biscuits when six guards entered his cell with a riot shield to restrain him. Five of them then pinned him face down on a bed and sedated him.  \n\"You're the one who brought this on yourself Dungay,\" one officer can be heard saying in footage of the incident. \"If you're talking you can breathe,\" another adds.\nCorrective Services New South Wales has maintained that the death was not suspicious, and an internal investigation found no criminal negligence. \nA coroner did find that \"agitation as a result of the use of force\" was a contributing factor, along with Mr Dungay's pre-existing health conditions - but declined to send the case to prosecutors.\nMr Dungay's family has run a years-long campaign calling for charges to be laid against the officers involved. It led to a petition with over 110,000 signatures being sent to the NSW Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The office did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. \nAlthough Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people don't die at a greater rate than non-Indigenous prisoners, they are much more likely to find themselves in prison or police lock up. \nThat was one of the central findings of the 1991 inquiry - and it has worsened with time. \nToday they comprise 33% of Australia's prisoners, though they are just 3.8% of the national population. Socio-economic disadvantage and \"over-policing\" are central to the disparity, numerous investigations have heard.\n\"There's a legacy of colonisation in Australia where First Nations people have always been disproportionately segregated and controlled,\" says Thalia Anthony, a law professor at the University of Technology Sydney. \nShe and others argue this has injected racist stereotypes into policing, leading to Indigenous Australians being treated as \"deviant, drug addicted, or alcoholics\" and paid undue attention. \nReviews are currently under way in Queensland and the Northern Territory to address allegations of widespread racism within both forces. \nWestern Australia Police has introduced strategies to address institutional racism, and Victoria Police's chief commissioner recently offered an unreserved apology to Aboriginal families for \"undetected, unchecked and unpunished\" systemic discrimination. \nFederal and state governments have introduced some services aimed at lowering Indigenous incarceration rates.

    "Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has been arrested by Dutch police at a protest in The Hague.\nThe 21-year-old joined hundreds of protesters in a march against fossil fuel subsidies on Saturday.\nThe protest devolved into a standoff as dozens of police officers, some on horseback, attempted to stop protesters from blocking a main road.\nLocal police put Ms Thunberg on a bus full of demonstrators and she was driven away from the scene. \nProtesters had planned to block The Hague's A12 highway for what Extinction Rebellion (XR) organisers say was the 37th time. The road has been subject to regular blockades since 2022.\nThe demonstration was called to denounce the Dutch government's tax concessions for companies connected to the fossil fuel industry, including the energy firm, Shell, and the airline, KLM. \nActivists hoped to pile pressure on the government ahead of a planned debate about fossil fuel subsidies in June.   \nFlanked by fellow activists, Ms Thunberg marched towards the designated protest spot behind a banner with the words, STOP FOSSIL SUBSIDIES.\nThe world's most recognizable climate activist tried to blend in with the crowd, but her star-power meant this demonstration attracted more attention than previous XR blockades of the A12 highway.\nA brass band played and the protesters sang traditional Dutch songs given a modern climate-conscious twist.\nSome newspapers had claimed local residents were annoyed the climate protest was taking place on the hottest day of the year so far, potentially making it harder for people to reach the beach in The Hague.\nA group of activists then marched from the city centre to a field next to the highway, where a wall of local police officers was waiting for them.\nA few demonstrators broke through police lines but were quickly picked up and handcuffed.\n\"It's important to demonstrate today because we are living in a state of planetary emergency,\" Ms Thunberg told AFP news agency.\n\"We must do everything to avoid that crisis and to save human lives.\"\nAsked whether she was concerned about police action, she said: \"Why should I be?\"\nMs Thunberg was among a small group of climate activists who broke away and managed to reach the road. More than a hundred of them were placed in police-commandeered minibuses. \nThe Swedish activist described her arrest as 'peaceful'. She sat at the back and chatted before being driven away.\nAt previous protests in The Hague, police have driven detainees away from a protest's epicentre and released them without further consequences. \nThose, including Ms Thunberg, who managed to separate from the colourful crowd and sit down cross-legged on the A12 highway, were first asked by police if they wanted to cooperate by boarding the buses. Those who refused were hoisted up by arms and rucksacks and deposited in the vehicles.\u00a0\nLater on Saturday, reports emerged that Ms Thunberg had returned to the protest and been arrested for a second time. \nPolice told the BBC some people who were arrested and released were then arrested again. They did not confirm if Ms Thunberg was among them. \nAs of about 14:00 local time (12:00 GMT), traffic was still flowing on the A12, according to the Netherlands' Algemeen Dagblad newspaper.\nThe Hague's local police told the BBC: \"While we can't comment on individual cases, we can confirm that all of the people who were picked up by police and put on to minibuses were officially arrested, because they were blocking the highway and that is against the law.\"\nMs Thunberg has been a leading climate campaigner since she was 15 years old. \nIn February, she and four co-defendants were found not guilty of breaking the law when they refused to follow police instructions during a climate demonstration in London.

    "The government has temporarily banned permits for new incinerator plants in England, including one the Environment Secretary Steve Barclay is fighting to stop being built in his constituency.\nThe environment department will now consider how many plants are needed.\nIt comes after a top government lawyer warned a plan being explored to pause permits was \"unlawful\".\nThis month Mr Barclay said the proposed incinerator in his Cambridgeshire seat was a \"massive blot on the landscape\".\nThe large waste-to-energy plant is being proposed in Wisbech, in the North East Cambridgeshire constituency.\nThe decision to instruct the Environment Agency to temporarily stop granting licences was made by junior Environment Minister Sir Mark Spencer, after Mr Barclay was recused from the process.\nIn a letter to the agency's head, Sir Mark says he is worried about the risk that expanding incineration capacity could pose to environmental obligations.\nHe describes it as a \"temporary pause\" to allow government officials to \"lead a piece of work considering the role of waste incineration in the management of residual waste in England\".\nThe work will consider whether the capacity being developed fits with government objectives to reduce the amount of waste incinerated and will look at concerns about \"over-provision\". It could lead to a further formal review.\nEarlier this month, Mr Barclay suggested that the case for new incinerators would be \"undermined\" by making progress on a government target to halve the waste which goes to them.\nA source from Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the environment secretary would not have any involvement in the work.\nThe order is set to expire on 24 May but could be withdrawn earlier.\nApplications for 10 incinerators across England are thought to be affected, but plants which dispose of clinical or hazardous waste are exempt from the pause.\nIn March, the BBC saw an internal legal note which had been compiled within government after consultation with Sir James Eadie KC, the First Treasury counsel.\nAt that point it is understood the government was privately exploring the consequences of pausing licences for up to a year.\nThe note said that that proposal raised \"serious concerns of perceived bias\" as it had come shortly after permission was granted by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (Desnez) for the Wisbech incinerator to be built.\nThe plant still needs a licence from the Environment Agency, a non-departmental public body, to go ahead.\nThe legal note advised that the proposed suspension would have been \"unlawful\" because \"the consultation undertaken\u2026was plainly inadequate\" and noted \"the context of the secretary of state's constituency interests\".\nIn an article written for this month's edition of a local Cambridgeshire magazine, \"Discovering Wisbech\", Mr Barclay wrote he was committed to \"doing everything possible to fight\" the new incinerator.\nHe described it as a \"massive blot on the landscape\" and said that he had already had conversations with Fenland District Council about supporting them in bringing forward a judicial review of the decision to grant planning consent.\nA spokesperson for Defra said the department was committed to reducing waste, improving recycling and meeting net zero targets for sending less waste for incineration. \n\"We must make sure we have the right waste management infrastructure to meet these goals, and are rightly considering the need for more waste incineration facilities.\"\nBut Labour's shadow environment secretary Steve Reed said there were \"serious concerns\" Mr Barclay abused his position to prop up his constituency decision. \n\"The British public deserve answers. Who did Barclay try to persuade, when, and which other ministers were involved,\" he said.\nMr Barclay told a committee of MPs in March that he had never \"made representations as secretary of state\" to the Environment Agency about the Wisbech project.\nHe also said that he had delegated the policy to another minister and apologised for not formally recusing himself earlier.",
    "Dozens of flights have been cancelled as Storm Kathleen brings strong winds and the warmest day of the year so far to the UK.\nAbout 140 flights departing and arriving at UK airports were cancelled after the Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for wind.\nRail and ferry services have also been affected in Scotland.\nWind gusts of over 70mph (112km/h) swept many parts and temperatures hit 21.4C (70.5F) in eastern England.\nThe strongest gusts of 101mph were recorded at the summit of Cairngorm, a mountain in the Scottish Highlands.\nThe year's warmest temperature was recorded in Lakenheath, Suffolk, on Saturday, BBC Weather said. This beat the previous high of 19.9C in north-west Scotland in January.\nThe most significant impacts of the storm have been felt in the north-west and south-west of England and parts of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.\nThousands of passengers experienced delays when flights were cancelled at airports including Heathrow, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Belfast City. \nThe vast majority of flights affected were those travelling within the UK and to and from the island of Ireland.\nEasyJet flights to and from the Isle of Man were also halted. \nThe 11th named storm in eight months, Storm Kathleen was named by the Irish met service, Met \u00c9ireann, because the Republic of Ireland was expected to feel its effects most acutely. \nAround 12,000 customers have been left without electricity as the storm moves across the island of Ireland, where trees have fallen in the strong winds. \nIn Northern Ireland, Met Office yellow wind warning for counties Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Londonderry is set to lift at 22:00 BST on Saturday.\nEarlier in the day, part of the roof of the Titanic Belfast museum was damaged by the storm.\nSome Irish Sea coastal regions have seen gusts of 69mph and large waves.\nIn Capel Curing, north Wales, wind speeds reached 68mph.\nP&O Ferries cancelled ferry services travelling between Larne in Northern Ireland and Cairnryan in Scotland, with ferry services to and from the Isle of Man also disrupted.\nThe strong winds have also seen sports matches rearranged, with Saturday evening's EPCR Challenge Cup rugby match between Edinburgh and Bayonne moved from the Hive Stadium to Murrayfield. \nStorm Kathleen is expected to ease by Sunday evening.\nBBC weather forecaster George Goodfellow said the storm had brought warm air from north-west Africa over the North Atlantic.\nHe said: \"It's still sat out there to the west of the UK - it's fairly slow-moving, as much as we've had strong winds. We're expecting further strong winds tomorrow as well.\"\nWhile eastern parts of the country have been \"a bit on the windy side in places, the main thing is how warm it's been,\" the forecaster added. \n\"It's not unusual to get such warm temperatures in April, but looking at the temperatures we've had recently, [Saturday is] quite a lot warmer than it has been. To suddenly break through the 20 degree barrier is quite impressive,\" he said.\nThe highest recorded temperature for April was 29.4C, recorded in Camden Square in London in 1949, Mr Goodfellow said. \nWhile the storm is not unusual in terms of its intensity, he said the fact Storm Kathleen will last until Sunday means \"it's a fairly long-lived thing.\"\nMore than 110 flood alerts are in place across England. The Environment Agency has issued 15 flood warnings where flooding is expected.\nRAC Breakdown spokesman Rod Dennis said: \"This intense period of stormy weather is going to prove extremely challenging for anyone driving on the western side of the UK.\n\"We strongly urge drivers to avoid exposed coasts and higher routes where the impact of the very strong winds is most likely to be felt.\"\nFind out the weather forecast for your area, with an hourly breakdown and a 14-day lookahead, by downloading the BBC Weather app: Apple - Android - Amazon \nThe BBC Weather app is only available to download in the UK.\nAre you affected by the issues raised in this story?

    "The military regime which seized power in Myanmar three years ago has suffered another big defeat, this time on the eastern border with Thailand.\nTroops had suffered weeks of attacks by ethnic Karen insurgents, allied with other anti-coup forces.\nHundreds of troops guarding the vital border town of Myawaddy have now agreed to surrender.\nMost of Myanmar's overland trade with Thailand passes through Myawaddy.\nOn Friday, the Karen National Union announced that it had accepted the surrender of a battalion based in the town of Thanganyinaung, about 10km (6.2 miles) west of Myawaddy.\nIt posted a video of its jubilant fighters showing off a substantial arsenal of weapons they had captured.\nOver the weekend, the Karen forces have been negotiating with the last remaining battalion inside Myawaddy, which has apparently agreed to surrender.\nThis is a serious setback for the military junta, which in recent months has also been driven out of large areas along the Chinese border in Shan State, and in Rakhine State near the border with Bangladesh.\nThousands of soldiers have already either been killed, or have surrendered or defected to the opposition, forcing the military to impose conscription on the population to try to make up the losses.\nThe Karen National Union has been fighting for self-rule for the ethnic Karen people since Myanmar's independence in 1948.\nHowever it suffered a series of defeats by government forces in the 1990s, and after 2015 had been part of a national ceasefire.\nThe 2021 coup changed that, with the KNU announcing that the overthrow of the elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi had invalidated the ceasefire.\nBecause it is relatively close to Yangon, the largest city in Myanmar, and offers the best route to the Thai border, Karen State was a favoured destination for dissidents fleeing the brutal military suppression of protests after the coup.\nThe KNU has helped train many volunteer fighters from the cities, who have joined it in renewed attacks on military positions.\nThe KNU has also been trying to co-ordinate its operations with those of other big insurgent groups like the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force to the north of Karen State, and the Kachin Independence Army in the far north of the country.\nThe balance of power in Karen State has recently shifted in favour of the opposition, as a powerful militia based on the Thai border, funded by scam centres and which had been backing the military junta, switched sides earlier this year.\nOverstretched by fighting in so many other parts of Myanmar, the military has also been unable to reinforce its positions in Karen State, and it lost control of the main roads to the border.\nThe junta has responded to these losses by launching more air strikes on the areas now controlled by the insurgents.\nThousands of non-combatants have already lost their homes to the conflict in Karen, and many more are now reported to be moving towards the Thai border in anticipation of continued air strikes in the days ahead.",

    "Flood waters are expected to rise in Sydney after torrential rainfall on Friday caused flash flooding in parts of Australia's second-largest city, the authorities have warned.\nHeavy rain pummelled parts of the city for 24 hours, forcing thousands to evacuate the city's outskirts.\nThe rain also caused the city's main supply of water, the Warragamba Dam, to spill two days earlier than expected.\nPeople living downstream of the dam have been warned to expect more floods.\nThe dam started spilling on Saturday morning and has been pumping the equivalent of 80,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools downstream every single hour since, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.\nThe dam's water levels were expected to peak by midnight local time (13:00 GMT) on Saturday, according to officials. But some residents have been warned of further flood risks as most of the water from the dam is yet to reach Sydney's flood-prone areas.\n\"We have been out with the community, letting them know what is coming and ensuring they prepare,\" New South Wales State Emergency Service commissioner Carlene York told reporters.\n\"We don't think those waters are affecting a significant amount of people in those areas but certainly rural farmland, stock and families and businesses... need to be aware of the next couple of days as the water will continue to flow down at a high level in those river systems.\"\nThe water levels in the Hawkesbury and Nepean rivers are expected to rise in the coming days.\nWaterNSW CEO Andrew George said there was also water spillage coming from other dams, including the Tallowa Dam on the Shaolhaven River and the Blue Mountains dam. Spillages from three other metropolitan dams was expected, he said, quoted by 9News.\nThe storm led to a month's worth of rain pummelling Sydney on Friday, leading authorities to issue emergency evacuation warnings for many of the city's low-lying areas, including Richmond and Windsor.\n\"While it looks like blue skies across Sydney at the moment and the emergency rain situation seems to be easing\u2026 it is important to note that flood levels in some of the rivers, particularly in western Sydney, are continuing to rise and that presents a danger for some communities,\" New South Wales Premier Chris Minns told reporters on Saturday.\nMore than 150 people were rescued from floods on Saturday, the New South Wales State Emergency Service said, adding that 72 rescues took place in Sydney. \nOne man was found dead in water near a reserve in Penrith, in Sydney's west on Saturday. New South Wales police said it was not clear whether his death was related to the storm. \nThousands have been left without power.\nMany train services across Sydney have not been running because of flooding on the tracks while many roads have also been closed.\nThe only access road to Megalong Valley in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, has been cut off by a major landslide caused by the wet weather.\nLocal Mayor Mark Greenhill said food drops might have to be organised for residents who were isolated.\n\"The destruction is so great that we can't even get people out, let alone vehicles,\" he told ABC Radio Sydney.\nPictures also show houses destroyed in Wollongong city, south of the state capital.\nFlood warnings have been issued in Queensland state too, with residents advised to avoid unnecessary travel.",

    "Sacha Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher have announced they are getting divorced after two decades together.\nIn a social media post announcing the split, the actors said they jointly filed to end their marriage last year. \nThe pair, who have three children, met in 2001 and got engaged in 2004.\nSharing the news with a picture of themselves wearing tennis whites, they wrote: \"After a long tennis match lasting over 20 years, we are finally putting our racquets down.\"\nIn the post, published on Baron Cohen and Fisher's Instagram stories on Friday, they said: \"We have always prioritized our privacy, and have been quietly working through this change.\n\"We forever share in our devotion and love for our children. We sincerely appreciate your respecting our family's wish for privacy.\"\nThe pair first met at a party in Sydney, Australia. Baron Cohen later told The New York Times about their first encounter, saying Fisher was \"hilarious\".\n\"We were at a very pretentious party, and me and her bonded over taking the mick out of the other people at the party. I knew instantly. I don't know if she did.\"\nBaron Cohen rose to fame in the 1990s with his Ali G character, the infamous spoof wannabe gangster who became a comedy star.\nHe also starred as Borat, a journalist from Kazakhstan, and played the role of flamboyant Austrian fashionista Bruno. \nFellow actor Fisher appeared as Shannon Reed in long-running Australian soap Home and Away before moving to the big screen.\nHer breakthrough role came in Wedding Crashers in 2005, and she also starred in Confessions of a Shopaholic. She has also had a series of children's books published.\nLast month, Baron Cohen and Australian actress Rebel Wilson got involved in a dispute ahead of the release of her memoir.\nThe book includes allegations against Baron Cohen, who is understood to have threatened legal action.\nWilson wrote that she was asked to do some things that were \"derogatory to women or to my size\" while shooting Baron Cohen's 2016 film Grimsby, and some scenes made her feel like she was \"being humiliated\" and \"sexually harassed\".\nShe likened the comedian to a \"fourth-grade bully who teases the fat girl on the playground and tries to make her life a living hell\".\nBaron Cohen's lawyers have said the evidence shows her allegations have \"no basis in reality\" and are part of a \"cynical commercial ploy to promote her book\". \nThey have supplied video footage of one scene in question, plus email exchanges, script excerpts and testimony from producers and crew members, which his lawyers say back up his case.\nThe memoir was due to be released in the UK on Thursday, but the release date has now been moved to 25 April. It has already been released in the US.",
    "For more than 50 years, the hippy neighbourhood of Christiania has been a haven of counter-culture, in the very heart of the Danish capital Copenhagen.\nPopular with tourists, it is known for its liberal attitude towards cannabis and the infamous drug market, Pusher Street.\nHowever, in recent years organised criminals have increasingly taken over, and growing violence has rattled the community.  \nResidents have now had enough. In a bid to reclaim the street from drug dealers, this Saturday they began physically digging it up, armed with spades and crowbars. \nThere were celebratory claps and cheers of \"Christiania\",  as locals prised up heavy cobblestones and tossed them into wheelbarrows, one by one. \n\"We've been breaking up Pusher Street. It's closing down today. So it's a kind of a closing party,\" said local Pia Jagger, carrying away a big stone.\nNow this roughly 100-metre stretch of road has a new sign reading: \"Pusher Street is closed today.\"\n\"In the last five or six years I haven't been here that much because I have kids and I didn't feel very safe,\" said onlooker Sofie Ostergaard. \"Today I brought all three of them, and they're helping.\" \nStanding beside a rainbow-coloured cargo bike, 40-year resident Hulda Mader told the BBC: \"It feels like a historic moment. We're very happy for it.\"\nA spokeswoman for Christiania's press group, she said: \"We are very tired of people saying Pusher Street is Christiania. It is not.\"\nThough it's illegal in Denmark, cannabis has been sold openly in Christiania for decades.\nBut many of the original local dealers have been pushed out, as organised gangs have wrested control. In the last three years, there has been a spate of stabbings and fatal shootings. \nAccording to Ms Mader, the community reached a turning point about a year-and-a-half ago. \n\"Two people came in,\" she said. \"They shot one dead and injured four others. That was absolutely where we said this is enough.\"\n\"We're going to dig it up. We're gonna change all the infrastructure. Then we're gonna start building other stuff.\"\n\"For us hash is not the problem, it's the money in it,\" Mette Prag, a representative from the Freetown Christiania Foundation, told reporters. \n\"But the last years with all the violence and all the fighting, we cannot have it in our society. That's why now this chapter must come to an end.\"\nAmong those present on Saturday was Danish Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard. \n\"It is a day that is the beginning of the end, of the very, very deep roots that organised crime gangs have established in this neighbourhood in Copenhagen,\" he said.\n\"To safeguard that Christiania will continue to be a vibrant, colourful, creative part of Denmark, it needs to be a place without organised criminal gangs.\"\nTourists are still welcome to visit Christiania, he added, but not for drugs.\nOrdinarily this T-shaped strip is the epicentre of Denmark's cannabis trade, where so-called pushers hawk weed from behind makeshift stacks of beer crates and plywood market stalls, labelled with names like Green Rocket and Blue Dream. Just three days ago, the BBC counted roughly 20 sellers. \nUntil the late 1990s it was informally tolerated, says Kim Moeller, a professor of criminology at Malmo University. But that ended in the 2000s, as the market grew bigger and more visible. \nHe says about five different gangs now operate, and that has brought more disputes. \n\"If you have a conflict between groups in Copenhagen, they can most likely find each other in Pusher Street where they can shoot at each other,\" says Deputy Police Inspector Simon Hansen, who oversees the Copenhagen police force's operation in Christiania.\nIt is often the people manning these shops who get caught up, he says. \"They are sometimes kids. Sometimes people who have some kind of disability, and people who can't get a job.\"\nPolice have repeatedly raided Pusher Street but the dealers have kept coming back.\n\"We clear out the shops 100 times a year\", Mr Hansen said. \"That sounds like pushing the same rock up a mountain. But we don't want the shops to evolve to small houses and sheds.\"\nFound within a kilometre of the Danish parliament, Freetown Christiania was established in 1971 when a bunch of anarchists and hippies squatted inside a vacant military base. \nThey set up an independent commune, with its owns rules and flag. There is no leader and decisions are made by consensus at communal meetings. The Danish state eventually accepted Christiania as a radical \"social experiment\", later giving it legal status. \nLocal gallery owner Marios Orozco moved here from the USA in 1981, when he was 19.  \n\"I had long hair and found Christiania to be the perfect hippy dream,\" he told the BBC.\n\"You can imagine a village filled with people that didn't fit into society. There were bikers, hippies and nudists running around. It was sort of a chaotic piece of heaven.\"\nToday 1,000 residents, including 250 children, live in the graffiti-covered barracks and wooden cottages along Copenhagen",
    "Many of the front and inside pages are dedicated to the war in Gaza, on the sixth month anniversary of the start of the conflict. \nWriting for the Sunday Times, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron describes it as a \"grim milestone\" and says it is important to remember the attacks by Hamas on Israel which started it. But he also describes last week's killing of seven aid workers by an Israeli airstrike as \"tragic and avoidable\", and says it must not be allowed to happen again. \n\"Britain joins rush to help\" says the Sun on Sunday reflecting on the Royal Navy ship being sent to support aid deliveries for Gaza. The Observer says the Royal Navy has been \"ordered into action\" amid warnings that people trapped in the territory are \"on the brink of famine\". \nThe Sunday Mirror takes a more personal look at the past six months, focusing on a British couple whose daughter and two granddaughters were killed in the 7 October attacks. Their son-in-law was taken hostage by Hamas, and they explain they do not know what has become of him. \nGillian Brisley says she tries to keep her \"hatred for Hamas\" under control because \"if I fill my heart with too much hate, there's no room left in it for our family that's gone\".\nThe Sunday Telegraph says two former ministers, James Heappey and Ben Wallace, have delivered a \"stark wake up call\" to the government by warning the UK is \"failing to prepare for war\". Mr Heappey, who was the armed forces minister until last month, says he does not think we're on the cusp of another world war but we are in a new era since Russia's invasion of Ukraine two years ago. He also says ministers need to consider the time it takes to prepare for conflict. Former defence secretary Ben Wallace is quoted as saying too many in government are hoping the current worldwide instabilities will \"go away\". A government spokesperson says the UK has robust plans in place for \"a range of potential emergencies and scenarios\".\nThe  Mail on Sunday says it has found new information regarding the sale of Angela Rayner's council house almost ten years ago. Labour's deputy leader has faced questions about whether the property was her principal residence at the time, a distinction that would determine how much tax she owed when the house was sold. \nThe paper says it has uncovered social media posts by Ms Rayner showing life with her family at her husband's property. She denies any wrongdoing. A Labour spokesman has told the paper Ms Rayner \"always made clear\" she also spent time at her husband's property as \"she was perfectly entitled to do so\".\nAccording to the Observer the family of the late children's author and illustrator, David McKee, have found a manuscript and rough sketches for a new story featuring Elmer the Elephant. Dates on the pieces suggest he had been working on it shortly before he died in 2022, at the age of 87. \nThe paper says the story, takes on the climate crisis and sees the patchwork Elmer meet a white bear in the jungle trying to find his way home after \"floating from the frozen north on a tiny scrap of melting ice\". It's due to be published next year. ",
    "I was going to use the words \"what I've learned\" at the top of this article, and in fact I just did. \nBut given I bark out around 3,000 questions per series, and that I cannot in good conscience claim to have known all the answers before I read them out, I've learned so much that those words seem insufficient. \nSo let's just call these salutary lessons from my first series hosting Britain's longest-running TV quiz, University Challenge.\nThe overriding feeling from the experience is a profound respect, verging on awe, for the extraordinary young contestants. \nThey are all so impressive intellectually, of course; but beyond that, they are immensely charming, and so excited to have made the journey from their respective campuses. \nThere are times when certain students get in a zone where they seem to be giving correct answers before hearing the questions. \nIt is bewitching telly, and rather unsettling in the flesh. How can they know so much about the tools of the Mesolithic period and French kings and differential equations and the moons of Neptune? \nYet they do. \nOften from humble backgrounds, or autodidacts, or both, the sliver of young humanity who take part in our quiz will instantly fill you with hope for the future. \nPutting them to work in our fastest-growing industries could solve our productivity crisis at a stroke, and why our best companies don't have recruiters loitering at the studio door is beyond me. \nBut then I guess there's LinkedIn for that.\nWhen I took part in the alumni series, I was astonished to discover that Roger Tilling, the legendary voice of the buzzer, is a real person in the studio, who does the names live. \nMost new contestants similarly are shocked to meet him, not least because he's 6ft 5in tall.\nHe has a glorious, panoramic view of the studio from his slightly elevated perch just off-camera. \nAnd here's a thing: in my whole first series, and indeed the many episodes I've filmed since, Roger must have bellowed out several thousand surnames, and more than 10,000 syllables. \nHe hasn't got a single one wrong. What a pro. \nCuriously, he lives just yards from my parents' house in Tooting, so I probably walked past or near him for years.\nAll my life I've pronounced it \"Haitch\", dimly aware that I was getting it \"wrong\". \nEveryone I grew up with says \"Haitch\". My mates say \"Haitch\". \nBut, dear reader, I'm here to tell you: it's \"Aitch.\" \nThis matters a lot to a lot of people, which is fair enough. \nIn the new series, starting this summer, you will hear me say \"Aitch,\" although \"Haitch\" is actually listed as a variant in the Oxford English Dictionary. \nBy the way, apropos of nothing in particular, it's pronounced \"bio-pic\", not \"bi-opic\", for obvious reasons.\nThe \"We need jungle, I'm afraid\" phenomenon was the unforeseen glory of this first series, and contained a great lesson: this quiz has infinite viral potential. \nI'd actually seen a couple of magnificent viral clips from previous series, when Jeremy Paxman was hosting. \nBut it was only when my answer about the distinction between drum'n'bass and jungle went viral that I realised that each question is a little narrative arc. \nIt goes: Question, change of shot, teams ponder, answer given... pay-off with laughter. \nEach question is a little story, or joke, that could meet social media infamy. \nWhether they lead to actual beers being invented and named after answers I give seems outlandish. But then it's happened, hasn't it?\nWhich brings us onto the brilliance of quizzes on television. What makes a successful TV format? \nAn emotional and moral journey, from exposition of plot to resolution, in which you get to know groups of people, with stand-out characters. \nIdeally there should be warmth, and jeopardy. Quizzes provide all that. \nThrow in a huge amount of satisfaction through learning, and the highly participative lean-in element, in which you can actually get involved by barking answers from the sofa and impressing your family, and you have TV gold. \nIconic music helps. And a good-looking studio, which is still way cheaper than, say, drama. \nIt's a wonder, frankly, that there aren't more of them. \nOne thing I didn't know was that the host has not just a director but the series producer, and a questions producer or two in his ear.\nI am really not exaggerating when I say the intelligence of these people is astonishing. \nThat they happen to be the nicest people you could ever meet just fortifies the privilege. \nSeries producer Clare Parody frequently has to make instinctive adjudications when, as is often the case, a contestant gives an answer that seems a marginal call, but isn't. \nI don't mean by this, say, confusing a Monet with a Manet, which is clear-cut; but rather shouting \"pass it across\" to me when, with seconds to go in a tight match, a team has interrupted with the answer Atomic Emission Spectroscopy, when the answer we needed was Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. \nObviously they are left occasional notes from the question set",
    "A seriously ill two-year-old boy is to start treatment for cancer after his parents said they had just three months to save his life.\nAdamas, from Peterborough, was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a rare, aggressive and complex cancer, in 2022.\nHe has had chemotherapy and a kidney removed but his family said their final hope was a \u00a3300,000 clinical trial in Italy.\nMore than \u00a3200,000 has been raised and he will start treatment on Monday.\nHis family set up a online fundraiser to finance Adamas' treatment.\nHis mother Egle previously told the BBC: \"The only hope was to get Adamas on a clinical trial that takes place in Rome called CAR-T but it's not funded by the NHS and has to be paid by parents.\"\nShe said although they had not raised the full amount, the hospital had agreed to let them pay for treatment in phases.\n\"Adamas is full of beans. He's a very brave, happy little boy and a true inspiration for many of us,\" she said.\n\"For us as parents it helps emotionally to see him so full of life. We are feeling mixed emotions, but very thankful because our son can have this potentially life-saving treatment.\" \nShe said the family had not expected the amount of support they received. \nShe and her husband, Robertas, believe they could yet reach the full amount. \nAdamas was diagnosed at 14 months old and underwent chemotherapy.\nMonths later, he had an 11-hour operation to remove his left kidney which was wrapped by a sizeable tumour.\nScans showed another tumour was growing back from the remaining cancer cells around his main blood vessels. \nIn 2023 he started high doses of chemotherapy, steam cells transplant, and 12 cycles of radiotherapy, and immunotherapy.\nIn February 2024, a new 3cm (1in) growth, which also needed surgery to remove, was shown on a routine scan. \nAfter all the tests, his parents said they found out there was a cancer cell modification that could not be beaten by conventional treatments offered by hospitals.\nThe first phase of Adamas' treatment will start next week.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Spring is the season of new beginnings and a fresh start.\nBut while we may see daffodils and hope for sunshine, the weather has remained often wet and dreary in Wales. \nIt has been challenging for farming influencer Natalie Davies, who found her field flooded by heavy overnight rain. \nBut after finding a kayak in the shed, she decided to have some fun with her followers. \nThe 28-year-old, from Llandovery, Carmarthenshire, gained thousands of online followers by sharing her experiences of working on a farm. \nIn a video shared on TikTok and Instagram, Natalie and her husband, Dafi, 29, are seen kayaking through an overflowed bank near Rose Dew Farm in Llantwit Major in the Vale of Glamorgan.\n\"We went outside and saw the field was completely flooded, which is not ideal for a farmer any time of the year,\" she said.  \n\"We found the kayak in the shed and we came up with an idea to have a bit of fun with it. It was a joke and we decided to make light of a difficult situation farmers often face.\"  \nAfter posting the video, Natalie said she received positive reaction from her followers. \n\"I have a lot of farmers who follow my social media and they found it hilarious. They knew we were making light of the situation and they could empathise with us.\" \nBefore going into farming full time, Natalie worked in her parents' coffee shop in Cardiff. In 2020 she decided she needed a change. \n\"I looked at the job I was working in at the time and I thought, 'Am I really enjoying myself?' I think a lot people at that time did the same.\" \nWhen she was growing up, Natalie's friends were mostly from farming backgrounds and it is where she spent most of her time. \n\"I always gravitated towards the farming setting. I had an understanding and appreciation for farming before I got into it so I knew what I was getting into. \n\"My husband comes from a farming background and I was lucky enough to take the plunge full time in 2020.\" \nUsing the part of the land at Rose Dew Farm, which is owned by Dafi's family, the couple bought 140 sheep and started their dream. \nNatalie was excited to start her new adventure, and family and friends encouraged her to share her experience online. \n\"I started an Instagram initially so my family could keep up with my progress. I then started gaining followers, who were mostly farmers, which I wasn't expecting.\" \nHer following has grown to more 6,000 followers on Instagram and at the beginning she learned a lot from them.\n\"At the start I was very open and vulnerable. I would ask my followers for help on things that I wasn't sure of and they would point me in the right direction. \n\"Now, when people are asking the same questions, I'm able to help them. \n\"It's like we've created a little farming community online.\" \nAround spring is when she gains the most interaction with followers from posting pictures of new lambs. \nBut she wants to show the \"real highs and real lows to farming\".\n\"I want to show people it's not all cute and fluffy like you see on TV. We're up against the weather every day. Whether it's sunshine, rain or snow, we're out there. \n\"You see people online who are off for a few weeks or enjoying a bank holiday, and we don't get that. \n\"One morning, I woke up and found one of my lambs had been killed by a fox, and that's tough, especially first thing in the morning.\" \nAlong with the day-to-day challenges, she said she also receives negative comments online. \n\"I get some really horrible comments under my posts, and I try not to reply to them.\n\"But reading them just fuels me to keep sharing the high and lows, and educating people on the challenges that farmers face.\" \nShe said she has learnt a lot along the way and is proud of what she has achieved. \n\"My life is completely different to what it was a few years ago. \n\"I live a gorgeously beautiful life now, and that's because of the big highs but also the lows. \n\"But I wouldn't have it any other way.\" ",

It is the second of the two CalMac ferries being built at Ferguson's shipyard in Port Glasgow whose construction have been beset by problems and delays.\nWill we ever see such a large ship launched this way again on a river that once dominated world shipbuilding?\nThe ritual of a bottle being smashed into the hull before a great ship glides into the water is an iconic - but increasingly rare - scene in shipyards.\nThousands of Clydebuilt ships, among them great names like the Queen Mary, the QE2 and the battlecruiser Hood, have been launched this way.\nBut for many shipyards, the \"dynamic\" launch method, as it's known, has fallen out of favour. \nSending thousands of tonnes of steel and aluminium down a slipway under the forces of gravity always carries an element of risk. \nDoing it safely requires meticulous planning as well as skills and experience possessed by a dwindling number of experts. \nOn the day Glen Rosa enters the water, 66-year-old shipwright Andrew Cochrane will retire after a shipbuilding career spanning 51 years. \nHe's lost count of the launches he's witnessed but he reckons it's just under 100. For Andrew, nothing beats a traditional slipway launch. \n\"This is the only yard left on the Clyde that believes in the dynamic launches -  the traditional way, the best way,\" he says. \n\"I'm always proud - and I'll be proud of this one because it's my last one.\n\"It's the camaraderie amongst the boys - the pride once you see the ship leaving the slipway and going into the water.\"\nTouching his heart, he says: \"You get a wee bit in there. It's all pride.\"\nBut could this be the last dynamic launch on the Clyde?\nFerguson's currently has no new ship orders. The yard is still waiting to learn if it gets the contract for a fleet of smaller CalMac vessels, similar to ones it has built on time and on budget in the past.\n\"I'm hoping everything goes well for this yard and they get work,\" says Andrew.\n\"This yard can prove itself once again because they're a great bunch of workers in here.\"\nThe traditional method of ship launching hasn't changed since Andrew started work at the long-gone Scotts shipyard in nearby Greenock at the age of 15.\nAs the ship is assembled on the berth, long wooden tracks called launch ways are constructed on either side of the keel.\nThey are in two parts - the standing ways, which will guide the ship into the water; and the sliding ways, a long wooden cradle which is fitted directly on top and travels with the ship as it descends into the water. \nThe surfaces are all heavily greased. The shipwrights have got through 15 barrels of grease and 10 barrels of tallow in preparation for the launch of Glen Rosa.\nDuring World War Two, when grease was in short supply, a ship in Texas was once famously launched using 3.2 tonnes of bananas. \nThe vessel also rests on heavy timbers called shores, and there are wedges to keep it in place.\nAs launch day approaches, the shores and wedges are removed from the bottom and the side until the ship rests entirely on the launch ways. \nHours before the ceremony, stopper blocks and the restraining shores - angled timbers wedged between metal brackets on the hull and concrete berth - are also taken away\n\"They're the very last bits of timber holding the ship,\" explains Andrew.\n\"The only way to remove these shores is to cut them off - a metal bracket is cut off with burning gear.\" \nAll that prevents the ship moving now are a pair of daggers - strong steel levers, hinged at one end, which serve as a trigger mechanism. \nThey are held in place by vertical metal pins which are winched away by the shipwrights the moment they hear the bottle smash.\nThe winch pulls the pins away, the dagger drops and the sliding way then slides into the water.\nFor retired naval architect Craig Osborne, who has advised on Glen Rosa's launch, a lot of maths and physics is also involved, calculating forces and centres of gravity. \nThe vessel weighs just under 3,000 tonnes.\nCraig says that for a few seconds, about 30% of the weight of the ship is taken on a metal structure called the fore poppet.\n\"You have to ensure the wooden supports for the launch ways can take that weight - but it's over in the flash of an eye,\" he explains. \nOften a ship won't slide off immediately. Glen Rosa's sister ship Glen Sannox - which was much lighter - remained stubbornly static for almost 90 seconds while hydraulic jacks were used to coax it along.  \nAbout 20 seconds after the ship moves, it's all over as the vessel floats for the first time. \nThe waiting tugs quickly \"catch\" the drifting vessel, ready to shepherd it to the safety of the quayside where months of \"fitting out\" work lie ahead. \nThere's a lot that can go wrong. \n\"Stuck on ways\" is a frequent entry in the records of Clyde ship launches as a ship failed to make it all the way to the river. \nThe most disastrous launch came in 1883 when the steamer SS Daphne sank minutes after leaving the slipw",
    "A mother says a \"devastating\" tightening of visa rules will prevent her Jamaican husband joining her and their three-year-old son in the North East.\nFrom Thursday, the salary needed to bring family members to the UK will rise from \u00a318,600 to \u00a329,000.\nLindsay Thompson, of County Durham, said she had been left \"angry\".\nThe government said the move would reduce immigration and ensure families were not a burden on taxpayers.\nA further increase to \u00a334,000 is planned later this year with another rise, to \u00a338,700, due in early 2025.\nMrs Thompson, from South Hetton, met her husband Orlando while holidaying in his home country.\nNow, despite her full-time job with a travel firm, she was worried they would be permanently separated as her job paid below the incoming visa threshold of \u00a329,000.\nShe was also concerned about the potential impact on their son Arland.\n\"I haven't got him there to support us,\" she said of her husband.\n\"I feel like a single-parent but I am not a single-parent because my son has got a father. He's just not in this country.\"\nAsked how it felt for her husband, she said: \"Absolutely devastating - he's had a relationship with his son for nearly four years by FaceTime.\"\nHayley Cartagena, from South Shields, South Tyneside, said she spent years trying to qualify for a spouse visa for her husband Elvin, who is from Honduras, and they believed the system was unfair.\nMr Cartagena was finally granted a visa in 2023 but the family said the time they spent apart deeply affected their son, Benjamin.\n\"What they are telling us is that we can't fall in love with somebody who is not British because we don't earn enough and that's wrong,\" Mrs Cartagena said.\nShe pointed out her husband now has a job at the Nissan car plant, in Washington, and said she was angered by any suggestion new arrivals would be a burden.\n\"We are not coming here to sponge off the system or to be a burden to the taxpayer. We are coming here to be a family,\" she added.\nThe measures were announced by the government in December after official figures showed net migration reached a record high of 745,000 in 2022.\nThe threshold had initially been due to rise to \u00a338,700 this month but the Home Office decided to implement the increase in stages following criticism.\nMore than 70,000 people across the country have signed a petition calling for the government to scrap the moves, but a Home Office spokesperson said \"decisive action has been taken to deliver the largest cut to net migration ever\".\n\"We have a long-standing principle that anyone bringing dependants to live in the UK must be able to financially support them,\" they added.\n\"The Minimum Income Requirement ensures that families are self-sufficient.\"\nConservative MP Peter Gibson, who represents Darlington, defended the policy as he warned immigration was putting pressure on housing and public services. \n\"In order to tackle that and bring those immigration figures down, this is one of the tools in the tool kit,\" he said.\nAnalysis by the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford suggested fewer than half of north-east workers earned \u00a329,000.\nOne of the researchers from the organisation, Nuni Vieira Jorgensen, said: \"The new family income requirement doesn't take into account the fact that salaries vary a lot depending on where people live in the UK.\n\"For example, we estimate that in north-east England, where wages tend be lower, about 80% of people in full-time jobs will not earn enough to bring a foreign spouse to the country once the new policy comes into full effect in early 2025.\n\"This compares with 70% of employees living in other parts of the UK.\"\nFollow BBC North East  on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

    "Changes to income tax being introduced on Saturday mean Scotland has moved further away from the set-up in the rest of the UK.\nA new \"Advanced\" band of income tax for those earning more than \u00a375,000 has been introduced along with other changes to tax rates.\nIt means Scotland now has six tax bands, in contrast to England, Wales and Northern Ireland, where there are just three.\nAnyone on more than \u00a328,867 in Scotland will pay more income tax than someone with the same earnings elsewhere in the UK.\nHowever the Scottish government says the majority of Scottish income taxpayers pay less than they would elsewhere in the UK.\nAt the same time as Scotland changes its income tax rates, the UK government has brought in cuts to National Insurance.\nUntil January this year, it was 12p in the pound for earnings between \u00a312,571 and \u00a350,270. But a second cut in a year will see it reduced to 8p. \nSo for someone earning an average \u00a335,000, they will be paying nearly \u00a3800 less to the UK government than a year ago.\nThe Chartered Institute of Taxation said that, despite higher earners paying more tax in Scotland, the rises have been largely offset by the UK-wide National Insurance changes.\nIt said the new NI rates would mean an increase in the take-home pay for Scots earning up to \u00a3112,900 compared with the tax year about to end.\nThere has been a difference between the income tax regimes north and south of the border since 2017 but the latest changes have introduced a new Scottish tax band of 45% between \u00a375,000 and \u00a3125,140. \nThe budget also increased the top rate of tax for those earning more than \u00a3125,140, meaning that for each pound earned above that level, 48p will be deducted.\nIn addition, the higher rate threshold will be frozen for a fourth year at \u00a343,663, instead of rising with inflation.\nThis means almost 62,000 more people will be dragged into paying at least the 42% tax rate during this tax year, according to figures from the Scottish Fiscal Commission (SFC), the Scottish government's independent adviser on taxation.\nIn total 114,000 people will pay the new Advanced rate of 45%, which starts at salaries over \u00a375,000, with each pound above that level taxed at 45p, up from 42p for the band below.\nAbout 40,000 people are now expected to pay the top rate of 48% on earnings over \u00a3125,140. That's about 4,000 more than paid the top rate last year.\nThe SFC said this \"fiscal drag\" meant the number of people paying any of the higher rates of tax (currently above \u00a343,662) had risen from about 300,000 eight years ago to 650,000 in the next year.\nIn 2016 just 12% of Scottish taxpayers paid the higher rate but this has now risen to 22%.  \nSFC figures suggest about \u00a31.5bn more would be raised in Scotland next year than if it still had UK income tax rates.\nFor Scottish income taxpayers earning below \u00a328,867 there is a very small advantage to paying tax in Scotland, worth no more than \u00a323 a year.\nAbove that level Scots are paying more tax than they would in the rest of the UK - a small amount at first but it builds as income rises.\nBy the time they get to \u00a350,000 a year - the top banding for an unpromoted teacher or a police constable - they are paying \u00a31,542 more than they would on that same pay south of the border.\nFor a very high earner on \u00a3200,000, they will pay \u00a37,478 more in tax than they would elsewhere in the UK. \nThe Scottish government has previously said the decisions taken in the Scottish budget, including the new tax band, were made to protect frontline services at a time when public sector finances are under pressure.\nBut critics argue that further widening the tax gap between Scotland and the rest of the UK will hit many Scots in the pocket, harm economic growth and make the country a less attractive place to live and work.",
    "A cairn has been unveiled in Devon honouring a group of American servicemen who died in the Second World War operation, Exercise Tiger.\nThe memorial was unveiled at Dartmouth on Friday afternoon, near Slapton Sands, the location of the D-Day landing rehearsals in April 1944.\nThe 110 victims have had no specific memorial for almost 80 years. \nOrganisers said they wanted a distinct monument to the one already at Torcross.\nThat site primarily remembers a larger number killed in an incident the following day.\nThe convoy involved in the D-Day rehearsal, codenamed Exercise Tiger, suffered a loss of life greater than the actual invasion of Normandy two months later.\nHowever, the event remained a secret for decades, with US military leadership ordering a complete information blackout. \nIt was believed survivors who revealed the truth about what happened would be threatened with a court-martial.\nThe monument was researched and funded by Teddy Cranmer, however he was unable to attend the event.\nHilary Cranmer attended on his behalf and said Mr Cranmer wanted to \"put the record straight\" and clarify what happened 80 years ago.\nShe explained Mr Cranmer wanted to separate it from the other monument at Torcross and to mark it as two separate events.\nMrs Cranmer said: \"I am absolutely thrilled and delighted to see all these people here and I know Teddy would be as well.\"\nJonathan Hawkins said the cairn was important to not forget the people who \"gave their lives for us\".\nMr Hawkins added: \"Teddy has been determined to get this here and put up and at long last, we have achieved it.\" \nEarly on 28 April 1944, eight tank landing ships, full of US servicemen and military equipment, converged in Lyme Bay, off the coast of Devon, making their way towards Slapton Sands for the rehearsal.\nSo vital was the exercise that the commanders ordered the use of live naval and artillery ammunition to make the exercise as real as possible, to accustom the soldiers to what they were soon going to experience.\nBut a group of German E-Boats, alerted by heavy radio traffic in Lyme Bay, intercepted the three-mile long convoy of vessels.\nFollow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Stoke-on-Trent City Council has sold its shares in a development company it jointly founded in 1993 for \u00a35m.\nThe authority established Stoke-on-Trent Regeneration Limited with St Modwen, and the firm has been involved in a number of major developments across the city.\nBut it said now was a \"sensible time\" to sell its 19% stake due to the current economic conditions, and that the decision was taken following independent advice.\nHowever, the Conservative opposition group said the council should have asked for the land owned by the company instead and now feared hundreds of homes could be built with the authority potentially unable to prevent that.\nThe firm's property portfolio includes much of the land at Berryhill Fields which was previously earmarked for up to 1,300 homes, although deemed as not \"currently viable\" for development in 2020.\nBut Conservative group leader Dan Jellyman said that could change due to a new housing land assessment being carried out by the council.\nHe said the value of the site and others owned by the company would increase if earmarked for housing in Stoke-on-Trent\u2019s forthcoming local plan.\n\u201cOur view is that \u00a35m is going to look like peanuts,\" he said.\n\"The land is going to be worth a lot more than that, now that it\u2019s under the full control of a property developer. \n\"The council should have walked away with control of these sites.

    "A hedgehog rescue centre is looking for more volunteers to help look after the influx of animals in their care.\nDespite a decline in the hedgehog population nationally, the Brockworth Hedgehog Rescue Centre in Cheltenham says it is rescuing more and more.\nVicki Oliver, manager of the rescue centre, blames the heightened intake on predators and a loss of hedgerows.\n\"We just want somebody that's got a passion really, not just for hedgehogs, but for wildlife,\" she said.\nThe State of Britain's Hedgehogs report found numbers are down in rural areas by between 30% and 75% since 2000.\nMs Oliver, who founded the centre, says it took in 152 hedgehogs in 2014 when it was founded. By 2023, the number had risen drastically to 716. \n\"We are certainly having more hedgehogs coming in year-on-year,\" she said.\n\"Our hedgerows aren't always there like they used to be, but also things like predations. \n\"Obviously badgers are their main predator, but they can also be affected by things like otters, minks, stoats, and weasels,\" she added.\nMs Oliver said members of the public could help to slow the decline in wild hedgehogs by calling the centre for help, and provided her top tips on assessing when the animal needs their care.\n\"One of the main signs is them being out during the day, however that can be affected by pregnant and feeding females,\" she said.\n\"If they're slow, they're not moving, they're wobbling, or if they've got flies around them and generally look skinny and unwell, then they need to come into the rescue.\n\"If it's showing signs of illness then pop it into a tall-sided box, because they are really good climbers, with a warm hot water bottle and some newspaper, maybe a towel it can hide in.\" she added.\nSarah, who has volunteered for the centre for the past 18 months, said she finds the work \"therapeutic\". \nShe said volunteer responsibilities include collecting sick or injured hedgehogs, daily health checks and weighing, cleaning out cages, and giving them fresh food and water.\n\"It is very fulfilling and will certainly add something very good to your life,\" said Sarah. \n\"It just makes you more aware of wildlife all around you, so do it.

    "Realistic 3D models of human organs made at a Nottingham university are being used to help train surgeons.\nRichard Arm, a senior researcher at Nottingham Trent University's fashion department, uses data from real CT scans to create the models.\nThe military use them to train first responders to treat IED victims and gunshot wounds, he said.\nMr Arm's work has also been used as props by the independent horror film industry.\nExplaining the process of creating the models, Mr Arm said: \"We take that image [from the CT scan], then we 3D print those using different materials. \n\"We look at what the type of surgery and what the surgeon requires, then we'll look specifically at that area.\n\"We could do every blood vessel, organ, piece of anatomy in the body, but that would be expensive, so it's about making it cost effective.\"\nMr Arm said the Queen's Medical Centre, in Nottingham, requested a model to teach a patient-specific removal of a tumour in a child's liver in 2021.\n\"It was pretty difficult to get to, so they wanted a model they could teach and practice on before going into surgery,\" he said.\n\"Not only does it help the surgeon prepare for that particular case, but that model can then be used as a real case scenario to teach medical students about how to resect tumours.\"\nProfessor Peter Mahoney, a consultant anaesthetist, said what distinguishes Mr Arm's work is his understanding of anatomy.\nHe said there are many training scenarios where real human organs cannot and should not be used.\n\"So having a good, realistic simulated organ means you can have a much broader range of individuals who can train, but you can also train on a much broader range of scenarios,\" he added.\nWhen serving in the military, Prof Mahoney said the project allowed his team to train surgeons in realistic field conditions.\nMr Arm has also helped the independent film industry by creating organ props for mainly horror films.\nProf Mahoney added: \"The items he has produced have been extremely realistic and actually caused some consternation on film sets.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "When the NHS said there was \"no reasonable prospect\" of reopening a town's inpatient hospital beds, residents thought they had a fight on their hands.\nBosses said they could not recruit enough staff for 24/7 operations at Bishop's Castle Community Hospital in rural Shropshire, and a temporary suspension announced in 2021 was set to be made permanent.\nBut on Thursday, they changed their mind and announced the beds would reopen, after campaigners and the health trust running the site worked together to bring more nurses to the town.\nSo how did protests, public meetings and even threats of legal action turn into a victory for co-operation? \nThe tone of the dispute changed last autumn when Shropshire Community Health Trust (ShropCom) agreed to try a fresh recruitment drive, and those who had been chanting and planning to go to court over the beds were part of a sales pitch for the town.\nIn campaigner Christine Williams' case, her initial role was \"going to meetings and shouting loudly\", but she ended up supporting candidates at interviews for nursing roles.\n\"I've been in the back room, chatting to them while they've been nervous... really letting them know about the local area,\" she explained.\nThe chair of campaign group Save Our Beds, Jenny Sargeant, said: \"To be fair to the trust, they've worked with us, they've let us into all the recruitment days, and they have acknowledged that we've made a big difference.\"\n\"It's a great thing for the community, and for other communities, to know that this can be done.\"\nEarly in 2023, ShropCom was pessimistic about the chances for reviving the inpatient service, and demoralised staff complained they had been kept in the dark.\nEven when a consultation on the unit's future was launched in the summer that year, the trust was warning of a 60% vacancy rate for registered nurses, and problems with recruitment and retention.\nChief executive Patricia Davies said bringing the community on side was key to reversing the problem.\n\"Talking to some of the people who've been recruited... if you don't know that community, it's not just about the job. \n\"It's about relocating your family, it's the services on offer, whether you need to get to schools, to think about those wider facilities,\" she said.\n\"Engaging with the community allowed prospective candidates to have that conversation.\"\nShe said she would work the same way in the future.\nBishop's Castle mayor Josh Dickin made an eye-catching contribution to the campaign, being pushed 18 miles in a bed last August, wearing pyjamas and a long blonde wig.\nHe said the determination of the area's people should never be underestimated.\n\"Bishop's Castle stands up for what it wants,\" he said.\n\"It gets what it wants in the end, and there's a lot of people who are really motivated... just passionate about services in our town.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Israel's military said on Sunday that it was reducing its numbers of soldiers from southern Gaza, leaving just one brigade in the area.\nThe military stressed a \"significant force\" would remain in Gaza.\n\"This is another stage in the war effort\", Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Lt Col Peter Lerner told the BBC.\nThe pull-out is being interpreted as tactical, rather than a sign the war may be moving closer to its end. \nAlso on Sunday, Israel and Hamas said they had both sent delegations to Cairo to join fresh ceasefire negotiations.\nIt is six months to the day since Hamas attacked southern Israeli border communities on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostage. \nIsrael says that of 130 hostages still in Gaza, at least 34 are dead. \nMore than 33,000 Gazans have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza since then, the Hamas-run health ministry says, the majority of them civilians. Gaza is on the brink of famine, with Oxfam reporting that 300,000 people trapped in the north have lived since January on an average of 245 calories a day.\nLt Col Lerner said troops would rotate out because the military had completed its mission in Khan Younis.\nKhan Younis has been under Israeli bombardment for months, and the city and surrounding area are largely destroyed.\nLt Col Lerner said: \"The war is not over. War can only be over when they [hostages] come home and when Hamas is gone.\"\n\"It is a decline in the forces but there are more operations that need to be conducted. Rafah is clearly a stronghold. We need to dismantle Hamas' capabilities wherever they are.\"\nUS National Security spokesman John Kirby said it appeared to be a \"rest and refit\" and \"not necessarily... indicative of some coming new operation for these troops\".\nBut later Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the troops were leaving to \"prepare for their follow-up missions\".\nHe said their achievements in Khan Younis were \"extremely impressive\", adding that Hamas had ceased to function as a military organisation throughout Gaza.\nIsrael has long warned of a planned ground offensive in the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million displaced Palestinians are sheltering. \nSome of the displaced expressed hope that they would soon be able to return to what remains of their homes. \nMuhammad al-Mughrabi, 32, from Gaza City, currently living with his family in Rafah, told BBC News he was \"filled with hope as my neighbour in a tent from Khan Younis was able to return home\". \n\"Despite knowing that my house was completely destroyed, I dream daily of returning to my hometown. I will set up a tent over the rubble of my house and live there with dignity, rather than being compelled to reside in the courtyard of a hospital,\" he said.\nInternational pressure for a ceasefire is mounting, and the US - Israel's closest and most powerful ally - warned earlier this week that its ongoing support for the Gaza war is dependent on \"specific, concrete steps\" to boost aid and prevent civilian deaths.\nMarking six months of the war, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was \"one step away from victory\" but insisted there would be no ceasefire without the release of Israeli hostages.\n\"The achievements of the war are considerable: we have eliminated 19 of Hamas's 24 battalions, including senior commanders,\" he said.  \nTens of thousands of Israelis rallied against Mr Netanyahu on Saturday, demanding a deal to free the hostages held in Gaza.\nAnti-government protesters were joined by hostages' families.\nThe rallies in Tel Aviv and other cities came hours after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) recovered the body of hostage Elad Katzir.\nOrganisers said the protest in Tel Aviv had drawn 100,000 people, while other counts put attendance at around 45,000. \nMore demonstrations took place on Sunday evening, with thousands protesting in Jerusalem.",

    "The Crystal Palace transmitting station is one of the tallest structures in London.\nIt has a unique job to beam terrestrial television into millions of homes in the capital and the Home Counties.\nIts range extends as far north as Stevenage in Hertfordshire and as far south as Sussex.\nPaul Mellers, who has been responsible for its maintenance for the past two years, describes himself as a \"self-confessed transmitter geek\".\nHe says he feels \"privileged to work at the site because of its beauty and uniqueness as a structure, but also because of its history and importance to London\".\nBuilt in 1956, it replaced the transmitter at Alexandra Palace in north London. Its location was chosen because of its height above sea level.\nHowever, moving to south London did not come without its problems.\nThe footprint of the site meant designers had to build a lattice-style tower which was tall and thin. Some people compare it to the Eiffel Tower in Paris because it has a similar design.\nMr Mellers says a lot of people locally consider it to be a \"homing beacon\" rather than an eyesore.   \nThe tower itself has remained unchanged for almost 70 years, despite advances in technology.\nWhen it first started transmitting, it was responsible for the output of the BBC only.  \nTwo miles away, a rival transmitter was built two years before the one at Crystal Palace to broadcast ITV programmes.  \nBut over the years, more and more channels started to use the Crystal Palace transmitter and in 1985 its neighbour stopped transmitting, meaning all television broadcasts came from Crystal Palace for the first time.  \nToday, rows and rows of hi-tech computers do much of the work underneath the tower in order to get the signal ready for transmission.\nThis was originally the role of an army of engineers who worked at the site around the clock. \nFrom the introduction of colour TV to high definition and the digital switchover in the 2000s, the role of the transmitter has changed with the times, developing, adapting and modernising what it does.\nIn 2024, mobile phone masts also occupy the tower, which also broadcasts FM radio.\nChanges to technology means fewer staff are needed, but for those who do work there - like Mr Mellers - there is nowhere else quite like it.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The Sopranos is the gripping tale of a New Jersey mafia family which went on to become one of the most watched TV series of all time.\nBut how many of its viewers know that the show's instantly recognisable theme tune was actually penned by a man from the south Wales valleys?\nAnd as the US hit celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, he has a startling confession to make.\nLarry Love says he has never seen one of its 86 episodes.\n\"No, I've been too scared to watch it to be honest,\" said Love, frontman with Alabama 3, whose 1997 track Woke Up This Morning became the instantly recognisable song which cued up the everyday story of New Jersey gangsterism.       \n\"Not because of anything in the show itself, more due to the fact I hate listening to my own records.\n\"I'm too much of a perfectionist and always end up thinking, 'Oh, I should have done that part differently'.\"\nBut how did a musician from Merthyr Tydfil end up involved with Tony Soprano and his heat-packing cohorts?\n\"We'd originally done Woke Up as a 10-minute acid house track with all these blues samples on it,\" said Love, whose real name is Rob Spragg.\n\"Then I just started singing over the top and it sort of coalesced into a song from there. \n\"Our record company decided to release it as a single but it didn't really do much - I think it only got to number 60 in the charts or something.\"           \nHowever, the tune, which was inspired by a true-life case of a domestic abuse victim who killed her husband, somehow made it to the ears of Sopranos writer David Chase.\n\"He was driving along the New Jersey turnpike when it came on his car radio,\" said Love.\n\"He thought the lyrics - \"Woke up this morning, got yourself a gun / Mamma always said you'd be the chosen one\" - were perfect for the dynamic between Tony Soprano and his mother.\n\"Funny thing is David originally thought we were a bunch of black kids from the Bronx, as opposed to some Welsh fella pretending to be American. \n\"And when he found out the truth he loved it, saying that it was so daft it somehow made perfect sense,\" laughed Love.   \nInitially offered $500 for the track, subsequent royalties from its use have allowed the Brixton-based singer and his bandmates to keep going.     \n\"I'll admit that we took a bit of a gamble going up with the whole 'Country and Western-meets-techno' vibe, especially during the age of Britpop,\" he said.\n\"But it worked and we're still here and of that I'm very proud.\"\nNow 59, Love is looking forward to performing live around the UK later this year and will be releasing a \"twisted, moody remix\" of Woke Up This Morning to coincide with the dates. \n\"A lot of the old American bluesmen I grew up listening to didn't start their careers until they were already a ripe old age, so I'm not going to let nearly turning 60 bother me,\" he added.\n\"I'm a rock and roller at the end of the day, not playing prop forward for Wales.\"           ",

    "Sir Lindsay Hoyle has led tributes to his father, the former Labour MP and \"truly dedicated parliamentarian\" Lord Doug Hoyle, who has died aged 98.\nThe veteran politician was MP for Nelson and Colne from 1974 to 1979 and for Warrington from 1981 to 1997 before being ennobled as Lord Hoyle.\nAnnouncing his father's death, the Commons Speaker said he had been \"a force to be reckoned with\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he had been \"a tenacious campaigner\".\nLord Hoyle first ran for office in the Lancashire constituency of Clitheroe in 1964, coming second to Conservative Sir Francis Pearson, before he was narrowly defeated by Tory rival Lord David Waddington in Nelson and Colne in 1970.\nHe lost for a second time to Lord Waddington in the general election of February 1974, but when a second general election was called eight months later, he clinched the seat.\nHe was unseated in the 1979 election, but returned to Parliament as Warrington's MP two years later.\nHe went on to represent the Cheshire town for 16 years and, after being made a life peer in 1997, he served as chairman of its rugby league side Warrington Wolves from 1999 to 2009.\nHe retired from the House of Lords in 2023.\nIn his statement, Sir Lindsay said there were \"few people who get to my age with their father still around, but I have been one of the lucky ones\".\n\"His death last night has left me bereft; I have lost my dad, my inspiration and the country has lost a truly dedicated parliamentarian,\" he said.\nHe said his father had \"loved his sport\" and as \"a massive rugby league fan\", he had held his position as Wolves chairman \"with great passion and honour\".\nHe added that he had inherited his love of animals from his father.\n\"Today, there is an empty armchair, an absence of ready wit, and one less animal lover in the world,\" he said.\nAlongside his service as an MP, Lord Hoyle also chaired the Parliamentary Labour Party and two trade unions.\nIn a tribute, Sir Keir said he had been \"a distinguished parliamentarian and a tenacious campaigner\".\n\"A trade unionist, co-founder of LFI [Labour Friends of Israel] and Warrington Wolves fanatic, he had a longstanding commitment to the town, but above everything, he was a family man,\" he said.\n\"We will truly miss him.

    "The Crystal Palace transmitting station is one of the tallest structures in London.\nIt has a unique job to beam terrestrial television into millions of homes in the capital and the Home Counties.\nIts range extends as far north as Stevenage in Hertfordshire and as far south as Sussex.\nPaul Mellers, who has been responsible for its maintenance for the past two years, describes himself as a \"self-confessed transmitter geek\".\nHe says he feels \"privileged to work at the site because of its beauty and uniqueness as a structure, but also because of its history and importance to London\".\nBuilt in 1956, it replaced the transmitter at Alexandra Palace in north London. Its location was chosen because of its height above sea level.\nHowever, moving to south London did not come without its problems.\nThe footprint of the site meant designers had to build a lattice-style tower which was tall and thin. Some people compare it to the Eiffel Tower in Paris because it has a similar design.\nMr Mellers says a lot of people locally consider it to be a \"homing beacon\" rather than an eyesore.   \nThe tower itself has remained unchanged for almost 70 years, despite advances in technology.\nWhen it first started transmitting, it was responsible for the output of the BBC only.  \nTwo miles away, a rival transmitter was built two years before the one at Crystal Palace to broadcast ITV programmes.  \nBut over the years, more and more channels started to use the Crystal Palace transmitter and in 1985 its neighbour stopped transmitting, meaning all television broadcasts came from Crystal Palace for the first time.  \nToday, rows and rows of hi-tech computers do much of the work underneath the tower in order to get the signal ready for transmission.\nThis was originally the role of an army of engineers who worked at the site around the clock. \nFrom the introduction of colour TV to high definition and the digital switchover in the 2000s, the role of the transmitter has changed with the times, developing, adapting and modernising what it does.\nIn 2024, mobile phone masts also occupy the tower, which also broadcasts FM radio.\nChanges to technology means fewer staff are needed, but for those who do work there - like Mr Mellers - there is nowhere else quite like it.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Households in Barnsley, Rotherham and Doncaster will not have to recycle food waste separately when the law changes.\nCouncil in England will be required to provide a weekly kerbside food waste collection from March 2026.\nThe law aims to cut the amount going to landfill and to ensure food waste does not sit in bins for weeks.\nThe three councils are exempt as a waste treatment facility at Manvers already separates food waste without the need for another bin.\nThe BDR waste treatment facility takes up to 250,000 tonnes of residual waste produced across Barnsley, Doncaster and Rotherham each year, and recycles food waste into \"compost-like output\".\nAccording to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, the facility is unique in the UK and combines a mechanical biological treatment facility and an anaerobic digestion plant to extract recycling.\nMatt O'Neill, executive director of growth and sustainability at Barnsley Council, said that when the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) consulted on recycling, the BDR Partnership looked at the carbon and financial benefits of separately collecting food waste. \n\"Since 2015, we've been processing food waste through anaerobic digestion at the facility, producing a compost-like output,\" he said.\n\"Our appraisal found that carbon gains would be relatively small, while costs would be high due to both impacts on our long-term contract and the need to procure a separate food waste processing contract.\"\nMr O'Neill said that after consideration, Defra granted the three councils transitional arrangements, which meant there was no requirement for food waste to be separately collected from households in the region at this time.\nHe added that the BDR Partnership would continue to review their services \"to ensure the best environmental option not involving excessive costs are employed\".\nFor the whole of 2023/24, only 0.5% of waste processed through the PFI contract went to landfill.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "Comedian Ashley Storrie has revealed playing an autistic character in her first lead acting role helped her to become more open about her own challenges.\nAshley plays Nina a neurodiverse palaeontologist in Dinosaur, a comedy drama set to air on BBC Scotland on 14 April.\nThe six-part series follows Nina and her family in the lead up to her sister Evie\u2019s impromptu wedding.\nAshley, who has autism, said the role enabled her to \u201cunmask\u201d in real life.\nShe told BBC Scotland News: \"I don\u2019t know if you go 'oh I\u2019d love to play a woman who is autistic like me' but it turned into a dream for the fact it's given me the opportunity to do acting.\"\nThe BBC Radio Scotland host said while there were some crossovers between her and her character, there were lots of differences.\n\u201cShe lives her whole life very unmasked and very open about her autism but that\u2019s only something I\u2019ve kind of felt able to do since playing Nina,\u201d Ashley added.\n\u201cBefore this I tried a lot more to be normal, to make other people feel comfortable but Nina didn\u2019t do that so that became something we had in common.\n\u201cI now feel more at liberty to just be myself and say 'I\u2019m autistic so I\u2019m not being rude'.\"\nAshley said the programme differed from other shows featuring an autistic lead character because \"it's not all doom and gloom\".\n\"Sometimes that can be a bit unhelpful. It\u2019s always good to have the voices of people who have lived those things,\" she said.\nAshley is also listed as the show's co-creator, alongside Matilda Curtis, as she helped convey her own \"lived experiences\".\nThe comedian said: \"I think it\u2019s important that we keep seeing all different types of characters on our screen because, unfortunately or fortunately, I think we live in a world where people's opinions are formed from the media they consume.\n\"So when you say to somebody 'I\u2019m autistic', they\u2019ll say 'but you\u2019re not rocking back and forth or counting toothpicks' because their only point of reference is Rain Man. That is a problem.\"\nThe series is set in Glasgow and the west coast of Scotland, and features locations that will be familiar Scottish audiences, including Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum.\nThe decision was only taken to set the drama in Scotland after Ashley successfully auditioned.\nThe comedian said she was happy to be able to film in her home city, as it is \"one of the most beautiful in the world\".\nAshley said: \"It was very comforting filming in places that I knew but also just getting to put down on paper, and show growing up Scottish, in a way that hasn\u2019t necessarily been done before.\n\u201cI think outside of Scotland there is this image of Scotland, that is somewhere between Trainspotting and Outlander and there\u2019s not a lot in the middle.\u201d\nOne episode also features Rothesay on the Isle of Bute, a place Ashley used to visit with her grandmother as a child.\nAs well as showing off the sites of Scotland it also features a host of stars including Still Game\u2019s Greg Hemphill, who plays Nina\u2019s father Ade, and River City\u2019s Sally Howitt.\nThe cast also includes Sanjeev Kohli, David Carlyle and Katie Dickie.\nYou can watch Dinosaur on the BBC Scotland Channel on 14 April at 22:30 or on BBC Three on 16 April at 22:30.",
    "An asylum seeker wants to know why he has to wear an ankle tag, given the practice has been deemed unlawful.\nThe 38-year-old is in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, after arriving in the UK from Trinidad in May.\nA government pilot which monitored migrants using electronic tags ended in December and the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said the scheme \"failed to assess privacy intrusions\".\nThe Home Office said that \"outside of the pilot\" electronic monitoring was still used.\nThe Dunstable asylum seeker, who the BBC is not identifying, said he was originally deported to Trinidad in 2014 having been jailed in the USA for being in receipt of stolen money.\nHe said he was detained for his first 73 days in the UK and has been wearing the tag for the last nine months.\nWearing the tag made him feel \"like a criminal\", he explained, and added: \u201cThere is no-one else in the two accommodations I have been to that has an ankle monitor... I just feel like I am still being penalised even halfway across the world.\"\nThe man said he had tried calling and emailing the Home Office to ask why he was still tagged and added: \"People look at you strangely; they want to know what have you done?\u201d\nThe ICO said that since August 2022, it had been in discussion with the Home Office about its pilot scheme tracking the GPS location of up to 600 migrants.\nIts report concluded that the government failed to sufficiently \"assess the privacy intrusion of the continuous collection of people\u2019s location information\".\nThe ICO issued an enforcement notice ordering the Home Office to update its policies and said \"future processing\" on \"the same basis\" would be breach data protection law.\nThe pilot was intended to test whether this monitoring was an effective way of maintaining contact with asylum claimants and an alternative to detention.\nUK information commissioner John Edwards said: \"We recognise the Home Office\u2019s work to keep the UK safe... but they cannot take the same approach in the future.\u201d\nThe Home Office said in a statement: \u201cOutside of the pilot, electronic monitoring is a long-established practice and immigration judges in the First-tier Tribunal are allowed to grant bail with such conditions.\u201d\nIt said all individuals \"who were subject to electronic monitoring as part of the pilot have now been taken off\".\nA spokesperson said it would not comment on individual cases.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The population of one of Northern Ireland's rarest birds of prey, the hen harrier, dropped by more than a quarter in seven years, a study suggests.\nOnly 34 territorial pairs were recorded in Northern Ireland in 2023 - a drop of more than 26% since 2016.\nA 2011 independent government report estimated there should be about 150 pairs of hen harriers breeding in Northern Ireland.\nThose behind the new survey said \"things need to change\".\nThe 2023 hen harrier survey was conducted in partnership with RSPB NI, Northern Ireland Raptor Study Group (NIRSG) and the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera). \nDoctors Eimear Rooney and Marc Ruddock, survey co-ordinators from the NIRSG, said volunteers often found no birds in areas that once held the species.\n\"The hen harrier population in Northern Ireland is under immense pressure from a range of land management activities and human-mediated threats, leading to extensive and ongoing losses of suitable habitats and widespread disturbances at nesting and foraging habitats,\" the NIRSG said. \n\"The population has been displaced and disturbed for too many decades - things need to change.\"\nGregory Woulahan of RSPB NI said: \"This is a drastic decline in numbers of hen harriers in Northern Ireland. \n\"One of the main reasons for this decline was loss of habitat. \n\"This, coupled with the landscape scale threats and pressures to the species, means we need a coherent, practical and policy-based restoration strategy for the needs of the hen harrier and its habitat. \n\"Unfortunately, this recent decline mirrors a similar population decrease within the Republic of Ireland in 2022.\"\nAgriculture Minister Andrew Muir said he was concerned to learn of the declining population of the raptor. \nHe said action needed to be taken \"to stop the decline of this iconic bird\". \n\"But it can only be achieved through working in partnership with landowners, farmers, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and all other stakeholders, to restore and enhance breeding habitats and appropriately manage activities which have the potential to cause disturbance and displacement,\" he added.",
    "The public inquiry into the Horizon scandal will resume this week, with senior Post Office bosses among those called to give evidence. Away from the formal hearings, many of the victims of the scandal are still finding the courage to confront the traumas of the past.\n\"I'm fine,\" says Sharon Brown, as she gets closer to her old post office, \"I just feel a bit sick.\" She says her heart is racing.\nAs the car pulls up, Sharon's old post office comes into view. It is the first time she's been back since she was accused of being a thief, turning her life upside down. The post office is now gone, replaced by a shop selling vapes, cakes and shakes. It is adorned with a rainbow LED facade. \nMore than a decade ago, Sharon was accused of false accounting by the Post Office and of taking \u00a336,000. Like many others, she has only recently felt able to tell her story.\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast, Sharon says she and her husband, Kevin, are still in debt because of it. She says she no longer speaks to members of her family who doubted her innocence, and that she is still nervous of walking around the area where her post office used to be. \nWhen asked what it feels like to see her former shop again, after a moment of silence, she replies: \"Awful isn't it? It's awful. They just don't know what they've done to people, to their post office.\"\nSharon and Kevin first bought the post office in Pennywell, Sunderland, in 2006. When money mysteriously started disappearing from the business, the couple used their life savings to cover the shortfall.\nKevin says there was \"a massive black hole\". The couple still have two charging orders on their home, he adds. \"We still owe debt, we've still got debt.\"\nLike many sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses who were caught up in the Horizon scandal, Sharon mistakenly assumed she had done something wrong. \"I just couldn't figure it out. I didn't even consider that it was the computer. It didn't even enter my head.\"\nSharon was suspended by the Post Office in 2012, she resigned in 2013. The Post Office sent investigators to their home to search for the missing money. \nThe investigators went through their kitchen cupboards and drawers and even searched the fridge. \"I said what are you looking for in there? He said: 'People hide money in different places all the time'.\"\n\"In yourself you knew you hadn't took a penny, but nobody else believed you, because the Post Office was telling everybody you did,\" she adds. \"For all you want to fight and shout and scream that you're innocent, they're still going to take [the Post Office's] side.\"\nSharon fell out with members of her own family. She says she's still not been in touch with them. \"I don't see any of my family, none of them. I haven't for years.\"\nAnd she says the emotional stress became unbearable. \"I just locked myself in the house, didn't go out shopping, didn't go out, didn't see my friends, didn't do anything,\" says Sharon. \"I just didn't want to be here - just didn't want to be here at all.\"\nAs her business and life unravelled, Sharon says she \"nearly did something stupid\" in the early hours of one morning. She says she stopped herself after she saw photographs of her two children.\n\"If I hadn't seen the pictures of the bairns, I wouldn't be sitting with you now, and I just looked at them and thought, 'God, I can't leave them bairns',\" she says.\nMore than 900 sub-postmasters and postmistresses were wrongly prosecuted for stealing money after faulty computer software - called Horizon - said money was missing from post office branch accounts.\nThe public inquiry into the scandal will resume on Tuesday. The latest hearings will last 15 weeks, and witnesses will include key figures at the heart of the scandal - including the sub-postmaster and campaigner Alan Bates and former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells.\nIn 2017, a group of 555 sub-postmasters - which included Sharon - took legal action against the Post Office. In 2019, it agreed to pay them \u00a358m in compensation, but much of the money they received was swallowed up by legal fees.\nAs of 15 January 2024, only 95 convictions had been overturned.\nEarlier this year, the government introduced new legislation to overturn the convictions of sub-postmasters who were the victims of what has been called the biggest miscarriage of justice in UK history.\nThe new law is designed to speed up the process of both clearing their names and paying out compensation.\nSharon wasn't eventually prosecuted by the Post Office. She says she enjoyed being a sub-postmistress. \"I just loved going to work, loved the customers. There was never any getting up and going, 'oh God, work again today'. It was a pleasure to go to work.\"\nSitting in a car outside her old post office, she says: \"I could have been still there now, still working, instead of being in this state all the time, and I just feel sick as a dog, stomach's going, and terrified because I see many of my own customers, you know.\"\n\"I know I haven't done nothing w",

The airline confirmed it was responsible for maintenance of such parts.\n\"We apologise for the inconvenience of their delay, but place our highest priority on ultimate safety for our customers and employees,\" a statement said.\nThe plane was manufactured in 2015 according to regulator Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, and the 737-800 is an earlier generation of the 737 from the latest Max model. \nThe aircraft in the latest incident was powered by CFM56 engines while the 737 Max models use the CFM-Leap engine. Both are made by a joint venture between General Electric Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines\nThe FAA said the Boeing aircraft was towed to the gate after landing.\nBoeing declined to comment when approached by BBC News, referring questions to Southwest for information about the airline's plane and fleet operations.\nSouthwest said it would fly passengers on another plane to Houston about three hours behind schedule.\nBoeing has been under scrutiny following a dramatic mid-air blowout in January, in which passengers on the flight from Portland, Oregon, to California narrowly escaped serious injury.\nOn Friday, it was announced Boeing paid $160m (\u00a3126m) to Alaska Air to make up for losses the airline suffered following the emergency.\nRegulators temporarily grounded nearly 200 Boeing 737 Max 9 jets after a door plug fell from the Alaska aircraft shortly after take-off.\nBoeing has been trying to repair its reputation for years after crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving a different version of the 737 Max plane killed 346 people.\nIts popular 737 Max planes were subsequently grounded globally for more than 18 months.",

Or will they prefer to pick up the Scotch?\n\"So there is concern there just from a pure reputation point of view as well.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Northern Ireland's Department of Health said there were no current plans to introduce such requirements on alcohol labelling.\n\"Given the nature of the market, it is likely that any such changes across the UK administrations would need to be discussed on a four nations basis,\" they added.\n\nTwenty years ago, Ireland was the first country to ban smoking in the workplace, including bars and restaurants.\nHealth campaigners hope more countries will follow the Republic's lead on alcohol health warnings too.\nDoreen Regan from Cancer Focus NI would like to see a similarly \"bold\" step being taken in Northern Ireland.\n\u201cWe know there\u2019s a clear link between drinking alcohol and cancer,\" she said. \n\"It causes seven different types of cancer and the Northern Ireland cancer strategy states that it\u2019s linked to at least 300 cases per year in Northern Ireland.\n\"So anything that\u2019s going to help prevent that, or help empower people to make more informed choices, we would definitely be in support of.\"\nHinch Distillery in County Down has only been in operation for four years.  \nIt exports to about 30 countries worldwide.\nThe firm's international sales director Michael Morris has concerns that producing the new labels could add extra work.\n\"We will have to see exactly what the strict standards are going to be,\" he explained. \n\"We'll run dummy labels and we\u2019ll get them approved in the south. \n\"That will be the normal process and then once we've got those labels approved, we would do a run of the labels based on projections of volume. \n\"We need to make sure we have enough stock with the correct labels.\"\nMr Morris also said he did not think warning labels were needed on alcohol bottles sold in Northern Ireland or other parts of the UK.\n\"Our view is that the sensible approach is to go with the government health warning -  drink within the units and avoid session drinking.\"",
    "A Finaghy man has said he will not be deterred from speaking out after his home was sprayed with 'hate-motivated' graffiti. \nTakura Makoni's house was targeted during the early hours of Sunday.\nIn March, Mr Makoni spoke out against anti-immigration signs which were put up in and around the Finaghy area of south Belfast.\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) have confirmed they are treating the latest incident as a hate crime.\nMr Makoni told BBC News NI he believes his home has been targeted for speaking out.\n\"This is the action of one person who can identify me. When you speak out, people target you,\" he said. \nMr Makoni, who is a community worker with the African and Caribbean Support Organisation in Northern Ireland, said he hopes to use what has happened to \"create a dialogue to move towards a more cohesive society\".\nHe said he has \"always felt welcome\" in Northern Ireland and \"this does not change that\".\n\"I have lived in Northern Ireland for over 20 years. I am at a place now where I am confident that Northern Ireland is a place that does not want to go in this direction, into a hateful place.\" \nMr Makoni said his 15-year-old son, who was first to see the spray-painted graffiti on the front of their home, had pleaded for him to stop his community work.\nHowever he added: \"This does not make me feel unwelcome, clearly this is just rogue elements within our community. \n\"I believe that if there is a dialogue with them a resolution can be had.\n\"Instead of wasting paint, they should have just knocked on my door. I would have offered them a cup of tea , sat down and talked with them.\"\nSouth Belfast Alliance MLA Kate Nicholl has condemned the attack.\n\"This is an appalling and sinister attack which was designed to threaten Takura for speaking out,\" she said. \"Those behind it do not represent south Belfast which is a community of compassionate, kind and welcoming people.\"However, that does not diminish its impact on those people who are being targeted. It creates fear and it is completely unacceptable.\"\nMs Nicholl also appealed for all political parties \"to come together and condemn racism\".\nPSNI Chief Inspector Mark Conway said: \"We are treating this as a hate-motivated crime and our enquiries are ongoing.\n\"The sentiment expressed is unacceptable and I am appealing to anyone with information that could assist enquiries to get on touch.\"",
    "Russell Cook, the man nicknamed \"Hardest Geezer\", has successfully run the full length of Africa, crossing the finish line in Tunisia after 352 days.\nBefore he set off on the mammoth challenge to run the entire length of Africa, he said he hoped to look back at his life and have no regrets. \nThe 27-year-old from Worthing, West Sussex, said he had struggled with his mental health, gambling and drinking, and wanted to \"make a difference\". \nAfter running through 16 countries, he has raised in excess of \u00a3700,000 for charity and has completed his final run.\nAs he crossed the finish line at about 16:40 BST in Ras Angela, Tunisia, Mr Cook was greeted by a shouting crowd, with many chanting \"geezer\".\n\"I'm pretty tired,\" he told reporters and in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\nMr Cook told those who had been following his journey to the finish line: \"Mission completed.\"\nA lot has changed since Mr Cook set off from home in February 2023.  \nHis initial plan to run from Tunisia to South Africa, completing 360 marathons in 240 days with no rest days, was soon halted by a lack of an Algerian visa - a hindrance that would later resurface. \nBut after a last-minute switch, he set off on foot from South Africa's most southerly point on 22 April - a journey that would take him through cities, rainforests, mountains and the Sahara Desert.\nAfter ticking off South Africa and Namibia in 50 days, Mr Cook encountered his first major setback - an armed robbery. \nHe and his support team had cameras, phones, cash, passports and visas stolen in Angola on 24 June. \nHowever, as with many stumbling blocks he would face throughout the challenge, the ultrarunner vowed to soldier on.  \nConsistently running more than a marathon a day began to take its toll. \nAfter some minor tummy troubles in the early weeks, he was forced to take his first rest day after doctors found blood and protein in his urine on day 45. \nBut it was recurring back pain that caused the most concern. \nOn day 200, Mr Cook was forced to reduce his mileage and intensity at the request of a doctor in Nigeria - even missing consecutive days on day 205 and 206. \nBut in true Hardest Geezer style, he was not to be stopped. \nHe said: \"I took a couple of days to get some scans. No bone damage so figured the only option left was to stop mincing about like a little weasel, get the strongest painkillers available and zombie stomp road again.\" \nAfter overcoming everything in his path, it was a single piece of paper - an Algerian visa - that cast doubt over the entire challenge on day 278. \nMr Cook was forced to halt while he waited to find out his fate as to whether he could secure permission to cross the border into Algeria from Mauritania.\n\"If we don't get the visas, then it is game over,\" he said at the time. \nHis public appeal video on X, formerly Twitter, was seen by 11 million people - even catching the attention of the site's owner Elon Musk, as well as MPs Tim Loughton and Alexander Stafford and the Home Office. \nThe increased attention on the challenge eventually paid off as the UK's Algerian embassy announced he would receive a courtesy visa on the spot.\nAfter the setbacks, all that separated Mr Cook and the finish line was the small task of the Sahara Desert. \nThe tarmac roads ran out, as did the signal and any signs of civilisation. But an end date was set: 7 April, 2024. \nRamping up his mileage to make up for lost time, Mr Cook made the decision to run through the night due to the intense daytime heat and sandstorms. \nMonths turned into weeks, and weeks turned into days. \nFinally, on Sunday afternoon, Mr Cook laced his trainers one last time - at least for now - as he set off for Tunisia's most northerly point.\nJoined by supporters from across the world for the final marathon, Mr Cook completed the challenge.  \nThe celebrations will go long into the night - helped by a finishing party performance by British punk band Soft Play, formerly Slaves, at a hotel in Bizerte.\nAnd the Hardest Geezer will finally get his hands on the one thing he has been craving since day one - a strawberry daiquiri.\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook,on X, and on Instagram.

The paper says there will be a shift to \"accountability\", as the latest stage focuses on the role company executives, government ministers and figures from Fujitsu played in handling the cases of sub-postmasters wrongly accused of fraud. \nMany of the papers feature photographs of the British man who has completed his epic challenge to run the entire length of Africa. \"Run of a kind\" declares the Metro. \"Victory\" says the Sun.

    "Cancer warning labels on alcohol products should be introduced in Northern Ireland, according to a cancer charity.\nFrom 2026, it will be a legal requirement for all bottles of alcohol in the Republic of Ireland to carry a label.\nHowever, alcohol producers have expressed concern that the law could impact sales and add to their workload.\nCancer Focus NI has said a \"bold\" approach was needed by Stormont.\n\u201cIt\u2019s causing a lot of concern\u201d said Eoin \u00d3 Cath\u00e1in, director of the Irish Whiskey Association.\n\u201cTo get the labels finalised and everything in order can take quite a long time. \n\"And some companies are finding it quite challenging that they'd have to have a separate line to produce a label just for the Republic of Ireland.\u201d\nMr \u00d3 Cath\u00e1in is worried that warning labels could also have an impact on sales to the lucrative north American souvenir market.\n\u201cLots of people want to take a present back with them to the US to Canada, wherever they're from. \n\"Will they pick up the bottle that has this very stark, very big warning label on it?  Or will they prefer to pick up the Scotch?\n\"So there is concern there just from a pure reputation point of view as well.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Northern Ireland's Department of Health said there were no current plans to introduce such requirements on alcohol labelling.\n\"Given the nature of the market, it is likely that any such changes across the UK administrations would need to be discussed on a four nations basis,\" they added.\n\nTwenty years ago, Ireland was the first country to ban smoking in the workplace, including bars and restaurants.\nHealth campaigners hope more countries will follow the Republic's lead on alcohol health warnings too.\nDoreen Regan from Cancer Focus NI would like to see a similarly \"bold\" step being taken in Northern Ireland.\n\u201cWe know there\u2019s a clear link between drinking alcohol and cancer,\" she said. \n\"It causes seven different types of cancer and the Northern Ireland cancer strategy states that it\u2019s linked to at least 300 cases per year in Northern Ireland.\n\"So anything that\u2019s going to help prevent that, or help empower people to make more informed choices, we would definitely be in support of.\"\nHinch Distillery in County Down has only been in operation for four years.  \nIt exports to about 30 countries worldwide.\nThe firm's international sales director Michael Morris has concerns that producing the new labels could add extra work.\n\"We will have to see exactly what the strict standards are going to be,\" he explained. \n\"We'll run dummy labels and we\u2019ll get them approved in the south. \n\"That will be the normal process and then once we've got those labels approved, we would do a run of the labels based on projections of volume. \n\"We need to make sure we have enough stock with the correct labels.\"\nMr Morris also said he did not think warning labels were needed on alcohol bottles sold in Northern Ireland or other parts of the UK.\n\"Our view is that the sensible approach is to go with the government health warning -  drink within the units and avoid session drinking.\"",
    "There are fears for the future of Alstom's rail assembly factory in Derby due to a lack of orders.\nThe company says 1,300 permanent jobs could go and there are major concerns about the knock-on affect for other businesses in the supply chain.\nBBC News looks at how the crisis has come about.\nAccording to Alstom's managing director Nick Crossfield, the company can no longer guarantee a presence in the city because the main production has finished, with a gap until 2026 for the next order.\nIf the Litchurch Lane factory does close, the UK would be the only nation in the G7 without a site able to design, develop and manufacture trains, the firm said.\nMr Crossfield added it also would have a \"considerable\" impact on the national supply chain - with a further 15,000 jobs at risk.\nAlstom currently employs 3,000 people in the city - more than 1,000 are permanently based there, and many others are contractors. \nContractors employed by Alstom are professionals who provide skills or services for a fixed period. \nThey may be contracted for a set number of hours, a specific time frame, or for a project\u2019s duration.\nThree generations of Chris Cope's family have worked at Alstom - he said morale is low and there was \"devastation everywhere\".\nHe added some workers have had \"nothing to do\" for the last few weeks and a lot of temporary contractors have already been let go with those left with \"days or weeks at best\".\n\"I was always brought up believing that it was a job for life,\" he told the BBC\n\"But to find out that's not true... it's upsetting.\"\nThe site, which has been in Derby for 147 years, is facing the prospect of mass redundancies.\nThe factory - which became Alstom from Bombardier in 2020 - has always had a steady stream of orders to keep workload ticking over. \nBut some commentators say things began to change in 2009, with increased competition both at home and overseas. \nAbout 15 years ago, Bombardier lost out on a contract to build a fleet of inter-city \"super express\" trains to Japan's Hitachi which replaced ageing high-speed trains on the Great Western and East Coast main lines.\nThe firm then lost out to Siemens in a bid to grab a \u00a31.4bn contract for London's Thameslink programme - which included building 1,200 new carriages - in 2011.\nA month after missing out on the contract, Bombardier announced plans to cut more than 1,400 jobs at the Litchurch Lane site. \nThe decision to award Siemens the contract prompted fury from MPs and a protest march with up to 6,000 people in Derby.  \nThe company was given a reprieve in 2013 with a \u00a3180m contract to build 116 electric rolling stock trains for Southern, but an even bigger lifeline came the following year. \nBombardier secured a \u00a31bn contract for London's Crossrail to build 65 nine-car trains and construct a new purpose-built depot. The deal also included maintenance provision.\nIn 2020 the firm, now Alstom, was awarded a \u00a32.3bn contract to build 70 four-car monorail trains for a transport project connecting the Egyptian cities of Cairo and Giza. \nIt was the company's first large export project for many years. \nHowever, Alstom bosses warned in September 2023 that potential new contracts might not arrive in time to save jobs.\nMany have laid the blame for this at the government's door.\nThe company said there were opportunities to bid for work that they had been made aware of since 2020 but added there was \"no guarantee any orders will be placed\". \nAlstom said it was not asking for a bail-out or for guaranteed orders to come forward but for the government to bring forward tenders. \nUnite general secretary Sharon Graham said there was \"absolutely no justification\" for the proposed job losses.\nShe added it was \"madness\" that there is a \"huge amount of work\" that Alstom could be bidding for but the government has \"not got around to tendering for it\".\nAlstom has said it expects a large push of train companies in updating dated stock over the coming years.\nThe factory has smaller-scale ongoing work but it has no major manufacturing projects until HS2 in 2026.\nThe firm was relying on large orders to supply HS2 but these have been delayed, along with the wider project. \nThe Unite union said scaling back HS2 and delays in its construction were to blame for Alstom's job cuts fears.  \nBut Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, speaking in Derbyshire in November, said it was not \"fair or accurate to characterise it\" as a HS2 problem.\nIntense lobbying is well under way from a range of interests, most notably from Alstom, MPs, Derby City Council and unions.\nAlstom said after 10 months of discussions, they have \"all but run out of time\" and the government \"need to provide the much-needed certainty\" to the staff and supply chain.\nIn a visit to Derbyshire in March, Mr Sunak said the government was \"doing everything it can to support the supply chain\" and make sure there is a \"good pipeline of work\".\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "If we want to ditch our polluting vehicles and replace them with cleaner, greener electric cars we have a problem: The huge number of homes with no off-street parking.\nCity streets full of terraced houses present a particular challenge. Research by the RAC Foundation suggests in Nottingham as many as forty per cent of households have no access to a private parking space. \nIn the search for solutions, councils are offering to dig covered channels across pavements so drivers can charge outside their home. Others are installing fast chargers on street corners.\nThe government has now approved payments of \u00a3185m to local authorities, part of a \u00a3381 million Local Electric Vehicle (LEVI) fund to improve infrastructure to charge electric and hybrid vehicles. \n\nOne beneficiary is teacher Alison Chilton. When she leased her first electric car five years ago charging it at public charge points was inconvenient and pricey. She found the cheapest public network near her cost 59p per kilowatt hour (kWh). By contrast using off-peak electricity at home is 7.5p per kWh. \n\"It seems a bit unjust that because you haven't got a driveway, you've got to pay four or five times more,\" she says.  \nBut now Nottinghamshire County Council has provided a free solution in the form of a shallow covered channel running from the kerb to her own charge point mounted next to her front door. The cable lies flat under the pavement removing any potential trip hazards. \n\"It's been a life changer for me,\" Alison says. \"It means I can stop my car outside my house at any point; it doesn't matter if there's no charge left in it. You can't do that if you have to go somewhere else to charge it.\"\nDeveloped by Kerbo charge, the channels usually cost around \u00a31,000 to install but are free as part of the pilot. So far the council has equipped ten households and they are encouraging more drivers to apply.\nOther councils are trying to reduce the number of cars competing for parking spaces along narrow streets. In the Darley area of Derby the city council has joined up with hire car company Enterprise to offer local drivers free first year membership of an electric car share club. They also get a voucher to cover mileage on their first trip.\n\n\"There is evidence to suggest that a car share club in a particular location can take 20 cars off the road,\" says Derby city councillor Carmel Swan. On a terraced street where parking spaces are at a premium that could make a big difference. \nThe Labour Cabinet member for climate, transport and sustainability says the car share club also offers sceptical drivers the chance to try an electric car before they commit to buy. \nThe council is using funding from the Department for Transport to install electric chargers on street corners. It means charging points closer where people live and work.\nResidents say traffic is a particular problem in the Darley area, particularly at school pick-up time.\n\"Parking is a nightmare round here,\" one man said. \"It's a bit inconvenient at the moment with all these parking spaces now being taken up by electric cars. Ultimately we should start using bicycles and public transport more. There are other options. We don't have to rely on cars.\"",
    "Rail users in Stranraer fear they may not see trains return to the tracks after a hotel fire 50 miles away closed the line for six months.\nA deliberate blaze closed Ayr railway station in September, and people who use the Stranraer route say they have been left \"feeling forgotten\".\nThe fire ravaged the adjacent derelict station hotel and forced the line to close while the listed building is demolished. \nSouth Ayrshire Council said it was working with ScotRail and other partners to ensure trains can run again \"as soon as possible\".\nThe fire brought to a head a long-running saga around Ayr Station Hotel, which was closed and classed as \"dangerous\" in 2013. \nEfforts to deal with the derelict site have been hampered by the absence of its owner, Malaysian businessman Ung Eng Huat, who also goes by the name Sunny Ung.\nThe council previously stepped in to stop the hotel collapsing when a second dangerous building notice was issued in 2018.\nScotRail reopened some services from Ayr North to Prestwick and Glasgow in November, but plans to re-start southbound services have suffered several delays.\nThe setbacks for journeys to Stranraer have caused consternation for some people in the town. \nNational Rail's website recently changed the date for the line reopening from mid-April to 2 June. \nJim Heron, chair of the Ayr-Stranraer Trainline Action Group, is critical of the council and ScotRail and feels the slow progress \"is creating a crisis\".\nThe 75-year-old said: \"We were told it would re-open in January, then March, then April, and now it's the summer. \n\"Trains from Stranraer to Ayr need to be restarted as quick as possible.\n\"I'm quite sure the people making the decisions could demolish the hotel walls by the rail line in two weeks.\"\nMr Heron says the group suggested to ScotRail ways the trains could operate to just south of Ayr, and be cleaned and fuelled elsewhere, but that \"there was no interest\".\nRebecca Richardson is upset at what she feels is \"ongoing inaction\" to remedy the situation. \nMrs Richardson's 14-year-old daughter is one of a number of commuters who used the Stranraer to Ayr line for school, and says the impact \"has completely disrupted her daily routine\".\nShe contacted South Ayrshire Council, ScotRail, and Dumfries and Galloway Council but said \"nobody is taking ownership\" of the problem.\nShe added: \"We've had different answers from everybody. \n\"I'm appalled at how long it's gone on for. The lack of communication is the most frustrating thing. No-one gives us an answer or tells us exactly what's happening. \n\"Ultimately it comes across as if people don't care about this area of south west Scotland, we feel it's the forgotten part.\n\"What some don't realise is the people most affected aren't those where the fire happened, but the people south of Ayr. It is hard enough for people in Stranraer even without this.\"\nJoe Lynch fears that the temporary closure of the railway line could become permanent, and added it had been closed for \"far too long\".\nThe South Rhins resident said he didn't see any end to the delays and accused operators of \"failing to meet any dates they put out\".\nHe is worried it could be \"death by a thousand cuts\".\nScotRail removed two Class 156 trains from the line in March for maintenance work due to the length of time they had sat idle, which have added to Mr Lynch's worries. \nThe 65-year-old said: \"My concern is the line may never reopen, it could be the case that it closes by default because officially no-one uses it.\"\nMore than 40,000 passengers used Stranraer railway station during 2022-23, the highest since Covid, according to official figures.\nBefore the pandemic the station had a total of 65,000 annual users. \nBut Mr Lynch feels the rail link to Stranraer has been a forgotten service since the ferries left the town more than a decade ago, and wants to see it upgraded in line with those north of Ayr. \nHe added: \"It's not a great line when it's running, it takes 90 minutes just to get to Ayr, with an average speed of just over 30mph. \n\"The line north of Ayr is well invested in, there's electric trains, they are fast, frequent, run early and late at night.\"\nMr Lynch has also been critical of the replacement bus service, after closures on the A77 have seen it suffer 20-mile diversions via Newton Stewart, adding a further 30 minutes to journey times.  \nSouth Ayrshire Council, ScotRail and Network Rail have been approached about the delays and dissatisfaction experienced by rail users in Stranraer.\nThe council highlighted its dedicated website page for updates, and acknowledged the impact the works are having on rail services.\nA spokesperson said: \"Works at the former station hotel are continuing. \n\"We recently reported that we discovered damaged structure in the northern section of the building and that this will unfortunately impact the timeline of our safety works.\n\"We know this delay is frustrating for rail users and we are working closely with Network Rail and ScotRail to ensure that",
    "An organised crime group has been jailed for supplying Spice, a synthetic cannabis.\nFive individuals were sentenced on 5 April at Bristol Crown Court following an investigation by the South West Regional Organised Crime Unit (SWROCU).\nQuyen To, 42, of William Morris Way in Swindon, was the central figure in the group, responsible for import, export and production of the Class B drug.\nDet Insp Claire Smith said they showed \"utter disregard for human life\".\nThe investigation began in the summer of 2020 when UK Border Force intercepted 4kg (9lb) of Spice crystals destined for properties owned by, or associated with, Quyen To. \nThe seizure of these packages resulted in warrants at his home address in Swindon, where officers from SWROCU uncovered a drug production factory in the garage. \nParaphernalia associated with the production of Spice, including marshmallow leaf, rat poison, and sweet flavourings, were also found in the garage.\nQuyen To's nephew, Rio Nguyen, who was 17 at the time, was arrested at the scene. He was wearing a respiratory mask and preparing the drugs for onward supply. \nIn total, 40kg (88lb) of class B drugs were seized from Quyen To's home, as well as computers, phones and receipts which showed he had been distributing a large number of packages containing Spice across the UK and around the world, to countries including Kuwait and Nigeria.\nSWROCU investigators were able to prove Quyen To had been aided by a network of friends, family and acquaintances for many years: his estranged wife Kati To, 42, from Wiltshire, his sister Vicky To, 40, from London, and Michael Clarke, 58, from London.\nQuyen To was jailed for 16 years in prison for his involvement in running the Spice factory.\nClarke, who received parcels containing Spice from China on behalf of Quyen To, was found guilty of importation and conspiracy to supply class B drugs and sentenced to seven years in prison.\nVicky To was found guilty of importation, exportation and supply of class B drugs and was sentenced to six years. \nTo's nephew, Nguyen, who was packing and sending drugs abroad was given two years and two months for exportation and supply of class B drugs. \nKati To, who made payments abroad on behalf of her estranged husband, previously pleaded guilty to money laundering and received a ten-month sentence suspended for 12 months, as well as 40 hours of unpaid work.\nDet Insp Smith from SWROCU said: \"Quyen To and his accomplices have shown utter disregard for human life having manufactured and distributed vast quantities of Spice around the world. \n\"The activities and criminality of this group were driven by greed and financial gain and I am pleased to see significant prison sentences have been handed down.\n\"SWROCU will continue to relentlessly disrupt serious and organised crime and the convictions in this case should act as a clear deterrent to those pursuing such criminal activity.\"\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "It's a drama about a fictional slimming club - and the set where Ruth Jones and James Corden first met.\nFat Friends came to our screens seven years before the Welsh-English comedy classic Gavin and Stacey.\nThe show, set in Leeds, is now winning new fans after dropping on Netflix.\nOne of the cast members, Gaynor Faye, said Gavin and Stacey may never have existed without Fat Friends.\nIn series one of Fat Friends, first broadcast 24 years ago, Jones played Kelly Chadwick, a bride-to-be struggling to fit into her wedding dress, while Corden was bullied teenager Jamie Rymer. \nJones said she only found out the series was back on screen after a text from Corden saying it was number two on Netflix. \nFormer Coronation Street and Emmerdale star Faye, who played Lauren in the series, also had similar surprised calls when the series appeared on Netflix.\nIt was Faye's mum, the late Kay Mellor, who wrote the series.\n\"Fat Friends was a phenomenon,\" Faye told the Lucy Owen programme on BBC Radio Wales. \n\"My mum knew what people wanted to watch and everyone is affected by weight.\n\"Whether you're too small, too big - or you think you are - and she saw the fun in everything.\"\nAlison Steadman and Sheridan Smith - who played Pam and Rudi in Gavin and Stacey respectively - also appeared in Fat Friends. \n\"Ruth and James may not have met if it wasn't for Fat Friends and I know they were writing while they were on Fat Friends,\" Faye said. \nIts four series originally ran from 2000 to 2005 on ITV.\n\"My mum gave Ruth her first writing break because Ruth said, 'Oh I'd like to be writer' so she came and worked on The Chase which was another of my mum's dramas. \n\"So she kind of cut her teeth on my mum's drama... she's got a lot to answer for my mum, most of it wonderful.\"\nFaye said her mum also supported Swansea-born Russell T Davies - who is behind such work as Queer As Folk, It's A Sin and Doctor Who - when he was starting out as a writer.\n\"She's done incredible work and inspired so many incredible writers now and mentored so many people. \n\"She's found actors like James Corden, Jude Law, she's mentored writers [like] Ruth Jones, Sally Wainwright, Russell T Davies, myself. \n\"Her work is incredible and it needs to be celebrated.

He is from the Oldham area and is believed to have links to the Burnley and Chester areas.\nOfficers said a knife was recovered from the scene on Saturday but could not confirm whether Mr Masum was armed.\nA Facebook page believed to belong to Mr Masum suggests he is a Bangladeshi national and is studying digital marketing at the University of Bedfordshire.\nThe university declined to comment or confirm if Mr Masum was one of its students when contacted by the BBC.\nGeo Khan, who runs a fruit and veg shop close to the scene of the incident, told the BBC how he had tried to save the victim after he found her body on Saturday afternoon.\nMr Khan said he knew the woman by sight and that she had been coming into his store for a \"few weeks\".\n\"I was sitting in my shop when I heard screaming,\" he said.\n\"I came out and ran to the scene and there was a body lying on the floor. I tried to check her pulse and there was none.\"\n\"Within a few minutes a doctor arrived and we tried to turn her over,\" he said.\n\"There was blood everywhere. I got a sheet and I put that over her until the ambulance arrived.\n\"It was really, really bad. I couldn't take it in.\n\"She was a good, charitable lady and all the time there was a smile on her face. \n\"The local area is distressed. I just feel really sorry for her and for what happened.\"\nThe Rev Duncan Milwain, assistant curate at Bradford Cathedral, said churches and mosques in the city would be open to people wishing to grieve. \nHe said: \"The cathedral is open at all times for anybody who wants to come and sit down, talk to somebody, pray or light a candle. \n\"Bradford's a city of faith. This must be used to bring the community together, rather than pull people apart.\n\"Being towards the end of Ramadan, it's a terrible time for this to have happened.\"\nMr Milwain said \"people who don't know Bradford\" should be assured the incident was \"isolated\".\n\"Bradford is a young and vibrant city,\" he added.\n\"It's really an optimistic place. We don't want a narrative that Bradford's an unfortunate place to be. It's a place of great hope.\"\nWest Yorkshire's deputy mayor for policing and crime, Alison Lowe, said Mr Masum was known to the victim and was considered \"very dangerous\".\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4 on Monday, Mrs Lowe said: \"There is a very complex investigation currently ongoing with all forces in the country trying to locate the suspect.\n\"We don't think this was a random killing, the police know the two people were known to each other.\"\nShe said people in the community were \"shocked and distressed\" by what had happened.\nShe added: \"The reason I'm speaking today is to give reassurance to that community that everything is being done to locate this suspect and to reassure them that these incidents are really rare.\n\"This was someone who knew the victim and is highly unlikely to be a risk to anybody else in Bradford or wider West Yorkshire.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "BBC Middle East correspondent Lina Sinjab left her home in the Syrian capital Damascus in 2013, soon after the start of the civil war. Recently she was able to travel back for the first time in years, finding a country both very familiar and utterly changed.\nEntering Syria, the scene was as I remembered it - the same mountain, the same oak trees and the same big posters of the president, providing a vivid reminder of who is in charge here.\nBut few of the people coming in were Syrians. Most were religious tourists from Lebanon and Iraq, though some others may have come to shop in Damascus's souks.\nTravelling towards the city, the checkpoints begin. Over the past decade, many people have disappeared here. It is enough to have voiced views critical of the regime, or even to have liked a social media post sympathetic to the opposition.\nAlmost nothing seems to have changed in President Bashar al-Assad's Syria, yet it is a country transformed by war.\nMore than a decade after the protests began in Syria, the regime's agenda has shifted. Its main concern today is the economy, not politics.\nArriving in Damascus at night, the city lies in darkness. Even the fanciest neighbourhoods are blacked out. This has been the case for years. Nearly everything is in short supply, forcing Syrians to stand in long queues to secure their basic needs. \nYou need a smart card with your data on it to get your subsidised bread or allocation of fuel or gas - a text tells you when it's time to join the queue.\nThe government seems determined to present Syria as a modern state just as everything collapses. \nIt introduced a system for people to pay government bills by bank transfer, via a mobile app. But many don't have access to banks or mobile phones. Another system then emerged that allows you to pay electronically without a bank - but you still need a mobile phone. And sometimes the generators running the telephone masts run out of fuel, and the network drops out.\nA whole new generation of Syrians have grown up with war - explosions, bombings and the constant news of death and disappearance. They are indifferent about the war, yet they know that there are boundaries they can't cross in order to remain safe. So they cherish culture, heritage, art and music. Those fields are somehow safe from brutality.\nThe art and cultural scene is booming, despite everything. \nBands play all types of music, new galleries are opening, and there is a fresh eagerness to explore what's left of Syria's historic sites.\nThe presence of large numbers of people from countries allied to Syria is a cause of anger. Take a walk in the old city and you hear the voices of visitors from Iraq, Lebanon, Iran and even Yemen. \nAmong them are Shia Muslims brought in by Iran to strengthen its influence in Syria - or as people in Damascus see it, to expand Shia influence in the region. The majority of Syrians are Sunni Muslim and most of the five million refugees who fled the war are Sunni while the ruling elite is mainly Alawite, a Shia offshoot that accounts for about 12% of the population.\nEven regime loyalists, who in the past saw Iran's presence as strategic, now call it \"occupation\". Discontent only increased after Israel reportedly attacked Iranian military and security personnel who stationed themselves in residential neighbourhoods of Damascus. Israel sees the presence in Syria of its arch-enemy Iran as a major threat.\n\"Our whole building was shaking. Why should I live this with my children? Why do they come and live in residential areas?\" one woman asked after an attack on a building in Mezzeh, an affluent area in the south-west of the city. \nThis week a suspected Israeli air strike flattened the consular section of the Iranian embassy in Mezzeh, killing senior Iranian commanders. \nThe Russians are unwelcome too. Although the number of Russian troops has reportedly fallen since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, they are still a visible presence in the country, whether regular Russian soldiers or affiliated fighters from the southern Russian region of Chechnya.\nNorth-west Syria is still controlled by Syrian opposition fighters but many people in Damascus see that part of the country as being ruled by another \"occupier\", in this case Turkey which has troops there. Meanwhile Kurdish-led forces control most of north-eastern Syria where the country's oil resources are. \nLiving standards vary in each of these regions, with government-controlled parts of Syria among the poorest of all.\nBut although President Assad's allies are still influential on the ground, he and his regime are fixing its hopes on another big player.\nIn circles close to the government, Saudi Arabia is described as a great regional player and is no longer seen as fuelling terrorism in Syria, as it did in the early days of the uprising. Some Syrians see Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman as a genius with the potential to set the Arab world on a fresh path.\nAfter years of exclusion from the Arab ",
    "A workshop that helps men combat loneliness has been served with an eviction notice.\nWareham Men's Shed, which is run out of The Purbeck Centre in Dorset, was handed the three-month notice by Care Dorset - facing closure if it could not find another premises.\nBut building owners Care Dorset told the BBC the notice \"should not have been given when it was\".\nIt said it had paused proceedings, pending further conversations.\nWareham Men's Shed is part of a national network of spaces for men at risk of social exclusion.\nIt gives its members somewhere to do woodwork and help with practical projects in the local community, as well as offering companionship.\nChris Hockley, a member of the group, called the news \"shocking\".\n\"This is a devastating blow to the mainly elderly men involved, as for many the shed gives them a purpose they would otherwise not have,\" he said.\nHe went on to list the local organisations that had benefitted from the group's projects, including schools, churches, charities and parish councils.\nRecently, the group built a climbing wall for reception children at Stoborough Primary School.\nMembers have also undertaken projects to help local wildlife, like building bug hotels and hedgehog houses.\nCare Dorset, an adult care service owned by Dorset Council, said it had been looking to make improvements to how it operated its day centres.\nA spokesperson said: \"In the planning of this work, we recognise that there are more discussions that need to be had with representatives from Men's Shed and notice should not have been given when it was.\n\"Consequently we are pausing all matters relating to the issuing of the notice.\"\nThey apologised to Wareham Men's Shed for causing \"concern and anxiety\" and said they hoped to meet with the group, together with social care staff from Dorset Council, within the next fortnight, to discuss options for the future.\n\"In the meantime, [Wareham] Men's Shed can be assured that no action will be taken in relation to their tenancy,\" they added.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

    "The devastated landscape of their city feels unreal to the thousands of Palestinians who have been returning to Khan Younis in Gaza. \nThrough the rubble of the streets, they have been filing back on bicycles, donkey carts and by foot, looking for their homes or what trace is left of them.\n\"I am going to my house, even though I know that it is destroyed. I am going to remove the rubble to get a shirt out,\" Mohammed Abou Diab said.\nIsrael's military pulled troops out of southern Gaza, leaving just one brigade in the area.\nThe smell of death is in the air, residents say, with bodies still lying beneath the ruins. The scale of the devastation has shocked them.\n\"The destruction is huge. It all needs to be rebuilt. It's not suitable for human beings to live in - not even for animals,\" Abu Saif Abu Mustafa told the BBC.\n\"It's as if an earthquake hit the city,\" Rashad Khamis al-Najjar from the wider Khan Younis region said as he surveyed the scene. \n\"The houses are not liveable, the mosques are not suitable for worship, and the roads and the infrastructure, even the electricity, have all been completely destroyed.\"\nAnother resident had a similar sense of horror at what he saw on his return: \"We see total destruction everywhere as if it were an earthquake or a natural catastrophe. \n\"The houses that haven't been destroyed are burned or looted by thieves. We are dying slowly. There are no homes to live in and we live like the dead.\"\nGaza's second city was the focus of a sustained onslaught by the Israeli army from December, believing that Hamas leaders and fighters had been driven there from the north and established a new stronghold in tunnels and hospitals.\nNeighbourhood by neighbourhood, Israel ordered Palestinians to leave. The Israeli army said it was doing everything it could to protect civilians.   \nA city of some 400,000 people was deserted bit by bit as Israeli forces mounted ferocious bombardments.\nAlmost from the moment that Israel announced that its mission in Khan Younis was completed and its troops had been pulled out, Palestinians began to move from their overcrowded shelters further south towards their city.\nBut many have found that with their homes rendered unliveable, they have little option but to try to gather what possessions are left and return to their temporary shelters.\nOne woman, Nour Ayyash, said she couldn't reach her apartment because the stairs were gone. Her brother managed to climb up and retrieve some clothes for her children.\nAnother returning resident told the BBC: \"We came to get some of our things, we wanted to see if anything was left of our homes and to take any of our belongings, like clothes for example.\"\nBut some would rather stay, even if there is nothing left of what was once their home.  \nMohammed Abu Rizzeq lost more than his house, his wife was killed in an Israeli bombardment after they were displaced.  \nBut he told the BBC: \"Our biggest request is that Israel withdraw from our land - there's been enough killing and destruction. It's better for us to have a tent on the rubble of our homes than being displaced and in exile.\"\nIsrael's military stressed a \"significant force\" would remain in Gaza after some troops left southern areas on Sunday. The pull-out is being interpreted as tactical, rather than a sign the war may be moving closer to its end.\nOn Monday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had set a date for a planned military operation in the southern city of Rafah, where many of those returning to Khan Younis had been sheltering. He gave no details.\nMore than a million Palestinians have sought shelter in Rafah after fleeing fighting in other areas - although that city too has been hit by Israeli air strikes.\nMr Netanyahu said Israel wanted complete victory over Hamas. \"This victory requires entry into Rafah and the elimination of the terrorist battalions there. It will happen - there is a date.\"\nThe US has said it won't support a large-scale offensive in Rafah without a credible plan to protect civilians. \nCeasefire talks are continuing, with Qatar's foreign ministry telling the BBC it was cautiously optimistic about a new proposal.\nHamas - which says it wants a permanent end to the war, full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and an influx of aid as part of any deal - has said that it is studying the latest proposal, without indicating whether its leadership now feels ready to make concessions on its demands. \nThe same is true on the Israeli side. Israel says it wants hostages being held by Hamas to be freed in return for a temporary pause in fighting.\nBut Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has said he believes this is an opportune moment to do a deal with Hamas. \nMeanwhile the leaders of France, Egypt and Jordan jointly called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Emmanuel Macron, Abdul Fattah al-Sisi and King Abdullah also warned against an Israeli offensive in Rafah, which they said would \"only bring more death and suffering\".\nMore than 33,000 Gazan",
    "John Lewis has said the former boss of Tesco's UK business, Jason Tarry, will become its next chairman.\nMr Tarry will start in September, taking over from Dame Sharon White who said last year that she would be standing down at the end of her term.\nThe partnership, which includes the John Lewis department stores and Waitrose supermarkets, has come under increasing pressure in recent years.\nIt has closed stores and cut jobs, but recently announced a return to profit.\nMr Tarry, who will become only the seventh chairman of John Lewis, said it was a \"great privilege\" to lead the company.\nDame Sharon was the first woman to lead John Lewis, but when she announced in October that she would step down after five years in the role, it made her the shortest-serving boss in the partnership's near 100-year history.\nHer predecessors had each served between 13 and 26 years.\nDame Sharon's appointment made her one of the few black women leading a major UK business. However, she faced controversy after considering breaking the historic employee-owned structure of the partnership, and she was also criticised by some for her lack of retail experience.  \nBut in an interview with the BBC in June last year, Dame Sharon defended her background, noting that some of her predecessors at John Lewis had also come from outside the retail sector.\nRita Clifton, deputy chairman and chair of John Lewis's nomination committee, said: \"The board extends its huge thanks to Sharon for successfully leading the partnership through one of the most testing periods in its history - first Covid and then the cost-of-living crisis.\n\"She has faced the toughest decisions and overseen the partnership's financial recovery; we are in good financial health with a return to profit, and have a strong balance sheet with record investment planned this year.\"\nLast month, John Lewis reported full-year profits of \u00a356m compared with a \u00a3234m loss the year before. \nDespite this, the partnership said it would not be paying a staff bonus for the second year in a row, which is only the third time it has not paid out such an award since 1953.\nDame Sharon said: \"I'm delighted to be handing over to Jason, who has a combination of fantastic retail experience with leadership through transformation.\" \nMr Tarry had worked at Tesco for more than 33 years, with his most recent role being chief executive of the supermarket's UK and Ireland business.\n\"The partnership and its brands stand for trust, value, quality and service and it's a great privilege to be succeeding Sharon as the seventh chairman,\" Mr Tarry said.\nZoe Mills, retail analyst at GlobalData, said Mr Tarry \"certainly has the experience and knowhow to rejuvenate the John Lewis Partnership\".\nHowever, she added that he would face a different challenge to that faced at Tesco, \"with Marks & Spencer, rather than the discounters, a clear threat to John Lewis's long-term success\".\nM&S is forecast to continue growing its share of clothing and footwear over the next few years, Ms Mills said, while it has also been growing its grocery sales, with Waitrose perceived to be losing out in the battle for premium food.\n\"Within Waitrose & Partners, Tarry must not lose sight of its more premium proposition,\" Ms Mills said.\n\"While remaining price-competitive will be crucial, as within general merchandise, the focus must be on quality and justifying higher price points to entice shoppers to trade up.\"",

    "The Green Party plans to introduce a flat fare on London Underground and Overground, its mayoral candidate says.\nZoe Garbett pledged passengers would pay the same regardless of whether they were travelling from Zone 2 or Zone 6.\nTransport is a focus of the party's manifesto, which includes plans for free transport and a pay per mile consultation.\nThe Labour, Conservative and Lib Dem candidates also gave their views on her proposals.\nThe flat fares scheme is a repeat of the Greens' pledge in the past two elections, with Ms Garbett saying she would look to introduce it first on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR).\nImplementing it on Transport for London (TfL) services would cost \"hundreds of millions\" and would depend on government negotiations, Ms Garbett added.\nThe Greens have come third in the past three mayoral elections and it currently has three assembly members. \nLaunching her party's manifesto in Walthamstow in east London on Monday, Ms Garbett argued the capital was not \"working\" for millions of Londoners and \"fairness\" was central to her plans. \nAlong with an ambition for a flat fare in the future, the party wants to extend free bus travel to under-22s, restore free peak-time transport for the over-60s, give free school meals to all secondary schools and create 10 new parks.\n\"We need a plan to refocus London for the workers and renters in our city,\" she said.\nMs Garbett's other proposals include offering free travel and cycle hire to asylum-seekers to ensure they \"can get to appointments they need to and able to feel part of our communities\".\nShe said she would also consult people in the first year on \"pay-per-mile\" road-charging, where motorists would pay according to how far they drive and at what time, as well as the emissions of their vehicles.\nLabour candidate Sadiq Khan has ruled out this kind of road charge in his next term but he has previously said he was looking at creating a new charge to replace the separate Ultra Low Emission Zone charge, congestion charge and tolls at the Blackwall and new Silvertown tunnels.\nOn the Greens' fare plans, a spokesperson for Mr Khan said: \"Sadiq has done everything he can to keep TfL fares low. He is proud to be freezing TfL fares again this year, the fifth time he has frozen fares since becoming mayor. \n\"This is alongside Sadiq's other work making fares more affordable, such as trialling off-peak fares all day on Fridays, and the huge success of the Hopper bus fare.\"\nConservative candidate Susan Hall faced criticism after a campaign claiming Mr Khan had plans for \"pay-per-mile\" charges, and her team also circulated leaflets looking like penalty charge notices with a scannable link to a webpage making the same claim.\nMs Hall denied that the materials were misleading, saying TfL software engineers had been carrying out research for Mr Khan.\n\"Sadiq Khan expressly said last time he wouldn't expand Ulez, and that's exactly what he did,\" she said.\n\"It is alerting the public that if they vote for Sadiq Khan, not only will they keep Ulez expansion but then he will introduce pay-per-mile which means more tax.\"\nMr Khan's spokesperson said: \"These leaflets peddle a barefaced lie. The Tories are clearly desperate and have resorted to deliberately misleading Londoners. It is nothing more than scaremongering.\n\"Sadiq has repeatedly, categorically, ruled out pay-per-mile for as long as he is mayor. Londoners will not be duped by these Tory lies.\"\nLiberal Democrat candidate Rob Blackie said the Green policies would leave TfL \"short of billions of pounds\", which he said would result in cuts to bus routes and Tubes breaking down because maintenance would be cut. \nHe also accused Mr Khan of \"mismanagement of TfL\", which he said had resulted in similar issues. \n\"The Liberal Democrat plan for transport will protect bus routes and make sure that Tubes don't break down as often,\" he added.\nIt comes amid developments on other transport issues in the capital - specifically, a government announcement of \u00a32.9m in new funding for Hammersmith Bridge to resurface a cycle lane.\nThe 137-year-old bridge, which is owned by Hammersmith and Fulham Council, has been closed to motor vehicles since cracks appeared in the pedestals in 2019.\nThe money will be used to resurface the temporary cycle lane across the bridge and make it permanent, but the financial boost will not solve ongoing issues about how the \u00a3250m bill will be funded.\nThe full cost will be split three ways between the Hammersmith and Fulham Council, the Department for Transport (DfT) and Transport for London (TfL), however the DfT is still assessing plans by the council to fund its share by introducing a toll.\nTransport minister Huw Merriman told BBC Radio London: \"We have to go through that and make sure that the governance and the oversight and the value for money is in there for the whole f the UK taxpayer.\n\"The UK taxpayer doesn't own the bridge, the borough does and therefore if funds are going to be added then we need to make",
    "The questions that will be asked of the jury in Donald Trump's upcoming hush money criminal case have been revealed.\nThey range from whether prospective jurors listen to podcasts to their feelings about a former president being criminally tried in state court.\nAlso on Monday, an appeals court dismissed Mr Trump's most recent effort to delay the case.\nHe had sued the Manhattan judge overseeing the trial earlier in the day. \nA New York court order published on Monday afternoon contained the questions for potential jurors. Jury selection for the trial is set to begin next week, on 15 April. \nThey ask the jury pool to reveal information about themselves, particularly whether they have participated in any groups that either oppose or support Mr Trump. \nThe questions are most specific about the following groups: the QAnon movement, the Proud Boys, the Oathkeepers, the Three Percenters, the Boogaloo Boys and Antifa.\nOther questions include:\nThey will also be asked about what media they watch and read and the social media they follow. \nThe former president was charged last year with a felony over a hush money payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, with whom he is accused of having an affair. \nHe has pleaded not guilty to falsifying business records, and he has continued to claim that this case and his other legal issues are the result of political persecution. \nMr Trump - the Republican presidential candidate for 2024 - has complained about the setting of his trial in Manhattan, a borough with a large number of Democratic voters. \nHe alleges that he will not face an unbiased jury on the island that long served as his home.\nExperts have told the BBC that jury selection for the trial, could pose a challenge for Mr Trump's legal team. \n\"It's doable, but it's going to be difficult,\" former Brooklyn prosecutor Julie Rendelman said. \nMr Trump's hush money trial is one of four criminal cases he is facing, but it may be the only trial to take place before the upcoming presidential election in November.\nIn an apparent effort to delay the upcoming trial, Mr Trump filed a lawsuit on Monday against New York Justice Juan Merchan. An appeals court judge dismissed that last-minute attempt just hours later. \nMr Trump was seeking to change the location of the trial and dismiss a gag order that limits his ability to comment on the case, according to BBC's US partner CBS News. \nThe lawsuit was not made public and BBC has not been able to review it. Two legal filings with the titles \"change of venue\" and \"stay\" were visible in an online court database, however, according to CBS. \nThe BBC has contacted Mr Trump's legal team for comment. \nMr Trump's trial was already delayed from the end of March to 15 April due to the unexpected release of a batch of documents from federal prosecutors that lawyers in the case needed time to review. The former president's legal team had sought to push back the trial to an even later date. \nHe has also complained about a gag order imposed on him by Justice Merchan, who is overseeing the trial. \nMr Merchan initially imposed a gag order preventing Mr Trump from commenting publicly about witnesses, jurors and others connected to the case. \nBut Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg asked to expand the order to cover the families of those involved in the case after Mr Trump attacked the judge's daughter on social media. \n\"This pattern of attacking family members of presiding jurists and attorneys assigned to his cases serves no legitimate purpose,\" Mr Merchan wrote in a ruling on the gag order. \nIn a separate development, justice department special counsel Jack Smith wrote to the Supreme Court on Monday in a legal filing to ask that it reject Mr Trump's claim of absolute presidential immunity. \nThe Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Mr Trump's immunity case on 25 April. \nMr Smith wrote that siding with Mr Trump in the matter \"would free the President from virtually all criminal law\u2014even crimes such as bribery, murder, treason, and sedition\".\nThe special counsel is prosecuting the former president in a classified files case and in a 2020 elections interference case.

But they are rarely sly.\"\nA basic structure of each episode's plot and subplot is written by David, but the show's dialogue is largely improvised by the actors. \nThat approach meant \"many of the most quotable one-liners arose spontaneously within the moment\", noted the Guardian's Charles Bramesco.\nThe final season's over-arching story line has been the continuing uncertainty about Larry accidentally running afoul of Georgia election laws.\nSet in a court room, the season finale saw various characters previously featured in the series show up to provide testimony, a device which helped recall popular storylines from over the years. \nBut in a review published earlier in the season, Empire's Boyd Hilton suggested the show peaked with the scenes which did not necessarily serve the overall plot.\n\"It's a measure of just how willing David is to mine anything and everything for comic effect that some of the funniest scenes this season occur when David is simply a vessel of impotent rage, at inanimate objects or unwitting service-industry workers,\" he said.\n\"Those particular scenes don't really go anywhere, and don't need to. The show still makes time for some purely preposterous comedy shtick, and thank heavens for that.\"\nA string of celebrities, news anchors and other guest stars from the show made appearances in the show's send-off. \nThe finale also featured multiple references to TV comedy Seinfeld, which David co-created, including an appearance from Jerry Seinfeld himself.\nCurb's conclusion included several nods to the criticism David received for Seinfeld's final episode in the late 1990s.\nOne subplot saw Larry's friend Leon (JB Smoove) finally get around to watching Seinfeld, creating a vehicle which allowed him to question Larry about the way it ended.\nTheir conversation, in turn, gave Larry an opportunity to indirectly address criticism about that series, ultimately delivering the line: \"I'm not really interested in your opinion.\"\nReviewing the finale, CNN's Brian Lowry said: \"David had clearly earned the right from HBO, creatively speaking, to say goodbye on his terms, and yes, not to fret about the reaction.\n\"Even so, it was nice to see in the Seinfeld plot that David could laugh not just at himself but at what many have long seen as one of his few conspicuous misfires.\n\"All told, as Larry is fond of saying, the result was pretty, pretty good, and indeed, even a bit better than that. And while Larry made a point in the episode of saying he hadn't learned a thing in his life, grading this on the spectrum of series finales would suggest otherwise.\"\nHowever, Meredith Hobbs Coons of the AV Club curbed her own enthusiasm when reviewing the show's season finale.\n\"With everything leading up to this big, Election Integrity Act/water bottle trial all season, we all knew Curb Your Enthusiasm would end with Larry in court, just as Seinfeld did in its two-part, 1998 finale,\" she wrote.\n\"This was inevitable, but there were some variables at play, too: 1) whether our guy would be convicted and go to jail, and 2) which of Larry's previous-season sins would show up to incriminate the man.\n\"Is fan service fun? Sure, it's fine. And the court thing does serve as a convenient device to collect clips from seasons 1-12 to give the series a nostalgic send-off (which is why Seinfeld did it first, of course). But the thing is, this episode revolved so much around the Seinfeld finale that it felt a bit expected and devoid of much surprise.\"\nThe final season of the comedy fell somewhat flat for David Remnick of The New Yorker, partly, he suggested, because of the real-life backdrop of the conflict in Israel.\n\"As I was watching, so",
    "Across Mexico, the US and Canada, inside a ribbon of land stretching 155 miles wide but more than 4,000 miles long, tens of millions of people craned their necks, tilted their heads to the sky and watched in wonder as the day turned to night.  \nWhat many saw on Monday was a phenomenon like no other: the Moon moving between the Earth and the Sun, extinguishing its light in a total solar eclipse.\nThe path of totality spanned the continent, beginning over the warm sands of a Mexican beach town and darkening the skies above the crashing waters of Niagara Falls before ending its journey on the shores of Canada's Newfoundland. \nIt left a sense of awe in its wake, a reminder of our planet's place in the universe.  \nThe eclipse was first seen around Mazatl\u00e1n, Mexico, on the country's western shores at 11:07 local time (18:07 GMT). \nAt first, the Moon's outer edge seemed to just be touching the Sun. Then it devoured more and more until cheers erupted as all finally went dark - save for the silvery glow of the \"corona\" effect of the Sun around the Moon's outline. \nA thousand miles away in Dallas, Texas, 11-year-old Ady Walton-King was waiting, weeks of pent-up excitement ready to burst.\nShe had learned all about the eclipse in her fifth-grade class at Dallas Academy and on Monday morning she laced up her shoes and tucked four pairs of eclipse glasses into her pink purse - one for herself, one for each parent and one for her little sister, Abigail. \nJust before it started, Ady sat down beside her dad, Ryan, on a school field in central Dallas and lifted her gaze upward. \nAnd then it happened.\nIt all felt slow, she said, as she described the Texas afternoon turning dark. \"It looked like the Moon was biting the Sun, but without the teeth marks.\"\nClouds slid in and out, occasionally blocking the eclipse from view until the Sun had vanished, nothing left but little flares of light around the Moon. \n\"I didn't think it would be like that,\" Ady said. \"It was really dark out. I thought it would be like evening dark, but it was pretty close to pitch black.\"\nThe temperature dropped suddenly and, just as she had been taught, animals fell silent. \n\"As it started to get lighter the crickets were there, and the birds started singing. It was really crazy,\" she said. \"I'm sad it's over.\" \nFrom there, the eclipse moved on, carving its path north-east through the United States. \nFor some, the solar phenomenon was marked by a personal milestone, with hundreds of Americans joining one of several mass wedding events dotted across the path of totality. \nIn Russellville, Arkansas, 300 couples from across the country signed up, saying \"I do\" just before the sky went black. As the sky brightened, the group cut wedding cakes and danced - all part of the aptly named Total Eclipse of the Heart festival.  \nFollowing the Moon one state over, in Ellsinore, Missouri, was amateur astronomer Darcy Howard, who had driven from her home in central Arkansas to be sure bad weather didn't block her view. \nShe had seen many eclipses before today, two totals, one annular and two partials. \"Each one has its own fingerprint,\" she said. \nTotality today, at around 13:56 local time (18:56 GMT) brought an \"eerie twilight\", Ms Howard said, with dusky colours dotted all along the horizon. The corona was nearly as bright as a full moon. \"The sense of other-worldliness was all around,\" she said. \nThe 70-year-old has loved the cosmos since her childhood, since her father showed her the Big Dipper, the North Star and the Milky Way, and bought her her first telescope. \n\"I was hooked,\" she said. \"I can look through a telescope and see Jupiter\u2026 I can see Saturn. And when I see that in space, I know all is right with the world.\"\nBy 15:13 local time (20:13 GMT), the total eclipse had plunged the midwestern state of Ohio into darkness. \nIn Cleveland, where eclipse-watchers were graced by clear skies, the Sun's corona was clearly visible, a brilliant halo framing the Moon. \nThe stars came out in the middle of the day, a sight met with cheers and fireworks, a mid-April New Years Eve. \nMany big American cities were not lucky enough to be on the path of totality - but the spectacles were still awe-inspiring. In New York, hundreds of people crowded on to the viewing platform of the Edge skyscraper in Manhattan to see what they could see.\nThey did not leave disappointed as the sun shrank to a crescent-like sliver of light that cast an unearthly pale gloom over the city. \nTourists had crowded along both sides of the border at Niagara Falls, where the eclipse path crossed from the US into Canada. \nHere, the weather offered a formidable challenge, with thick grey clouds mostly obscuring the sky from view. \nBut just in time for totality - to the audible delight of the crowd - the clouds parted to reveal the black-hole Sun. \nNearby, on a Niagara City Cruise, 309 people celebrated by record-breaking - dressing up as the Sun to break the Guinness World Record for \"Largest gathering of peop",
    "An extremely rare blind, hairy mole has been spotted and photographed in the Australian outback.\nThe northern marsupial mole, or kakarratul, lives in one of the most remote parts of the nation and is so elusive that authorities don't even know how many there are.\nThe palm-sized creatures have silky golden locks, no eyes, a stumpy tail and flipper-like hands. \nSightings of marsupial moles usually occur only a few times each decade.\nThis mole was stumbled upon by Kanyirninpa Jukurrpa Martu rangers - Aboriginal traditional owners who use cultural and local knowledge to look after their land - while they were working in the Great Sandy Desert, which is about 1,500km (932 miles) from Perth.\nThe creatures are so uncommon that their existence remains a mystery to most people, says desert wildlife expert Gareth Catt.\n\"[I know] somebody who spotted one but didn't know what it was - they thought it was a baby guinea pig,\" he tells the BBC.\nThe burrowing animals live within sand dunes in isolated deserts and spend very little time on the surface.\n\"[They] almost swim through the sand, so the main survey technique for them is to dig trenches and channels to look for their holes.\"\nVery little is known about the cryptic creature, which is why this sighting - the second in six months - is so exciting.\nPeople often think \"there isn't a lot of life in the desert\", Mr Catt says, but it is full of unique animals. From bilbies with their giant heat-releasing ears to great thorny devils - which use their spikes to channel water into their mouths - many have developed quirks which help them cope in the harsh environment.\n\"A lot of wildlife in a desert if you spotted it out of context, and you didn't know what it was, it would look very unusual,\" he says.\nMany of these animals are under-researched, Mr Catt says, and further study of them is essential for ensuring their conservation in the face of climate change.\n\"At the most extreme ends of the environment, it becomes really obvious when things change - that's what we're seeing in the desert.\"\n\"So that does put extra pressure on animals which are really living at the limits.\"",
    "Every year, the Indian Premier League (IPL), the world's richest cricket tournament, unveils rich talents.\nOnly twice though has there been awed chatter about a young Indian pace bowler because of their exceptional speed.\nUmran Malik from Indian-administered Kashmir created a storm three years ago. In IPL 2024, it's Mayank Yadav who is turning heads almost as quickly as he's turning up the dial on speed guns. \nThe 21-year-old lanky bowler from Delhi made his IPL debut for Lucknow Super Giants against Punjab Kings in March and set pulses racing with a terrific spell of fast bowling. He bowled a delivery at 155.8 km/h (96 mph) and won the man-of-the-match award on debut.\nIn the next game Yadav went one better with a 156.7 km/h (96 mph) scorcher - the season's quickest delivery so far - and a second successive man-of-the-match award against Royal Challengers Bangalore, an IPL first for a debutant. He picked up six wickets for 41 runs across the two matches.\nYadav's performance prompted Ian Bishop, commentator and former West Indies bowler, to describe him as a \"child of the wind\". \nDale Steyn, one of the greatest fast bowlers in history, and who Yadav described as his only idol, said on Twitter: \"Mayank Yadav where have you been hiding!\" In a tweet after his second game, Steyn simply wrote: \"That's a serious ball! #PACE\".\nFormer Australia player Tom Moody felt Yadav was \"definitely in the conversation\" to make India's squad for the T20 World Cup that will follow the IPL. \nWhat prompted the normally measured and seasoned experts to gush about Yadav after he had played only two matches? \nFor one, pace. Others have also topped 150 km/h in this IPL, but none as consistently as Yadav, or with quite the same ferocious effect. \nBut pace alone is seldom enough at the top level. What made Yadav stand out was his control. He hasn't yet bowled a single extra in the IPL. He has varied his lengths without pace being affected. And then there's the quality of batters snared, and the manner of their dismissals.\nAgainst Punjab he accounted for Jonny Bairstow, one of the more accomplished players of fast bowling, by hurrying him on the pull shot, a sure-fire indicator of how quick he was. \nHe went even better against Bangalore, similarly dismissing Glenn Maxwell, one of the best T20 bats in the world. \nHe then beat another Australian star, Cameron Green, for sheer pace when uprooting his off-stump. Green is no stranger to fast bowling. Here, he stood frozen at the crease, bat hanging loosely, a tell tale sign of a batter anticipating a short delivery and belatedly reacting to one that wasn't.\n\"He has some real extra speed that you don't really see a lot of around world cricket at the moment,\" Maxwell told ESPN, comparing Yadav to ex-Australia bowler Shaun Tait at his peak.\nFast bowlers commonly accept that the faster they bowl, the harder it becomes to maintain control. Tait and Malik have both faced that. So far, Yadav has defied the stereotype. \nOther potential pitfalls await though. \nSeveral Indian pacers have arrived on the scene as tearaway quicks, only to settle into the \"medium-fast\" category as the years go by. \nThen there's the constant risk of injury that comes with repeatedly executing the physically demanding action of fast bowling over extended periods.\nAfter his first two games, Yadav encountered the looming threat of injury in his third match against Gujarat Titans.\nHe bowled just one over, hitting around 140 km/h, fast for most bowlers but below Yadav's usual standard. Then he left the field with a side strain.\nTeam-mates said that Yadav seemed fine and there wasn't much cause to worry. Even if he recovers quickly, this incident offers insight into the pressures of fast bowling and its impact on speed. Yadav has already contended with the issue - he missed the IPL last year due to injury.\nYadav's journey started when his father, a police vehicle siren seller, enrolled him at Delhi's renowned Sonnet Cricket Club. His pace caught the attention of former India cricketer Vijay Dahiya, then coaching Uttar Pradesh, during a net session at a domestic tournament.\nDahiya, who was also assistant coach with LSG, called up Gautam Gambhir, then the LSG team mentor, and said Yadav had to be signed. LSG bought Yadav for his base price of two million rupees in the IPL 2022 auction, but they didn't play him the first year because he didn't have enough \"bowling miles\" in his legs. But they never doubted his ability.\nIt's still early days for Yadav. Many pitfalls have to be navigated. \nThe case of Malik is a reminder of how difficult the journey is. Malik played 10 ODIs and 8 T20Is for India in 2022 and 2023, but cannot currently command a guaranteed place in the first XI of his franchise, Sunrisers Hyderabad. \nBut if Yadav can stay fit, and continue to grow as a bowler, life will happen for him at 150km/h too.",
    "An executive from cryptocurrency firm Binance has pleaded not guilty to money laundering charges in a Nigerian court.\nUS citizen Tigran Gambaryan was arrested in February, along with his colleague Nadeem Anjarwalla, a British-Kenyan dual national.\nTheir detention came as Nigeria accused Binance of being behind the country's economic turmoil.\nTwo weeks ago Mr Anjarwalla escaped from custody and his whereabouts are unknown.\nOn Monday, Mr Gambaryan rejected five counts of money laundering filed against him by Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\nAfter the hearing, he was transferred to Kuje Correctional Centre, a prison in the capital, Abuja. The facility has in the past held inmates ranging from jihadists to politicians.\nMr Gambaryan and Mr Anjarwalla had previously been detained in an unknown location.\nIn a statement released after Monday's hearing, Mr Gambaryan's wife, Yuki, said: \"I am beyond heartbroken that my innocent husband is being sent to a prison that houses known terrorists and murderers... it is beyond unacceptable that this is how they are treating a completely innocent man.\" \nA Binance spokesperson said the charges against Mr Gambaryan were \"meritless\".\nThey told the BBC: \"We are deeply disappointed that Tigran Gambaryan, who has no decision-making power in the company, continues to be detained.\" \nThe EFCC had accused Binance - understood to be one of the most popular cryptocurrency platforms in Nigeria - along with Mr Gambaryan and Mr Anjarwalla, of laundering $35.4m (\u00a328m).\nIn February, Mr Gambarayan, who is in charge of financial crime compliance at Binance, and Mr Anjarwalla, who is Binance's Africa Regional Manager, were detained after arriving in Nigeria for meetings to discuss the platform's operations in the country.\nBinance was later that week ordered to pay a fine of $10bn (\u00a38bn).\nThe government accused it of currency speculation and fixing exchange rates, leading to the free-fall of the local currency, the naira.  \nThe weakening of the naira, alongside food inflation and the soaring cost of living, has sparked an economic crisis in Nigeria.\nBinance is not alone - Nigeria's authorities have been clamping down on cryptocurrency platforms in general over allegations they are being used for money laundering and financing terrorism.\nAs well as money laundering charges, Binance and the two executives also face four counts of tax evasion, filed by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS).\nAfter Mr Anjarwalla fled the country, Nigerian authorities said he had escaped with a \"smuggled passport\", but a family source said he had left by \"by lawful means\".\nNigeria said it was \"working with Interpol for an international arrest warrant on the suspect\".\nAs of Monday, Mr Anjarwalla was not on Interpol's red notice list for \"internationally wanted fugitives\".",
    "Donald Trump has said decisions about abortion rights should be left to the states, releasing a statement on the contentious election issue on Monday.\nMany in his Republican Party had wanted him to back a nationwide ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\nBut Mr Trump said policies should be set by individual states - as they have been since the Supreme Court overturned the Roe v Wade decision in 2022.\nSince then, abortion has emerged as a galvanising issue for many voters.\nWith several states moving to tighten restrictions, voters have thrown their support behind abortion rights in swing states like Michigan and even in deep-red states like Kentucky.\nThe former president's comments on Monday morning drew criticism from both liberals and conservatives.\nIn his video, Mr Trump declared: \"My view is now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint; the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both.\"\nMr Trump also said he was \"proudly the person responsible\" for the change brought about by the US Supreme Court two years ago, when it overturned the longstanding Roe v Wade decision that a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy was protected by the US constitution.\nIn 2016, Mr Trump campaigned on appointing justices who would overturn Roe v Wade - and went on to put three conservatives on the court during his presidency.\nIn his statement, he acknowledged this would create a piecemeal situation: \"Many states will be different. Many will have a different number of weeks or some will have more conservative than others. \nBut he said it came down to \"the will of the people\", adding: \"You must follow your heart or in many cases, your religion or your faith.\" \nMr Trump added that he was in favour of exceptions when rape or incest were involved, or the life of the mother was in danger. \nHe also reiterated that he was in favour of fertility treatments including in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), a reference to a recent Alabama court ruling that opened a new front in the battle over reproductive rights.\nThe former president also falsely claimed that national Democratic leaders have a \"radical\" abortion position that includes \"execution after birth\".\nMr Trump, who is all but certain to be the Republican presidential candidate, acknowledged that the abortion issue has caused major problems for his party in elections held since 2022. \nVoters angry at the Supreme Court decision have showed up at the polls to support Democratic candidates, as well as ballot measures intended to preserve access to abortion.\nDemocrats have seized on the issue as a way to help re-elect Mr Biden in November, and the Biden campaign on Monday swiftly shared Mr Trump's admission he was proud to have ended Roe.\nThe president also sent out a lengthy response to the Trump video, saying his political rival was \"scrambling\".\n\"Having created the chaos of overturning Roe, he's trying to say, 'Oh, never mind. Don't punish me for that. I just want to win,'\" Mr Biden wrote.\nHe also alleged that Mr Trump would sign off on a federal abortion ban proposed by congressional Republicans if he returned to the White House.\nMr Biden has made universal access to abortion a central campaign issue and pledged that he will work to create a federal law based on the Roe decision.\nOn Monday, his re-election campaign released a campaign advert featuring a Texas woman who almost died when she developed an infection after being denied an abortion for a pregnancy doctors said was unviable.\nOther Democrats also seized on Mr Trump's statement, with Washington state's Senator Patty Murray saying it \"changes nothing\".\n\"This is a man who bragged about overturning Roe, supports draconian abortion bans & said women should be punished for seeking care,\" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\"Don't be fooled: we know a second Trump admin would do everything they could to ban abortion nationwide.\"\nConservative reaction to Mr Trump's message has been largely negative, with his former Vice-President Mike Pence calling it \"a slap in the face to the millions of pro-life Americans who voted for him\".\nSome argued abortion policy should be set by the federal government, while others objected to Mr Trump's failure to take a stand on the number of weeks at which he would support a ban.\nEarlier, Mr Trump had reportedly signalled support for a 15-week limit in private conversations with allies.\nSouth Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a key Trump ally who has proposed a 15-week abortion ban, said he \"respectfully [disagrees]\" that abortion should be decided by individual states.\n\"The pro-life movement has always been about the wellbeing of the unborn child - not geography,\" he wrote on X.\nKristan Hawkins, the head of the Students for Life of America, reaffirmed her support for the former president but added there was \"some work to do to educate President Trump\" on the issue.\nWhile conservative states have moved to limit abortion access over the last two years, othe",
    "People with long Covid have evidence of continuing inflammation in their blood, which could help understanding of the condition and how it may be treated, a UK study suggests.\nIt found the presence of certain proteins increased the risk of specific symptoms, such as fatigue, in people sick enough to need hospital treatment.\nIt is unclear whether milder cases of Covid have the same effect on the body.\nA test remains a long way off - but the findings may prompt future trials.\nLong Covid - symptoms lasting at least 12 weeks after a Covid infection - is thought to have affected millions of people around the world.\nSome of the most common symptoms are:\nOthers can include:\nThe chances of developing long-term symptoms do not seem linked to how ill people were when first infected - many people who had mild symptoms say they are affected.\nThe UK's largest long Covid study, led by Imperial College London, followed up 650 hospital patients with severe Covid.\nSix months later, 426 said they still had at least one long Covid symptom while 233 had completely recovered.\nAnd those with long Covid showed evidence of a continuing and active pattern of inflammatory proteins in their blood.\nThe researchers said the presence of these chemicals in the blood, which are usually a sign of the body fighting off infection, was unusual when the initial infection occurred so long before.\nTracy Evans, 59, from Bridlington, N Yorks, worked as a care assistant and support worker before catching Covid in early 2021.\nShe spent three months in hospital and six weeks in intensive care, and still finds it traumatic to think of that time.\n\"I was so close to death, because they were going to turn me off,\" she says. \nTracy has been unable to work since because of continuing symptoms, including severe fatigue and brain fog. \n\"Any exertion, I am breathless,\" she says.\n\"I'm tired just having a shower or getting dressed.  I can't make a bed without people thinking I've run a marathon.  \n\"I'm in pain all the time - constantly in pain.\" \nWhen Tracy wrote down her symptoms, for a doctor, they filled an A4 piece of paper. \n\"Sometimes with the brain fog, it feels like you've got dementia,\" she says.\n\"It's not a life - it's an existence.\"\nThe researchers behind the study, in Nature Immunology, also found some proteins in the blood of those with long Covid could be linked to their specific symptoms.\nFor example, those with gastrointestinal symptoms had increased levels of a marker called SCG3, previously linked to impaired communication between the gut and the brain. \nThis could help divide long Covid patients into different sub-groups and be useful for designing clinical trials, especially for treatments targeting immune responses and inflammation, the researchers said.\nImperial College London clinical-research fellow Dr Felicity Liew said the findings suggested inflammation \"could be a common feature of long Covid after hospitalisation, regardless of symptom type\".\nAnd this may open the door to existing drugs being tried against long Covid, such as those for rheumatoid arthritis, an auto-immune condition causing inflammation of the joints.\nLead research Prof Peter Openshaw said: \"This work provides strong evidence that long Covid is caused by post-viral inflammation but shows layers of complexity. \n\"We hope that our work opens the way to the development of specific tests and treatments for the various types of long Covid and believe that a 'one size fits all' approach to treatment may not work.\"\nThe researchers will continue to look for the signs of inflammation as the symptoms improve and disappear, as they do for most people with long Covid.\nDr Liew said she hoped the study would also lead to identification of new treatments for the long-lasting symptoms of other illnesses found to affect people in the same way.\nUniversity of Edinburgh honorary professor of immunology and infectious disease Prof Eleanor Riley said the data \"should usher in a series of clinical trials for treatment of long Covid\" using several licensed drugs targeting inflammation.  \nShe said the study findings opened up new avenues for the investigation of the very poorly understood myalgic encephalomyelitis, or chronic fatigue syndrome, (ME/CFS), because many of the symptoms appeared to overlap.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \"Long Covid can have a debilitating impact on people's physical and mental health, that's why we have backed our world-leading scientists with over \u00a350 million to better understand it and identify new treatments, including this government-funded study.\"",

    "A 74-year-old politician with \"critical\" health issues is in jail as Togolese authorities crack down on dissent, an spokesperson for the nation's opposition coalition says.\nTensions heightened after Togo's parliament passed a bill proposing huge changes to the political system.\nElections scheduled for 20 April were later postponed.\nFive opposition activists were arrested for campaigning against the reforms, a DMK coalition spokesperson said.\nUnder the bill passed on 25 March, the president of the West African nation would become a symbolic position selected by parliament, rather than being directly elected.\nExecutive power would instead go to a prime minister.\nOpposition parties have rejected the reform, arguing that it could allow President Faure Gnassingb\u00e9 to stay in power.\nHe succeeded his father, Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma, who died in 2005 after ruling the country with an iron fist for 38 years.\nMembers of the DMK (Dynamique Monseigneur Kpodzro) were arrested last week after publicly campaigning against the reform, spokesperson Ben Djagba told the BBC.\nHe said there were concerns about the health of Dovi Amouzou, a 74-year-old politician, who is among the five detainees.\n\"Her heart conditions are worrisome as she has ongoing heart-related issues and is under constant care by her physician. Since her detention, she no longer has access to her doctor,\" Mr Djagba said.\nThe five politicians have been held on \"public order charges\", their lawyer, Elom Kpade, was quoted as saying by press agency AFP.\nFrench broadcaster RFI reported that the five have been taken to the civil prison in the capital, Lom\u00e9.\nPublic prosecutor Talaka Mawama said an investigation had been opened into \"individuals caught distributing leaflets and chanting slogans inciting popular revolt\" during an unauthorised protest.\nMr Djagba told the BBC that these were \"bogus allegations\".\nNo new date has been given for the elections.\nThe Conference of Togolese Catholic bishops has urged President Gnassingb\u00e9 not to sign the constitutional changes into law, citing the need for \"broad consultation and a more inclusive national debate\".\nOpposition parties boycotted Togo's previous elections and are poorly represented in Togo's parliament.\nAs a result, the constitution change was approved almost unanimously - with only one legislator voting against and one other abstaining.\nThe presidency said on Wednesday that the delay was to allow for \"consultations\" over the contested constitutional changes.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story wrongly said those arrested were lawmakers.",
    "In February US company LanzaJet, which produces sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from ethanol, announced that it intended to build a second, larger plant on US soil.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was a \"big influence\", says Jimmy Samartzis, its chief executive.\nThe second plant would add to its facility in Soperton, Georgia - the world's first commercial scale ethanol-to-SAF plant.\n\"We have a global landscape that we are pursuing\u2026[but] we have doubled down on building here in the United States because of the tax credits in the IRA, and because of the overall support system that the US government has put in place.\" \nSigned into law by President Biden in August 2022, the IRA, along with the so-called Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) enacted in November 2021, are intended, amongst other things, to funnel billions of federal dollars into developing clean energy. \nThe aim is to lower greenhouse gas emissions, and incentivise private investment, to encourage the growth of green industries and jobs: a new foundation for the US economy.\nWith a 10-year lifespan, and a cost originally estimated at $391bn (\u00a3310bn) but now predicted to reach over $1tn - the final figure is unknown - the IRA offers new and juicer tax credits, as well as loans and loan guarantees for the deployment of emissions reducing technology.\nThe tax credits are available to companies for either domestically producing clean energy, or domestically manufacturing the equipment needed for the energy transition, including electric vehicles (EVs) and batteries.\nConsumers can also receive tax credits, for example for buying an EV or installing a heat pump. The tax credit for SAF producers like LanzaJet is new in the IRA and, offers between $1.25 to $1.75 per gallon of SAF (though it only lasts five years).\nComplementary is the BIL, which runs for five years and provides direct investment largely in the form of government grants for research and development and capital projects. Under the BIL, about $77bn (\u00a361bn) will go to clean energy technology projects, according to the Brookings Institution which monitors the law. \nOne company to benefit so far is EV battery recycling company Ascend Elements.\nIt has won BIL grants totalling $480m (\u00a3380m), which it is matching a similar amount in private investment to build its second commercial facility in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. \n\"[The IRA and BIL] are massive investments\u2026 larger than the infrastructure related provisions in the New Deal,\" says Adie Tromer from the Brookings. \"There is a clear sense that America has become more serious about transitioning to a cleaner economy.\"\nWhile rules for some tax credits are still being finalized, tens of billions in actual public spending is flowing into the economy, says Trevor Houser at the Rhodium Group, an independent research provider. Rhodium, together with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, runs the Clean Investment Monitor (CIM) to track US clean technology investments.\nAccording to recently updated CIM data, in the 2023 fiscal year, the federal government invested approximately $34bn (\u00a327bn) into clean energy, the vast majority through tax credits.\nThe extent to which the policy instruments are so far spurring not just announcements - of which there are plenty - but real extra private investment is harder to know: clean energy investment has been on a general upward trend anyway and the IRA hasn't been around long. But experts believe it is rising.\nTotal clean energy investment in the US in the 2023 calendar year including from both private and government sources reached a record $239bn (\u00a3190bn), up 38% from 2022 according to the CIM data.\nClean energy investment in the US, as a share of total private investment, rose from 3.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 5% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nThe IRA has had two main positive effects thus far, says Mr Houser. \nIt has \"supercharged\" private investment in more mature technologies which were already growing very rapidly like solar, EVs and batteries. \nIt has also, combined with the BIL, led to a \"dramatic growth\" in investment in emerging climate technologies like clean hydrogen, carbon dioxide capture and removal and SAF. While the total magnitude of those investments are still relatively small compared to the more mature technologies, \"the IRA fundamentally changed the economics\" says Mr Houser.\nBut the IRA is failing to reach some parts of the green economy: so far it hasn't lifted investment in more mature technologies which have been falling like wind and heat pumps, though Mr Houser notes things may have fallen further without the IRA.\nOn the industry's mind is the fate of the laws, particularly the longer-to-run IRA, should there be a change of government in the US November elections. \nRepealing or amending the IRA (or BIL) would require Republican control of the Presidency, Senate and House - though wholesale repeal would likely face meaningful opposition from within. The rub is many of the projec",
    "The state pension has risen by 8.5% because of a measure known as the triple lock.\nIt means that pensioners receive an amount designed to keep up with rising prices and wages.\nThe state pension is a payment made every four weeks by the government, to people who have reached the qualifying age and have paid enough National Insurance contributions.\nThis year, the link to earnings under the triple lock meant an increase of 8.5% from 8 April, making it worth:\nThis is a rise from:\nUnder the triple lock system, the state pension increases each April in line with whichever of these three measures is highest:\nThe triple lock was introduced by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2010. \nIt was designed to ensure the value of the state pension was not overtaken by the increase in the cost of living or the working population's income. \nIn March, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the Conservatives would continue the triple-lock system, if they won the next general election.\nLabour also said it was \"committed to retaining\" the triple lock.\nThe triple lock was temporarily suspended after the Covid pandemic distorted average wage figures, but later restored. \nMore than 12 million people currently receive the state pension.\nMen and women born between 6 October, 1954 and 5 April, 1960 start receiving their pension at the age of 66. \nBut for people born after this date, the state pension age is increasing:\nThere was speculation in the run-up to the 2023 Budget that the second increase would be brought forward, potentially to the late 2030s. \nHowever, in March 2023, the government said it had no plans to change the timetable and indicated a decision was expected in 2026, after the next general election.\nIn February 2024, the International Longevity Centre UK think tank published a report suggesting that the state pension age may need to increase more quickly than the current schedule. \nThe organisation tracks the impact of growing life expectancy and falling birth rates. \nIt argues that the UK and other countries with ageing populations will have to increase their state pension age to 71 by 2050, to keep the cost sustainable.\nThe state pension cost \u00a3110.5bn in 2022-2023, just under half the total amount the government spends on benefits.\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility thinks this will grow to \u00a3124bn in 2023-2024.\nDepending on their overall income, those above retirement age may also be entitled to Pension Credit in addition to the basic state pension. \nPension Credit tops up your weekly income to:\nIf your income is already above those limits, you might still be eligible if you have a disability or care for someone.\nAnyone who qualifies for Pension Credit may also be entitled to other financial support, including cost-of-living payments, housing benefit, a reduction in council tax, or help with heating costs through the Warm Home Discount Scheme. \nPeople born before 25 September 1957 are also entitled to the annual winter fuel payment.",
    "People across North America will be treated to the view of a lifetime later on Monday when a total solar eclipse spans across the continent, from Mexico to the very eastern tip of Canada. \nHundreds of events are already being planned for eclipse watchers to step outside, look into the sky and catch this rare, astronomical phenomenon. \nIf you want to be part of the fun, below is our comprehensive guide to where and how to see the eclipse.\nA solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Earth or the Sun, blocking some or all of the Sun's rays from reaching the Earth. \nThe phenomenon is a cosmic event, requiring the Sun, the Moon and the Earth to be in just the right alignment for the Moon to cast a shadow on our planet.\nWhen this happens, the Moon casts two types of shadows. \nOne results in a partial solar eclipse, which covers only part of the Sun. \nThe other - and arguably the most spectacular - is called a total solar eclipse where the Sun is entirely covered by the Moon, save for a visible ring of light in the sky.\nSolar eclipses themselves are not that rare - in fact, there are about two to four that occur per year. \nBut the likelihood of seeing a total solar eclipse is much rarer. The Earth is quite big, and most of it is covered by oceans. More often than not, humans don't get to see it in person.\nIn fact, this is the first solar eclipse this century to be visible in all three North American countries - the US, Canada and Mexico - making this upcoming one likely the only one that most of us will get to see in our lifetimes.\nThe timing of the eclipse will depend on where you are located.\nThe path of totality - meaning where the total solar eclipse will be fully visible - starts at around 11:07 local time in Mazatl\u00e1n, Mexico, on the Pacific coast. \nAll in all, the phenomenon itself will last two hours. For those in the Eastern time zone, the path of totality will enter continental North America shortly after 14:00 EDT (19:00 BST), and exit at 15:46. \nIt will then move northeast, over Texas, the southern parts of Oklahoma, Missouri and Illinois, before making its way to Ohio and along the US-Canada border. The path will end in the Canadian Atlantic province of Newfoundland.\nHere is a breakdown of when the total solar eclipse will occur in US and Canadian cities, all in local time:\nThe answer to this question, too, depends on where you are. \nAccording to Nasa, the total solar eclipse will span anywhere from one minute to four and a half minutes. \nFor people in the US, it will be longest at Radar Base, Texas, right on the US-Mexico border, where it will last a total of 4 minutes and 27 seconds. \nAmong Canadian cities, the total solar eclipse will be the longest in Sherbrooke, Quebec, where it will last 3 minutes and 26 seconds. \nAstronomers in the US and Canada have mapped out exactly where the path of totality will be. As long as you're on that path, you should be able to catch the total solar eclipse. \nThat path is 115 miles (183 km) wide, on average. Some big cities along it include Dallas, Indianapolis, Cleveland and Buffalo.\nNiagara Falls will also be a great spot to catch the total solar eclipse, whether you're on the Canadian or American side. \nFor Canadians, the path of totality includes Hamilton, Montreal and Gander. \nPeople close to the path will still be able to see the solar eclipse, albeit a partial one, and the percentage of the Sun covered by the Moon's shadow will depend on where you are. \nJan Cami, an astrophysicist at Western University in Canada and director of its Cronyn Observatory,  noted that people should also account for the weather. \nIf it happens to be cloudy in your city, that can hinder your visibility of the solar eclipse even if you are in the path of totality. \nSome areas look much better than others, as the latest forecast is for heavy clouds over large parts of the path of totality.\nIn Texas and neighbouring states, there are warnings from the US National Weather Service (NWS) of severe weather including rain, hail and possible tornadoes. \nSome of the cloudiest areas are those that will experience the eclipse first, including northern Mexico as well as Texas. San Antonio could be almost completely covered.\nBut the forecast improves further along the eclipse path, with southern Illinois and much of the Midwest expecting clear skies. Conditions should allow a \"decent viewing\" in parts of Arkansas, the NWS says.\nCloudy conditions may again obscure the view around the Great Lakes including Niagara Falls. \nThe best viewing conditions could be in New England. The sky cover looks \"favourable\" in Vermont and northern New York, according to the NWS office in Burlington.\nMeanwhile, the Canadian weather service is forecasting largely clear skies over Quebec.\nPartly cloudy conditions will not necessarily dampen the experience, particularly if the clouds are high and thin. No matter the weather, the sky will still dim considerably as the Moon's shadow travels across the Earth. \nT",
    "The first government inspection of a new prison has found illegal drugs are widely available and inmates are not suitably supported by staff.\nCategory C jail HMP Five Wells opened in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, in 2022 and is run by security firm G4S.\nHis Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) noted high levels of self-harm among prisoners and poor food.\nThe prison said it had put an action plan in place to address the concerns raised by inspectors.\nHMP Five Wells has capacity to house up to 1,687 prisoners with up to two years left on their sentences.\nIt was built on the site of the former HMP Wellingborough, which closed in 2012.\nThe HMIP report noted drugs remained a \"huge problem\" in the prison and random testing suggested about a third of all prisoners were active users. \nJust over half of inmates said it was \"easy\" to get hold of illegal drugs, against an average of 32% in other similar prisons.\nThe rate of self-harm incidents in the prison was also high and inspectors said not enough was being done to reduce them. \nThere had been 1,256 recorded incidents in the 12 months before the inspection took place, which the report concluded was \"very high\" compared with other establishments.\nIt also found staff lacked confidence in supervising prisoners and were not given sufficient support. \nHowever, the report also highlighted some positives, stating the general environment and living conditions were excellent, while access to amenities was reasonable.\nWriting in the report, chief inspector of prisons, Charlie Taylor, said: \"Opening a new prison is one of the toughest challenges in prison management and a first inspection is an important milestone in the life of an institution. It would be unrealistic to expect that all would be perfect.\n\"Our inspection notes the very real difficulties leaders have faced. Stronger governance, oversight and supervision, the building of staff confidence and capability, and a more active and purposeful regime should now be the focus.\"\nAn HMP Five Wells spokesperson said: \"We have put in place an action plan that addresses all HMIP's key priorities with a focus on recruitment, retention, addressing the ingress of drugs, governance and oversight.\n\"Inspectors said rates of violence and self-harm are falling and this downward trajectory has continued since the inspection.\n\"We are committed to developing a stronger and broader purposeful activity, skills and education programme to enhance employment opportunities for prisoners.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The origins of the silver used in 7th Century Anglo-Saxon pennies have been revealed after analysis of 49 coins.\nAnglo-Saxon England experienced a rapid surge in the use of silver coins between 660 and 750 AD, but historians had no \"hard evidence\" of its source.\nThey now know Byzantine bullion and a French silver mine were behind the increase, said the joint Cambridge and Oxford university study.\nProf Rory Naismith said it was \"such an exciting discovery\". \n\"I proposed Byzantine origins a decade ago but couldn't prove it,\" the Cambridge University professor of Early Medieval English History said.\n\"Now we have the first archaeometric confirmation that Byzantine silver was the dominant source behind the great 7th Century surge in minting and trade around the North Sea.\"\nAbout 7,000 silver pennies have been recorded from this time, compared to about the same number for the entire Anglo-Saxon period (5th Century to 1066).\nProf Naismith and his colleagues examined coins held by the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. They were minted in England, the Netherlands, Belgium and northern France.\nThe coins were first given trace element analysis and then analysed using a technique pioneered by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, which also participated in the research.\nA \"portable laser ablation\" was used, in which microscopic samples were collected onto Teflon filters for lead isotope analysis.\nThis established 29 coins from 660 to 750 AD were made from 3rd to 7th Century silver from the Byzantine Empire in the eastern Mediterranean. \nThe researchers, who have published their findings in Antiquity, believe the metal entered Western Europe decades before and was melted down in the late 7th Century \"when a king or lord urgently needed lots of cash\".\nThe study's lead author, Oxford University's Dr Jane Kershaw, said: \"This was quantitative easing, elites were liquidating resources and pouring more and more money into circulation.\"\nThe study's second major finding was that the silver used to mint the 750 to 820 AD coins was very different.

    "Eclipse watchers are keeping a close eye on the weather ahead of a solar eclipse that will plunge a wide strip of North America into daytime darkness on Monday. \nForecasters are predicting cloudy conditions in northern Mexico, Texas and parts of the Great Lakes region.\nBetter weather is expected in western Mexico and parts of the US Midwest.\nAnd some of the best viewing is likely to be under clear spring skies in New England and Canada.\nStarting in the Pacific Ocean, the eclipse will become visible on the coast of Mexico near the city of Mazatlan at about 11:07 local time (19:07 BST).\nThe shadow of the Moon will run across the Earth at a speed of 1,500 mph (2,400 km/h) - tracing a north-easterly arc through the states of Durango and Coahuila before casting parts of Texas, Arkansas and neighbouring states into darkness.\nAs the path crosses over the US Midwest, a phenomenon known as totality - when the Sun is completely obscured by the Moon - will cross over the cities of Indianapolis, Cleveland and Buffalo. \nAt around 15:18 Eastern (19:18 GMT) the eclipse will reach Niagara Falls, where a record crowd of up to a million people is expected to turn out to watch mist from the famous cataract turn a pinkish hue - provided the weather co-operates.\nThe shadow will continue to travel north east through the New England states and into Canada's Atlantic provinces before tracking into the Atlantic Ocean and ending at 20:55 BST.\nThe eclipse is the first this century to cross over all three North American countries. \nHere is a breakdown of when totality will occur in US and Canadian cities, all in local time:\nSpecial events, festivals and even mass weddings will take place in towns and cities across the path.\nNasa and its partner organisations are hosting more than 100 events, including gatherings where the eclipse will first be visible from land in Mazatlan, at the Cotton Bowl stadium in Dallas and at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Indiana.\nCrowds will fill a football stadium in Carbondale, Illinois, where the path of Monday's eclipse will intersect the path of the last solar eclipse to travel across the United States, in 2017.\nThe main variable for many viewers will be the weather down here on Earth. \nIn its latest eclipse forecast Sunday, the US National Weather Service warned of potential severe conditions including heavy rain, tornados and hail which may affect travel in Texas and nearby states. The view in San Antonio is expected to be almost entirely obscured by clouds.  \nHowever, cloudy conditions will not necessarily spoil the experience. No matter the weather, the sky will still dim considerably as the Moon's shadow travels across the Earth. \nThe Sun will be partially obscured even thousands of miles away from totality, but the most dramatic events will be experienced by those in the direct path. Some locations will experience totality for nearly four and a half minutes. \nThe Moon will completely cover the Sun, with only the corona - the star's bright outer atmosphere - visible. The temperature will fall and wind patterns and cloud formations could shift. Some animals will be tricked into thinking day has turned to night, and stars and planets might be visible in the sky. \nScientists will take advantage of the eclipse to perform experiments, launch rockets into the sky, observe animal behaviour and study the corona. \nAhead of the eclipse, authorities were reporting increased traffic and demand for places to stay from astronomy enthusiasts, some of whom planned their journeys months or years in advance. \nAccording to Nasa, 31.6 million people live along the path of totality, and millions more are expected to travel to catch a glimpse of the celestial event. \nNasa estimates that 215 million US adults - 88% of the population - either directly or electronically viewed the last North American solar eclipse in 2017. \nAt the Starry Night RV Resort in Fort Worth, Texas vehicles full of eclipse watchers were rolling in to set up camp ready for the big moment. \nOwner Lindsey Kuhn told the BBC: \"It's becoming quite a big deal, people have driven here from all over.\"\n\"I've been trying to explain to my daughter that it's going to get dark, she asked 'will we have to go to sleep?'\n\"We're going to be together, put on our glasses and take a selfie, it's once in a lifetime for us.\"\nExcept during the period of totality, special glasses are needed to view the partial stages of the eclipse. Experts advise that regular sunglasses won't work and looking at the sun, even through a camera or smartphone, can cause eye damage in seconds.\nSome schools are closed or have allowed students to be absent on Monday, while others have planned special viewing events.\nIf the weather does affect Monday's event, North American eclipse watchers will have a while to wait.

    "In political journalism you deal with lots of different kinds of stories - stories about policies, stories about ministerial rivalries, stories about geopolitics, stories about local politics. \nThen some stories are just plain weird, like the one that broke last week about the honeytrap targeting men in Westminster. There are still lots of unanswered questions about the case, which I hope to dig into in my job as the BBC's chief political correspondent. \nFor that reason, I should also be upfront that I was among the men targeted. \nIt started with a WhatsApp on a Sunday morning in March. Coming from a number I did not have saved in my phone, it read: \"Henry! Long time no speak - how're you doing? Miss seeing you around Westminster x.\"\nThe user's profile picture showed a man and a woman, both probably in their 20s, having dinner. I zoomed in on the photo as much as I could but recognised neither of them. \n\"V sorry,\" I replied. \"Who is this?\"\nThe response was instant. \"Haha it's Charlie! I used to work in Parliament and we swapped numbers after drinking one night.\"\nAnd then seconds later: \"I'd pretend to be offended but it was a while ago x.\"\nThis was pretty odd now. Yes, one way a journalist might make contacts in Westminster is to hang around the bars and pubs. But the point is to make contacts, not to fail to save their number and then forget them. And more obviously - why did Charlie keep leaving kisses at the end of their messages? \nI put my phone down and decided to leave it but my non-response left Charlie dissatisfied. A few minutes later they came back: \"Random Sunday message I know.\"\nAfter waiting a further six minutes for more from me, Charlie's apparent intentions became more clear. \"I'm going to guess you aren't still single - should I bow out gracefully? Lucky girl x.\"\nFrom pretty odd to very odd indeed. No thanks. I blocked Charlie, meaning they could not send me more messages. But the question of what exactly the brief exchange was all about nagged at me for the rest of the day. \nI flitted between thinking that a hostile state may have been attempting to entrap me - though it's hard not to have that thought without feeling instantly absurd and pompous - and rustling through my mental Filofax to make absolutely sure that I hadn't ever met this Charlie and given them the wrong end of the stick. \nWhat I now know, thanks to reporting by Politico, is that I was just one of at least a dozen men in political circles who received unsolicited WhatsApp messages along those lines. Some, including MPs, reportedly fared much worse than me. Rather than blocking the sender, they kept the conversation going long enough to be sent explicit images. Reportedly at least one person reciprocated.\nWilliam Wragg, a Conservative MP who I happen to have got to know fairly well as a professional contact over the years, came forward to admit that he had been caught up in the affair, saying he passed the personal phone numbers of colleagues to a man he met on a dating app who had \"compromising things\" on him.\nHarry Yorke, a journalist at the Sunday Times, has also said that he received flirtatious messages from Charlie. Others, anonymously, have said they received messages instead from a woman calling herself Abi, operating from a different phone number. \nUnlike any other cases I'm aware of, I was contacted by both. Because my brief Sunday morning exchange with Charlie was not the end of things. \nAlmost exactly 24 hours after Charlie's first message, another WhatsApp from an unknown number arrived in my inbox. This time the photo was a woman in front of a ruined abbey, her face artfully turned away from the camera.\n\"Are you in Westminster today? Monday drink? X.\" \nInstantly I was sure this was the same person as the day before. Charlie clearly was not an innocuous encounter I had forgotten, but one which never took place. \n\"Who is this?\" I replied. \n\"Abi Miller x.\"\nThey claimed to have previously been an intern at The Times, where I worked until last year. \n\"Always used to joke that you were the only fit one in the politics team.\"\nNever mind the unfair slight on my former colleagues - this was now getting quite sinister. I blocked the number, but by this point was feeling much more rattled than the day before. \nWas this to be a daily occurrence? I was confident I was being scammed in some way but the idiomatic language and contextual knowledge of Westminster was unsettling. \nFlustered, I realised I didn't even know what blocking somebody on WhatsApp meant. Did they know they had been blocked? Were they sending messages into a void? After 40 minutes of chewing it over in my head, I decided to unblock Abi to see if WhatsApp showed me any messages she had sent in the meantime. \nThat was probably a mistake. I didn't get any messages Abi might have sent when blocked, but the act of unblocking did show Abi that I was online. She pounced instantly: \"Did you block and unblock me?\" \n\"What do you want?\" I replied. \n\"I messaged to se",
    "The origins of the silver used in 7th Century Anglo-Saxon pennies have been revealed after analysis of 49 coins.\nAnglo-Saxon England experienced a rapid surge in the use of silver coins between 660 and 750 AD, but historians had no \"hard evidence\" of its source.\nThey now know Byzantine bullion and a French silver mine were behind the increase, said the joint Cambridge and Oxford university study.\nProf Rory Naismith said it was \"such an exciting discovery\". \n\"I proposed Byzantine origins a decade ago but couldn't prove it,\" the Cambridge University professor of Early Medieval English History said.\n\"Now we have the first archaeometric confirmation that Byzantine silver was the dominant source behind the great 7th Century surge in minting and trade around the North Sea.\"\nAbout 7,000 silver pennies have been recorded from this time, compared to about the same number for the entire Anglo-Saxon period (5th Century to 1066).\nProf Naismith and his colleagues examined coins held by the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. They were minted in England, the Netherlands, Belgium and northern France.\nThe coins were first given trace element analysis and then analysed using a technique pioneered by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, which also participated in the research.\nA \"portable laser ablation\" was used, in which microscopic samples were collected onto Teflon filters for lead isotope analysis.\nThis established 29 coins from 660 to 750 AD were made from 3rd to 7th Century silver from the Byzantine Empire in the eastern Mediterranean. \nThe researchers, who have published their findings in Antiquity, believe the metal entered Western Europe decades before and was melted down in the late 7th Century \"when a king or lord urgently needed lots of cash\".\nThe study's lead author, Oxford University's Dr Jane Kershaw, said: \"This was quantitative easing, elites were liquidating resources and pouring more and more money into circulation.\"\nThe study's second major finding was that the silver used to mint the 750 to 820 AD coins was very different. It was mined in Melle in Francia, part of modern day western France.\nIt argues the emperor Charlemagne (768-814 AD) drove this very sudden and widespread surge in Melle silver.\nThe authors said this also gives a new context to the emperor's \"delicate diplomatic relations\" with Offa of Mercia (757-796 AD) in England.\nProf Naismith has no doubt that people in England would have been very aware that their silver was coming from Francia and that they depended on it. \n\"[Offa] remained one of Europe's most powerful figures who was outside Charlemagne's control.

    "A partial eclipse was seen by very few people in the UK, with most of the country missing the chance to see the phenomenon because of cloud cover. \nA solar eclipse - when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, obscuring the view of the Sun from Earth - took place on Monday.\nTens of millions of people in the US gathered to view the total eclipse.\nIn the UK, clear skies in northern and western Scotland meant some could see the Moon obscure part of the Sun.\nBBC Weather presenter Simon King said there was too much cloud to see much, or any, of the partial eclipse - which would have otherwise been visible from western parts of the UK from 19:55 BST until sunset.\n\"However, there was always a chance in northern and western Scotland of some clearer spells and that's where at least a couple of our BBC Weather Watchers were able to capture a partial eclipse,\" he said.\nBBC Weather Watcher Elizabeth managed to photograph the Moon blocking part of the Sun as it was setting in Gairloch, in the Highlands of Scotland, while fellow Weather Watcher Callum P captured the phenomenon over the Orkney Islands. \nMet Office forecaster Simon Partridge added: \"The chances are most of England and Wales probably wouldn't have seen it anyway.\"\nOn social media, Britons shared pictures of solid grey clouds overhead, with some joking and calling the view \"breathtaking\" and \"beautiful\".\nOne man called Lewis, based in Castlederg, County Tyrone, told the BBC he was in a favourable spot to see the partial eclipse but there was \"naff all to be seen\".\n\"We took a quick drive to some higher ground after work to make the most of the cosmic event,\" he said. \"It's safe to say we saw an utterly jaw-dropping set of cloud formations.\"\nBut Prof Don Pollacco, from the department of physics at the University of Warwick who travelled to Texas to view it, said British spectators did not miss much because \"partial eclipses are really boring\" anyway.\n\"I wouldn't bother watching any partial eclipses - I think they're a waste of time,\" he said.\nHe described total eclipses as \"very magical\", adding: \"I'm a scientist, and I'm saying it's magical.\"\nIn Mexico, the US and Canada, many were treated to a truly breathtaking display of the Sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, which is usually obscured by its own intense glare.\nPeople gathered in groups, welcoming the moment with choruses of claps and gasps.\nLouis Boulet, who watched the eclipse from the other Cornwall in eastern Canada, described it as \"a mixture of cosmic beauty and terror\".\nThe next total solar eclipse visible from the UK will not be for another six decades, in 2090. The last one was in 1999.\nHowever, a near total eclipse is expected in 2026, with about 90% of the Sun being obscured by the Moon. ",

    "The state pension has risen by 8.5% because of a measure known as the triple lock.\nIt means that pensioners receive an amount designed to keep up with rising prices and wages.\nThe state pension is a payment made every four weeks by the government, to people who have reached the qualifying age and have paid enough National Insurance contributions.\nThis year, the link to earnings under the triple lock meant an increase of 8.5% from 8 April, making it worth:\nThis is a rise from:\nUnder the triple lock system, the state pension increases each April in line with whichever of these three measures is highest:\nThe triple lock was introduced by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2010. \nIt was designed to ensure the value of the state pension was not overtaken by the increase in the cost of living or the working population's income. \nIn March, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the Conservatives would continue the triple-lock system, if they won the next general election.\nLabour also said it was \"committed to retaining\" the triple lock.\nThe triple lock was temporarily suspended after the Covid pandemic distorted average wage figures, but later restored. \nMore than 12 million people currently receive the state pension.\nMen and women born between 6 October, 1954 and 5 April, 1960 start receiving their pension at the age of 66. \nBut for people born after this date, the state pension age is increasing:\nThere was speculation in the run-up to the 2023 Budget that the second increase would be brought forward, potentially to the late 2030s. \nHowever, in March 2023, the government said it had no plans to change the timetable and indicated a decision was expected in 2026, after the next general election.\nIn February 2024, the International Longevity Centre UK think tank published a report suggesting that the state pension age may need to increase more quickly than the current schedule. \nThe organisation tracks the impact of growing life expectancy and falling birth rates. \nIt argues that the UK and other countries with ageing populations will have to increase their state pension age to 71 by 2050, to keep the cost sustainable.\nThe state pension cost \u00a3110.5bn in 2022-2023, just under half the total amount the government spends on benefits.\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility thinks this will grow to \u00a3124bn in 2023-2024.\nDepending on their overall income, those above retirement age may also be entitled to Pension Credit in addition to the basic state pension. \nPension Credit tops up your weekly income to:\nIf your income is already above those limits, you might still be eligible if you have a disability or care for someone.\nAnyone who qualifies for Pension Credit may also be entitled to other financial support, including cost-of-living payments, housing benefit, a reduction in council tax, or help with heating costs through the Warm Home Discount Scheme. \nPeople born before 25 September 1957 are also entitled to the annual winter fuel payment.",
    "The interim DUP leader Gavin Robinson has said there has been \"no contact on a party basis whatsoever\" with Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.\nSir Jeffrey resigned as Democratic Unionist leader on 29 March, after being charged with rape and other historical sexual offences.\nHe has said he will strenuously contest the allegations.\nSpeaking on Radio Ulster's Talkback programme, Mr Robinson said Sir Jeffrey currently holds no role within the DUP.\nHe said he did not know if party colleagues had been in contact with Sir Jeffrey on a personal basis.\nMr Robinson also said he does not know if his predecessor will resign his Lagan Valley Westminster seat, which would bring about a by-election, but said the DUP is searching for a different candidate for the seat in the event of a general election.\nHe said he found out about the allegations against Sir Jeffrey the evening before they became public.\nThe East Belfast MP said the DUP \"recognised that our shock would be replicated right throughout communities, in individual homes right throughout Northern Ireland.\n\"But Gavin Robinson the person, or myself as an individual, that's quite irrelevant in the situation in the sense that we collectively put ourselves forward to give leadership, to give hope, to give vision to the communities we're honoured to represent.\n\"So you have to set aside some of the [personal] thoughts, some of those feelings and say there might be some weight on my shoulders now, but I have big broad shoulders.\"\nThose hoping to get the inside story on Sir Jeffrey Donaldson's sudden departure from the DUP will be disappointed, but not surprised, by what they heard from Gavin Robinson.\nThe party's interim leader was never going to divulge details of those sensitive conversations on the night Sir Jeffrey was charged and quit as DUP leader.\nBut he did reveal that contact had to be made to get an understanding of what had happened, though there wasn't much \"toing and froing\".\nIn other words, a call was made. \nHe said it quickly became clear that the prospect of Sir Jeffrey staying on as party leader was \"unsustainable\".\nThe party had to \"grasp that nettle\", he said.\nMr Robinson also revealed that all political links between Sir Jeffrey and the party he once led had been cut, though he added he could not speak for some of his colleagues who may have maintained a personal link with the former leader. \nFor the first time we learned that the DUP is actively searching for a candidate to contest the Westminster election in Lagan Valley, a seat still being held by Sir Jeffrey as an independent MP. \nMr Robinson said he had spoken to former DUP leaders Peter Robinson and Arlene Foster since becoming interim leader.\nHe said the past 10 days had been difficult, but added: \"Its not a DUP story, it's not a story about me or anyone else within the party.\"\nHe said party supporters \"recognise that we have done what we can do under the circumstances and we are moving forward with our job, which is to represent Northern Ireland.\n\"There's an opportunity for us to come together and move forward very purposefully.\" \nEarlier, DUP Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly said she was \"absolutely determined to provide what stability I can\" to ensure that the Northern Ireland Executive can continue in a positive tone. \n\"We have an important number of weeks coming up where we'll be discussing the programme for government and the budget,\" she said.\nFirst Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn F\u00e9in, said it was \"business as usual as far as the executive is concerned\". \nThey were speaking after the first full in-person meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in Armagh since 2016.\nA 57-year-old woman has been charged with aiding and abetting in connection with the offences Sir Jeffrey is charged with.\nBoth are due to appear in court this month.\nLast week Mr Robinson - who is also the East Belfast MP - said he had been engaging with colleagues and that the previous week had been \"incredibly difficult and shocking\".\nBut he said the news \"should not deflect from the important task we have ahead of us as representatives for unionism and for Northern Ireland\".",
    "The Vatican has reiterated its staunch opposition to sex changes, gender theory, surrogate parenthood, abortion and euthanasia in a text dubbed \"Dignitas Infinita\" (Infinite Dignity).\nOther social themes, such as poverty, migration and human trafficking are also emphasised as being potential threats to human dignity. \nThe text was signed by Pope Francis.\nThe pontiff has often been criticised by Catholic conservatives over his perceived liberal stance. \nSome conservatives have accused him of steering the Catholic Church too far away from some traditional teachings.\nBut for some liberals, he has not done enough to encourage to Church to evolve by any tangible measure on these questions.\nIn 2023, Pope Francis said transgender people could be baptised in the Catholic Church as long as doing so did not cause scandal or \"confusion\". He also allowed priests to bless same-sex couples under certain circumstances, although the Vatican said it continued to view marriage as between a man and a woman. \nLast year, the Pope directed the Vatican's powerful doctrine office, and the new man steering it with whom he is close, Cardinal Victor Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez, to look at the complexities of \"new questions\" facing people in the world today.\nCardinal Fern\u00e1ndez came under fire for a book he wrote and published in the late 1990s which discussed human sexuality in great detail.\nCertainly, on issues like same-sex unions and the role of women in the Church, the Pope has seemed liberal in tone, with the potential for some practical change in the pipeline.\nOn other issues though, Pope Francis has left little room for doubt about his immoveable stance. Some of his strongest language on doctrine has been reserved for two such topics dealt with in the new document that he has approved.\nHe has previously described the practice of surrogacy as \"despicable\" and so-called gender theory - a school of thought which challenges the idea that gender roles are fixed by biology - as \"an ugly ideology\".\nNow, the Dignitas Infinita declaration calls abortion an \"extremely dangerous crisis of the moral sense\" and says that surrogacy is a \"violation\" of both the woman and the child.\nIt also emphasises that a person's sex at birth is seen as a gift, and any attempt to change it risks conceding \"to the temptation to make oneself God\". \nThe exploitation of the poor, migrants and women are also described as affronts to human dignity. \nPope Francis continues to show that talk of him being either \"progressive\" or \"conservative\" is far too simplistic.\nThe 87-year-old became Pope in 2013. In an autobiography published last month, he said that he had no intention of retiring and planned to remain in post for life.",
    "A man who ran the length of Africa has hinted that his next challenge may not be far away.\nAfter complications with visas, health scares, geopolitical issues and an armed robbery, Russell Cook, nicknamed \u201cHardest Geezer\u201d, crossed the finish line in Tunisia on Sunday after 352 days.\nThe 27-year-old, from Worthing, West Sussex, has raised more than \u00a3775,000 ($978,000) for charity.\nSpeaking to the BBC, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve scratched the itch for a while. But I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I start planning some more things pretty soon.\"\nFor now, he said he was \"keen to chill out\" and spend time with his family but he had \"a whole list of ideas\".\nThe extreme challenge began at South Africa's most southerly point on 22 April, 2023, and finished more than 10,190 miles (16,400km) north in Tunisia.\nHe had originally planned to complete the equivalent of 360 marathons in 240 days but extended the challenge due to complications.\nBefore he set off on the mammoth challenge, he said he hoped to look back at his life and have no regrets after admitting to struggling with his mental health, gambling and drinking.\nUpon finishing, Mr Cook said the idea of quitting was never more than a fleeting thought.\n\u201cThe deepest level of motivation for me is legacy for my family and the Cook name,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere were a bunch of times when it was very difficult \u2013 the Sahara Desert sandstorms, pushing up the mileage the last couple of months was really tough. But I was never going to quit. The only way out was the end.\n\u201cThe scariest moment was in the Congo when I was on the back of a motorbike thinking I was going to die getting driven into the jungle. That was pretty nuts.\u201d\nMany people joined Mr Cook to run legs of the challenge through 16 countries, but he said the scale of the publicity was a welcome surprise.\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally bananas to me the amount of people who have been following and come out to support me,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt would be awesome to get people moving more. It does wonders for people\u2019s lives and changed my life.\u201d\nMr Cook, who has gone through 30 pairs of trainers throughout the challenge, is raising money for The Running Charity and Sandblast.\nThe Running Charity aims to harness the power of running to support young people experiencing homelessness or complex needs, while Sandblast runs educational programmes in refugee camps in Algeria.\nMr Cook\u2019s claim to be the first person to run the length of Africa has been challenged by the World Runners Association (WRA) - a group made of seven athletes who have successfully circumnavigated the world on foot.\nIt said one of its members, Jesper Kenn Olsen, from Denmark, was the first person to run the length of Africa.\nThe association said Mr Olsen began his challenge on 28 December, 2008, in Taba, Egypt, before running 7,948 miles (12,791km) to the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa - completing his journey in 2010.\nQuestioned about similar challenges in the past, Mr Cook said: \"There\u2019s plenty of people before me who have done big runs and kudos to all of them because they are all huge challenges, so nothing but respect.\"\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "Nicaragua has asked the UN's highest court to halt German weapons sales to Israel at the start of a landmark case. \nGermany is accused of breaching the UN genocide convention by sending military hardware to Israel and ceasing funding of the UN's aid agency.\nBerlin rejects the claims and will present a defence to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Tuesday.\nIn 2023 some 30% of Israel's military equipment purchases came from Germany, totalling \u20ac300m ($326m; \u00a3257m). \nThe allegations build on a separate case taken by South Africa in January, where judges in the Hague ordered Israel to take \"every possible measure\" to avoid genocidal acts. The court also ordered Hamas to release all hostages taken from Israel during its 7 October attacks immediately. \nIsrael rejects accusations that it is engaging in genocidal acts in its campaign in Gaza, and has insisted it has the right to defend itself. \nMore than 33,000 have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry there says, the majority of them civilians. Gaza is on the brink of famine, with Oxfam reporting that 300,000 people trapped in the north have lived since January on an average of 245 calories a day.\nNicaragua says Germany's arms sales to Israel, which totalled $326.5m last year - a tenfold increase on 2022 - make it complicit in Israel's alleged war crimes. \nComponents for air defence systems and communications equipment accounted for most of the sales, according to the DPA news agency. \nGermany was also one of 15 Western nations which suspended funding for the UN's Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) over allegations that some of the agency's staff were involved in the 7 October attacks on Israel.\nAccording to papers filed with the ICJ, Nicaragua wants the UN's top court to order Berlin to halt weapons sales and resume funding of the aid agency, one of the few international bodies still operating in Gaza. \nIt says in the absence of such measures, \"Germany is facilitating the commission of genocide and is failing in its obligation to do everything possible to prevent the commission of genocide\". \nSpeaking as the trial opened, Alain Pellet, a lawyer for Nicaragua, said it was \"urgent that Germany suspend continued sales. \n\"Germany was and is fully conscious of the risk that the arms it has furnished and continues to furnish to Israel\" could be used to commit genocide, he told judges. \nBerlin has rejected the allegations, but has remained tight-lipped about its legal strategy ahead of the hearings. \n\"We note Nicaragua's lawsuit and we deny the allegations as unjustified,\" government spokesman Wolfgang Buechner said.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz has been a vocal supporter of Israel's right to self-defence, but he has faced increasing domestic hostility to the continuation of arms sales to the country. \nOn Sunday, a group of civil servants wrote to the German leader calling on the government to \"cease arms deliveries to the Israeli government with immediate effect\".\n\"Israel is committing crimes in Gaza that are in clear contradiction to international law,\" the statement said, citing January's ICJ ruling. \nIn January's case, the ICJ ruled that \"at least some of the acts and omissions alleged by South Africa to have been committed by Israel in Gaza appear to be capable of falling within the provisions of the Convention\". \nMichael Becker, a law professor at Trinity College Dublin, told the BBC that there was uncertainty about states' obligations to prevent genocide or ensure respect for humanitarian law. The case against Germany, he said, could potentially help clarify the issue.\nCritics of Nicaragua's case have highlighted the country's chequered human rights record. The government of President Daniel Ortega has jailed opponents and banned protests. In March, the UK's mission to the UN accused the government of a \"relentless\" crackdown on human rights. ",
    "More than 90 people have died after a ferry sank off the north coast of Mozambique, local authorities say. \nOfficials in Nampula province said there were 12 survivors out of the 130 or so people believed to have been on board.\nThey were fleeing after disinformation about the ongoing cholera outbreak caused panic, Nampula Secretary of State Jaime Neto said. \nMany children were among the dead, he added. Rescue efforts are continuing.\nInitially on Sunday the authorities blamed the shipwreck on overcrowding, but later said it had sunk after taking on water.\nA crew member who survived, Menque Amade, told national broadcaster TVM that \"water filled the boat... and the tragedy happened\".\nPhotos taken soon afterwards show dozens of bodies lying on a beach. \nThe boat was travelling from Lunga to Mozambique Island, off the coast of Nampula, Portuguese broadcaster RTP reported.\nIt is a Muslim-majority area and some of those who died have already been buried, in line with Islamic rites.\nOrdinary Mozambicans say the news of the boat tragedy shocked them, particularly because of the huge number of deaths.\nBoat accidents are not uncommon in Mozambique but rarely do so many people die. Thousands of boats are said to ferry passengers around with little oversight.\n\"It's shocking - the authorities are partly to blame for not doing enough to control and monitor sea traffic,\" local journalist Charles Mangwiro told the BBC.\nAnother reporter in Mozambique, Berta Madime, told the BBC that this latest accident comes despite recent pressure on ferry operators to improve safety.\nNampula province has been one of the worst-affected by the cholera outbreak which has spread over several countries in southern Africa since January last year.\nAccording to Unicef, the current outbreak is the worst in 25 years. Since October 2023, Mozambique has reported 13,700 confirmed cases and 30 deaths. \nAn Islamist insurgency in neighbouring Cabo Delgado province has claimed the lives of at least 4,000 people and displaced nearly one million others since it began over six years ago.\nFor nearly 400 years, Mozambique Island was the capital of Portuguese East Africa, when the region was under colonial rule.

    "A 74-year-old politician with \"critical\" health issues is in jail as Togolese authorities crack down on dissent, an spokesperson for the nation's opposition coalition says.\nTensions heightened after Togo's parliament passed a bill proposing huge changes to the political system.\nElections scheduled for 20 April were later postponed.\nFive opposition activists were arrested for campaigning against the reforms, a DMK coalition spokesperson said.\nUnder the bill passed on 25 March, the president of the West African nation would become a symbolic position selected by parliament, rather than being directly elected.\nExecutive power would instead go to a prime minister.\nOpposition parties have rejected the reform, arguing that it could allow President Faure Gnassingb\u00e9 to stay in power.\nHe succeeded his father, Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma, who died in 2005 after ruling the country with an iron fist for 38 years.\nMembers of the DMK (Dynamique Monseigneur Kpodzro) were arrested last week after publicly campaigning against the reform, spokesperson Ben Djagba told the BBC.\nHe said there were concerns about the health of Dovi Amouzou, a 74-year-old politician, who is among the five detainees.\n\"Her heart conditions are worrisome as she has ongoing heart-related issues and is under constant care by her physician. Since her detention, she no longer has access to her doctor,\" Mr Djagba said.\nThe five politicians have been held on \"public order charges\", their lawyer, Elom Kpade, was quoted as saying by press agency AFP.\nFrench broadcaster RFI reported that the five have been taken to the civil prison in the capital, Lom\u00e9.\nPublic prosecutor Talaka Mawama said an investigation had been opened into \"individuals caught distributing leaflets and chanting slogans inciting popular revolt\" during an unauthorised protest.\nMr Djagba told the BBC that these were \"bogus allegations\".\nNo new date has been given for the elections.\nThe Conference of Togolese Catholic bishops has urged President Gnassingb\u00e9 not to sign the constitutional changes into law, citing the need for \"broad consultation and a more inclusive national debate\".\nOpposition parties boycotted Togo's previous elections and are poorly represented in Togo's parliament.\nAs a result, the constitution change was approved almost unanimously - with only one legislator voting against and one other abstaining.\nThe presidency said on Wednesday that the delay was to allow for \"consultations\" over the contested constitutional changes.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story wrongly said those arrested were lawmakers.",
    "New varieties of organic hops that are resilient to climate change are being trialled by UK beer makers.\nThe Innovative Farmers Hop Trial aims to boost the cultivation of UK crops after falling production levels.\nResearchers have identified five experimental hops which show resilience to disease and warmer temperatures.\nTaking part in the trial, Stroud Brewery Managing Director, Greg Pilley, said: \"The underlying issue is climate change - our weather is changing.\n\"UK summers are becoming wetter and more humid and less reliable, and it's making hop growing more challenging,\" he added.\nAccording to growers, traditional non-organic hop varieties grown in the UK- like Fuggle and Goldings- are under increasing stress from issues like climate change, disease, insects, and low nitrogen availability. \nThey have also seen a fall in demand due to changing consumer tastes towards tropical flavours, produced by hops that have been imported from countries like the US.\nAs part of the trial, the Stroud Brewery created two beers using Endeavour and Harlequin hops - which can be grown in warmer temperatures.\nThe organic hops also include a variety called 302, which produces flavour notes of pineapple, strawberry laces, blackcurrant, spice and lemon.\nRich Davies, from Charles Faram- a beer merchant in Worcestershire which helped to run the programme - said although these varieties would not provide the same intensity of taste compared to those like Mosaic, Simcoe or Citra, brewers could switch out 30% of those hops with Harlequin.\n\"You're not going to notice any discernible differences in the finished beer but it's more sustainable, there's less miles travelled from the farm, and it's more cost effective for brewers as well so it helps all around,\" he said.\nHe added this project has been the first time they have seen new organic varieties produce a bigger yield.\n\"Animals would eat the hops, they'd be attracted by the floral scent, and then they wouldn't like the bitterness so they'd spit it out,\" said Will Rogers, also from Charles Faram.\n\"So that helps the hop plant to spread it's seeds. These in theory, could have acreage expanded of them.\"\nMr Pilley from Stroud Brewery, which has always been organic, said he felt vindicated in his long term ambition of proving that there was a market for sustainable beer.\nHe now hopes to gather data on the increased biodiversity and soil carbon on the organic hops farms, to help bolster the environmental credentials of the beer it sells.\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "US President Joe Biden has unveiled his latest proposal to help millions of Americans pay off student loans, working to fulfil a campaign promise ahead of November's election.\nLast year, the Supreme Court rejected his initial plan to cancel as much as $20,000 (\u00a315,800) for some borrowers.\nThis \"Plan B\" targets relief for five groups of borrowers, including those burdened with \"runaway interest\".\nMore than 30 million people could benefit, according to the White House.\nRoughly one in eight Americans has outstanding student loan debt, including tens of thousands who finished college and entered the workforce decades ago.\nYounger voters in particular often cite debt relief or forgiveness among their top issues, and many Democrats say the president has not fulfilled promises he made on it as a candidate four years ago. \nAs he seeks re-election, Mr Biden's latest actions could help patch over the fractures in a political coalition that has grown disillusioned with his job performance as well as his handling of the war in Gaza.\nDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee this November, opposes student debt cancellation.\nMr Biden will promote the plan later on Monday during a visit to Madison, a liberal college town and the state capital of Wisconsin, a crucial swing state where he narrowly defeated Mr Trump in 2020.\nVice-President Kamala Harris and other members of the administration will also fan out across the country and pitch the effort to voters in coming days.\nAn outline of the plan was posted on the White House web site early on Monday. \nThe plan will not go into effect right away. Because the education department is following a multi-step rule-making process, it could take months. Portions of the new rule will likely be implemented sometime in the autumn, providing a boost ahead of the election.\nMonday's announcement spells out relief for:\nAccording to the White House, these actions would fully forgive debt for more than four million people, eliminate the interest balances of up to 23 million and relieve at least $5,000 for more than 10 million.\nIn some cases, borrowers eligible for these kinds of relief will not have to apply to the programme, and will instead be identified and see adjustments automatically credited to their accounts.\nBut the latest effort is likely to be beset by a host of conservative legal challenges. \nOpponents of debt relief say it does not solve the problem of costly college education, does not stimulate the economy and ignores financially-burdened Americans who did not attend college. They add that targeted proposals are also unfair to borrowers who have already managed to pay off their student loans, in some cases by making financial sacrifices.\nLast June, the nation's top court struck down the president's sweeping plan to use an existing law to wipe away $430bn in student debt, completely erasing the outstanding balances of about 20 million people.\nIn its 6-3 decision, the court's conservative majority ruled that the Biden administration had reinterpreted a statute to \"[expand] forgiveness to nearly every borrower in the country\".\nSince then, the White House has used existing provisions to approve $146bn in debt relief for nearly four million people while also working to reform the student loan system in other ways.",

    "In political journalism you deal with lots of different kinds of stories - stories about policies, stories about ministerial rivalries, stories about geopolitics, stories about local politics. \nThen some stories are just plain weird, like the one that broke last week about the honeytrap targeting men in Westminster. There are still lots of unanswered questions about the case, which I hope to dig into in my job as the BBC's chief political correspondent. \nFor that reason, I should also be upfront that I was among the men targeted. \nIt started with a WhatsApp on a Sunday morning in March. Coming from a number I did not have saved in my phone, it read: \"Henry! Long time no speak - how're you doing? Miss seeing you around Westminster x.\"\nThe user's profile picture showed a man and a woman, both probably in their 20s, having dinner. I zoomed in on the photo as much as I could but recognised neither of them. \n\"V sorry,\" I replied. \"Who is this?\"\nThe response was instant. \"Haha it's Charlie! I used to work in Parliament and we swapped numbers after drinking one night.\"\nAnd then seconds later: \"I'd pretend to be offended but it was a while ago x.\"\nThis was pretty odd now. Yes, one way a journalist might make contacts in Westminster is to hang around the bars and pubs. But the point is to make contacts, not to fail to save their number and then forget them. And more obviously - why did Charlie keep leaving kisses at the end of their messages? \nI put my phone down and decided to leave it but my non-response left Charlie dissatisfied. A few minutes later they came back: \"Random Sunday message I know.\"\nAfter waiting a further six minutes for more from me, Charlie's apparent intentions became more clear. \"I'm going to guess you aren't still single - should I bow out gracefully? Lucky girl x.\"\nFrom pretty odd to very odd indeed. No thanks. I blocked Charlie, meaning they could not send me more messages. But the question of what exactly the brief exchange was all about nagged at me for the rest of the day. \nI flitted between thinking that a hostile state may have been attempting to entrap me - though it's hard not to have that thought without feeling instantly absurd and pompous - and rustling through my mental Filofax to make absolutely sure that I hadn't ever met this Charlie and given them the wrong end of the stick. \nWhat I now know, thanks to reporting by Politico, is that I was just one of at least a dozen men in political circles who received unsolicited WhatsApp messages along those lines. Some, including MPs, reportedly fared much worse than me. Rather than blocking the sender, they kept the conversation going long enough to be sent explicit images. Reportedly at least one person reciprocated.\nWilliam Wragg, a Conservative MP who I happen to have got to know fairly well as a professional contact over the years, came forward to admit that he had been caught up in the affair, saying he passed the personal phone numbers of colleagues to a man he met on a dating app who had \"compromising things\" on him.\nHarry Yorke, a journalist at the Sunday Times, has also said that he received flirtatious messages from Charlie. Others, anonymously, have said they received messages instead from a woman calling herself Abi, operating from a different phone number. \nUnlike any other cases I'm aware of, I was contacted by both. Because my brief Sunday morning exchange with Charlie was not the end of things. \nAlmost exactly 24 hours after Charlie's first message, another WhatsApp from an unknown number arrived in my inbox. This time the photo was a woman in front of a ruined abbey, her face artfully turned away from the camera.\n\"Are you in Westminster today? Monday drink? X.\" \nInstantly I was sure this was the same person as the day before. Charlie clearly was not an innocuous encounter I had forgotten, but one which never took place. \n\"Who is this?\" I replied. \n\"Abi Miller x.\"\nThey claimed to have previously been an intern at The Times, where I worked until last year. \n\"Always used to joke that you were the only fit one in the politics team.\"\nNever mind the unfair slight on my former colleagues - this was now getting quite sinister. I blocked the number, but by this point was feeling much more rattled than the day before. \nWas this to be a daily occurrence? I was confident I was being scammed in some way but the idiomatic language and contextual knowledge of Westminster was unsettling. \nFlustered, I realised I didn't even know what blocking somebody on WhatsApp meant. Did they know they had been blocked? Were they sending messages into a void? After 40 minutes of chewing it over in my head, I decided to unblock Abi to see if WhatsApp showed me any messages she had sent in the meantime. \nThat was probably a mistake. I didn't get any messages Abi might have sent when blocked, but the act of unblocking did show Abi that I was online. She pounced instantly: \"Did you block and unblock me?\" \n\"What do you want?\" I replied. \n\"I messaged to se",

    "A spirit maker based along the Solway shoreline has become the first creator of tequila in Scotland - only it cannot use that name.\nThe Dark Art Distillery was set up near Galloway Forest Park - the UK's first dark sky park - by Andrew Clark Hutchison, a Scot who was born in Mexico City.\nHaving developed award-winning gins, he turned his attention to his birthplace and, discovered there had not been a tequila spirit made in Scotland.\nFor a year, he has worked with Dark Art's master distiller Gerard Macluskey on the possibility of creating the drink.\nGerard learned his trade with Tanqueray Gordon in Essex, Smirnoff Vodka and various small distilleries.\nThe pair have now unveiled Vespero to coincide with International Dark Skies Week.\nThe drink's central ingredient is the blue weber agave plant.\nMr Macluskey said he had to draw on his 40 years of experience in the industry to distil a tequila recipe in Scotland\nHe said: \"This is something different, certainly, and I'm very proud of being at the forefront of doing something that hasn\u2019t been done before in Scotland. \n\"We've had trials with leading mixologists and the reactions have been great.\"\nThe Dark Art Distillery, which is based in Kirkcudbright's old Johnston School, opened in 2021.\nMr Clark Hutchison and his brother were born in Mexico City, where his parents lived from the late 1950s to 1967. \nThe 57-year-old said: \"My father went there with Paisley firm Coats. \n\"Having Mexico City as my place of birth on my passport, I was always keen to do something from my heritage, and where my parents first lived as a couple.\n\"It was really exciting to do something with a Mexican inspiration.\"\nHe said it was \"fantastic\" to see the drink come to fruition.\nIf you're looking for Scotland's first tequila, you won't find it under that name. Just like Scotch whisky has to be produced in Scotland, so tequila can only be distilled in Mexico.\n\"It smells like tequila, it tastes like tequila and it's made like tequila, but it can't be called tequila because it's 100% distilled in Scotland,\" said Mr Clark Hutchison. \n\"That's the beauty of it for me. \n\"There are other Scottish distilleries that have tequila, but they get it from Mexico, whereas this is 100% distilled in Scotland, here in Kirkcudbright. We're making it from scratch.\"\nThe name Vespero relates to venus and the evening star.\nMr Clark Hutchison explains \"the inspiration when we opened our distillery was all about the dark skies above the Galloway Forest Park so we were trying to get a link to astronomy, which is a big part of Mexican heritage.\n\"It fits with the heritage of both.\"\nThere's also a personal element for Mr Clark Hutchison. \nHe added: \"For me, it's been a really interesting journey, because as we've gone through the process I've picked up books my dad had from his time in Mexico.\n\"It made me read those books, and connected me with him, even though he's not here anymore.\n\"It's been really nice to read the books from Mexico that he had read before me when he was travelling there.

Sir Jeffrey said he would be \"strenuously contesting\" the charges.\nSome networks have previously argued their politician presenters only host current affairs debates, rather than act as news readers, and therefore their programming does not break the broadcasting code.\nBut the news about Sir Jeffrey broke during Lammy's show, prompting the Labour frontbencher to report on it as a news story.

    "New varieties of organic hops that are resilient to climate change are being trialled by UK beer makers.\nThe Innovative Farmers Hop Trial aims to boost the cultivation of UK crops after falling production levels.\nResearchers have identified five experimental hops which show resilience to disease and warmer temperatures.\nTaking part in the trial, Stroud Brewery Managing Director, Greg Pilley, said: \"The underlying issue is climate change - our weather is changing.\n\"UK summers are becoming wetter and more humid and less reliable, and it's making hop growing more challenging,\" he added.\nAccording to growers, traditional non-organic hop varieties grown in the UK- like Fuggle and Goldings- are under increasing stress from issues like climate change, disease, insects, and low nitrogen availability. \nThey have also seen a fall in demand due to changing consumer tastes towards tropical flavours, produced by hops that have been imported from countries like the US.\nAs part of the trial, the Stroud Brewery created two beers using Endeavour and Harlequin hops - which can be grown in warmer temperatures.\nThe organic hops also include a variety called 302, which produces flavour notes of pineapple, strawberry laces, blackcurrant, spice and lemon.\nRich Davies, from Charles Faram- a beer merchant in Worcestershire which helped to run the programme - said although these varieties would not provide the same intensity of taste compared to those like Mosaic, Simcoe or Citra, brewers could switch out 30% of those hops with Harlequin.\n\"You're not going to notice any discernible differences in the finished beer but it's more sustainable, there's less miles travelled from the farm, and it's more cost effective for brewers as well so it helps all around,\" he said.\nHe added this project has been the first time they have seen new organic varieties produce a bigger yield.\n\"Animals would eat the hops, they'd be attracted by the floral scent, and then they wouldn't like the bitterness so they'd spit it out,\" said Will Rogers, also from Charles Faram.\n\"So that helps the hop plant to spread it's seeds. These in theory, could have acreage expanded of them.\"\nMr Pilley from Stroud Brewery, which has always been organic, said he felt vindicated in his long term ambition of proving that there was a market for sustainable beer.\nHe now hopes to gather data on the increased biodiversity and soil carbon on the organic hops farms, to help bolster the environmental credentials of the beer it sells.\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "US President Joe Biden has unveiled his latest proposal to help millions of Americans pay off student loans, working to fulfil a campaign promise ahead of November's election.\nLast year, the Supreme Court rejected his initial plan to cancel as much as $20,000 (\u00a315,800) for some borrowers.\nThis \"Plan B\" targets relief for five groups of borrowers, including those burdened with \"runaway interest\".\nMore than 30 million people could benefit, according to the White House.\nRoughly one in eight Americans has outstanding student loan debt, including tens of thousands who finished college and entered the workforce decades ago.\nYounger voters in particular often cite debt relief or forgiveness among their top issues, and many Democrats say the president has not fulfilled promises he made on it as a candidate four years ago. \nAs he seeks re-election, Mr Biden's latest actions could help patch over the fractures in a political coalition that has grown disillusioned with his job performance as well as his handling of the war in Gaza.\nDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee this November, opposes student debt cancellation.\nMr Biden will promote the plan later on Monday during a visit to Madison, a liberal college town and the state capital of Wisconsin, a crucial swing state where he narrowly defeated Mr Trump in 2020.\nVice-President Kamala Harris and other members of the administration will also fan out across the country and pitch the effort to voters in coming days.\nAn outline of the plan was posted on the White House web site early on Monday. \nThe plan will not go into effect right away. Because the education department is following a multi-step rule-making process, it could take months. Portions of the new rule will likely be implemented sometime in the autumn, providing a boost ahead of the election.\nMonday's announcement spells out relief for:\nAccording to the White House, these actions would fully forgive debt for more than four million people, eliminate the interest balances of up to 23 million and relieve at least $5,000 for more than 10 million.\nIn some cases, borrowers eligible for these kinds of relief will not have to apply to the programme, and will instead be identified and see adjustments automatically credited to their accounts.\nBut the latest effort is likely to be beset by a host of conservative legal challenges. \nOpponents of debt relief say it does not solve the problem of costly college education, does not stimulate the economy and ignores financially-burdened Americans who did not attend college. They add that targeted proposals are also unfair to borrowers who have already managed to pay off their student loans, in some cases by making financial sacrifices.\nLast June, the nation's top court struck down the president's sweeping plan to use an existing law to wipe away $430bn in student debt, completely erasing the outstanding balances of about 20 million people.\nIn its 6-3 decision, the court's conservative majority ruled that the Biden administration had reinterpreted a statute to \"[expand] forgiveness to nearly every borrower in the country\".\nSince then, the White House has used existing provisions to approve $146bn in debt relief for nearly four million people while also working to reform the student loan system in other ways.",

I couldn't move, there was stuff everywhere.\n\"I didn't want to go home.\"\nThe highlight of his haul in 2022 was a hoard of farthings from the reign of 15th Century Scottish King James III.\n\"I got my first one and I knew it was really rare because I know my coins,\" he said. \n\"After that it was just like a tap, it just kept on going, and over the course of a few weeks I pulled 52 of them.\"\nThe 500-year-old coins, which were made of copper and were worth a quarter of a penny, were in very good condition, Mr Baxter, from Falkirk, said.\nThe coins are irregular shapes. They have the Saltire - the cross of St Andrew - on one side and a crown on the other. \n\"To hold something that's hundreds of years old for the first time is extraordinary,\" he said. \n\"You get a real buzz going up and down your body which lasts all day and all night.\"\nAn expert at the National Museum of Scotland said it was the first hoard of James III farthings to be found since 1919.\nMetal detectorists need to ask for permission from landowners to search on their land and anything they find must be handed into the Treasure Trove for analysis and recording.\nUnder Scottish law all finds of archaeological, historical or cultural significance must be reported and can be claimed by the Crown.\nNeither detectorists nor landowners have ownership rights to any archaeological finds made in Scotland. \nFinds that are allocated to a museum through the Treasure Trove system are usually acknowledged by an award paid to the detectorist.\nDetectorists generally split the money with the landowner.\nMr Baxter has detected at many sites, all of which he keeps a closely guarded secret. They include the 14-acre fields in Fife where he has now found more than 500 pieces ranging from the Bronze Age to the medieval period.\n\"I go along to farmers' doors with my portfolio of previous finds and show them what I do and ask them for permission to detect on their land,\" he said.\n\"You try to make yourself presentable, you put gel in your hair and wash your car and turn up in nice clothes. \n\"I hate getting permission because it's quite awkward speaking to the landowner. Farmers are busy and the last thing they want to do is speak to a wee guy asking for metal detecting permission.\"\nThe James III hoard has been put into the British numismatics journal, which charts the best finds in the country.\nIt also includes two Balliol coins which Mr Baxter discovered at the site in Fife. These farthings are extremely rare and are the only two to have ever been found in Scotland. \nJohn Balliol reigned as king of Scotland from 1292 to 1296.\nThe find was allocated to the National Museums of Scotland and \u00a35,000 was paid out.\nMr Baxter has also found 69 medieval coins from the reign of English King Edward I, whose armies invaded Scotland at the end of the 13th Century.\nThe medieval ring, which was his first find on the Fife site, dates between the 13th and 14th century.\n\"Initially I thought it was a bottle top because when it came out of the ground I could see the silver edges,\" Mr Baxter said.\n\"I saw the writing at the side and the big clasped hands at the front and I thought: 'That's a medieval ring'.\n\"It was just a great feeling to see it because it was a sunny day and it was twinkling away and it was in really good condition because it's been coated in gold, which has protected it from the soil.\"\nMr Baxter, who works as a lab technician, said he believed it was a betrothal ring.\n\"It would have been a higher status individual who owned it,\" he said.\n\"It weighs 9.5g, it's a heavy piece. A medieval penny would weigh about 1.2g, so that's about seven medieval pennies, so it wouldn't have been a peasant who owned that at the time.\"\nThe ring is silver but it has been coated in gold. It was eight inches down in the ground when his detector picked it up.\nMr Baxter, who has written a book entitled Making history: My Life As a Scottish Metal Detectorist, said it was hard for people to understand how difficult it was to find ancient artefacts. \nHe said: \"In a general field 90% of the time there will be nothing in it. \n\"You could go in all the fields on the right and left along the M9 from Falkirk to Edinburgh and there would be nothing in them apart from modern Victorian stuff or Georgian stuff.\n\"It's hard to get stuff that's beyond 500 and 600 years old because the population was a lot lower.\"\nMr Baxter said a field could be full of medieval items, but detectors were not going to find them if the crops were too high. \n\"Then i",
    "More than 90 people have died after a ferry sank off the north coast of Mozambique, local authorities say. \nOfficials in Nampula province said there were 12 survivors out of the 130 or so people believed to have been on board.\nThey were fleeing after disinformation about the ongoing cholera outbreak caused panic, Nampula Secretary of State Jaime Neto said. \nMany children were among the dead, he added. Rescue efforts are continuing.\nInitially on Sunday the authorities blamed the shipwreck on overcrowding, but later said it had sunk after taking on water.\nA crew member who survived, Menque Amade, told national broadcaster TVM that \"water filled the boat... and the tragedy happened\".\nPhotos taken soon afterwards show dozens of bodies lying on a beach. \nThe boat was travelling from Lunga to Mozambique Island, off the coast of Nampula, Portuguese broadcaster RTP reported.\nIt is a Muslim-majority area and some of those who died have already been buried, in line with Islamic rites.\nOrdinary Mozambicans say the news of the boat tragedy shocked them, particularly because of the huge number of deaths.\nBoat accidents are not uncommon in Mozambique but rarely do so many people die. Thousands of boats are said to ferry passengers around with little oversight.\n\"It's shocking - the authorities are partly to blame for not doing enough to control and monitor sea traffic,\" local journalist Charles Mangwiro told the BBC.\nAnother reporter in Mozambique, Berta Madime, told the BBC that this latest accident comes despite recent pressure on ferry operators to improve safety.\nNampula province has been one of the worst-affected by the cholera outbreak which has spread over several countries in southern Africa since January last year.\nAccording to Unicef, the current outbreak is the worst in 25 years. Since October 2023, Mozambique has reported 13,700 confirmed cases and 30 deaths. \nAn Islamist insurgency in neighbouring Cabo Delgado province has claimed the lives of at least 4,000 people and displaced nearly one million others since it began over six years ago.\nFor nearly 400 years, Mozambique Island was the capital of Portuguese East Africa, when the region was under colonial rule. The island is designated a Unesco world heritage site for its colonial architecture and history as a trading post. \nAdditional reporting by Ido Vock",
    "New robots that can find prescriptions on shelves in pharmacies far faster than humans can have been put into two hospitals.\nThe Royal Preston and Chorley and South Ribble Hospital have installed dual systems that are like \"giant vending machines\" with moving picking arms.\nHospital chiefs said automated picking had been used for 16 years, but the new robots were faster.\nAnd they assured the systems would not lead to pharmacy job cuts. \nThey new robots would mean the hospitals' 220 pharmacists would have even more time to devote to patient care.\nRichard Marshall, the lead pharmacy technician for procurement at the Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: \"Everyone thinks systems like these take people's jobs, but the pharmacy staff has grown, if anything.\n\"Instead of having people constantly picking all of these things manually, they can be out at the patients' bedsides, checking their take-home medicines, checking what they brought in and providing advice on how to get the best out of their medicines.\"\nThe robot are so big they each require their own room, with the system at the Royal Preston having the capacity to store 40,000 medicine packs.\nThe Chorley robot will pick from around 12,000 items.\nThe robots spring into life when a label is generated. \u00a0 \nThe prescription is then picked and carried by conveyor belt to a collection point.\n\"It reduces the risk of medication errors, such as selecting the wrong pack size or strength,\" Mr Marshall said.\nThere is also still human oversight at the other end of the process from a dispenser and a second checker - with the accuracy of the original label being key to the whole process.\nThe automated system also helps reduce waste, as the the shortest-dated products are automatically selected first.\nChorley Hospital received its new pharmacy robot late last year, while the Royal Preston's is almost fully up and running after a six-week installation period.\nDuring that time, staff had to revert to the hand-picking process, which some of them had never had to do before.\nWhy not follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram?

    "The state pension has risen by 8.5% because of a measure known as the triple lock.\nIt means that pensioners receive an amount designed to keep up with rising prices and wages.\nThe state pension is a payment made every four weeks by the government, to people who have reached the qualifying age and have paid enough National Insurance contributions.\nThis year, the link to earnings under the triple lock meant an increase of 8.5% from 8 April, making it worth:\nThis is a rise from:\nUnder the triple lock system, the state pension increases each April in line with whichever of these three measures is highest:\nThe triple lock was introduced by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2010. \nIt was designed to ensure the value of the state pension was not overtaken by the increase in the cost of living or the working population's income. \nIn March, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the Conservatives would continue the triple-lock system, if they won the next general election.\nLabour also said it was \"committed to retaining\" the triple lock.\nThe triple lock was temporarily suspended after the Covid pandemic distorted average wage figures, but later restored. \nMore than 12 million people currently receive the state pension.\nMen and women born between 6 October, 1954 and 5 April, 1960 start receiving their pension at the age of 66. \nBut for people born after this date, the state pension age is increasing:\nThere was speculation in the run-up to the 2023 Budget that the second increase would be brought forward, potentially to the late 2030s. \nHowever, in March 2023, the government said it had no plans to change the timetable and indicated a decision was expected in 2026, after the next general election.\nIn February 2024, the International Longevity Centre UK think tank published a report suggesting that the state pension age may need to increase more quickly than the current schedule. \nThe organisation tracks the impact of growing life expectancy and falling birth rates. \nIt argues that the UK and other countries with ageing populations will have to increase their state pension age to 71 by 2050, to keep the cost sustainable.\nThe state pension cost \u00a3110.5bn in 2022-2023, just under half the total amount the government spends on benefits.\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility thinks this will grow to \u00a3124bn in 2023-2024.\nDepending on their overall income, those above retirement age may also be entitled to Pension Credit in addition to the basic state pension. \nPension Credit tops up your weekly income to:\nIf your income is already above those limits, you might still be eligible if you have a disability or care for someone.\nAnyone who qualifies for Pension Credit may also be entitled to other financial support, including cost-of-living payments, housing benefit, a reduction in council tax, or help with heating costs through the Warm Home Discount Scheme. \nPeople born before 25 September 1957 are also entitled to the annual winter fuel payment.",
    "The first government inspection of a new prison has found illegal drugs are widely available and inmates are not suitably supported by staff.\nCategory C jail HMP Five Wells opened in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, in 2022 and is run by security firm G4S.\nHis Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) noted high levels of self-harm among prisoners and poor food.\nThe prison said it had put an action plan in place to address the concerns raised by inspectors.\nHMP Five Wells has capacity to house up to 1,687 prisoners with up to two years left on their sentences.\nIt was built on the site of the former HMP Wellingborough, which closed in 2012.\nThe HMIP report noted drugs remained a \"huge problem\" in the prison and random testing suggested about a third of all prisoners were active users. \nJust over half of inmates said it was \"easy\" to get hold of illegal drugs, against an average of 32% in other similar prisons.\nThe rate of self-harm incidents in the prison was also high and inspectors said not enough was being done to reduce them. \nThere had been 1,256 recorded incidents in the 12 months before the inspection took place, which the report concluded was \"very high\" compared with other establishments.\nIt also found staff lacked confidence in supervising prisoners and were not given sufficient support. \nHowever, the report also highlighted some positives, stating the general environment and living conditions were excellent, while access to amenities was reasonable.\nWriting in the report, chief inspector of prisons, Charlie Taylor, said: \"Opening a new prison is one of the toughest challenges in prison management and a first inspection is an important milestone in the life of an institution. It would be unrealistic to expect that all would be perfect.\n\"Our inspection notes the very real difficulties leaders have faced. Stronger governance, oversight and supervision, the building of staff confidence and capability, and a more active and purposeful regime should now be the focus.\"\nAn HMP Five Wells spokesperson said: \"We have put in place an action plan that addresses all HMIP's key priorities with a focus on recruitment, retention, addressing the ingress of drugs, governance and oversight.\n\"Inspectors said rates of violence and self-harm are falling and this downward trajectory has continued since the inspection.\n\"We are committed to developing a stronger and broader purposeful activity, skills and education programme to enhance employment opportunities for prisoners.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The questions that will be asked of the jury in Donald Trump's upcoming hush money criminal case have been revealed.\nThey range from whether prospective jurors listen to podcasts to their feelings about a former president being criminally tried in state court.\nAlso on Monday, an appeals court dismissed Mr Trump's most recent effort to delay the case.\nHe had sued the Manhattan judge overseeing the trial earlier in the day. \nA New York court order published on Monday afternoon contained the questions for potential jurors. Jury selection for the trial is set to begin next week, on 15 April. \nThey ask the jury pool to reveal information about themselves, particularly whether they have participated in any groups that either oppose or support Mr Trump. \nThe questions are most specific about the following groups: the QAnon movement, the Proud Boys, the Oathkeepers, the Three Percenters, the Boogaloo Boys and Antifa.\nOther questions include:\nThey will also be asked about what media they watch and read and the social media they follow. \nThe former president was charged last year with a felony over a hush money payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, with whom he is accused of having an affair. \nHe has pleaded not guilty to falsifying business records, and he has continued to claim that this case and his other legal issues are the result of political persecution. \nMr Trump - the Republican presidential candidate for 2024 - has complained about the setting of his trial in Manhattan, a borough with a large number of Democratic voters. \nHe alleges that he will not face an unbiased jury on the island that long served as his home.\nExperts have told the BBC that jury selection for the trial, could pose a challenge for Mr Trump's legal team. \n\"It's doable, but it's going to be difficult,\" former Brooklyn prosecutor Julie Rendelman said. \nMr Trump's hush money trial is one of four criminal cases he is facing, but it may be the only trial to take place before the upcoming presidential election in November.\nIn an apparent effort to delay the upcoming trial, Mr Trump filed a lawsuit on Monday against New York Justice Juan Merchan. An appeals court judge dismissed that last-minute attempt just hours later. \nMr Trump was seeking to change the location of the trial and dismiss a gag order that limits his ability to comment on the case, according to BBC's US partner CBS News. \nThe lawsuit was not made public and BBC has not been able to review it. Two legal filings with the titles \"change of venue\" and \"stay\" were visible in an online court database, however, according to CBS. \nThe BBC has contacted Mr Trump's legal team for comment. \nMr Trump's trial was already delayed from the end of March to 15 April due to the unexpected release of a batch of documents from federal prosecutors that lawyers in the case needed time to review. The former president's legal team had sought to push back the trial to an even later date. \nHe has also complained about a gag order imposed on him by Justice Merchan, who is overseeing the trial. \nMr Merchan initially imposed a gag order preventing Mr Trump from commenting publicly about witnesses, jurors and others connected to the case. \nBut Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg asked to expand the order to cover the families of those involved in the case after Mr Trump attacked the judge's daughter on social media. \n\"This pattern of attacking family members of presiding jurists and attorneys assigned to his cases serves no legitimate purpose,\" Mr Merchan wrote in a ruling on the gag order. \nIn a separate development, justice department special counsel Jack Smith wrote to the Supreme Court on Monday in a legal filing to ask that it reject Mr Trump's claim of absolute presidential immunity. \nThe Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Mr Trump's immunity case on 25 April. \nMr Smith wrote that siding with Mr Trump in the matter \"would free the President from virtually all criminal law\u2014even crimes such as bribery, murder, treason, and sedition\".\nThe special counsel is prosecuting the former president in a classified files case and in a 2020 elections interference case.

    "It began with hints. Intimation.\nNow, it's no holds barred accusations.\nThe Russian authorities are aggressively pushing the line that Ukraine and the West were behind last month's Crocus City concert hall massacre outside Moscow which left 145 people dead.\nThe Islamic State group quickly claimed responsibility for the attack. But soon after the suspected gunmen were detained President Vladimir Putin hinted at a Ukrainian connection.\nAt the weekend Russian state TV broadcast interrogation videos of the four suspects, all citizens of Tajikistan. One of the men said on camera that the post-attack plan had been \"to head towards Kyiv\". \nTheir words must be taken with extreme caution. During a court appearance after their arrest the men showed signs of torture.  \nThe Russian TV correspondent presenting the report went on to make a series of strange claims:\n\"Following the terrorist attack Western sources and many Russian 'foreign agents' began to shift the focus from the Ukrainian connection to, exclusively, Islamic State.\"\nIn Russia many Kremlin critics have been designated \"foreign agents\" for allegedly receiving funding from abroad or just being deemed \"under foreign influence\".\nThe \"shift of focus\" to the IS was hardly surprising. \nNot only had the group announced that it was behind the attack, it had released video of the shooting. \nBy contrast, Ukraine had denied any involvement. What's more, both America and, reportedly, Iran had warned Moscow of possible attacks on Russian soil.\nIn its 13-minute report, Russian state TV made no mention of the IS claim of responsibility.\nThen, from the journalist, this baseless accusation - that Western media \"had more sympathy for those who carried out the terrorist attack which killed more than 140 defenceless people, than for the victims\u2026\"\nIt was a clear attempt to demonise the West in the eyes of the Russian public.\nIt's not just Russian TV saying this. So is the Russian foreign ministry. In a statement on its Telegram channel, the ministry claimed that in the West \"there is a strict order not to report in the media the true scale of the tragedy - not to mention the number of victims of the terrorist attack, the dead children\u2026\n\"Demonstrations of humanity and sympathy for the Russian people are not allowed.\"\nThis is pure parallel reality. The BBC has received no such order. International media organisations widely reported the devastating consequences of the mass shooting and fire at Crocus City.\nAs for sympathy, many Western diplomats visited the Russian foreign ministry to sign a book of condolence and, later, laid flowers for the victims outside Crocus City.\nThat hasn't stopped Russian officials from lining up to blame Ukraine and the West.\nAlexander Bortnikov, head of the FSB security service, told Russian TV:\n\"We believe that the action was prepared by both the Islamist radicals themselves and was facilitated by Western special services. The special services of Ukraine are directly related to this.\"\nLast week President Putin claimed that \"Russia cannot be the target of terrorist attacks by Islamic fundamentalists. We are a country that demonstrates a unique example of interfaith harmony and inter-religious and inter-ethnic unity\".\nYet only last month the FSB reported it had thwarted an IS plot to attack a Moscow synagogue.\nSo why is the Russian leadership seemingly determined to frame Ukraine and the West for the huge loss of life at Crocus City?\nHere are some possible reasons:\nSince the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of its neighbour, Russians have been led to believe that their principal adversaries are Ukraine and the \"collective West\". \nIt's a message the authorities here are unwilling to alter. After all, if the Russian public were to conclude that radical Islam is a greater threat to their security than the Ukrainian government or Western leaders, they may wonder why Moscow hasn't focused on that particular threat and has chosen, instead, to fight Ukraine.\nLast month President Putin publicly dismissed a US embassy warning that an attack by extremists here was \"imminent\". \nHe called the terror alert \"outright blackmail\u2026[with] the intention of intimidating and destabilising our society\". The Crocus City concert hall attack followed days later.\nUS officials subsequently made it clear that the intelligence they had shared with the Russian authorities had been \"specific, timely, and credible\". Blaming Kyiv and the West may be an attempt to distract attention from the question of what information was passed on and how the Russian authorities acted upon it.\nAsserting that Kyiv and the West were connected to the attack gives Moscow a pretext for any future escalation in the war in Ukraine - if it decides it needs it.\nBut some commentators are warning the Russian authorities that, for a political system, identifying the wrong enemy can prove a fatal mistake. \n\"That's the way this type of system usually dies,\" believes political scientist Vladimir Pastukhov, honorary se",
    "The origins of the silver used in 7th Century Anglo-Saxon pennies have been revealed after analysis of 49 coins.\nAnglo-Saxon England experienced a rapid surge in the use of silver coins between 660 and 750 AD, but historians had no \"hard evidence\" of its source.\nThey now know Byzantine bullion and a French silver mine were behind the increase, said the joint Cambridge and Oxford university study.\nProf Rory Naismith said it was \"such an exciting discovery\". \n\"I proposed Byzantine origins a decade ago but couldn't prove it,\" the Cambridge University professor of Early Medieval English History said.\n\"Now we have the first archaeometric confirmation that Byzantine silver was the dominant source behind the great 7th Century surge in minting and trade around the North Sea.\"\nAbout 7,000 silver pennies have been recorded from this time, compared to about the same number for the entire Anglo-Saxon period (5th Century to 1066).\nProf Naismith and his colleagues examined coins held by the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. They were minted in England, the Netherlands, Belgium and northern France.\nThe coins were first given trace element analysis and then analysed using a technique pioneered by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, which also participated in the research.\nA \"portable laser ablation\" was used, in which microscopic samples were collected onto Teflon filters for lead isotope analysis.\nThis established 29 coins from 660 to 750 AD were made from 3rd to 7th Century silver from the Byzantine Empire in the eastern Mediterranean. \nThe researchers, who have published their findings in Antiquity, believe the metal entered Western Europe decades before and was melted down in the late 7th Century \"when a king or lord urgently needed lots of cash\".\nThe study's lead author, Oxford University's Dr Jane Kershaw, said: \"This was quantitative easing, elites were liquidating resources and pouring more and more money into circulation.\"\nThe study's second major finding was that the silver used to mint the 750 to 820 AD coins was very different. It was mined in Melle in Francia, part of modern day western France.\nIt argues the emperor Charlemagne (768-814 AD) drove this very sudden and widespread surge in Melle silver.\nThe authors said this also gives a new context to the emperor's \"delicate diplomatic relations\" with Offa of Mercia (757-796 AD) in England.\nProf Naismith has no doubt that people in England would have been very aware that their silver was coming from Francia and that they depended on it. \n\"[Offa] remained one of Europe's most powerful figures who was outside Charlemagne's control. He certainly didn't have as much silver. So they maintained a pretence of equality,\" he said.\n\"Our findings add to a dynamic that England and France have had for a very long time.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Women employed by Avon Fire & Rescue Service (AFRS) have described a widespread culture of sexism and bullying.\nIt comes after a female firefighter won an employment tribunal on the grounds of sexual discrimination last year.\nThe BBC has heard complaints from serving and former firefighters. There have also been several critical inspectors' reports into the service. \nAFRS said it is taking \"decisive action\" to change its culture.  \nThe BBC has spoken to more than a dozen former and current firefighters at the service who described experiencing sexist comments, bullying, a glass ceiling for women, and a \"climate of fear\" around reporting their concerns.\nSasha Acheson, a former England Rugby player and AFRS firefighter, said she was \"beyond broken\" by her experience at AFRS.\nShe won a landmark employment tribunal case in December 2023 against her former employer. The judge upheld her claims of sex discrimination, victimisation and harassment on grounds of sexual orientation. \nShe said the culture was one in which women were frequently objectified. Soon after she joined AFRS in 2021, she was dismayed by the response to a new female firefighter.  \n\"The first thing my manager said was, 'Is she fit?'\n\"Another girl came out in her gym kit and she was told she should have been working up a sweat in the kitchen.\"  \nShe alleges she was regularly belittled, subjected to sexual comments and at one stage, almost assaulted.  \n\"I actually said to my crew manager at the time, 'I'm not sure if you're aware but the way you speak to or about women is not OK,'\" she said.\n\"He just flipped, marched towards me swearing. I was walking backwards and he was genuinely going to headbutt me.\"   \nShe also believed her career was held back by managers failing to submit papers for training courses that would have helped her win promotion.\nMs Acheson claimed a poisonous atmosphere developed against her. She left AFRS in 2022 with her mental health in tatters.  \nShe said: \"My family and friends have always said that I was the strongest person that they knew and I wasn't then. I was having nightmares. I was in a daze.

I hope that isn't the case.\"\nCurrent chief inspector of Ofsted, Sir Martyn Oliver, said he had no doubt she would help the organisation \"reflect on\" and \"learn from\" its response to Ms Perry's death.\n\"I look forward to receiving her recommendations for improving our policies and practice,\" he added.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

    "An Indian actor running for election as a candidate for the ruling party has been forced to deny eating beef.\nKangana Ranaut, a vocal supporter of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said the claims by her opponents are \"shameful\" and \"baseless rumours\".\nThe issue of beef consumption is highly sensitive in India as cows are considered sacred by Hindus, the country's largest religious group.\nSome BJP politicians have pushed for bans on cattle slaughter.\nRanaut, an award-winning Bollywood star who has featured in some of India's highest-grossing films, responded after an opposition politician claimed she had previously eaten beef.\nSeveral social media users shared screengrabs of what they said were old posts from Ranaut's account as supposed proof of that claim.\nThe allegation is potentially damaging for the actor, who is seeking to make her formal entrance into politics in the coming weeks as a BJP candidate in northern Himachal Pradesh state.\nWriting on X, formerly Twitter, she said: \"I don't consume beef or any other kind of red meat, it is shameful that completely baseless rumours are being spread about me, I have been advocating and promoting yogic and Ayurvedic way of life for decades now such tactics won't work to tarnish my image. \n\"My people know me and they know that I am a proud Hindu and nothing can ever mislead them.\"\nRenaut, 37, signed off her post with the phrase \"Jai Shri Ram\", a proclamation of the Hindu faith.\nCattle production and consumption in India is a highly contentious issue and has led to violence from so-called cow protection vigilante groups, primarily against members of the country's Muslim minority. \nDespite widespread local restrictions on the industry, India is one of the world's largest beef producers, due primarily to its water buffalo market - a species which is exempt from many of the bans.\nThe BJP's previous attempt to implement a nationwide ban on cattle slaughter was overturned by India's highest court in 2017. Several BJP-ruled states have banned the sale and consumption of beef.\nThe party - which is led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and draws its support from the country's Hindu population - is on course to perform strongly in the upcoming elections.\nRanaut is no stranger to controversy. In 2020, at the height of her fame in Hindi cinema, she made a series of serious allegations against people in the industry.\nIn 2021, her account on what was then Twitter was suspended for alleged incitement to violence after she urged Mr Modi to \"tame\" an opposition leader.",

They're aggressive and put a lot of pressure on the boy to pay the money,\" the police force's cyber-crime commander, Matthew Craft, told the Sydney Morning Herald (SMH).\nThe boy died by suicide on the same evening, late last year.\nAustralian detectives worked with their counterparts in South Africa and Nigeria to trace the suspected perpetrators to a slum in Nigeria. The BBC has contacted the Nigerian police for comment.\nEvidence that the pair had also tried to extort other people was found on their phones, according to the SMH. They have been charged over the alleged extortion of the Australian boy, but not his death.\nThere have been several cases in Canada and the US in recent years of teenagers who have killed themselves after being targeted by sextortion plots.\nDet Supt Craft said his team had seen a \"huge spike\" in sextortion cases and has appealed for anyone targeted to contact police.\n\"[They] are up nearly 400% in the last 18 months,\" he said in a statement.\n\"We want young people to continue to report these cases, and to never be embarrassed to talk to police. \n\"Sextortion is a very real crime...

    "\"It's kind of like the end of the world.\"\nThat's how Ryan Milligan from Ardglass in County Down has described experiencing a total solar eclipse.\nHe has previously travelled across Asia, Australia, North and South America as well as Africa to see a solar eclipse at first-hand. \nThe self-declared 'eclipse-chaser' is in Mexico with the hope of witnessing the phenomenon for a 12th time on Monday. \nA solar eclipse happens when the Earth's Moon moves between it and the Sun.\nIf all three are aligned, the Moon casts a shadow on the Earth.\nMr Milligan, a former lorry driver and fish-factory worker, has worked for Nasa and is now a senior lecturer in astrophysics at Queen's University Belfast.\nSpeaking to BBC News NI from Mexico, he described the eclipse experience as \"really visceral\".\nHe said: \"It's kind of like the end of the world. \n\"You can imagine how civilisations in the past might have been terrified at the prospect of a solar eclipse.\n\"Now we understand them a bit better. They're really a unique way to feel the position of the Earth in the solar system and to see the magnificence of the outer solar atmosphere known as the corona. \n\"It's that thrill to see a solar eclipse that inspires us chasers to go literally to the ends of the Earth,\" he added. \nMr Milligan saw his first total eclipse in Turkey in 2006.\nHe said \"nothing compares to the adrenaline rush of being on the path of totality\" when the Moon covers all light from the Sun and darkness fills the sky. \nMr Milligan also said the temperature drop adds to the excitement. \n\"You get these sunsets in the middle of the day, animals go to sleep, stars come out,\" he explained.\n\"The hairs go up on the back of your neck, the adrenaline kicks in because your brain is trying to process what is happening.\n\"In Mexico, we are probably expecting a 10 to 15 degree drop. \n\"Imagine you are out in your T-shirt enjoying the sunshine and suddenly you want to put a jacket on, it's that noticeable a drop. \n\"It adds to the thrill of the experience.\" \nThe 48-year-old has carefully identified Mazatl\u00e1n, Mexico, on the Pacific coast as his prime location, turning down tourist hot spots such as Niagara Falls where a state of emergency has been declared due to the crowds expected. \nHe said the weather was always the \"ultimate factor\". \n\"I've been planning for the guts of a year, because it goes over such populated areas.\n\"You also need to sort out maps of the eclipse path and make sure you'll be in the optimal location and then try and have a Plan B or plan C just on the off chance the clouds do roll in,\" he added.\nThe Moon's full shadow ends its journey across the Earth in the Atlantic Ocean about 620 miles (1,000km) from Cornwall.\nBut it should still be possible to catch a partial eclipse from western parts of the UK, right before sunset.\nYou'll need to be on high ground and have clear sky. \nIn Northern Ireland and western Scotland, where the Moon will eclipse around 20% of the Sun, the weather does not look ideal. \nMonday will see cloudy skies for most with spells of rain in south-west Scotland and Northern Ireland, according to BBC Weather. \nIn Wales and west England there will only be a small slither  - 2% to 10% of an eclipse - and the weather is also looking cloudy with rain. \nThe next total solar eclipse is expected in August 2026 but it will be a little closer to home.\n\"Europe hasn't really had a full total solar eclipse since 2015 and that one only went over the Faroe Islands and Svalbard,\" Mr Milligan said.\n\"That year I went to the Faroe Islands and of course the north Atlantic weather got the better of us and we were clouded out. We didn't get to see totality and it was very disappointing.\n\"Europe's been deprived of total solar eclipses for a number of decades now and I've had to travel all over Asia, Australia twice, South America twice, North America twice, even Africa, to see these things. \n\"Having one in your own back yard in a couple of years will be really something to look forward to.\"",
    "A new drone attack on Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia power plant has raised the risk of a \"major nuclear accident\", the UN's atomic watchdog has warned.\nRussia said Ukraine was behind the attack, which it said injured three people. Ukraine has denied involvement.\nThe giant Russian-held nuclear plant, with six reactors, is on the frontline of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\nThe UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly warned against such attacks.\nIAEA head Rafael Grossi said Sunday's drone strike was \"reckless\" and \"a major escalation of the nuclear safety and security dangers\" facing the plant.\nThe Zaporizhzhia plant, in southern Ukraine, is the largest in Europe. Russian forces seized it shortly after launching their February 2022 full-scale invasion and have occupied it ever since, alongside most of the Zaporizhzhia region.\nThe facility stopped generating power in 2022, but needs a constant supply of electricity to cool one of its reactors which is in a state of \"hot conservation\", meaning it is not fully offline. \nThe IAEA, which has a team of experts at Zaporizhzhia, confirmed \"physical impact of drone attacks\" at the plant, including at one of the reactors. \nThe plant's Russian-installed administration said radiation levels were normal and that there was no serious damage. \nThe IAEA said the damage had not compromised nuclear safety, but it warned that \"this is a serious incident with potential to undermine [the] integrity of the reactor's containment system\".\nMr Grossi specified there had been \"at least three direct hits\" against the plant's \"main reactor containment structures\".\n\"This cannot happen,\" he said. \"No one can conceivably benefit or get any military or political advantage from attacks against nuclear facilities. This is a no go.\"\nBoth Russia and Ukraine regularly accuse each other of shelling the plant and risking a serious nuclear accident. \nThe plant's Russian administration has said Ukraine's armed forces were behind the attack, but Ukraine has denied the allegation. \nOn Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the attacks were a \"very dangerous provocation\".\nUkrainian Main Intelligence Directorate spokesman Andriy Yusov told the Ukrainska Pravda news website that \"Ukraine was not involved in any armed provocations on the site.\"\nThe plant is \"illegally occupied by Russia,\" he added. \nMr Yusov accused Russia of endangering the nuclear facility, the civilian population and the environment by carrying out strikes on the plant itself. \nLast month the IAEA said its team of experts at the plant had heard explosions every day for a week. \nAt the time, Mr Grossi said: \"For more than two years now, nuclear safety and security in Ukraine has been in constant jeopardy. We remain determined to do everything we can to help minimise the risk of a nuclear accident that could harm people and the environment, not only in Ukraine.\"\nThe region of Zaporizhzhia came under fire early on Monday morning.  Governor Ivan Federov said three people were killed and three more were wounded after Russian forces struck eight populated areas over 350 times in the space of 24 hours. \nLast week, a Russian strike on the city of Zaporizhzhia killed four people and wounded more than 20.",

    "New robots that can find prescriptions on shelves in pharmacies far faster than humans can have been put into two hospitals.\nThe Royal Preston and Chorley and South Ribble Hospital have installed dual systems that are like \"giant vending machines\" with moving picking arms.\nHospital chiefs said automated picking had been used for 16 years, but the new robots were faster.\nAnd they assured the systems would not lead to pharmacy job cuts. \nThey new robots would mean the hospitals' 220 pharmacists would have even more time to devote to patient care.\nRichard Marshall, the lead pharmacy technician for procurement at the Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: \"Everyone thinks systems like these take people's jobs, but the pharmacy staff has grown, if anything.\n\"Instead of having people constantly picking all of these things manually, they can be out at the patients' bedsides, checking their take-home medicines, checking what they brought in and providing advice on how to get the best out of their medicines.\"\nThe robot are so big they each require their own room, with the system at the Royal Preston having the capacity to store 40,000 medicine packs.\nThe Chorley robot will pick from around 12,000 items.\nThe robots spring into life when a label is generated. \u00a0 \nThe prescription is then picked and carried by conveyor belt to a collection point.\n\"It reduces the risk of medication errors, such as selecting the wrong pack size or strength,\" Mr Marshall said.\nThere is also still human oversight at the other end of the process from a dispenser and a second checker - with the accuracy of the original label being key to the whole process.\nThe automated system also helps reduce waste, as the the shortest-dated products are automatically selected first.\nChorley Hospital received its new pharmacy robot late last year, while the Royal Preston's is almost fully up and running after a six-week installation period.\nDuring that time, staff had to revert to the hand-picking process, which some of them had never had to do before.\nWhy not follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram?

    "Stormont's infrastructure minister has ruled out mutualising NI Water, saying it would inevitably mean household water bills.\nMutualisation would involve converting NI Water from a government company to one owned by its customers.\nMLAs have been debating a UUP motion calling for a review of NI Water which could involve mutualisation.\nJohn O'Dowd said while the principle of a mutual company may appear to have merits, it would involve charging.\n\"Fundamentally a mutual company requires a guaranteed and predictable funding stream which is not subject to direct political control or competing public sector priorities,\" Mr O'Dowd told the Assembly on Monday.\n\"Mutualisation leads directly to domestic water charges, there's no other way around it,\" he added.\n\"If you want to go down the mutualisation route you end up charging hard-pressed workers and families directly for water.\"\nWelsh Water has a structure similar to a mutual company, with the typical household paying about \u00a3500 a year.\nLast month, a report from the NI Audit Office (NIAO) said there should be a comprehensive expert review of how NI Water is funded and governed.\nIt said NI Water has struggled to secure adequate funding for infrastructure upgrades since it was established in 2007.\nIt added that the investment deficit could \"profoundly affect\" the ability of the Executive to deliver its economic priorities.\nThe water system in Northern Ireland is largely funded by government resources rather than consumer charges. \nStormont's parties are resistant to introducing the sort of charges applied in other parts of the UK.\nThe NIAO report found an agreed plan to spend \u00a32.1bn on infrastructure between 2021 and 2027 may not be fully realised.\nIt said the Department for Infrastructure (DfI) had been able to provide the required level of funding in the first two years of the plan.\nHowever, the department has recently confirmed that NI Water's capital funding allocations in 2023-24 and 2024-25 are \"significantly below the level indicated by NI Water as being required to deliver on planned objectives.\"\nThe NIAO said this highlights \"the inherent ineffectiveness\" of current arrangements to support long-term investment plans.",
    "The interim DUP leader Gavin Robinson has said there has been \"no contact on a party basis whatsoever\" with Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.\nSir Jeffrey resigned as Democratic Unionist leader on 29 March, after being charged with rape and other historical sexual offences.\nHe has said he will strenuously contest the allegations.\nSpeaking on Radio Ulster's Talkback programme, Mr Robinson said Sir Jeffrey currently holds no role within the DUP.\nHe said he did not know if party colleagues had been in contact with Sir Jeffrey on a personal basis.\nMr Robinson also said he does not know if his predecessor will resign his Lagan Valley Westminster seat, which would bring about a by-election, but said the DUP is searching for a different candidate for the seat in the event of a general election.\nHe said he found out about the allegations against Sir Jeffrey the evening before they became public.\nThe East Belfast MP said the DUP \"recognised that our shock would be replicated right throughout communities, in individual homes right throughout Northern Ireland.\n\"But Gavin Robinson the person, or myself as an individual, that's quite irrelevant in the situation in the sense that we collectively put ourselves forward to give leadership, to give hope, to give vision to the communities we're honoured to represent.\n\"So you have to set aside some of the [personal] thoughts, some of those feelings and say there might be some weight on my shoulders now, but I have big broad shoulders.\"\nThose hoping to get the inside story on Sir Jeffrey Donaldson's sudden departure from the DUP will be disappointed, but not surprised, by what they heard from Gavin Robinson.\nThe party's interim leader was never going to divulge details of those sensitive conversations on the night Sir Jeffrey was charged and quit as DUP leader.\nBut he did reveal that contact had to be made to get an understanding of what had happened, though there wasn't much \"toing and froing\".\nIn other words, a call was made. \nHe said it quickly became clear that the prospect of Sir Jeffrey staying on as party leader was \"unsustainable\".\nThe party had to \"grasp that nettle\", he said.\nMr Robinson also revealed that all political links between Sir Jeffrey and the party he once led had been cut, though he added he could not speak for some of his colleagues who may have maintained a personal link with the former leader. \nFor the first time we learned that the DUP is actively searching for a candidate to contest the Westminster election in Lagan Valley, a seat still being held by Sir Jeffrey as an independent MP. \nMr Robinson said he had spoken to former DUP leaders Peter Robinson and Arlene Foster since becoming interim leader.\nHe said the past 10 days had been difficult, but added: \"Its not a DUP story, it's not a story about me or anyone else within the party.\"\nHe said party supporters \"recognise that we have done what we can do under the circumstances and we are moving forward with our job, which is to represent Northern Ireland.\n\"There's an opportunity for us to come together and move forward very purposefully.\" \nEarlier, DUP Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly said she was \"absolutely determined to provide what stability I can\" to ensure that the Northern Ireland Executive can continue in a positive tone. \n\"We have an important number of weeks coming up where we'll be discussing the programme for government and the budget,\" she said.\nFirst Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn F\u00e9in, said it was \"business as usual as far as the executive is concerned\". \nThey were speaking after the first full in-person meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in Armagh since 2016.\nA 57-year-old woman has been charged with aiding and abetting in connection with the offences Sir Jeffrey is charged with.\nBoth are due to appear in court this month.\nLast week Mr Robinson - who is also the East Belfast MP - said he had been engaging with colleagues and that the previous week had been \"incredibly difficult and shocking\".\nBut he said the news \"should not deflect from the important task we have ahead of us as representatives for unionism and for Northern Ireland\".",

    "The first government inspection of a new prison has found illegal drugs are widely available and inmates are not suitably supported by staff.\nCategory C jail HMP Five Wells opened in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, in 2022 and is run by security firm G4S.\nHis Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) noted high levels of self-harm among prisoners and poor food.\nThe prison said it had put an action plan in place to address the concerns raised by inspectors.\nHMP Five Wells has capacity to house up to 1,687 prisoners with up to two years left on their sentences.\nIt was built on the site of the former HMP Wellingborough, which closed in 2012.\nThe HMIP report noted drugs remained a \"huge problem\" in the prison and random testing suggested about a third of all prisoners were active users. \nJust over half of inmates said it was \"easy\" to get hold of illegal drugs, against an average of 32% in other similar prisons.\nThe rate of self-harm incidents in the prison was also high and inspectors said not enough was being done to reduce them. \nThere had been 1,256 recorded incidents in the 12 months before the inspection took place, which the report concluded was \"very high\" compared with other establishments.\nIt also found staff lacked confidence in supervising prisoners and were not given sufficient support. \nHowever, the report also highlighted some positives, stating the general environment and living conditions were excellent, while access to amenities was reasonable.\nWriting in the report, chief inspector of prisons, Charlie Taylor, said: \"Opening a new prison is one of the toughest challenges in prison management and a first inspection is an important milestone in the life of an institution. It would be unrealistic to expect that all would be perfect.\n\"Our inspection notes the very real difficulties leaders have faced. Stronger governance, oversight and supervision, the building of staff confidence and capability, and a more active and purposeful regime should now be the focus.\"\nAn HMP Five Wells spokesperson said: \"We have put in place an action plan that addresses all HMIP's key priorities with a focus on recruitment, retention, addressing the ingress of drugs, governance and oversight.\n\"Inspectors said rates of violence and self-harm are falling and this downward trajectory has continued since the inspection.\n\"We are committed to developing a stronger and broader purposeful activity, skills and education programme to enhance employment opportunities for prisoners.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

It's awful.\n\"[When] it gets really bad and the cold air hurts my hands, I wear gloves.\"\nMr Fuller, who lives alone after his wife, Pauline, died from a brain tumour, said his rheumatoid arthritis had \"worsened\" since moving there.\nHe said Gentoo had come and \"had a look\", but he felt their response was unsatisfactory.\n\"I am nearly 70 and I want to be able go to bed comfortable without any cold draughts,\" he said. \"Either that, [or] move me into a warmer property.\n\u201cI just want a warm home, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get that with Gentoo.\u201d\nIn response, Gentoo's chief executive officer Louise Bassett said she was \"very sorry to hear of the issues\" raised by tenants to the BBC.\n\"As soon as we were made aware of these issues, we reached out to Mr Ivison and Mr Fuller to apologise and to rectify the issues in their homes,\" she said.\nMs Bassett said Gentoo had agreed to install a new kitchen in Mr Ivison's home and had been attempting to do this since 2022, but she said he had refused the work because he was worried about the disruption it would cause.\nThe company had since offered to replace his bathroom, she added.\nShe said the housing group had also visited Mr Fuller ahead of plans to \"fill any draught holes\", while topping up loft insulation and applying thermal paint to his home.\nMs Bassett added that \"damp and mould\" was a \"challenge across the housing sector\", which could have \"a significant impact on people's lives\".\nShe said last year Gentoo had set up a dedicated team to ensure customers were \"supported as quickly as possible with any issues\", and urged tenants with concerns to contact them directly.\n\"Our customers deserve the best standards of service from Gentoo and in this situation we have not got things right,\" she said.\n\"We are determined to listen and act on feedback from our customers and will ensure we learn from this situation.\"\nHousing Secretary Michael Gove earlier this year said new legislation - known as Awaab's Law - would force social housing landlords to carry out repairs more quickly.\nJohn Hume, chief executive of the People's Health Trust, said millions of people across England faced \"damp and mould\", causing a \"myriad\u201d of physical and mental health problems.\nHe said the government needed to ensure any new legislation was actively \"enforced\" to guarantee that social housing landlords resolved such issues in a timely manner.\nThe Regulator of Social Housing (RSH) said while it was unable to comment on individ",
    "The daughter of 77-year-old man who waited almost 20 hours for an ambulance says they were offered \u201cabsolutely no support\u201d from the NHS.\nClive Thomas broke his neck when he fell out of bed on 31 March, but his wife was told there were \"no ambulances available\" when she called 999.\nMr Thomas was told that he had \"probably pulled a muscle\" so he decided to stay at home, but decided to call for an ambulance again on Saturday.\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service said it was sorry to hear about the experience and is committed to delivering high quality care.\nClive Thomas, of Neath, Port Talbot, who has osteoporosis, a condition that weakens bone strength, waited until 19:00 BST on Saturday, 6th April to find out he had broken his neck.\nCeri Moran, his daughter, said \"the doctors didn't seem to care\" about her father's injuries, and that the whole situation was \"demoralising\".\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service said first responders arrived at Mr Thomas' home in Neath two hours after the call was made to 999, but Mr Thomas' daughter said they arrived with \"inadequate space or equipment for his injuries\".\nAn ambulance and paramedic team arrived at 9:46 on Saturday morning and took Mr Thomas to Morriston hospital, where he waited around a further five hours to be seen by a doctor. \nMs Moran said: \u201cI arrived at the hospital and was told to go outside and find ambulance 319 as that\u2019s where they were looking after him.\n\u201cHe was lying on the bed with nothing supporting his neck. I don\u2019t think they thought anything of his injuries at the time.\u201d\nShe added: \"Surely there have to be exceptions for elderly, vulnerable people.\n\"We\u2019re lucky that at the very least he was seen. It could\u2019ve easily gone the other way, he could\u2019ve been left paralysed.\u201d\nLiam Williams, of the Welsh Ambulance Service, said: \u201cWe invite Mr Thomas, or a representative, to contact us directly so that we can better understand their concerns and investigate what happened in this instance.\u201d\nSwansea Bay health board said Morriston Hospital was \"under extreme pressure\" for a number of days, which led to it declaring a \"business continuity incident\", its highest level of escalation.\n\"We apologise to any patients who have experienced longer waits, as we fully understand how frustrating and distressing that can be,\" a spokesperson for the health board said.\n\"We will of course respond directly to patients or families if they contact us with their concerns.\"\nThe health board added it had now \"de-escalated\" but the hospital remained \"very busy\", and asked people to only use A&E as a last resort.",
    "A former consultant at the Southern Health Trust has told an inquiry into urology services that waiting lists are the \"greatest source of patient harm\".\nThe inquiry was established in 2021 and is examining the trust's handling of urology services prior to May 2020.\nAidan O'Brien became a consultant urologist in Craigavon Area Hospital in July 1992.\nHis work is at the centre of the inquiry.\nGiving evidence on Monday, he said waiting list figures highlighted what \"myself and my colleagues [have said] for decades\" and described it as a \"grossly inadequate service\".\n\"If you look at four-and-a-half years for urgent surgery, it is appalling,\" he told the inquiry.\n\"I don't have a magic solution to the current situation, which is dire.\"\nNow retired, Mr O'Brien held a number of senior roles for almost 28 years.\nWhen asked why his patient review lists were longer than some of his colleagues, he said: \"I don't know\".\nHe then set out possible reasons for the disparity, including the nature of cases, surgery, and the focus for different consultants.\nSpeaking about a 2009 review which was endorsed by the then-health minister in March 2010, Mr O'Brien said the recommendations were \"top-down\" with the need for greater manpower, beds and theatre services.\nWhen lead counsel to the inquiry Martin Wolfe KC asked Mr O'Brien if taking on additional slots to cope with workload pressures meant he was taking more risks elsewhere, he answered \"yes\".\nMr O'Brien said in retrospect, after statements from colleagues were put to him, t was a \"major regret\" that he was trying to juggle too much.\n\"Ethically and compassionately if you are reading and trying to respond to cries of desperation everyday,\" he explained.\n\"I couldn't pass up the opportunity to operate on two or three more patients.\"\nHe said additional work was done in his own time.\nDuring Monday's session, Mr O'Brien was also asked about other working practices and productivity.\nIt was put to him that in 2017, he was the only consultant in urology not using digital dictation.\nHe was also questioned about his choice to telephone patients about treatment when he could have passed that responsibility on to a scheduler or an assistant.\nMr O'Brien dismissed these claims as \"a lot of almost gossip, it's rumour\".\n\"I never created admin havoc in theatre or scheduling of patients because I paid attention to it,\" he added.\n\"With regard to triage, it's grossly exaggerated.\n\"I go back to the inadequacy once again. I'm not sure the modern ways are an improvement to patient experience.\"",
    "The interim DUP leader Gavin Robinson has said there has been \"no contact on a party basis whatsoever\" with Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.\nSir Jeffrey resigned as Democratic Unionist leader on 29 March, after being charged with rape and other historical sexual offences.\nHe has said he will strenuously contest the allegations.\nSpeaking on Radio Ulster's Talkback programme, Mr Robinson said Sir Jeffrey currently holds no role within the DUP.\nHe said he did not know if party colleagues had been in contact with Sir Jeffrey on a personal basis.\nMr Robinson also said he does not know if his predecessor will resign his Lagan Valley Westminster seat, which would bring about a by-election, but said the DUP is searching for a different candidate for the seat in the event of a general election.\nHe said he found out about the allegations against Sir Jeffrey the evening before they became public.\nThe East Belfast MP said the DUP \"recognised that our shock would be replicated right throughout communities, in individual homes right throughout Northern Ireland.\n\"But Gavin Robinson the person, or myself as an individual, that's quite irrelevant in the situation in the sense that we collectively put ourselves forward to give leadership, to give hope, to give vision to the communities we're honoured to represent.\n\"So you have to set aside some of the [personal] thoughts, some of those feelings and say there might be some weight on my shoulders now, but I have big broad shoulders.\"\nThose hoping to get the inside story on Sir Jeffrey Donaldson's sudden departure from the DUP will be disappointed, but not surprised, by what they heard from Gavin Robinson.\nThe party's interim leader was never going to divulge details of those sensitive conversations on the night Sir Jeffrey was charged and quit as DUP leader.\nBut he did reveal that contact had to be made to get an understanding of what had happened, though there wasn't much \"toing and froing\".\nIn other words, a call was made. \nHe said it quickly became clear that the prospect of Sir Jeffrey staying on as party leader was \"unsustainable\".\nThe party had to \"grasp that nettle\", he said.\nMr Robinson also revealed that all political links between Sir Jeffrey and the party he once led had been cut, though he added he could not speak for some of his colleagues who may have maintained a personal link with the former leader. \nFor the first time we learned that the DUP is actively searching for a candidate to contest the Westminster election in Lagan Valley, a seat still being held by Sir Jeffrey as an independent MP. \nMr Robinson said he had spoken to former DUP leaders Peter Robinson and Arlene Foster since becoming interim leader.\nHe said the past 10 days had been difficult, but added: \"Its not a DUP story, it's not a story about me or anyone else within the party.\"\nHe said party supporters \"recognise that we have done what we can do under the circumstances and we are moving forward with our job, which is to represent Northern Ireland.\n\"There's an opportunity for us to come together and move forward very purposefully.\" \nEarlier, DUP Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly said she was \"absolutely determined to provide what stability I can\" to ensure that the Northern Ireland Executive can continue in a positive tone. \n\"We have an important number of weeks coming up where we'll be discussing the programme for government and the budget,\" she said.\nFirst Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn F\u00e9in, said it was \"business as usual as far as the executive is concerned\". \nThey were speaking after the first full in-person meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in Armagh since 2016.\nA 57-year-old woman has been charged with aiding and abetting in connection with the offences Sir Jeffrey is charged with.\nBoth are due to appear in court this month.\nLast week Mr Robinson - who is also the East Belfast MP - said he had been engaging with colleagues and that the previous week had been \"incredibly difficult and shocking\".\nBut he said the news \"should not deflect from the important task we have ahead of us as representatives for unionism and for Northern Ireland\".",
    "The final unlisted cabmen's shelter in London has now been awarded Grade II status, Historic England has announced.\nThe green wooden hut in Wellington Place, St John's Wood is one of only 13 shelters still standing in the capital.\nFirst introduced to the city in 1875, the buildings were created to give cabmen a place to rest and get hot food, and are still in use today.\nTwelve of them had previously been given protection, with the Wellington Place hut now also listed.\nSixty-one shelters are known to have been built across London between 1875 and 1950.\nThey were conceived by Capt George C Armstrong, who was editor of The Globe newspaper, after he struggled to find a cab during a storm because all the drivers had sought shelter from the elements in local pubs.\nWorking with a group of wealthy philanthropists, he helped establish the Cabmen's Shelter Fund which built the huts along many major thoroughfares to provide warm and dry rest stops at ranks.\nThe first was then erected in February 1875 on Acacia Road in St John's Wood - conveniently outside Armstrong's home. \nAll the shelters had the same proportions, with none bigger than a horse and cart as they were built on public highways at a time when cabs were all horse-drawn.\nThey featured a small kitchen and space for about 10 drivers to sit, with gambling, drinking and swearing being strictly forbidden while inside them.\nThe shelters are still in use today and while drivers with \"The Knowledge\" are only able to take a seat inside, many of the huts do offer takeaway refreshments to the public too.\nThe hut in Wellington Place, known locally as the Chapel, has been listed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport on the advice of Historic England, giving it special protection against any possible redevelopment.\nLuke Jacob, listing adviser at Historic England, said the shelters were \"distinctive relics of the horse-drawn age in the capital\".\n\"As we approach the 150th anniversary of the Cabmen's Shelter Fund it is fitting that the final shelter on Wellington Place - lucky number 13 - has received the official recognition it deserves through listing,\" he added.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A mother who had to take her son to A&E with breathing problems caused by their mouldy home says she is \"extremely worried\" about his health.\nLouise Moore lives in a ForHousing property in Salford with her 11-year-old son and six-year-old daughter. \nShe said the family were desperate to find a new home after damp and mould problems persisted, despite the firm making repairs. \nForHousing has apologised\u00a0to the family and said more work was being planned. \nThe family have lived at the property on Newgate Drive in Little Hulton for more than ten years, but problems with damp and mould started to take hold last summer, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. \nMs Moore reported the issue to her landlord in August, but it took until November for an inspection to take place.\nIn the same month, she took her son Jayden to A&E after he started to suffer from breathing problems, \nThe visit led a nurse from\u00a0Salford Primary Care Together to urge the housing provider to fix the mould problems \"as a matter of urgency\".\nMs Moore said repairs took place to clean and repaint some of the affected areas in January, but the problems continued, and some of the new treatment work caused her son to suffer further chest problems. \n\"I felt like they were trying to cover the problem up rather than deal with it,\" the 31-year-old said. \nNigel Sedman, a director of homes at ForHousing, said the provider had offered further repairs, but Ms Moore said she declined over fears it could make her son's issues worse.  \n\"I'm extremely worried about his health, some nights he can't even be in his room.\"\nMs Moore said she raised a formal complaint in February and had been offered compensation, but added she was still waiting for the outcome of an investigation by ForHousing.\nShe said efforts to leave the property had been difficult because rental prices were unaffordable, despite her working long hours at a hospital.\nMr Sedman said the housing company would do \"all we can to support Louise and her family\" while they searched for a new home, and would carry out \"any repairs that are needed so they feel safe and comfortable where they live.\"  \nWhy not follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X and Instagram?

And we're going to have to carry on campaigning for that to occur.\"\nMr Bates said the campaign group would \"start looking at prosecutions\" after the public inquiry into the scandal ends, adding that some of the bonuses paid to Post Office bosses over the years should be \"clawed back\".\nThe public inquiry will resume on Tuesday. The latest hearings will last 15 weeks, and witnesses will include key figures at the heart of the scandal - including Mr Bates and former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells.\nHundreds of sub-postmasters were prosecuted for theft and false accounting by the Post Office - which is owned by the government - based on a faulty accounting software system called Horizon. Many poured in their own life savings to cover shortfalls in the accounts.\nThe Post Office scandal is widely regarded as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history. The government is introducing legislation to overturn the convictions of sub-postmasters linked to Horizon. \nMr Hollinrake admitted on Monday that wrongly prosecuted sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses were not being compensated quickly enough, and that the process of financial redress needed to be simplified.\n\"We do need to compensate people, that's the first thing we need to do and we haven't been compensating people quickly enough. We need to accelerate that,\" Mr Hollinrake said on the BBC Breakfast programme, which was broadcast from Fenny Compton, the Warwickshire village where Mr Bates convened the first gathering of sub-postmasters in 2009.\nThere are also three main compensation schemes aimed at groups of victims who had different experiences of the scandal. The Post Office has further details on the scheme on its website.\nThe government has provided funding to the Post Office for these payments, but MPs have warned that the Post Office is \"not fit\" to run any compensation scheme, that it is removed from involvement, and replaced by a new independent body.\nMr Hollinrake told the audience: \"We need to simplify the process is what we need to do. If you've had a conviction then you can go down two routes - the fixed sum award of \u00a3600,000 which you get pretty much immediately or the full assessment route [which is] is more complicated, it does take more time. We are keen to make that as streamlined as possible.\"\nDavid Morley, a former sub-postmaster, said that in 2001: \"I proved in front of Post Office managers and in front of Fujitsu managers that the system was faulty and they did have remote access to postmasters' accounts. Now my question to you sir is do you think evidence of that meeting was deliberately suppressed?\"\nMr Hollinrake said he couldn't say if it was deliberately suppressed \"because I wasn't there and wasn't party to the conversations afterwards but someone knew something at a very early stage\". \nMany Post Office victims who appeared on the programme became emotional when telling their stories.\nJess Kaur was a postmistress in Walsall in the West Midlands and suffered a mental breakdown after being wrongly accused in 2009 of stealing \u00a311,000. \n\"When I was in hospital, the Post Office sent their own doctors to see if I was actually ill. And that's what really hurt the most,\" she recalled.\nOther former postmasters gasped as she said the Post Office did not believe she was in hospital for having a mental breakdown. Charges against Ms Kaur were dropped in 2011, but she said there had been \"too many broken promises\" for her to know when the final \"win\" would happen for her and others falsely accused.\nSeema Misra was sent to prison while she was pregnant. She was a sub-postmistress in West Byfleet, Surrey, and was wrongfully accused of stealing \u00a370,000. \nAlthough she was cleared in 2021, she said she was \"still fighting on til the proper accountability is done\". \nOn the day she was sentenced it was her son's 10th birthday. \"We did not know what to say to him. We told him because mummy's pregnant she's just gone to a special hospital.\"\nOn the morning she was due to go to court, she had said to her son that she would see him later that day. \"Why would someone send me to prison for a crime I never committed?\" she said tearfully.\nMark Kelly was a sub-postmaster in Swansea from 2003 t",
    "A mother who had to take her son to A&E with breathing problems caused by their mouldy home says she is \"extremely worried\" about his health.\nLouise Moore lives in a ForHousing property in Salford with her 11-year-old son and six-year-old daughter. \nShe said the family were desperate to find a new home after damp and mould problems persisted, despite the firm making repairs. \nForHousing has apologised\u00a0to the family and said more work was being planned. \nThe family have lived at the property on Newgate Drive in Little Hulton for more than ten years, but problems with damp and mould started to take hold last summer, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. \nMs Moore reported the issue to her landlord in August, but it took until November for an inspection to take place.\nIn the same month, she took her son Jayden to A&E after he started to suffer from breathing problems, \nThe visit led a nurse from\u00a0Salford Primary Care Together to urge the housing provider to fix the mould problems \"as a matter of urgency\".\nMs Moore said repairs took place to clean and repaint some of the affected areas in January, but the problems continued, and some of the new treatment work caused her son to suffer further chest problems. \n\"I felt like they were trying to cover the problem up rather than deal with it,\" the 31-year-old said. \nNigel Sedman, a director of homes at ForHousing, said the provider had offered further repairs, but Ms Moore said she declined over fears it could make her son's issues worse.  \n\"I'm extremely worried about his health, some nights he can't even be in his room.\"\nMs Moore said she raised a formal complaint in February and had been offered compensation, but added she was still waiting for the outcome of an investigation by ForHousing.\nShe said efforts to leave the property had been difficult because rental prices were unaffordable, despite her working long hours at a hospital.\nMr Sedman said the housing company would do \"all we can to support Louise and her family\" while they searched for a new home, and would carry out \"any repairs that are needed so they feel safe and comfortable where they live.\"  \nWhy not follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X and Instagram?

    "Ambulance delays meant that a seriously ill patient ran out of oxygen while he was being treated by community first responders, an inquest has heard.\nHoward Tucker, 65, from Rhyl had a history of breathing difficulties, and developed problems on 5 November, 2022.\nA community first responder arrived quickly and gave him oxygen, but the supply ran out before paramedics could get there.\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service says it has changed the way it communicates with its community first responders to prevent future incidents.\nKeith Jones was the first responder and spoke at an inquest into Mr Tucker's death on Monday.\nMr Jones did basic health checks on Mr Tucker and gave him oxygen as the levels in his blood were low, before reporting to ambulance control.\nHowever, control told him that a paramedic crew was not immediately available as backup.\n\u201cAround 6:30pm, the oxygen ran out - Mr Tucker was struggling to breathe and talk,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHe put his hand out, as if to say \u2018please could you help me\u2019, but I felt helpless.  He went into cardiac arrest.\u201d\nAn ambulance arrived half an hour after the oxygen supply ran out, but paramedics were unable to save Mr Tucker.\nEven if ambulance backup had arrived soon, consultant pathologist Mark Atkinson told the inquest, there was no guarantee Mr Tucker would have survived.\n\u201cHe had COPD and profound pneumonia, and with other things going on, it\u2019s likely he would have passed, even with additional oxygen supply,\u201d he said. \nJonathan Johnston, national volunteer manager with the Welsh Ambulance Service said  community first responders now have more direct access to medical expertise - a change put in place as a result of Mr Tucker\u2019s death.\n\u201cThis is one example of the pressure that hospital delays are putting on our community volunteers,\u201d he said.\nSpeaking after the hearing, Sharon Hunt, Mr Tucker\u2019s partner said: \u201cKeith was amazing.\n\u201cHe did everything he could and kept me informed as he was trying to get backup.\n\u201cI miss Howard.

    "A museum dedicated to the history of armed policing has closed after the charity that ran it moved out, largely due to ongoing costs.\nIt opened about five years ago in the old police station in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, and was visited by the Princess Royal.\nMark Williams, chief executive of the Police Firearms Officers Association (PFOA), said it decided to hand back the lease to Cambridgeshire Police, with the site costing \"more and more money to maintain\".\nHe said the charity would not reopen a museum at its new headquarters.\nExhibitions at the former museum detailed the use of firearms going back to the 1600s.\nIt also had a virtual firing range, showing how officers would be tested in real-life situations.\nFirst reported by Cambs News, the PFOA, which also occupied the former police station on East Park Street, decided to close the doors and hand back the keys at the end of February.\nThe charity has since set up a base at South Fens Business Centre in Fenton Way.\nMr Williams said it took on the old police station under a maintenance lease, which meant it was responsible for its upkeep.\nOver about nine years he said about \u00a3100,000 was spent on it, which included asbestos removal from the roof and fitting air conditioning.\nHe said the museum had planning permission to expand upwards and moves were made to purchase the freehold of the site, but due to cost pressures and issues around the maintenance of a nearby radio mast, the decision was made to relocate.\nMr Williams said he was a \"little bit gutted\" and \"disappointed\" the charity could not make the old location work in the longer term, with the museum being \"a sideline to help us educate the public about what we do\".\nHe said some of the exhibits were being sent to new homes, but the remaining ones \u2013 including documentation \u2013 were still being stored safely with \"nothing thrown away\".\nJames Haylett, chief executive of the office of the police and crime commissioner for Cambridgeshire, said moves to sell the building to the PFOA stalled after \"terms of the sale of the freehold could not be agreed\".\n\"The PFOA operated the break clause in their lease and the building was vacated by them earlier this year,\" he said.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A sex attacker dubbed \"The Fox\" is now eligible for parole board hearings, a TV documentary has revealed.\nChannel 5 will air a documentary about a series of burglaries and sex attacks in 1984 across Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire.\nMalcolm Fairley was sentenced to six life sentences for his crimes at St Albans Crown Court in 1985.\nThe Parole Board said Fairley was refused parole in October and has not yet been referred for his next review.\nRetired Det Ch Supt Brian Prickett said Fairley was \"still a real risk to the public\".\nFairley was named \"The Fox\", because he would build dens in the houses he broke into while waiting for homeowners to return. \nHe prepared and ate meals in their homes, watched television and collected trophies.\nFairley, masked and brandishing a shotgun, would then commit crimes such as rape, indecent assault and other violent attacks.\nAt the height of his offending, in the summer of 1984, there were three attacks in one week. \nIt became one of the largest police manhunts in British criminal history with 200 officers involved.\nThe documentary, The Intruder: He's Watching You From Within, will include police interviews never heard before, in which Fairley confessed to the crimes and explained why he did them.\nMr Prickett, who led the investigation into Fairley's crimes, told ITN: \"Malcolm Fairley should never come out of prison after all the fear and harm he put into the community. \n\"He never deserves to be released because I think he's still a real risk to the public.\"\nFairley also committed break-ins and sexual crimes in Milton Keynes, South Yorkshire and his native north east. \nHe was arrested in September 1984 at his home in Kentish Town, north London, after forensic evidence linked his car to an attack. \nAt the time of his arrest Fairley had committed 81 offences.\nIn the documentary, Det Ch Supt Prickett talks about finally coming face-to-face with Fairley: \"When I first saw him he said to me, 'I'd seen you on the television a few times, and I never thought I'd see you in real life'. I said to him, 'I knew I'd see you'.\n\"We said, 'Why did you do it? Tell us why. Do you realise what you did to these people? Are you sorry?' He shrugged his shoulders. He never showed any remorse, or he never once asked, 'How are these people?' Not once.\n\"Psychiatrists said that he was rational and that he was normal. Well, I never accepted that. As a police officer, you deal with him professionally, but as a human being to human being, you've got complete disgust, you've got almost hatred. \n\"I don't think I'll ever understand the motivation he had for the attacks he carried out.\"\nMr Justice Caulfield sentenced Fairley following his trial at St Albans Crown Court in February 1985. \nHe said: \"There are degrees of wickedness beyond condemnatory description. Your crimes fall within this category. You desecrated and defiled men and women in their own homes.\"\nA spokesperson from Bedfordshire Police said Fairley attracted little suspicion in his everyday life, although he was known for petty crimes the father-of-three seemed to live a \"somewhat normal family life\".\nThe documentary has been produced by ITN Productions and commissioned for Channel 5.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Singer Feargal Sharkey joined campaigners in calling for a clean up of a lake on Monday.\nThe environmentalist joined Save Windermere's weekly protest outside water firm United Utilities' information office in the Lake District town.\nThe water company said it invested billions in keeping water clean, but campaigners believe not enough is being done to tackle sewage pollution in the lake.\nMr Sharkey said: \"If we cannot figure out how to preserve something as precious as... Windermere, what chance does any other brook, pond or lake have?\"\nStorm overflows are used in times of heavy rain, when the sewer system is at capacity. When this happens, the overflow will discharge dilute sewage into rivers.\nSave Windermere said the discharge of sewage into the lake by United Utilities had significantly contributed to a degradation in water quality at the site.\nEnvironmental problems at the lake in recent years have included the presence of harmful blue-green algae blooms, which can make humans ill and prove fatal to animals.\nIn November 2023, just 3% of the samples collected from the lake's shoreline met minimum standards under UK legislation.\nThe campaign group is calling for the removal of treated and untreated sewage discharges into Windermere, which is England's largest natural lake.\nSave Windermere founder and ecologist Matt Staniek invited Mr Sharkey to join them in a post on X, formerly Twitter, recently.\nSpeaking at the protest, Mr Sharkey criticised the amount water companies, including United Utilities, paid shareholders and called on them to invest more in tackling sewage pollution.\nHe said: \"You cannot have a leisure and tourist facility that has become nothing more than an open air septic tank.\n\"Every single river in England is polluted, not one escapes - and the source of that pollution is the water industry.\"\nMr Sharkey described his fellow campaigners as \"decent, honest people\" doing their best to make a difference.\n\"These people have had enough,\" he added.\n\"They put their trust in the system and in return they've had as much effluent verbally from our water companies as is in our lakes and rivers.\n\"It's got to stop.\"\nA spokesman for United Utilities said it had invested billions in safe and clean drinking water, adding that the reduction of storm overflows was a new government requirement.\nHe added: \"We invest three times what we pay our shareholders every year and that investment is into our infrastructure.\"\nThe company said it was planning to invest more than \u00a33bn in tackling problems linked to storm overflows, with the aim of reducing spills by 60% by 2030.\nFollow BBC Cumbria on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Rare flowers only found in Yorkshire are to be protected as part of a scheme to restore a wildlife habitat.\nIngleborough in the Yorkshire Dales is a mix of meadows, limestone pavements and nature reserves - and is home to rarities such as Yorkshire sandwort.\nRachael Bice, from Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, said a new scheme could see the area become one of the world's \"most significant limestone landscapes\".\nHowever, she said the Wild Ingleborough project was \"a race against time\".\nIt is estimated that Ingleborough, which is the second-highest mountain in the Yorkshire Dales, is home to a third of the UK's plant species. \nHowever, it is the only place in the world where the \"tiny white stars\" of Yorkshire sandwort are found, a spokesperson for the trust said.\nThe area is also one of only four places in the UK where Teesdale violets can be seen, and one of just two places in Yorkshire where purple saxifrage grows.\nYorkshire Wildlife Trust said as part of the Wild Ingleborough project, it was cultivating the rarest of the area's limestone flowers, shrubs and trees at a special nursery where volunteers would help nurture plants from seed so they could be planted back out in the landscape.\nThe charity also said it had plans to connect wilder spaces, spanning from the valleys up to the top of Ingleborough itself.\nRare wildlife would then be able to \"expand and flourish\", a spokesperson said.\nMs Bice, the trust's chief executive, said the \"critical haven\" hosted rare holly ferns, lichens and mosses, as well as patches of wild thyme and rock-rose.\nShe added: \"There is so much hope for the future of Wild Ingleborough and the wildlife that could thrive there if given more opportunity.\"\nThe work had the potential to make \"a real difference on a truly significant scale\", she added. \nBut Ms Bice warned time was running out to \"save some of the last remnants of this area's most vulnerable plants\".\nTony Juniper, chair of Natural England, said the Wild Ingleborough scheme was \"an impressive landscape-scale restoration programme\", which was \"on the cusp of reaching new heights\" for nature.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

He said that he'd lost his wife and I thought we're both going through the same sort of experience. \n\"I checked him out, he said he was from Manchester, supported Man City and I was asking him loads of questions, so I felt really comfortable that he was from the area.\"\n'Derek' told Lyn that he owned a mineral company and regularly travelled between Manchester, Miami and Dubai.\n\"We had loads of banter over the phone,\" said Lyn. \"We both liked the same things, he said we'll go on holiday and he'll take me back to his place in America.\"\nIn June 2021 'Derek' made his first request for cash, telling Lyn he needed \u00a3500 as he had an accident in Dubai and his account had been frozen. \n\"He asked for \u00a3500 for medical bills,\" she said. \n\"He said he would pay me back with interest, he said 'don't worry about the money' and he just kept reassuring me. \n\"He sounded so genuine.\"\nThe requests for cash kept coming and Lynn's payments to 'Derek' snowballed over that summer. \n\"I paid over \u00a350,000, which was my retirement money,\" she said. \n\"I thought he was truthful, everything about his business tallied up, but then Cheshire Police came knocking at my door.\"\nOfficers informed Lynn that 'Derek' did not exist and the person behind the account was part of a romance fraud gang. \n\"I felt sick, I was numb. I didn't believe it at first, I thought this isn't real,\" she said. \nThe magnitude of the crime hit Lynn soon afterwards,\nShe said: \"I thought, how am I going to manage now?

    "Islanders are being called upon to help document the effects of climate change in Guernsey by exploring the shoreline this summer. \nTwo marine \"citizen science\" projects will challenge volunteers to survey 14 species of seaweed as well as varieties of shark egg cases, known as Mermaid Purses. \nIt is hoped the data gathered can be used to help conserve native species, Guernsey's Nature Commission says.\nThe commission's ecologist, Charlotte Burgoine, said:  \"It's really important to get the public involved.\"\n\"It makes them understand more about the natural world and they are also providing data, which is really important. \n\"If we have data, we know what species we have around here. Long term, we can find out if they are increasing or decreasing and target our conservation measures,\" she added.\nEight beach sites will be surveyed across the island as part of two nationwide schemes: The Great Eggcase Hunt project organised by Shark Trust and The Big Seaweed Search lead by the Marine Conservation Society. \nConversationists have been conducting preliminary studies of the sites before the project is rolled out. \nMs Burgoine says the seaweed species found can act as a barometer of changes to the wider marine environment. \n\nThis includes rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification, caused by rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, she said.\n\"It might mean we are finding more invasive species that can tolerate warmer waters and the native cold tolerate species are moving elsewhere,\" Ms Burgoine continued.\n\"They can form a blanket over the rock pools, so organisms beneath can't photosynsthise. \n\"The native grazing species - like sea slugs and sea hares - won't eat them, which means they are able to spread really fast.\"\nThe projects will see islanders surveying an area of beach with an identification guide, before logging finds to an online database. \nMs Burgoine added: It's really important to contribute to these national schemes. \n\"But if we want to look at Guernsey specifically, then we can.The data can be extracted out so we will be able to do our own analysis.\"\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

It felt like it went on a long time as I was in pain,\" she said. \nEventually Troy's legs, torso and neck were delivered.\nMrs Brady said she felt \"pulling, pulling, pulling\" by the doctor. \n\"Baby Troy was hanging there, just hanging there.\" \nMrs Brady said she was told that Dr Sharma believed the time between the neck and head being delivered was at least six minutes. \n\"It felt like forever to me,\" she said. \nMrs Brady said that Dr Sharma \"appeared desperate\".\n\"He looked at my face and I could see he was desperate to remove the head,\" she told the court.\nMrs Brady was given an episiotomy and forceps were used to deliver Troy.\nJohn Brady, Troy's father, also gave evidence.\n\"I wrote down what happened the day we buried our child. It was crystal clear in my head what happened,\" he said.\nHe was asked about his memories of baby Troy being born. \n\"He was hanging down and the doctor was pulling. 100% he was pulling,\" he said. \nDr Sharma maintains that rather than pulling the baby he was performing a manoeuvre to release Troy's head. \nMr Brady was asked if it's possible that was what he was seeing and not pulling.\n\"No. It was shocking for me to see that happening because I was thinking 'is this how this should be done?'\" he said. \n\"I was waiting for someone to step in and save the day. It seemed as if no-one knew what they were doing.\n\"When the forceps went in it took two or three pulls and then he popped out.\" \nJohn Brady told the court after the baby was born she \"kissed baby Troy before he was placed in an incubator and taken to the neonatal unit\".\n\"Staff in the neonatal unit said to us that something went horribly wrong at the delivery and you need answers for it,\" he said.\nThe couple had a meeting with Dr Sharma, but Mr Brady said they \"didn't get answers\".\n\"I visit the grave every single day on my way home from work,\" he told the court\nThe inquest continues.

    "A sex attacker dubbed \"The Fox\" is now eligible for parole board hearings, a TV documentary has revealed.\nChannel 5 will air a documentary about a series of burglaries and sex attacks in 1984 across Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire.\nMalcolm Fairley was sentenced to six life sentences for his crimes at St Albans Crown Court in 1985.\nThe Parole Board said Fairley was refused parole in October and has not yet been referred for his next review.\nRetired Det Ch Supt Brian Prickett said Fairley was \"still a real risk to the public\".\nFairley was named \"The Fox\", because he would build dens in the houses he broke into while waiting for homeowners to return. \nHe prepared and ate meals in their homes, watched television and collected trophies.\nFairley, masked and brandishing a shotgun, would then commit crimes such as rape, indecent assault and other violent attacks.\nAt the height of his offending, in the summer of 1984, there were three attacks in one week. \nIt became one of the largest police manhunts in British criminal history with 200 officers involved.\nThe documentary, The Intruder: He's Watching You From Within, will include police interviews never heard before, in which Fairley confessed to the crimes and explained why he did them.\nMr Prickett, who led the investigation into Fairley's crimes, told ITN: \"Malcolm Fairley should never come out of prison after all the fear and harm he put into the community. \n\"He never deserves to be released because I think he's still a real risk to the public.\"\nFairley also committed break-ins and sexual crimes in Milton Keynes, South Yorkshire and his native north east. \nHe was arrested in September 1984 at his home in Kentish Town, north London, after forensic evidence linked his car to an attack. \nAt the time of his arrest Fairley had committed 81 offences.\nIn the documentary, Det Ch Supt Prickett talks about finally coming face-to-face with Fairley: \"When I first saw him he said to me, 'I'd seen you on the television a few times, and I never thought I'd see you in real life'. I said to him, 'I knew I'd see you'.\n\"We said, 'Why did you do it? Tell us why. Do you realise what you did to these people? Are you sorry?' He shrugged his shoulders. He never showed any remorse, or he never once asked, 'How are these people?' Not once.\n\"Psychiatrists said that he was rational and that he was normal. Well, I never accepted that. As a police officer, you deal with him professionally, but as a human being to human being, you've got complete disgust, you've got almost hatred. \n\"I don't think I'll ever understand the motivation he had for the attacks he carried out.\"\nMr Justice Caulfield sentenced Fairley following his trial at St Albans Crown Court in February 1985. \nHe said: \"There are degrees of wickedness beyond condemnatory description. Your crimes fall within this category. You desecrated and defiled men and women in their own homes.\"\nA spokesperson from Bedfordshire Police said Fairley attracted little suspicion in his everyday life, although he was known for petty crimes the father-of-three seemed to live a \"somewhat normal family life\".\nThe documentary has been produced by ITN Productions and commissioned for Channel 5.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "In 1633, Charles I was on the throne, Galileo Galilei was convicted of heresy (for holding the belief that the Earth revolves around the sun) and Samuel Pepys drew his first breath.\nAlso in 1633, on 10 April, a crowd gathered outside a shop in Holborn, in the city of London, to goggle at a peculiar new display.\nNow ubiquitous in our fruit bowls and supermarkets, and always with the potential to cause a comedy slip, the banana was first seen and sold in Britain by Thomas Johnson - a botanist and apothecarist.\nRecords show he was the first person to sell bananas in England. \nHe wrote: \"The fruit which I received was not ripe, but greene.\n\"This stalke with the fruit thereon I hanged up in my shop, were it became ripe about the beginning of May, and lasted until June.\"\nJohnson described the fruit as \"each of them the bignesse of a large beane some five inches long and an inch and a half in breadth. The stalk is short and like one's little finger\".\n\"They hang with their heads down, but if you turn them up, they look like a boat. The husk is easily removed.\n\"The pulp is white, soft and tender and ate somewhat like a musk melon.\"\nThe bananas that attracted spectators to Johnson's shop are unlikely to be the same as the ones we put in our shopping trolleys.\nAny banana now sold in British supermarkets will be descended from the Cavendish banana - and it is believed that Johnson's bananas came from Bermuda. We would probably refer to them today as plantains - or in the spelling of the day, \"plantanes\".\nIt still took a while for bananas to properly enter British culture. \nThe fruit's tropical origins, and its susceptibility to disease and shortages, had made it an exotic object.\nMost people in England still had not seen a banana by the end of the 19th Century - when regular imports started from the Canary Islands. \nBananas took on a more symbolic role later - as something associated with peace and the end of war.\nOn 9 November 1940, the Minister of Food, Lord Woolton (he of the vegetable pie fame), ordered a complete ban on the import of bananas. \nThe tropical fruit had to be transported in refrigerated ships, which were needed for the war effort. \nPlaintive wartime songs memorialised the banana. They included dance hall favourite When Can I Have a Banana Again? and I've Never Seen a Straight Banana.\nOf course, Britons revealed their stiff upper lip and made do with a substitute called \"mock banana\".\nMarguerite Patten who became known as \"the queen of ration-book cuisine\" had already created mock sausages (lentils), mock fish cakes (beans and anchovy paste) and mock oyster soup (artichokes).\nIt sounds less than convincing and consisted of boiled parsnip, mashed up with sugar and some banana extract.\nIn the BBC's WW2 People's War - a user-submitted archive of memories of the war - one contributor from Dagenham remembers their mother winning a banana in a pub raffle in 1944.\n\"She had been offered 10 shillings for it but had refused. They told us that it wasn't ripe yet and so we would have to wait before it could be eaten. My sister and I probably asked our parents every day whether the banana was ready to eat. When the great day arrived we gathered round to have a taste of this little banana.\n\"I imagined that it would be something mouth-wateringly scrumptious. What I actually found myself eating was a hard, tasteless substance which I wouldn't have finished eating if I hadn't known what it was. \n\"I suspect that our impatience had prompted our parents to eat it before it had ripened but although that first banana was a great disappointment it did at least cure me of wanting another for a number of years.\"\nIt was 1945 before bananas arrived in bulk again.\nThe first winter after the end of the war saw a Fyffe ship, the Tilapa, arrive from Kingston, Jamaica, loaded with a consignment of 10 million bananas. \nHundreds of children were there to greet it. \nThe fruit was earmarked for youngsters as a special treat - and many children had to be shown how to peel and eat a banana: from the top down, rather than side-on like corn on the cob.\nNow, the banana is consistently one of the biggest sellers in British supermarkets - industry publication The Grocer has it third in terms of revenue (after strawberries and grapes), raking in \u00a3573m in 2023.\nAnd London seems to have continued its relationship with bananas. \nIn 2007, artist Astrid Bin started to notice the number of discarded peels in the capital.\n\"Within a week of being in London I couldn't get my mind off these banana skins. Where were they coming from? Who was eating all these bananas and leaving the skins around? Why was it always bananas I was seeing, and not, say, oranges? Was it a sign? Was there something sinister going on?\"\nBin began photographing the abandoned skins and in 2009, 1,000 pictures from the London Bananas archive were displayed in an exhibition in Shoreditch, London.\nAnd artist Anna Chojnicka, a north London artist, bruises the skin to create elaborate dra",
    "Labour is pledging to fund policies on the NHS and school breakfast clubs by boosting efforts to tackle tax dodgers.\nShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves says plans to give more money to tax officials would help raise \u00a35bn a year.\nThe party had to find a way to plug the gap in its spending commitments after the government adopted its plan to scrap non-dom tax status. \nIt says it will also raise \u00a32.6bn by closing \"loopholes\" in the government's plans to abolish non-dom exemptions. \nNon-doms are UK residents whose permanent home for tax purposes is abroad, meaning they do not have to pay UK tax on money they earn overseas. \nIf it wins power, Labour said it would scrap a proposed 50% discount on the tax non-doms would have to pay in the first year of the new rules. \nIt said all foreign assets held in offshore trusts would also be subject to UK inheritance tax, while the government has said those held in a trust set up before April 2025 would be excluded from inheritance tax permanently. \nMs Reeves insisted she was \"confident\" her plans would raise the amount Labour had estimated. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she denied the sums were \"small change\" compared to the potential cuts facing public services, saying Labour's plans for the NHS and schools would make \"a massive difference to millions of people\". \nThe government said it had already brought in 200 measures to tackle tax non-compliance.\nTreasury Minister Laura Trott said: \"After a month of searching for a plan to pay for Labour's unfunded spending, the shadow chancellor still cannot say how she will fill the enormous black hole in their promises. And that means one thing - more taxes.\"\nLabour had been planning to pay for flagship pledges - including \u00a3365m for free school breakfast clubs and \u00a31.6bn for more hospital and dental appointments - by replacing the UK's current non-dom tax regime.\nHowever at his spring Budget, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said he would change the non-dom tax rules to pay for a cut to National Insurance. \nLabour has a self-imposed rule that, if elected, it will not borrow to fund day-to-day spending and following Mr Hunt's non-doms announcement the party faced questions as to how it would fund its existing promises. \nNow, Ms Reeves has set out her alternative plan, which also includes strengthening the government's proposed replacement of non-dom rules. \nThe party says these changes could bring in \u00a31bn in one year, rising to \u00a32.6bn over the course of the next Parliament. \nMs Reeves said her party would also give the HM Revenues and Customs (HMRC) more resources to tackle tax avoidance and evasion, spending \u00a3555m on increasing the number of tax officers. \nIt also wants to invest in digitising the tax office to improve customer services and \"free up resources to focus on more complex cases\".\nCiting HMRC figures, Labour said the gap between the amount of tax owed and what the government actually collects stood at \u00a336bn in 2021/22.\nThe party also points to a recent Financial Times interview in which the head of the spending watchdog the National Audit Office said the government could save \u00a36bn a year by tackling tax evasion and avoidance. \nThis, the party estimates, would raise \u00a30.7bn in 2025/26 growing to \u00a35.1bn a year by the end of the Parliament.\nIn an interview with the BBC, Ms Reeves said past governments had managed to close the tax gap but that it had plateaued in recent years\n\"It's not rocket science, it's about properly resourcing HMRC, making sure more cases are investigated,\" she said.  \nShe also said Labour were setting up an expert panel to advise the party on tackling tax avoidance and modernising HMRC.\nThe panel will include Sir Edward Troup, a former senior Treasury civil servant, and Margaret Hodge, an MP who chaired the influential Public Accounts Committee.\nHelen Miller, deputy director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies think tank, said it was \"common for governments to announce plans to try to raise revenue by reducing avoidance or evasion\".\nHowever, she said there was uncertainty over how much this could raise and how quickly. \nHMRC has been calculating the tax gap - the difference between how much money is raised in taxes and a theoretical calculation of how much could be raised - since 2005. \nIt says there has been a \"long-term reduction\" with the gap falling from 7.5% in 2005 - when Labour was in power - to 4.8% in 2021/22.\nPrevious attempts to close this gap have not always been as successful as hoped. \nIn 2010 the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government announced \u00a3900m to beef up HMRC but it did not really work. \nIn fact the tax gap as a percentage of GDP stayed flat and then started edging up until 2013 when a crackdown on VAT non-payment and fraud was much more successful.\nIn total since 2010 the tax gap has come down from just under 2% of GDP to 1.5%, but since the pandemic it has been creeping up again.\nHigh net worth individuals and businesses also tend to respond to whatever measures are ",
    "An 18-year-old in Idaho allegedly planned a violent rampage of local churches, after he pledged loyalty to the Islamic State (IS) group.\nAlexander Mercurio was arrested on Saturday, one day before prosecutors say he intended to attack churches with guns,\"flame-covered weapons\", explosives, knives and a pipe.\nHe allegedly wanted to move from church to church until being killed, the justice department said.\nHe could face up to 20 years in prison.\nMr Mercurio is charged with attempting to provide material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organisation.\n\"The defendant swore an oath of loyalty to ISIS and planned to wage an attack in its name on churches in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho,\" US Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement, using a common name for the Islamic State group. \nThe teenager allegedly wanted to carry out an act of martyrdom in the city in the north-western part of state, where he lived, before the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. \nIn messages that Mr Mercurio allegedly sent earlier this year, he outlined a plan to \"kill as many as possible\" at the nearest church. He then said he would \"rinse and repeat\" that same attack on neighbouring churches, setting them on fire as we he went, until he was killed.  \nPart of the plan allegedly involved beating and handcuffing his father in order to obtain guns from a locked closet in the family home.\nMr Mercurio was arrested after sharing his intentions with an unnamed FBI source, according to the criminal complaint against him. \nMr Mercurio had been known to the FBI under an online alias since July 2022, the complaint says. His beliefs developed in an online group chat, according to messages included in the court documents. \nAt first, the teenager expressed his early interest in Islamic fundamentalism and IS which the US considers a terror group. He also spoke of his frustration that his parents did not understand his religious views. \nBut his messages to the chat soon reflected his intentions to \"donate every last cent in my bank\" to IS and to carry out an attack in the US if he could not join the group in Africa or the Middle East, investigators allege.\nThe FBI executed a search warrant at Mr Mercurio's family home on Saturday, seizing a pipe, butane, hand sanitizer, a machete and the firearms locked in his father's closet. \nThe FBI and the Department of Homeland Security had recently issued a bulletin warning Americans of \"possible threats to public gatherings in the United States\". The law enforcement bulletin was issued shortly after an attack on a Moscow concert hall  killed more than 100 people, for which IS has claimed responsibility. ",

Huang was accused of forcibly kissing a 17-year-old, and coercing her into taking nude photos in a separate incident a decade ago, as well as forcing another to have sex with him back in 2013.\nHe apologised for both incidents, which have been investigated by police. The Taipei District Prosecutors Office said last week the allegations were not being pursued further due to a lack of \"objective evidence\" and settlements reached between Huang and the women.\nWhen police searched his property while investigating the women's allegations, they found the seven videos of minors, which Huang admitted to downloading in 2023.\nIn a Facebook post on Friday, Huang said he has not stopped soul-searching since being accused of sexual misconduct: \"It is my responsibility and the direction going forward that I will build a new self, a good self, and stand up for my family...

    "Former sub-postmaster and campaigner Alan Bates has said the Post Office was being run by \"little more than thugs in suits\" in 2010.\nIn a strongly worded witness statement to the public inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal, he accused the Post Office of lying about the accounting system.\nHe also said the organisation had spent 23 years trying to \"discredit and silence\" him.\nThe Post Office apologised for hurt caused by the scandal.\nIt also said it regretted not disclosing documents to the inquiry \"as early as all parties would have liked\".\nBetween 1999 and 2015, hundreds of sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted by the Post Office due to the faulty Horizon software, which showed errors that did not exist. \nSome lost their jobs, businesses and homes. Many were left financially ruined. Others were convicted and sent to prison and some died while waiting for justice.\nMr Bates has been campaigning on behalf of sub-postmasters for decades and was recently catapulted into the national spotlight by an ITV drama about the scandal, Mr Bates vs The Post Office.\nOn Tuesday, the public inquiry resumed and Mr Bates was the first person to provide evidence ahead of more key witnesses appearing over the next 15 weeks.\nIn response to a letter from former postal affairs minister Sir Ed Davey in 2010, Mr Bates wrote back: \"It's not that you can't get involved or cannot investigate the matter, after all you do own 100% of the shares and normally shareholders are concerned about the morality of the business they own.\n\"It is because you have adopted an arm's length relationship that you have allowed a once great institution to be asset stripped by little more than thugs in suits, and you have enabled them to carry on with impunity regardless of the human misery and suffering they inflict.\"\nResponding to Mr Bates's statement, the Liberal Democrats said: \"As Alan Bates told the inquiry, the bulk of the blame lies with officials.\n\"Ed was the first minister to meet with Mr Bates and hear his concerns. \n\"He put those concerns to the Post Office, but their officials lied to him as they did to so many people.\" \nMr Bates told reporters after the hearing had ended on Tuesday that it had been an \"an interesting day\", adding he wanted the original group of sub-postmasters to \"get their money\".\nHe joked that once the whole process was over, he planned to \"buy a little post office and put his feet up\".\nIn Mr Bates's witness statement, the former sub-postmaster said he had \"spent the last 23 years campaigning to expose the truth, and justice\".\nHe also told the inquiry that before he was sacked he had repeatedly raised concerns about Horizon, including in a letter he had sent in December 2000, two months after the system had been installed in his post office branch in Craig-y-Don in Llandudno.\nWhen Horizon was first installed he had been \"quite positive\" about it, having had experience with retailing and accounting software since 1986.\nHowever, he soon found \"frustrating\" problems with it, including a lack of transparency over transaction data.\nHe refused to accept that shortfalls in his accounts were his responsibility to make good, maintaining that it was the software that was faulty.\nWhen his employment was terminated in November 2003, he was \"annoyed\" with that \"to put it mildly\".\nBut he added that his sacking was \"partly expected, in a way, because it was pretty obvious [the Post Office] were after me one way or another\" after he repeatedly raised concerns about Horizon.\nThe inquiry was shown slides from an undated presentation prepared by Dave Smith, a former Post Office manager, which said Mr Bates \"had discrepancies\" but was \"dismissed because he became unmanageable\".\n\"Clearly struggled with accounting, and despite copious support, did not follow instructions,\" the presentation said.\nWhen asked by lead counsel to the inquiry Jason Beer KC if it was ever explained to him that he became \"unmanageable\", he smiled and said: \"No, not at all.\"\nHe also denied having ever struggled with accounting, or being given \"copious\" support.\nOver more than two years he and his staff made 507 calls to the Post Office helpline, 85 of which related to Horizon.\nHe said the helpline was not much help. \"Stating the bleeding obvious is one description I might use. It was all things that I'd tried.\"\nIn a surprise appearance on Wednesday, Post Office chief executive Nick Read was present in the inquiry room.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Read admitted financial redress for sub-postmasters had been \"slow\". \nWhile he did not want to go into the specifics of Mr Bates's case and why his claim had not yet been settled, he said he wanted to \"demonstrate [his] support\" for sub-postmasters and for Mr Bates.\nA Post Office spokesperson said: \"Post Office is deeply sorry for the hurt and suffering that has been caused to victims and their loved ones, and we are committed to ensuring that they receive the justice and redress that they so deserve.\"\nFollowing criticism of its docu",

    "Billie Eilish has announced the details of what is likely to be one of 2024's biggest albums.\nThe star says her third record, Hit Me Hard And Soft, will be released on 17 May, with no singles in advance so that fans can hear it \"all at once\".\nShe also published a sustainability plan for the album, with the aim of minimising her environmental impact.\nVinyl copies will be pressed onto recycled or eco-vinyl, with all the packaging made from recycled materials.\nEilish will also use raw, plant-based ink and and water-based dispersion varnish. Instead of shrink-wrap, the album sleeves will be 100% recycled and re-usable.\nThe move comes amid a continuing boom in vinyl sales, with 5.9 million units sold in the UK alone last year.\nBut vinyl is made from plastic, which has a major environmental impact, and often comes packaged inside non-recyclable materials. \nResearchers at Keele University estimate that vinyl records typically contain around 135g of PVC material with a carbon footprint of 0.5kg of Carbon Dioxide.\nBased on that calculation, the UK's vinyl habit produced 2,700 tonnes of CO2, before taking transport and packaging into account. That is the entire footprint of almost 560 people per year. \nEilish, who is a long-standing climate campaigner, told Billboard magazine she felt compelled to tackle the problem.\n\"My parents have always kept me well informed and hyper aware that every choice we make and every action we take has an impact somewhere or on someone, good or bad, and that has always stuck with me,\" said the multiple Oscar and Grammy Award-winner.\n\"I can't just ignore what I know and go about my business and career and not do something. That's just not how I was raised, or how I want to live my life.\"\nGreg Cochrane, who hosts the music and sustainability podcast Sounds Like a Plan, called the star's announcement a \"significant step\".\n\"We've seen examples of these type of releases before, but they've generally been limited releases or smaller batches, or from smaller artists,\" he told the BBC, \"but a shift happens when an artist of Billie Eilish's popularity decides to adopt this - and not only adopt this, but also be transparent and vocal about her reasons for doing it.\"\nHe drew parallels between Eilish's plan and Coldplay's attempts to make touring more environmentally friendly.\n\"Like any community, music needs trailblazers and successful examples for others to follow. So it's really important that Billie and Coldplay and others are doing this while still creating music and experiences that people love.\"\nEilish's announcement comes after the star criticised artists who release multiple vinyl formats to boost album sales, calling the practise \"really frustrating\".\n\"We live in this day and age where, for some reason, it's very important to some artists to make all sorts of different vinyl and packaging,\" the 22-year-old said in an earlier interview with Billboard, \"which ups the sales and ups the numbers and gets them more money.\"\nAfter the singer's mother, Maggie Baird, interrupted to point out that multiple vinyl sales \"counts toward number one albums\", Eilish responded: \"I can't even express to you how wasteful it is.\"\nEven so, Eilish will release eight vinyl variants of Hit Me Hard And Soft. However, the artwork and track-listing will remain the same across every edition, suppressing the demand for multiple purchases.\nThe standard black variant will be made from 100% recycled black vinyl. The remaining seven coloured editions will be made from Eco-mix or BioVinyl. \nEco-mix is created by recycling the offcuts from other albums, no matter what colour was used. The process means that each disc will be unique. \nSingle LP colours will be made using BioVinyl - which replaces the petroleum used to manufacture Polyvinyl chloride with recycled cooking oil. \nBioVinyl helps reduce carbon emissions by 90% compared to standard LPs while retaining the same audio quality.\nIn addition, Eilish will manufacture cassette casings using recycled materials, and her tour merchandise will be created from left-over stock, organic or recycled polyester or cotton and non-toxic dyes.\nThe singer told Billboard she hoped that other artists would \"adopt the same practices, and they will eventually become standard.

We want that.\"\n\"But for me if an audience member walks away with something new to think about then we've done our job properly.\" \nHe added that he was \"excited and honoured to be involved\". \nThe show also highlights the \"deep divisions\" at the time on the streets, at work and in the Pentecostal Church, where the main character sees a divide developing between generations, the company said. \nJames Yarker, a co-director of Community Service and Stan's Cafe's artistic director, said: \"The idea to create a show around Trevor's life was brought to us by his family, who told us stories about him, answered our questions and put us in touch with some of his former work colleagues.\"\nHe said Mr Prince was born in Birmingham in 1955 and his parents had come to Britain from Jamaica. \nHe had formed the Shiloh Band, an influential gospel group, with friends after playing guitar for the Pentecostal Church. \nAfter joining the police cadets aged 16, he became a police officer and \"became a familiar and much-loved figure\" in the city, he added. \nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Toad rescuers in Bath say they have helped the highest number of amphibians to safely cross the road in 14 years. \nMore than 50 volunteers helped 3,177 amphibians across a half mile stretch of Charlcombe Lane to reach their ancestral breeding lake. \nThe lane was closed to traffic for six weeks in February and March.\nHelen Hobbs, manager of Charlcombe Toad Rescue, said the migration dates had been changing in recent years due to climate change.\nAcross the six weeks the 52 volunteers spent more than 600 hours in high visibility jackets, armed with torches and buckets walking slowly up and down the road. \nToads, frogs and newts are carefully picked up and taken safely in buckets to drop-off points to help them on their journey towards the lake.\nMs Hobbs said closing the road had been a \"game changer\" and because of it the toads, frogs and newts had been able to \"buck national trends and stand a fighting chance of flourishing\".\n\"The biggest challenge this year was that the busiest night of the year was on the 6 February - a week before the road was due to close.\n\"In that one night our brilliant volunteers helped 647 amphibians across the road but sadly the casualty rate was much higher than usual because vehicles could still use the lane.\n\"That is why it is so important to have the lane closed for the six weeks.\n\"With a changing climate it is becoming increasingly difficult to predict the peak times for amphibian movements. \n\"This year it was early February and in 2023 it was mid-March.\"\nBath and North East Somerset Council has supported the patrol and road closure since 2003.\nThe Charlcombe Toad Rescue Group fundraises to cover the administrative costs of the road closure and VolkerHighways sponsors the group with the provision of signage each year.\nAll the data collected by patrollers is collated by conservation charity Froglife.\nSheila Gundry, from Froglife, said: \"Data from many toad patrols around the country shows that amphibian populations are declining and are very depleted in many areas of the country.\n\"At Charlcombe Lane there is still a healthy population, thanks to the hard work of the toad patrol who rescue toads, frogs and newts even on wet winter evenings.\n\"The temporary road closure makes a big difference too, as do the surrounding landowners who look after the breeding pond and foraging grounds.

    "A former Virginia school official is facing criminal neglect charges in connection with an incident last year in which a six-year-old shot a teacher. \nA special grand jury found that former assistant principal Ebony Parker endangered students by ignoring warnings that the child had a gun. \nEach of the eight counts is punishable by five years in prison. \nTeacher Abigail Zwerner was seriously wounded in the shooting and had multiple surgeries.\nIn a $40m (\u00a331.5m) lawsuit against Ms Parker filed after the shooting, Ms Zwerner claimed that Ms Parker ignored at least three warnings that the child had a gun in school on the day of the January 2023 incident, which took place in the city of Newport News. \nIn one instance outlined in the lawsuit, Ms Zwerner's lawyers said that she told Ms Parker that the child was in a \"violent mood\" and had made threats against another child. \nMs Parker allegedly \"had no response\" and refused to \"even look up\" when concerns about the child were brought to her. \nAdditionally, Ms Parker is accused of ignoring warnings from other staff that the young boy may have brought a gun to school, as well as of rebuffing a request to search his bag. \nApproximately 45 minutes later, the child fired a single shot at Ms Zwerner as she was teaching her first-grade class. The bullet went through her hand and chest. \nThe indictment, filed on Tuesday, accuses Ms Parker of committing \"a wilful act or omission in the care\" of students at Richneck Elementary School that was \"so gross, wanton, and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life\".\nIn a statement quoted by the Washington Post, Ms Zwerner's attorneys said that \"these charges are very serious and underscore the failure of the school district to act to prevent the tragic shooting\". \nWhile an arrest warrant for Ms Parker was issued on Tuesday morning, she had not yet been arrested, according to local media reports. \nHer attorneys have yet to comment on the indictment. \nThe child's mother, 26-year-old Deja Nicole Taylor, was charged a year ago with felony child neglect after the child took her gun to school. \nShe pleaded guilty and was sentenced in December to two years on the state charges, in addition to 21 months on federal gun charges for lying about drug use on the form required to obtain the weapon.\nThe boy is reportedly in the care of a relative and enrolled at a different school.

    "An Australian museum has been ordered to allow men into a women's-only exhibit, following a high-stakes court case over the matter.\nThe Ladies Lounge at Tasmania's Museum of Old and New Art (Mona) sought to highlight historic misogyny by banning male visitors. \nAfter being denied entry, one filed a gender discrimination lawsuit, which he won on Tuesday. \n\"We are deeply disappointed by this decision,\" a Mona representative said. \nThe velvet-clad lounge - which contains some of the museum's most-acclaimed works, from Picasso to Sidney Nolan - has been open since 2020. \nIt was designed to take the concept of an old Australian pub - a space which largely excluded women until 1965 - and turn it on its head, offering champagne and five-star service to female attendees, while refusing men at the door. \nJason Lau, a New South Wales resident who visited Mona in April of last year, was one such male. \nRepresenting himself throughout the case, he argued that the museum had violated the state's anti-discrimination act by failing to provide \"a fair provision of goods and services in line with the law\" to him and other ticket holders who didn't identify as female.\nThe museum had responded by claiming the rejection Mr Lau had felt was part of the artwork, and that the law in Tasmania allowed for discrimination if it was \"designed to promote equal opportunity\" for a group of people who had been historically disadvantaged. \nIn his ruling, Richard Grueber dismissed the argument - finding that it was \"not apparent\" how preventing men from experiencing the famous artworks held within the Ladies Lounge achieved that goal. \nThroughout the case, the museum's supporters, including artist Kirsha Kaechele - who created the work - had used the courtroom as a space for performance art, wearing matching navy suits and engaging in synchronised movements. \nMr Grueber said that while the behaviour of the women hadn't disrupted the hearing, it was \"inappropriate, discourteous and disrespectful, and at worst contumelious and contemptuous\".\nHis decision to allow \"persons who do not identify as ladies\" to access the exhibit will come into effect in 28 days. \nIn a statement, Ms Kaechele said she was \"deeply saddened\" by the ruling, and would be taking time to \"absorb the situation, seek council and compose myself\". She added that she was grateful for public support through what has been \"one of the most difficult periods of my life\".\nMs Kaechele previously told the BBC the case had felt like her artwork was coming to life and signalled she would fight it all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary. \nBut she also noted that having the Ladies Lounge shut down could help drive home its intended message. \n\"If you were just looking at it from an aesthetic standpoint, being forced to close would be pretty powerful.\"\nA spokesperson for Mona said the museum would consider its options, but in court it had previously said the artwork would be untenable if the ruling was not in their favour.",

    "Billie Eilish has announced the details of what is likely to be one of 2024's biggest albums.\nThe star says her third record, Hit Me Hard And Soft, will be released on 17 May, with no singles in advance so that fans can hear it \"all at once\".\nShe also published a sustainability plan for the album, with the aim of minimising her environmental impact.\nVinyl copies will be pressed onto recycled or eco-vinyl, with all the packaging made from recycled materials.\nEilish will also use raw, plant-based ink and and water-based dispersion varnish. Instead of shrink-wrap, the album sleeves will be 100% recycled and re-usable.\nThe move comes amid a continuing boom in vinyl sales, with 5.9 million units sold in the UK alone last year.\nBut vinyl is made from plastic, which has a major environmental impact, and often comes packaged inside non-recyclable materials. \nResearchers at Keele University estimate that vinyl records typically contain around 135g of PVC material with a carbon footprint of 0.5kg of Carbon Dioxide.\nBased on that calculation, the UK's vinyl habit produced 2,700 tonnes of CO2, before taking transport and packaging into account. That is the entire footprint of almost 560 people per year. \nEilish, who is a long-standing climate campaigner, told Billboard magazine she felt compelled to tackle the problem.\n\"My parents have always kept me well informed and hyper aware that every choice we make and every action we take has an impact somewhere or on someone, good or bad, and that has always stuck with me,\" said the multiple Oscar and Grammy Award-winner.\n\"I can't just ignore what I know and go about my business and career and not do something. That's just not how I was raised, or how I want to live my life.\"\nGreg Cochrane, who hosts the music and sustainability podcast Sounds Like a Plan, called the star's announcement a \"significant step\".\n\"We've seen examples of these type of releases before, but they've generally been limited releases or smaller batches, or from smaller artists,\" he told the BBC, \"but a shift happens when an artist of Billie Eilish's popularity decides to adopt this - and not only adopt this, but also be transparent and vocal about her reasons for doing it.\"\nHe drew parallels between Eilish's plan and Coldplay's attempts to make touring more environmentally friendly.\n\"Like any community, music needs trailblazers and successful examples for others to follow. So it's really important that Billie and Coldplay and others are doing this while still creating music and experiences that people love.\"\nEilish's announcement comes after the star criticised artists who release multiple vinyl formats to boost album sales, calling the practise \"really frustrating\".\n\"We live in this day and age where, for some reason, it's very important to some artists to make all sorts of different vinyl and packaging,\" the 22-year-old said in an earlier interview with Billboard, \"which ups the sales and ups the numbers and gets them more money.\"\nAfter the singer's mother, Maggie Baird, interrupted to point out that multiple vinyl sales \"counts toward number one albums\", Eilish responded: \"I can't even express to you how wasteful it is.\"\nEven so, Eilish will release eight vinyl variants of Hit Me Hard And Soft. However, the artwork and track-listing will remain the same across every edition, suppressing the demand for multiple purchases.\nThe standard black variant will be made from 100% recycled black vinyl. The remaining seven coloured editions will be made from Eco-mix or BioVinyl. \nEco-mix is created by recycling the offcuts from other albums, no matter what colour was used. The process means that each disc will be unique. \nSingle LP colours will be made using BioVinyl - which replaces the petroleum used to manufacture Polyvinyl chloride with recycled cooking oil. \nBioVinyl helps reduce carbon emissions by 90% compared to standard LPs while retaining the same audio quality.\nIn addition, Eilish will manufacture cassette casings using recycled materials, and her tour merchandise will be created from left-over stock, organic or recycled polyester or cotton and non-toxic dyes.\nThe singer told Billboard she hoped that other artists would \"adopt the same practices, and they will eventually become standard. It really is as simple as that\".",
    "Tens of millions of people across the US, Canada and Mexico were treated to a total solar eclipse on Monday.\nWhole cities were plunged into darkness as the Moon briefly blocked out the Sun's rays in areas along what is known as the path of totality.\nAwestruck stargazers - or those who missed the event because of cloud cover or other commitments - now want to know when the phenomenon can next be observed. \nThis time, the interval will be much longer than the previous six-year wait. The next total eclipse in the contiguous United States will not happen for more than 20 years - and will be much more fleeting.\nIt will happen on 23 August 2044 and will appear in Greenland before becoming visible in Canada, according to non-profit organisation the Planetary Society.\nIt will be visible in only three US states: North and South Dakota and Montana.\nThere will then be another event the following year, in 2045, that will be possible to witness coast to coast across the US, as well as parts of Latin America. \nSolar eclipses themselves are not that rare - in fact, there are about two to four that occur per year.\nBut the chances of seeing a total eclipse are much rarer. The Earth is quite big and most of it is covered by oceans. More often than not, humans do not get to see one in person.\nThere will be a total eclipse visible over Alaska - which is not part of the contiguous US - on 30 March 2033. \nThe next total eclipse anywhere in the world will be on 12 August 2026, which Nasa says will be visible over Greenland, Iceland, Spain, Russia and a small area of Portugal.\nOther areas including the UK, Africa and North America will experience a partial eclipse - more on this below.\nA solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, blocking some or all of the Sun's rays from reaching the Earth.\nThe phenomenon is a cosmic event, requiring the Sun, the Moon and the Earth to be in just the right alignment for the Moon to cast a shadow on our planet.\nWhen this happens, the Moon casts two types of shadow.\nOne results in a partial solar eclipse, which obscures only part of the Sun.\nThe other - and the most spectacular - is the total solar eclipse. When this happens, the Sun is entirely obscured by the Moon, save for a visible ring of light in the sky.",
    "People using cannabis THC vapes risk inhaling a very dangerous substance called xylazine, UK experts warn after discovering some confiscated products contained the \"zombie\" drug. \nThe sedative, designed to put big animals such as cows and horses to sleep, can be lethal for humans. \nIt is \"alarming\" to find it in \"even a few\" illicit e-cigarettes that many think are pretty harmless, experts say.\nIt puts people, as well as those who inject or take strong drugs, at risk. \nThe illegal global xylazine market has so far mostly seen it mixed with strong opioid drugs, such as heroin or fentanyl. \nThere has been at least one xylazine-related UK death already - and there are fears misuse could grow, as it has in the US. \nDr Caroline Copeland and colleagues from King's College London say new types of illicit xylazine products are now entering the UK market. \nAs well as risky vapes, they found tablets being sold as codeine and diazepam, or Valium, that contained xylazine. \nThe researchers contacted all toxicology laboratories in the UK last year to gather evidence. \nThey also looked at drug-testing results from hauls seized by law enforcement. \nThe findings are published in the journal Addiction.\nAlthough the numbers found were small - only two THC vapes and a small number of illegally sold pills out of tens of thousands of products - the experts say it is still extremely concerning.\nWhat are cannabis vapes?\nDr Copeland told BBC News: \"People may not realise what they are actually buying. \n\"They think they are getting a THC vape - but it could contain much more than they expect. \n\"It's really alarming.\"\nThe UK's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs recently recommended to the government xylazine be listed as a Class C drug, putting it in the same category as laughing gas, anabolic steroids and benzodiazepines, which would mean people possessing it could be jailed for two years and those dealing it 14 years.\nThe health risks are amplified when it is taken with other strong sedatives. \nIt can cause:\nIt is not clear what level of harm inhaling it might do.\nSome children and teenagers in the UK have needed hospital treatment after they were thought to have used a vape spiked with another illegal drug, Spice. \nKing's College London Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience addictions head Prof Sir John Strang, who was not involved in the study, said: \"We need to be constantly alert to changes in the nature of the illicit drug market, especially as these changes sometimes bring new health complications or challenges.\"\nA government spokesperson said: \"We are aware of the threat from xylazine and are determined to protect people from the threat posed by this drug and other illicit synthetic drugs.\n\"We will not hesitate to act to keep the public safe. Following advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), we intend to make xylazine a Class C drug.\"",
    "The BBC in India will separate in two from Wednesday, as it seeks to meet the country's foreign investment rules.\nThe BBC will retain its newsgathering team in India for its English language digital, television and radio outlets headquartered in London.\nA new, independent, Indian-owned company called the Collective Newsroom will now produce content for the BBC's six other Indian language services.\nThe move comes a year after BBC India's offices were searched by authorities.\nThose searches by income tax officials came weeks after the broadcaster aired a documentary in the UK - but not in India - critical of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nGaurav Bhatia, a spokesman from Mr Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said at the time that the timing of the raids had nothing to do with the documentary, which the government attempted to block being shared in India.\nWhen the BBC announced the formation of Collective Newsroom in December, it said the new entity would enable it to meet its commitment to audiences in India and globally, while also complying with Indian FDI law.\nThe corporation has said it remains \"committed\" to the country, where it has an average weekly audience of 82 million people across its English and languages output.\nThe BBC has a long history in the country's media landscape, having first launched the Hindi language service in 1940.\nThe Hindi service will now be produced by the Collective Newsroom, along with Marathi, Gujarati, Punjabi, Tamil, and Telugu - as well as a YouTube channel BBC News India in English.\nBut the Collective Newsroom - which was formed by four BBC staff members and will employ about 200 former BBC employees - will also be able to make content for other news providers across India and globally.\nThe remaining 90 BBC staff members will still work directly for the broadcaster in news gathering operations for television, radio and online in English, reporting to editors in London. Their work will still be available to Indian audiences, although it will not be published in India.\nThe BBC has also applied for a 26% stake in the new company, a first for the broadcaster's global operations anywhere. \nRupa Jha, chief executive of Collective Newsroom, said the new company has \"a clear, ambitious mission to create the most credible, creative and courageous journalism\".\nShe added: \"Audiences will quickly come to know Collective Newsroom as an independent news organisation that leads with the facts, works in the public interest and hears from diverse voices and perspectives.\"",

    "A former Virginia school official is facing criminal neglect charges in connection with an incident last year in which a six-year-old shot a teacher. \nA special grand jury found that former assistant principal Ebony Parker endangered students by ignoring warnings that the child had a gun. \nEach of the eight counts is punishable by five years in prison. \nTeacher Abigail Zwerner was seriously wounded in the shooting and had multiple surgeries.\nIn a $40m (\u00a331.5m) lawsuit against Ms Parker filed after the shooting, Ms Zwerner claimed that Ms Parker ignored at least three warnings that the child had a gun in school on the day of the January 2023 incident, which took place in the city of Newport News. \nIn one instance outlined in the lawsuit, Ms Zwerner's lawyers said that she told Ms Parker that the child was in a \"violent mood\" and had made threats against another child. \nMs Parker allegedly \"had no response\" and refused to \"even look up\" when concerns about the child were brought to her. \nAdditionally, Ms Parker is accused of ignoring warnings from other staff that the young boy may have brought a gun to school, as well as of rebuffing a request to search his bag. \nApproximately 45 minutes later, the child fired a single shot at Ms Zwerner as she was teaching her first-grade class. The bullet went through her hand and chest. \nThe indictment, filed on Tuesday, accuses Ms Parker of committing \"a wilful act or omission in the care\" of students at Richneck Elementary School that was \"so gross, wanton, and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life\".\nIn a statement quoted by the Washington Post, Ms Zwerner's attorneys said that \"these charges are very serious and underscore the failure of the school district to act to prevent the tragic shooting\". \nWhile an arrest warrant for Ms Parker was issued on Tuesday morning, she had not yet been arrested, according to local media reports. \nHer attorneys have yet to comment on the indictment. \nThe child's mother, 26-year-old Deja Nicole Taylor, was charged a year ago with felony child neglect after the child took her gun to school. \nShe pleaded guilty and was sentenced in December to two years on the state charges, in addition to 21 months on federal gun charges for lying about drug use on the form required to obtain the weapon.\nThe boy is reportedly in the care of a relative and enrolled at a different school.

    "The Spanish government has begun the process of eliminating the so-called \"golden visa\" scheme.\nUnder the scheme, foreign investors are provided with fast-tracked residency.\nAt a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, ministers agreed to end the awarding of the visa, which can be obtained in exchange for buying property worth \u20ac500,000 (\u00a3428,000) or more.\nThe visa scheme was created in 2013 by the conservative government of Mariano Rajoy. \nIt was seen as a way of attracting badly needed foreign investment in the wake of the eurozone crisis, which hit Spain's property sector particularly hard.\nA total of 6,200 visas were issued until 2023 for investment in property, according to the organisation Transparency International, although other sources put the number higher.\nNearly half of beneficiaries of Spain's Golden Visa - a total of 2,712 - were Chinese, according to Transparency International. \nRussians were the next most numerous recipients, with 1,159, followed by Iranians (203), and citizens of the US (179) and the UK (177).\nThe \"golden visa\" scheme also provided residency in exchange for investing \u20ac2m (\u00a31.7m) or more in state bonds, or for investing in emerging Spanish companies. \nHowever, only 6% of visas were awarded for reasons other than the purchase of property, the government said.\nPrime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said his government's intention to scrap the scheme was intended \"to guarantee that housing is a right and not merely the subject of business speculation\".\nHe said that the majority of visas awarded were linked to the purchase of properties in places such as Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, M\u00e1laga, Alicante and the Balearic Islands - all areas where the housing market \"is under enormous pressure and where it is almost impossible for people who live and work in those places and pay their taxes each day to find affordable housing\".\nSome areas of the country have been particularly affected by rising rents, such as Ibiza, in the Balearic Islands.\nLast year, the government introduced a housing law which aimed to cap rental increases in areas where they have been spiralling.\nMr S\u00e1nchez's left-wing allies in his coalition government had been calling for an end to the visa system.\nHowever, critics say that its elimination will not improve matters.\n\"The problem with housing in Spain, both in terms of sales and rental, is not caused by the Golden Visa, but rather by the increasing lack of supply [of housing] and the accelerating growth in demand,\" said Francisco I\u00f1areta, of the Idealista property portal.\nHowever, pressure has also come from outside Spain, with the European Commission calling on EU members to clamp down on such schemes, in great part because of security concerns, especially since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nIn 2022, the UK government ended a scheme allowing wealthy foreign nationals to settle in the country if they brought assets with them. \nThe following year, Ireland scrapped its Golden Visa, while Portugal revised its own version of it, no longer allowing residency in exchange for property purchases.",
    "British dubstep star Benga has pulled out of Coachella festival in California after a \"snag\" with his US visa.\nThe US State Department had requested additional information at the very end of the application process, he said.\nThe DJ was set to perform with long-time collaborator Skream at the music festival beginning on Saturday.\n\"I am absolutely gutted, my team and I have worked tirelessly on making this happen,\" the Croydon artist said, announcing the news on Instagram.\n\"But hey, I'm respecting the process and staying positive,\" he continued.\nBenga, whose real name is Adegbenga Adejumo, was scheduled to appear with Skream over both the opening and closing weekends of the festival on 13 April and 20 April.\n\"I am truly sorry for all of the inconvenience and disappointment this causes, and I promise to keep you updated on what's happening,\" he said.\n\"We have called on some of the OG's (sic) to step up in my place,\" Benga added, promising that he would be on stage at Coachella again the following year.\nSkream, whose real name is Oliver Jones, still appears on the Coachella line-up in an alternative slot, alongside New York-based DJ Dennis Ferrer.\nCoachella is one of the biggest music festivals in the world. This year, Doja Cat, Tyler, the Creator and Lana Del Rey are the festival's headline acts.\nIn the Instagram post, Benga also acknowledged the commitment and patience of his fans during periods of ill mental health. \n\"I am doing well and have had the best two years healthwise and I am ready to get back out there,\" he said, referencing his diagnosis of bipolar disorder.\nBenga told BBC Newsbeat in 2018 he had had a \"crazy ride\" with the disorder, and at one point deleted all of his music.\n\"The journey hasn't been easy, but getting the chance to tour again with Skream has been amazing,\" he said in his latest post on Instagram.\n\"I really appreciate all the love and support you've shown me since I've been back.

    "The parents of a Michigan teenager who shot dead four students have each been sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison. \nA seven-year sentence was recommended, but prosecutors asked for more. \nJames and Jennifer Crumbley, the first parents of a US school shooter to be convicted, appeared together for the first time in months at Tuesday's sentencing hearing.\nBoth expressed regret about their son's attack, as their lawyers pushed to minimise their prison sentence.\nIn a landmark case, jurors in separate trials found each parent of shooter Ethan Crumbley guilty of involuntary manslaughter earlier this year. \nJudge Cheryl Matthews said that the expanded sentence of 10 to 15 years was \"to act as a deterrent\" and reflected the parents' failure to stop the attack.\n\"They [parents] are not expected to be psychic. But these convictions are not about poor parenting. They concern acts that could have halted a runaway train,\" she told the court.\n\"Opportunity knocked over and over again, louder and louder, and it was ignored.\"\nThe Crumbleys are eligible for parole after they serve 10 years in prison, but they cannot be held for more than 15 years if parole is denied.\nProsecutors had alleged that the pair had dismissed clear signs that their son's mental health had deteriorated, and noted that the parents had bought Ethan Crumbley the gun he used in the 2021 attack. \nTheir son was 15 when he killed four students with a semi-automatic handgun at Oxford High School. Seven others were wounded in the shooting. \nHe is now serving life in prison without parole.\nOn Tuesday, parents of the dead students, who were all under the age of 17, delivered emotionally charged victim impact statements in court.\nNicole Beausoleil, mother of 17-year-old victim Madisyn Baldwin, addressed Ethan Crumbley's parents directly. \n\"When you were purchasing a gun for your son and leaving it unlocked, I was helping her finish her college essay,\" a teary-eyed Ms Beausoleil said.\n\"You decided parenting wasn't a priority,\" she added. \"And because of that I've lost my daughter.\"\nJill Soave - the mother of another 17-year-old victim, Justin Shilling - was the second parent to speak. She noted that her \"horror and trauma is hard to put into words\".\nBut she looked directly at James and Jennifer Crumbley as she slammed the parents for their \"failure to act\" and stop a \"completely preventable\" tragedy.\n\"If only they had done something, anything, to shift the course of events,\" she said. \nIn a separate trial for each parent, prosecutors accused the Crumbleys of ignoring warning signs about their son's growing mental health crisis. They accused them of being negligent by buying him a gun and not storing it properly. \nProsecutor's sentencing recommendations were based on four separate counts of involuntary manslaughter, one for each of the four students that were killed. \nDuring Tuesday's sentencing, the prosecution said James Crumbley showed a \"total lack of remorse\" after they read from a profanity-laden transcript of a call he made from jail. They alleged that James Crumbley had made death threats against the lead prosecutor in the case during the call. \nJames Crumbley's lawyers disagreed, and said that their client only \"vented\" and used language that was \"angry\" and \"not respectful\".\nThe shooter's father emphasised his regret in a statement before the hearing and told the court later that he wished he had acted differently.\n\"I cannot express how much I wish that I had known what was going on with him or what was going to happen, because I absolutely would have done a lot of things differently.\"\nJennifer Crumbley also shared her own regret to the families affected. \n\"I stand today not to ask for your forgiveness, as I know it may be beyond reach, but to express my sincerest apologies for the pain that has been caused,\" she said in court\nJames Crumbley's lawyer, Mariell Lehman, said that there was no evidence that Ethan Crumbley's father was aware of his son's plans. \nDefence attorneys also argued that there was no legal precedent for this case, and it was inappropriate to hold the parents responsible for each person that their son killed.\nProsecutors disagreed, as did the judge. \nOn the day of the shooting at Oxford High School in Oxford, Michigan, the Crumbleys cut short a school meeting about a disturbing drawing their son had made, instead opting to go to work and not take him home.\nSchool staff later sent him back to class without checking his backpack, which contained the gun his parents had purchased.\nAn independent investigation published last year alleged multiple failures from the school system, including the decision to allow Ethan to return to class.\nIn response, the school district has pledged to review and improve its practices and policies.",
    "A Wimbledon ticket tout has been told by a High Court judge he will be jailed unless he discloses his associates.\nThe All England Lawn Tennis Club took out an injunction against Oliver Hardiman last July, as part of efforts to combat touting.\nIn December, the club asked the High Court to send him to prison after he breached the order and entered Wimbledon.\nMr Hardiman's barristers argued a fine or suspended sentence would suffice.\nIn a ruling on Tuesday, Mr Justice Morris said an immediate prison sentence was \"appropriate\".\nHowever, Mr Morris gave Mr Hardiman a final chance to \"purge\" his contempt by sharing details of his associates later this month.\nSpeaking to Mr Hardiman directly, he added: \"I have given you one final opportunity to think again.\n\"You will have until 26 April to provide the information. If you do, then subject to anything the claimants have to say, it is likely you will not be going immediately to prison.\n\"If you don't provide the information, you will.\"\nMr Hardiman was also ordered to pay more than \u00a319,000 in costs, which he must pay by that date too.\nStandard tickets for Wimbledon are issued through a strictly controlled ballot run by the club and cannot be transferred. \nVisitors are required to show photographic ID alongside their ticket when entering.\nThe injunction issued against Mr Hardiman, made by a different High Court judge, barred him from unlawfully trading tickets for Wimbledon and from being within the vicinity of the club's premises during the 2023 tournament.\nThe order also obliged him to share details of his associates within 24 hours.\nBut, Mr Hardiman was later found touting tickets to people queueing and no information about other touts was provided.\nDuring a hearing last month, barrister Edward Rowntree, representing the club, said Mr Hardiman \"knowingly and consciously\" failed to comply with the injunction.\nHe said Mr Hardiman should be jailed, adding that touting \"puts people off\" the sport.\nKevin Saunders, representing Mr Hardiman, said his client was initially willing to disclose information.\nBut, he said this \"evaporated\" after coverage of Mr Hardiman's case, in which he was described as a \"tout supergrass\".\nMr Saunders said \"reckless\" and \"erroneous\" reporting led to Mr Hardiman being told to stay silent by other touts and had caused him to suffer \"shame, vilification, abuse and marginalisation\".\nIn his judgement, Mr Justice Morris dismissed this claim, saying: \"The message cannot be that the court will step back from imposing the sanction that it would have otherwise imposed by reason of abuse from third parties.\n\"Neither the terms of the press reporting nor any abuse the defendant may have received since then is a good reason to suspend a custodial sentence.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A TikTok star live-streamed himself knitting for 24 hours in memory of his grandmother.\nDan Soar, from Shirland, Derbyshire, challenged himself to set the Guinness world record for arm knitting the most blankets in a day.\nThe 31-year-old, who finished his knit-a-thon on Saturday at noon, raised more than \u00a32,300 for a hospice and mental health charity.\nHe said he needed to knit 15 blankets for the record, but managed 19.\nKnown as The Tattooed Knitter online, Mr Soar only took up the hobby in December but already has more than 300,000 followers.\nHe organised the fundraiser in memory of his late grandmother, Margaret Soar, who also enjoyed knitting.\nThe locksmith said he wanted to support Derbyshire's Ashgate Hospice after the charity cared for Mrs Soar at the end of her life.\nHe also raised money for mental health charity MenWalkTalk. \nMr Soar said: \"I already wanted to do a 24-hour knit-a-thon as a personal challenge to myself, then my friend suggested that arm knitting so many blankets in 24 hours may be a world record, and it spiralled from there.  \n\"We contacted Guinness World Records directly as the timeframe was very short, and they were super enthusiastic and supportive of the idea.  \n\"I was able to achieve the world record as I had to make at least 15, and I made 19.\n\"My arms and wrists were very sore the next day and by the 20th hour, I was a little delirious, but I just kept on knitting!\"\nMr Soar films tutorials for viewers to get into knitting, while using his platform to encourage people to open up about mental health struggles.\nHe said he would send footage of himself completing the challenge to Guinness, which will review it before confirming whether he has officially set the world record.\nNo record for the most amount of blankets knitted in 24 hours has previously been set. \nA Guinness World Records spokesperson said: \"We look forward to receiving evidence from Dan's attempt for our Records Management Team to review.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Mattel is to launch a new version of Scrabble which is designed to be more collaborative and accessible for those who find word games intimidating.\nThe new double-sided Scrabble board will still feature the original game for those who want to play the traditional version.\nBut the new game on the flip side will include helper cards, use a simpler scoring system and be quicker to play.\nThe new board, Scrabble Together, will also allow people to compete in teams.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, broadcaster Gyles Brandreth described the launch as \"exciting news\".\n\"We play the original game, but change is inevitable,\" said Brandreth, who co-hosts the language podcast Something Rhymes With Purple.\nHe added that the launch of the new iteration \"doesn't deny the old version\".\n\"The makers of Scrabble found that younger people, Gen Z people, don't quite like the competitive nature of Scrabble,\" he said. \"They want a game where you can simply enjoy language, words, being together and having fun creating words.\"\nIn the new game, cards which provide help, prompts and clues can be selected to match the player's chosen challenge level.\nRay Adler, vice-president and global head of games at Mattel, said: \"Scrabble has truly stood the test of time as one of the most popular board games in history, and we want to ensure the game continues to be inclusive for all players. \n\"For anyone who's ever thought 'word games aren't for me', or felt a little intimidated by the classic game, Scrabble Together mode is an ideal option.\"\nThe new game differs from Scrabble Junior, which is more of a crossword puzzle, with letters already on the board.\nMattel said the new board marks the first time in its 75-year history that Scrabble has made such a significant change to its classic board. \nBrett Smitheram, the current UK number one and 2016 World Scrabble Champion, said: \"The game speaks to a trend in younger people who want to avoid competitive games, instead favouring teamwork and collaboration working towards a fun goal together.\" \nThe launch follows the huge popularity of online games such as Wordle, an online puzzle owned by the New York Times where players try to guess a new five-letter word every day.",
    "Banking giant HSBC is selling off its business in Argentina at a $1bn (\u00a3790m) loss after years of battling with the country's unstable exchange rate. \nHSBC Argentina, which has more than 100 branches and 3,100 employees, will be bought by Grupo Financiero Galicia, a major private financial group.\nAnnual inflation in Argentina hit 276.2% last month, the highest in the world. \nFive years ago, $1 would buy 43 pesos. It is now worth more than 860 pesos.\nHSBC has been in Argentina since 1997, when it took full control of the local Banco Roberts and renamed it. That same year, it established itself in neighbouring Brazil by taking over the ailing Bamerindus bank, leading some observers to speak of its \"relentless march into Latin America\".\nHSBC still holds on in Brazil, but purely as an investment bank: it sold its retail banking operation there in 2015. \nOther operations elsewhere in the world have been sold off in recent years as the London-based bank has pivoted to focus more on faster-growing markets in Asia.\nHSBC said the sale of its Argentine business, for $550m, will see it book a $1bn loss in its first-quarter results this year.\nThe size of the loss could vary for several reasons, including \"associated hyperinflation and foreign currency translation\", HSBC said on Tuesday.\nOver the next 12 months, the business will also recognise $4.9bn in losses from historical currency translation reserves.\nThis refers to the loss that is racked up by translating the financial performance of the Argentine business, which is counted in pesos, on to HSBC's overall balance sheet, which is counted in US dollars.\n\"These reserve losses have accumulated over many years and arise from the cumulative translation of the Argentinian peso-denominated book value of HSBC Argentina into US dollars,\" HSBC said.\nIn 2023 alone, these losses grew by $1.8bn, the bank added.\nThe exact losses may well change between now and when the sale goes through, because the exchange rate is constantly changing. \nHSBC chief executive Noel Quinn said: \"We are pleased to agree the sale of HSBC Argentina.\n\"This transaction is another important step in the execution of our strategy and enables us to focus our resources on higher-value opportunities across our international network.\n\"HSBC Argentina is largely a domestically focused business, with limited connectivity to the rest of our international network.\n\"Furthermore, given its size, it also generates substantial earnings volatility for the group when its results are translated into US dollars. Galicia is better placed to invest in and grow the business.\"",
    "A new support scheme to encourage renewable energy generation in Northern Ireland could be operational next year, the economy department has indicated.\nIt intends to introduce a competitive auction process, similar to those seen in Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland.\nThe first auction could be held next year with projects delivered by 2027.\nStormont has a target for 80% of NI's electricity to come from renewable sources, such as wind, by 2030. \nLast year, about half of Northern Ireland's electricity was generated by renewables.\nDevelopment of new renewable energy projects has slowed in recent years after the closure of a subsidy scheme known as the Northern Ireland Renewables Obligation (NIRO).\nThe planned new scheme would be a Contract for Difference (CfD) auction.\nCfD schemes involve companies bidding to develop renewable energy projects to supply the grid with electricity. \nSuch schemes ensures projects receive a guaranteed price for the electricity they will generate.\nThe competitive nature of the process should also mean that only the most efficient schemes are developed.\nIn the GB CfD scheme, if electricity prices rise above the price set at the auction, the generation companies pay the excess back to energy suppliers.\nIf prices fall below the guaranteed price the energy suppliers - and customers - pay the company the difference.\nThe Department for the Economy has published an update on the design of the NI scheme which it says will be finalised after further work which will include a financial impact assessment \"to determine the potential financial implications of the scheme on consumers' bills\".\nProgress towards a new support scheme has been welcomed by the industry group RenewableNI.\nIts director Steven Agnew said: \"There is a massive pipeline of renewable projects just waiting on the right policy signals to hit go. \n\"RenewableNI is looking forward to working constructively with the Department for the Economy to get this right.\n\"Working together, we can protect consumers from high costs of energy and ensure a security of supply.\n\"Everyone knows the decisions made over the next year will determine the success or failure of the 2030 target.\"",
    "Council tax bills have gone up for millions of households in England and Wales.\nLarge increases set by local authorities came into force on 1 April. Many have also slashed services in an effort to balance their books.\nCouncils with social care duties can raise council tax every year by up to 4.99%, without triggering a referendum. Others can increase it by up to 2.99%. \nThe County Councils Network previously predicted that 75% of councils would introduce the maximum increase in April 2024.\nThe average increase for a band D property in England for 2024-2025 will be \u00a3106, taking bills up to \u00a32,171. The average rise in April 2023 was \u00a399.\nCouncils can increase bills by more than 5% without a referendum if they have government permission.\nBirmingham City Council, for example, has approved an increase of 21% over the next two years, as it tries to make savings of \u00a3300m.\nWoking Borough Council agreed an increase of 10%. Thurrock put bills up by 8%, while Sough approved an 8.5% rise. All have effectively declared themselves bankrupt.\nIn Wales, a 12% council tax rise was approved for Pembrokeshire. \nCouncil charges also rose in Northern Ireland. However, in Scotland they are frozen until 2025. \nCouncil tax is a compulsory charge on properties in England, Scotland and Wales. It is set by local authorities to raise money for providing services. \nTypically, anyone who is over 18 and owns or rents a home has to pay council tax. \nHowever, there are some exemptions and discounts.\nSomeone living alone, for example, is entitled to a 25% reduction. \nProperties occupied only by students are exempt.\nAnd there are some discounts if you, or someone you live with, has a disability.\nMost people pay in 10 monthly instalments and then don't pay anything in February and March.\nNorthern Ireland uses a domestic rating system instead of council tax.\nHow much you pay depends on the council tax band your property is in. The more expensive the property, the higher the band.\nIn England and Scotland, bands are based on the price the property would have sold for in 1991, and in Wales it is 2003. Northern Ireland's system uses 2005 prices.\nYou can check which band your home is in:\nCouncil tax is a major source of income for most councils. It helps fund numerous services, including:\nCouncil tax bills also include additional charges - called levies - which pay for other services.\nOne goes towards the cost of care homes and other adult social care services. Another is set by local police and fire authorities to help fund their services.\nSome cities with mayors, such as London and Manchester, can also add a separate levy that covers funding various services.\nCouncils in England can raise some income by charging for services like parking, swimming pools, planning applications and from commercial investments. \nBut about half of local authority funding comes from council tax, the Institute for Government says. \nMost of the rest comes from a mix of business rates and central government grants.\nBy the 2024-25 financial year, councils will have seen a 27% fall in spending power for local services since 2010, according to the Local Government Association (LGA).\nIt says cuts in central government grants, rising inflation, higher energy costs and increases to the National Living Wage are all factors.\nNottingham City Council said reduced government funding was one of the reasons it had to approve hundreds of job losses and cut social care and youth services.\nIts leader David Mellen told the BBC \u00a3100m had been taken from its budget \"each and every year in the last 10 years\".\nCouncils don't technically go bankrupt, but if they can't balance the budget for the financial year, they can issue what's called a section 114 notice.\nThis means they can't commit to most new spending, and residents could see cuts to services, such as reducing the number of bin collections or dimming streetlights.\nBefore 2018, only two councils had issued a section 114. Since then, there have been more than 10 such notices\nOne in five English councils say that it is in danger of going bankrupt, according to the LGA.\nA number of authorities in England have not issued section 114 notices but are receiving exceptional financial support to manage financial pressures.\nMiddlesbrough Council, for example, is one of 19 authorities that has permission to borrow money to fund day-to-day spending in 2024-25.\nBirmingham City Council went bust in 2023, with a \u00a3760m black hole. It followed Woking Council, Thurrock and Croydon (for a third time).\nDon't just stop paying - councils may take legal action to reclaim the money.\nInstead, contact the council and explain the situation, Citizens Advice suggests.\nYou might be able to pay less council tax or not pay it at all depending on your circumstances.",

    "Security is being increased at Champions League games after a media outlet supporting the Islamic State group published threats against venues.\nMinisters in both France and Spain confirmed enhanced security measures.\nA pro-IS media channel published several images of stadiums hosting quarter-final ties on Tuesday and Wednesday.\nUefa said it was aware of the threats, but said games in Madrid, Paris and London would go ahead as planned.\nFrench Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin said there would be \"considerably reinforced\" security measures in place when PSG play Barcelona in Paris on Wednesday.\nMr Darmanin continued: \"I will remind you that only 10 days ago, IS shared a picture of the Munich stadium and said action should be taken against sports venues that host football games - although all sports can be targeted. Given how important the Champions League is for football, we are of course talking to our partners.\"\nThe jihadist images posted this week did not refer to any particular match or event and were shared by pro-IS media groups not officially linked to the organisation itself.\nTwo quarter-finals are being held in Madrid this week. Real Madrid drew 3-3 with Manchester City on Tuesday night, while Atletico Madrid take on Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday.\nPilar Alegr\u00eda, Spain's sports minister, has issued a message of \"calm\" ahead of the games in Madrid and said \"more than 2,000 police and civil guard officers\" are being deployed. \nThe acting mayor of Madrid, Inmaculada Sanz, told Spanish media there was no specific threat afoot, adding the terrorist alert level in Spain was four out of five, which is classified as high risk. \n\"These announcements are usually propaganda actions to provoke fear,\" she said.\n\"Both the security forces and the intelligence services are studying any possible threat, but there is nothing that makes us foresee a situation of special risk.\"\nA counter-terrorism source told the BBC that IS did not normally advertise planned attacks, citing last month's shootings at a theatre in Moscow. That had not been discussed in advance on any social media channels. \nArsenal drew 2-2 with Bayern Munich in London on Tuesday night. Ahead of the fixture, Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Ade Adelekan said: \"We're aware of online and media reports in relation to calls to target matches across Europe and here in London. \n\"However, I want to reassure the public that we have a robust policing plan in place for tonight's match and we continue to work closely alongside the club's security team to ensure that the match passes peacefully.\"\nThe pro-IS channel featured images of the Emirates Stadium in London, the Bernabeu and Metropolitano Stadiums in Madrid, as well as the Parc des Princes Stadium in Paris. \nAlthough the channel is not officially linked to IS, it is thought the directive to publish the threats may have come from the jihadist group itself, as its leadership recently hinted at close co-ordination between official media operatives and online supporters.\nMaterial seeking to incite attacks on channels with long-standing ties to the group have increased in the wake of last month's Moscow concert hall attack, according to specialists at the BBC's Monitoring service.\nAnother image shared last week depicted the Allianz Arena in Munich, which is due to host Bayern Munich's return leg against Arsenal next week.\nA spokesman for European football's governing body said: \"Uefa is aware of alleged terrorist threats made towards this week's Uefa Champions League matches and is closely liaising with the authorities at the respective venues.\n\"All matches are planned to go ahead as scheduled with appropriate security arrangements in place.\"\nGermany is set to host the Euro 2024 European Championships later this year. \nWhen asked last month about threats to stadium security, German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the \"dangers have reached a new level\". \"The state is arming itself even more strongly against all current threats,\" she added.\nAhead of Arsenal's match against Bayern Munich at the Emirates Stadium, a spokesperson said venue staff were \"working closely with the Metropolitan Police regarding the safety and security of all supporters and staff at Emirates Stadium for all our matches\".\n\"Our planning for tonight's fixture is no different and our approach, working together with the Police and UEFA, is proportionate to the current UK threat level.\"\nThe Deputy Assistant Commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police, Ade Adelekan, said officers had \"a robust policing plan\" in place for Tuesday's match, but asked the public to \"remain vigilant\" at the event.\n\"The UK terrorism threat level remains at 'substantial', meaning an attack is likely, and we work closely with colleagues from across Counter-Terrorism Policing in planning for events here in London, to take into account any relevant information that could help us to keep those attending safe,\" he said in a statement.",

    "Germany has said Israel's security is at the \"core\" of its foreign policy, as it defends a genocide case brought against it at the UN's highest court. \nNicaragua had accused it of breaching the UN genocide convention by sending military hardware to Israel and ceasing funding of the UN's aid agency.\nBerlin rejected the claims at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague on Tuesday.\nIn 2023 some 30% of Israel's military equipment purchases came from Germany.\nThe purchases totalled \u20ac300m ($326m; \u00a3257m).\nThe allegations build on a separate case taken by South Africa in January, where judges in the Hague ordered Israel to take \"every possible measure\" to avoid genocidal acts.\nIsrael rejects accusations that it is engaging in genocidal acts in its campaign in Gaza, and has insisted it has the right to defend itself.\nMore than 33,000 have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry there says, the majority of them civilians. Gaza is on the brink of famine, with Oxfam reporting that 300,000 people trapped in the north have lived since January on an average of 245 calories a day.\nNicaragua says Germany's arms sales to Israel, which totalled $326.5m last year - a tenfold increase on 2022 - make it complicit in Israel's alleged war crimes. The Central American country had brought the case to the Hague to ask judges to issue emergency measures to stop Berlin from providing Israel with weapons and other assistance.\nFirmly rejecting the accusations, Germany's representative argued on Tuesday that Nicaragua's case - which she said was rushed and based on the \"flimsiest of evidence\" - was aimed more toward Israel.\n\"Nicaragua insists [on] initiating proceedings against Germany before this court, [and] has taken a one-sided view of the conflict. It fails to properly appreciate both the facts and the law in this situation\", lawyer Tania von Uslar-Gleichen said on Tuesday.\n\"Our history is the reason why Israel's security has been at the core of Germany's foreign policy,\" she told the court.\n\"Where Germany has provided support to Israel, including in a form of export of arms and other military equipment, the quality and purposes of these supplies have been grossly distorted by Nicaragua.\" \nIn her opening statement, she argued that Germany was doing its \"utmost to live up to its responsibility\" to both Palestinians and Israelis.\nGermany had a duty to remind Israel of the rules of international humanitarian law, even as it exercised its \"right to self defence\", she added.\nOn the issue of ceasing its funding of the UN's aid agency, she argued that Germany was among the largest international donors to Gaza in 2024.\nAnother lawyer representing Germany, Christian Tams, said that Germany had resumed funding operations of the UN's Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), a fact \"ignored by Nicaragua\".\nGermany was one of 15 Western nations which suspended funding for UNRWA over allegations that some of the agency's staff were involved in the 7 October attacks on Israel.\nAccording to papers filed with the ICJ, Nicaragua wanted the UN's top court to resume funding of the aid agency, one of the few international bodies still operating in Gaza.\nOn Monday, the opening day of the trial, Nicaragua's lawyers had said Berlin was \"pathetic\" for supplying Israel with arms while at the same time giving humanitarian aid to Palestinians.\nAlain Pellet, a lawyer for Nicaragua, said it was \"urgent that Germany suspend continued sales.\n\"Germany was and is fully conscious of the risk that the arms it has furnished and continues to furnish to Israel\" could be used to commit genocide, he told judges.\nNicaragua's case has raised broader questions about the accountability of countries supplying weapons to Israel since the Gaza conflict began.\nMichael Becker, a law professor at Trinity College Dublin, told the BBC on Monday that there was uncertainty about states' obligations to prevent genocide or ensure respect for humanitarian law. The case against Germany, he said, could potentially help clarify the issue.\n\"Under international law, states can also be held responsible for aiding or assisting in another state's violations of international law,\" he observed. \n\"But international law on aid or assistance in the commission of an unlawful act is full of uncertainty. For example, it may not be clear whether Nicaragua needs to demonstrate both that Germany knew its assistance to Israel risked contributing to violations of international law but that that Germany intended that result.\nCritics of Nicaragua's case have highlighted the country's chequered human rights record. The government of President Daniel Ortega has jailed opponents and banned protests. In March, the UK's mission to the UN accused the government of a \"relentless\" crackdown on human rights.",
    "A Missouri man who murdered his cousin and her husband in 2006 has been executed by lethal injection despite clemency appeals by prison staff. \nBrian Dorsey, 52, shot Sarah and Ben Bonnie after they agreed to help him with debts he owed to drug dealers. \nThe couple's four-year-old daughter was at the home during the fatal attack. \nHe was pronounced dead at 18:11 local time (23:11GMT) on Tuesday, according to a news release from the Missouri Department of Corrections.\nAdvocates for Dorsey argued that he had reformed during his stay in prison and that he did not have adequate legal defence during his trial.\nThe US Supreme Court rejected two bids to delay the execution. The governor also rejected a request for clemency, saying in a statement on Monday that Dorsey \"punished his loving family for helping him in a time of need\".\nMissouri Governor Michael Parsons also cited prosecutors' claims that he sexually assaulted his cousin's body after killing her. Lawyers for Dorsey reject the allegation, saying it was never proven at trial.\nDorsey turned himself in to the police three days after the attack. He confessed and pleaded guilty. \nHe is the first inmate executed by Missouri this year, after four people were put to death in the state in 2023.\nLawyers for Dorsey argued that he had become a model inmate in the last 17 years, one who worked as a prison barber giving haircuts to staff, and was remorseful for his crimes. \nThey said he was suffering drug-induced psychosis at the time of the attack, two days before Christmas, and that his lawyers faced a financial conflict of interest during trial.\nAt the time, the Missouri Public Defender Office's paid court-appointed lawyers a flat fee of $12,000 (\u00a39,500) per case. A low sum, given the thousands of hours normally needed in capital justice murder cases.\nThey argue his lawyers rushed him to take a plea deal that did not ensure that he would not be given a death sentence.  \nFormer Missouri Supreme Court Justice Michael Wolff wrote to the governor saying the payment system, which has since been changed, has \"undoubtedly influenced everything\".\nMr Wolff wrote that executing Dorsey \"will dishonor our system of capital punishment\".\nA petition signed by more than 70 correctional officers argued his sentence should be commuted to life in prison due to good behaviour. \n\"The Brian I have known for years could not hurt anyone,\" one officer wrote in the petition. \"The Brian I know does not deserve to be executed.\"\nIn his final statement before his death, Dorsey again apologised to his victims and their relatives.\n\"To all of the family and loved ones I share with Sarah and to all of the surviving family and loved ones of Ben, I am totally, deeply, overwhelmingly sorry,\" he wrote. \n\"Words cannot hold the just weight of my guilt and shame.

    "Boeing is facing new pressure after a whistleblower reported safety concerns over the manufacturing of some of its planes to US regulators.\nEngineer Sam Salehpour accused Boeing of taking shortcuts in the construction of its 787 and 777 jets.\nHe claimed he was \"threatened with termination\" after raising concerns with bosses.\nBut Boeing said the claims were \"inaccurate\" and added it was confident its planes were safe.\n\"The issues raised have been subject to rigorous engineering examination under [Federal Aviation Administration] oversight,\" the company said.\n\"This analysis has validated that these issues do not present any safety concerns and the aircraft will maintain its service life over several decades.\"\nShares in the plane manufacturer sank almost 2% on Tuesday after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it was investigating the claims, and the company reported it had delivered just 83 planes to customers in the first three months of the year - the smallest number since 2021. \nThe whistleblower complaint, which was first reported by the New York Times, is the latest incident to focus attention on the safety of planes made by US-based Boeing, one of the world's two major producers of commercial planes. \nThe company was already facing criminal investigation and other legal troubles, after an unused exit door broke off of one of its smaller 737 Max 9 planes shortly after take-off in January.\nPassengers escaped serious injury but the incident has plunged the company into crisis, forcing a temporary grounding of dozens of 737 Max 9 planes, drawing regulatory probes and prompting Boeing to dramatically slow production of its planes.\nThe company coming under intense scrutiny again led its chief executive David Calhoun to announce last month that he would step down by the end of the year.\nOn Tuesday, attorneys for engineer Mr Salehpour said Boeing had made decisions for 787 aircraft assembly which placed stress on joints that linked up parts of the body of the jets, an issue affecting more than 1,000 planes. \nIn a whistleblower complaint filed with the FAA in January, he alleged the method could reduce the lifespan of the plane. \n\"These problems are the direct result of Boeing's decision in recent years to prioritize profits over safety, and a regulator in the FAA that has become too deferential to industry,\" his lawyers, Debra Katz and Lisa Banks, said in a statement.\nThe attorneys added Mr Salehpour had been transferred to work on the 777 plane after he raised concerns.\nThey said he had soon observed other issues in the assembly of that plane.\n\"He was threatened with termination, excluded from important meetings, projects, and communication, denied reasonable requests for medical leave,  assigned work outside of his expertise, and effectively declared persona non grata to his colleagues,\" they said.\nThe 787 Dreamliner is a bigger plane than the 737, often used on international flights. It has been flying commercially since 2011, but almost from the start has been the target of quality complaints. \nBoeing eventually slowed production and stopped deliveries for almost two years, responding to issues that had been raised. The FAA in 2022 cleared Boeing to resume deliveries. \nThe FAA, which has increased its oversight of Boeing since the door plug blowout in January, said in a statement that it encouraged people in the aviation industry to share information. \n\"We thoroughly investigate all reports,\" the agency said when asked about the report.

    "Prosecutors are set to argue that Alec Baldwin was unable to control his emotions on the film set of Rust where a cinematographer was fatally shot.\nThey will also argue that he \"shamelessly lied\" and changed his story after the event.\nIn October 2021 Halyna Hutchins was accidentally shot on the set by a gun that Mr Baldwin was holding. \nMr Baldwin is set to go on trial for involuntary manslaughter in July, a charge he denies.\nIn a court filing on Monday, prosecutor Kari Morrissey alleged Baldwin's unpredictable behaviour contributed to the tragedy and that he kept changing his story in its aftermath.\n\"Mr Baldwin was frequently screaming and cursing at himself, at crew members or at no one and not for any particular reason.\n\"To watch Mr Baldwin's conduct on the set of Rust is to witness a man who has absolutely no control of his own emotions and absolutely no concern for how his conduct affects those around him,\" Morrissey wrote. \n\"Witnesses have testified that it was this exact conduct that contributed to safety compromises on set,\" the prosecutor added.\nBBC News has asked legal representatives for Mr Baldwin for comment on the latest court filing.\nThe 66-year-old actor was practising firing a Colt .45 pistol before filming a scene for Rust, a forthcoming Western filmed near Santa Fe, New Mexico, in October 2021.\nBut the gun went off, with a live round fatally striking 42-year-old Ms Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza.\nHe has maintained he did not pull the trigger and only drew back its hammer.\nThe prosecutor said this was \"absurd\" and alleged that the actor did not claim this when he was first interviewed but had done so a month later. \n\"Every time Mr Baldwin spoke, a different version of events emerged from his mouth, and his later statements contradicted his previous statements,\" the prosecutor said.\nThe film set weapons handler, Hannah Gutierrez, who loaded a gun for actor Alec Baldwin before it fired was convicted in March of involuntary manslaughter. \nThe 26-year-old faces up to 18 months in jail.

    "A Wimbledon ticket tout has been told by a High Court judge he will be jailed unless he discloses his associates.\nThe All England Lawn Tennis Club took out an injunction against Oliver Hardiman last July, as part of efforts to combat touting.\nIn December, the club asked the High Court to send him to prison after he breached the order and entered Wimbledon.\nMr Hardiman's barristers argued a fine or suspended sentence would suffice.\nIn a ruling on Tuesday, Mr Justice Morris said an immediate prison sentence was \"appropriate\".\nHowever, Mr Morris gave Mr Hardiman a final chance to \"purge\" his contempt by sharing details of his associates later this month.\nSpeaking to Mr Hardiman directly, he added: \"I have given you one final opportunity to think again.\n\"You will have until 26 April to provide the information. If you do, then subject to anything the claimants have to say, it is likely you will not be going immediately to prison.\n\"If you don't provide the information, you will.\"\nMr Hardiman was also ordered to pay more than \u00a319,000 in costs, which he must pay by that date too.\nStandard tickets for Wimbledon are issued through a strictly controlled ballot run by the club and cannot be transferred. \nVisitors are required to show photographic ID alongside their ticket when entering.\nThe injunction issued against Mr Hardiman, made by a different High Court judge, barred him from unlawfully trading tickets for Wimbledon and from being within the vicinity of the club's premises during the 2023 tournament.\nThe order also obliged him to share details of his associates within 24 hours.\nBut, Mr Hardiman was later found touting tickets to people queueing and no information about other touts was provided.\nDuring a hearing last month, barrister Edward Rowntree, representing the club, said Mr Hardiman \"knowingly and consciously\" failed to comply with the injunction.\nHe said Mr Hardiman should be jailed, adding that touting \"puts people off\" the sport.\nKevin Saunders, representing Mr Hardiman, said his client was initially willing to disclose information.\nBut, he said this \"evaporated\" after coverage of Mr Hardiman's case, in which he was described as a \"tout supergrass\".\nMr Saunders said \"reckless\" and \"erroneous\" reporting led to Mr Hardiman being told to stay silent by other touts and had caused him to suffer \"shame, vilification, abuse and marginalisation\".\nIn his judgement, Mr Justice Morris dismissed this claim, saying: \"The message cannot be that the court will step back from imposing the sanction that it would have otherwise imposed by reason of abuse from third parties.\n\"Neither the terms of the press reporting nor any abuse the defendant may have received since then is a good reason to suspend a custodial sentence.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

I believe they were in shock with their baby coming early.\n\"I don't accept their recollection.\"\nDr Hinds told the inquest she remembered the couple \"had no firm views either way\" on the delivery choice and the couple agreed to \"go for the vaginal\". \n\"Cases like Mrs Brady's don't leave you,\" she said.\n\"I recall it like it was yesterday.\"\nDr Sharma, who delivered baby Troy. also gave evidence and told the inquest he accepted the birth was high risk due to the prematurity of the birth and the breech position.\nDr Sharma said a vaginal delivery and a C-section delivery were \"offered\" to the couple and he was not alerted to any difficulties in the counselling around delivery options. \n\"I had no doubt in Dr Hinds experience and skills,\" he said.\nHowever, Dr Sharma said: \"I should have discussed this with the couple. I should have double-checked\".\nIt was also put to Dr Sharma that experts for the coroner agreed \"that with a C-section, baby Troy would have survived.\"\nDr Sharma was also asked about his choice to have Mrs Brady deliver in what the inquest called the all-fours position.\nThis instruction caused some \"surprise\" in the midwives present, and Dr Sharma agreed they were not comfortable with that delivery position.\nDr Sharma said he was experienced with the mode of delivery, having performed it at least 12 times at other hospitals. However, he acknowledged that for staff at Craigavon Area Hospital it was a new practice.\nHe said he knew it was the best way, but added: \"I should have taken staff in to account.\" \nWhen asked had he ever performed the specified delivery method in a pre-term pregnancy before, Dr Sharma replied: \"Probably not.\"\nA solicitor asked Dr Sharma if that choice of delivery could have caused a delay during the delivery, Dr Sharma said \"no\".\nDr Sharma said he was \"really sorry about what happened on the day\".\nThe inquest continues.

    "A truce between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza was never going to be easy. Weeks of talks have failed to produce agreement. But international pressure is growing.\nPerhaps the biggest sign is the Biden administration sending William Burns, the head of the CIA, for the latest round of talks in Cairo.\nHamas has, in public at least, stuck with its initial demands of a permanent ceasefire, the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops and the return of displaced Palestinians to northern parts of the territory without restrictions.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile insists that Israel will continue fighting until Hamas is destroyed and hostages the group is holding are free. \n\"There's a lot more American pressure on Israel, and on Egypt and Qatar to put pressure on Hamas. That's obvious,\" said Gershon Baskin, who helped negotiate a deal with Hamas for the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011. \n\"The fact that the head of the CIA showed up, which required all the negotiators to be there at the highest level. That's indicative of increased American pressure.\"\nBut that does not mean a deal is at hand.\nIsraeli officials have indicated willingness to make some concessions amid intensifying frustration among the country's main allies, including the US. Earlier this week, the Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, suggested that now was the right time for a truce.\nAny deal is expected to see the release of some of the hostages captured in the Hamas attacks in return for Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails, which was the basis for a truce that led to a temporary pause in hostilities in November. According to Israeli authorities, 133 people remain captive in Gaza, although at least 30 have already been confirmed dead.\nUnder the latest US proposal, an initial phase of a six-week ceasefire would see Hamas release 40 hostages who are alive, with the priority being given to female captives including soldiers, men over the age of 50 and those with serious medical conditions. \nIsrael would then release at least 700 Palestinians, including about 100 who are serving life sentences for killing Israelis, which has proved controversial in Israel in the past. \nBut Hamas has reportedly told negotiators it is not holding 40 people in this category, raising the prospect that many more hostages than previously thought have died or that they could be in the hands of other armed groups, such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad.      \nIn Israel, Mr Netanyahu's room for manoeuvre is limited by pressure from different parts of society and politics. While most of the Israeli public remain supportive of the war, there are growing calls for him to agree to a deal for the release of the hostages. \nThe families have held large protests, accusing the prime minister of not making the captives' return a priority and of being more concerned with his own political survival. Calls for Mr Netanyahu to resign are on the rise too.\nDivisions have intensified within Mr Netanyahu's governing coalition, which includes far-right, ultranationalist allies who refuse concessions to Hamas and insist the war must go on. \nFinance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told the prime minister that increasing pressure on Hamas was the only way to bring the hostages back and destroy the group, while National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir explicitly threatened to bring down Mr Netanyahu himself if he did not go ahead with a much-promised offensive into the city of Rafah, in southern Gaza. \nIsraeli officials insist it is essential to enter Rafah, where, they say, Hamas has four operational brigades and its senior leaders could be hiding. \nBut virtually everyone outside Israel is against an offensive in the city, where about 1.5 million Palestinians are sheltering in tents, improvised shelters and overcrowded camps, over concerns of the catastrophic impact it could have on civilians. \nIn what could have been an attempt to counter domestic criticism, on Monday, Mr Netanyahu said a date had already been set for a Rafah operation, without giving details.\n\"There's a revolt going on right now in the government, and within [Mr Netanyahu's party] Likud, against Netanyahu making any kind of deal that they don't think should be made,\" Mr Baskin said. \n\"Netanyahu is not a free actor. He's a hostage himself within his own government.\"\nFor its part Hamas has yet to give a formal response to the latest proposal, but said that while it was interested in an agreement \"that puts an end to the aggression on our people\", the offer did not meet its demands.\n\"The Israeli position remains intransigent,\" the group said in a statement.\nThe White House described the group's response as \"less than encouraging\".\nA final decision will probably be made by Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza who is thought to be hiding in tunnels surrounded by guards and hostages. But communications with him are difficult and said to involve several intermediaries and take day",

    "Children from low-income families who grew up near a Sure Start centre did better than their peers at GCSEs, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).\nIts research says those living near a centre performed up to three grades better than those further away.\nSure Start began in 1998 to support new parents, especially in disadvantaged areas, but many centres have closed.\nThe Department for Education (DfE) said its family hubs scheme had a \"number of advantages\" over the Sure Start model.\nThe IFS study, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, used postcodes from when children were five years old to determine roughly how close the nearest centre was.\nIt then looked at the GCSE results of those children 11 years later and found \"big improvements\" in the performance of those living near a centre, especially those from low-income backgrounds.\nThe study found a child on free school meals who got DDD in their GCSE grades would be more likely to get three Cs - or three 3s would become three 4s under the current boundaries - if they lived close to a Sure Start centre in their early years.\nFormer prime minister Gordon Brown, the Labour chancellor who first announced the initiative in 1998, said the UK \"desperately needs a new Sure Start\". \n\"These results tell us in detail what most parents already know,\" he told the Guardian. \"That if you provide a supportive environment to children in their early years and invest in their futures, the results will be life-transforming.\"\nAmong all children in the study, those who lived near a Sure Start centre performed better at GCSEs than those who lived further away, but the trend was more pronounced among those eligible for free school meals, and those from minority ethnic backgrounds. \nThe effects were more pronounced at centres which started earlier in the programme, the IFS said, as they tended to have bigger budgets and better outreach to help bring in families who could benefit from using them.\nThe scheme improved early support for children with special educational needs, and reduced the need for expensive education, health and care plans in their teenage years, the IFS said.\nSure Start was introduced by Tony Blair's Labour government in 1998 as \"one-stop shops\" providing parents of children under five with integrated support around health, education, childcare and employment, particularly in disadvantaged areas.\nAt its peak in 2010, the IFS says spending on the scheme topped out at \u00a32.5bn in today's prices, with more than 3,000 centres around the country.\nAn IFS report from 2019 found Sure Start reduced the number of children being admitted to hospital, but said funding for the scheme had been cut and 500 sites had closed.\nSarah Cattan, an IFS research fellow who co-authored the report, said government spending on early years had \"significantly increased\" since 2010, but had shifted away from integrated services and towards funding free childcare.\nA DfE official said the government now spent four times more overall on early years than had been spent on Sure Start at its peak.\nIts investment in childcare would be \"transformative for children and families\".\nAnd 75 councils in England were running family hubs, which, unlike Sure Start, provided support until children turned 19 - or 25, if they had special educational needs or disabilities.\nBut Ms Cattan said the hubs currently receive a fraction of what was spent on Sure Start at its peak, so are \"unlikely to go as far in realising the potential\" of integrated early years services.\nNiamh Sweeney, deputy general secretary of the National Education Union, said Sure Start had been \"decimated, leaving families in desperate need of support\".\nNeil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said the IFS study showed that children's centres provide \"vital\" opportunities to \"support children's long-term development and improve their life chances\".\nHe added: \"While the government's new programme of family hubs is undoubtedly welcome, with the current rollout limited to 75 local authorities, it's very difficult to see how the plans will compensate for the sheer scale of children's centre closures that have taken place over recent years.\" \nSenior Labour figures, including former Prime Minster Gordon Brown and former Home Secretary David Blunkett, have called for Sure Start centres to be at the heart of the party's election manifesto.\nBut shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves refused to commit to funding new Sure Start centres.\n\"I know it made a big difference to the lives of very many people,\" she told BBC One's Breakfast programme.\n\"There are lots of things I would like to do - but I will always make sure all our policies are fully costed and fully funded.\n\"And the breakfast clubs that we will fund will make a big difference to make sure that all children have a good start to the day and parents can take on more hours at work.\"\nNaomi Eisenstadt, the first director of Sure Start, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government was invest",
    "An LGBT navy veteran has won an award for her efforts to get a rule banning gay people from the navy overturned by taking the UK to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).\nEmma Riley, who lives in Brighton, was a Royal Navy radio operator for three years before she was arrested and discharged after telling a colleague about her sexuality in the early 1990s.\nShe has been named Hero of the Year at the British Diversity Awards for her campaigning efforts.\nA government spokesperson said the treatment of LGBT serving personnel between 1967 and 2000 was \"wholly unacceptable\" and encouraged LGBT veterans to \"apply for restorative measures online\".\nThousands of veterans are thought to be affected by laws that were in place until 2000 that made it illegal to be gay in the British military.\nThe LGBT Veterans Independent Review, published last year, said many faced invasive medical examinations, intrusive police investigations and in some cases, as recently as 1996, were sent to prison for their sexuality. Many still have a criminal record to this day.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak previously called the ban an \"appalling failure\" of the British state.\nMs Riley took the UK to the ECHR to challenge the ban and helped change the UK law in 2000 to allow LGBT people to serve in the military.\nShe told Kathy Caton on BBC Radio Sussex that her treatment in the navy was \"humiliating and ridiculous\" and \"incredibly ostracising\".\nShe said it was \"quite mind-blowing\" to receive the award.\n\"I feel I've taken something pretty horrific and tried to make something good,\" she added.\nA government spokesperson said:  \u201cWe deeply regret the treatment of LGBT serving personnel between 1967 and 2000, which was wholly unacceptable and does not reflect today\u2019s Armed Forces, and thank those that have come forward to share their stories.\n\u201cWe have already implemented over half of the recommendations of the LGBT veterans review and are working at pace to deliver those that remain.\n\u201cWe will be providing more information as soon as we can and encourage LGBT veterans to apply for restorative measures online.\u201d\nThe full interview, \u201cOut with Kathy\u201d, is on BBC Radio Sussex at 9pm and on BBC Sounds.\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron has confirmed that UK arms sales to Israel will not be suspended.\nThe announcement follows mounting pressure on the government over its weapons trade with Israel, after an air strike which killed aid workers and the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\nMinisters have been asked whether legal advice deems Israel to have breached international humanitarian law. \nIf proved, it could ultimately bar arms sales from the UK.\nOn 8 March, Lord Cameron said he would get new advice on the issue \"in the coming days\". \nEarlier on Tuesday, at a State Department news conference in Washington, the BBC asked Lord Cameron why, a month later, there had still been no announcement on a decision. He confirmed he had now reviewed the \"most recent advice\" about Israeli conduct, saying: \"The latest assessment leaves our position on export licences unchanged.\"\nLord Cameron said: \"Let me be clear, though, we continue to have to have grave concerns around the humanitarian access issue in Gaza, both for the period that was assessed and subsequently.\n\"So far, no like-minded countries have taken the decision to suspend existing arms export licences to Israel and I'd add that Israel remains a vital defensive security partner to the UK,\" he added. \nBut Labour's shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, suggested the government's position was \"simply not good enough\".\n\"David Cameron is still hiding from scrutiny, by stating that arms sales will continue without even publishing a summary of the legal advice or offering any rationale behind his decision\", he said.\nSecretary of State Anthony Blinken, meanwhile, said the US had not been given a date by Israel for its threatened ground offensive into the city of Rafah. The Biden administration has repeatedly said it opposes a full-scale assault on the city, which is home to 1.4 million displaced Palestinians.\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he has set a date for an operation but has not clarified exactly when that is. Israel says it is targeting four Hamas battalions that remain in Rafah.\nMr Blinken said the US was having \"an ongoing conversation with Israel about any Rafah operation\".\nThe BBC asked him about last week's air strike by Israel that killed seven workers from the food charity World Central Kitchen, and whether the family of Jacob Flickinger, a US-Canadian citizen among those killed, could expect meaningful accountability. \nHe said Israel had taken some \"initial steps in that direction\", including sacking two senior commanders who were engaged in what he called a \"horrible incident\". \n\"But we're in the process, an ongoing process of looking at the looking at the conclusions and talking both to Israel and humanitarian organisations about it,\" Mr Blinken added. \nLord Cameron was also asked to divulge the details of his dinner with former President Donald Trump on Monday, which he dismissed saying it was a \"private meeting\". \nThe pair dined at Mr Trump's Florida estate Mar-a-Lago, and Lord Cameron said they \"discussed a range of important geopolitical subjects\".\nHe argued there was precedent for foreign secretaries to meet opposition candidates during visits abroad.\nLord Cameron has previously criticised Mr Trump, who is the presumptive nominee for the Republican Party in the US presidential election in November.\nMr Trump, and his supporters within the party, oppose the US package providing aid to Ukraine. Some in the House of Representatives have vowed to vote against the package without additional funding for US border security being agreed to first.\nLord Cameron has been urging Republicans for some time to approve the aid package, particularly angering Republican congresswoman and Trump loyalist Marjorie Taylor-Greene, who previously told the foreign secretary to \"kiss my ass\".\nShe was responding to an article written by the foreign secretary, in which he warned the US against showing \"the weakness displayed against [Nazi Germany leader Adolf] Hitler in the 1930s\".\nIn 2015, during his time as prime minister, Lord Cameron labelled Mr Trump's proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the US \"divisive, stupid and wrong\".\n\"I think if he came to visit our country I think it'd unite us all against him,\" Lord Cameron said at the time, when Mr Trump was not yet elected.\nMr Trump replied by warning he may not have a \"very good relationship\" with Mr Cameron during his presidency.\nIn his memoirs published in 2019, Lord Cameron further said that he found it \"depressing\" that Mr Trump could win an election, and that it was due to his \"protectionist, xenophobic, misogynistic interventions\".\nAsked by the BBC whether he still held that view of Mr Trump, the foreign secretary declined to answer. \nElsewhere, in a potentially embarrassing development, it has emerged that a crucial meeting Lord Cameron said he was going to have with Mike Johnson, the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, has not yet taken place. \nBefore travelling, the forei",

    "Tens of millions of people across the US, Canada and Mexico were treated to a total solar eclipse on Monday.\nWhole cities were plunged into darkness as the Moon briefly blocked out the Sun's rays in areas along what is known as the path of totality.\nAwestruck stargazers - or those who missed the event because of cloud cover or other commitments - now want to know when the phenomenon can next be observed. \nThis time, the interval will be much longer than the previous six-year wait. The next total eclipse in the contiguous United States will not happen for more than 20 years - and will be much more fleeting.\nIt will happen on 23 August 2044 and will appear in Greenland before becoming visible in Canada, according to non-profit organisation the Planetary Society.\nIt will be visible in only three US states: North and South Dakota and Montana.\nThere will then be another event the following year, in 2045, that will be possible to witness coast to coast across the US, as well as parts of Latin America. \nSolar eclipses themselves are not that rare - in fact, there are about two to four that occur per year.\nBut the chances of seeing a total eclipse are much rarer. The Earth is quite big and most of it is covered by oceans. More often than not, humans do not get to see one in person.\nThere will be a total eclipse visible over Alaska - which is not part of the contiguous US - on 30 March 2033. \nThe next total eclipse anywhere in the world will be on 12 August 2026, which Nasa says will be visible over Greenland, Iceland, Spain, Russia and a small area of Portugal.\nOther areas including the UK, Africa and North America will experience a partial eclipse - more on this below.\nA solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, blocking some or all of the Sun's rays from reaching the Earth.\nThe phenomenon is a cosmic event, requiring the Sun, the Moon and the Earth to be in just the right alignment for the Moon to cast a shadow on our planet.\nWhen this happens, the Moon casts two types of shadow.\nOne results in a partial solar eclipse, which obscures only part of the Sun.\nThe other - and the most spectacular - is the total solar eclipse.

supported him while 69  voted against his appointment.\nHe was officially installed as taoiseach on Tuesday afternoon after travelling to meet President Michael D Higgins to receive the seals of office.\nMr Harris was the only candidate to seek the party leadership after Mr Varadkar's shock resignation announcement in March.\nSpeaking in the D\u00e1il, the new taoiseach described his election as a \"very special day\". \n\"I accept this new role in a spirit of humility, ready for the challenge and full of energy and determination about what can be achieved,\" he said.\nHe added that Ireland must never take peace for granted and he pledged to guard and honour his role \"as protector and guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement\". \nMr Harris also vowed to lead the coalition government in a spirit of \"unity, collaboration and mutual respect\".\nHis Fine Gael party is in a coalition with Fianna F\u00e1il and the Green Party, but a general election is due by March 2025.\nMr Harris said he wanted the government to run for a full term, indicating he was not planning on going to the polls any sooner.\nHowever, as it is the third time the coalition government has changed its taoiseach in less than four years, opposition parties have called for an early election. \nMr Harris has represented the Wicklow constituency for more than two decades, but he was very young when he entered elected politics.\nD\u00e1il members laughed on Tuesday when the current Social Protection Minister Heather Humpreys recalled her first impression of him in the D\u00e1il back in 2011.\n\"I saw this young lad walking around the place and I said to myself: 'Ah, sure he must be on a school tour or on work experience'.\"\nBut Ms Humpreys said it was clear from his first day in the chamber that Mr Harris would \"go far\" and she added that it was her \"great honour\" to propose him as taoiseach.\nMembers of the Harris family, including his wife and two young children, were in the D\u00e1il to witness his election.\nDuring his first speech, he thanked his wife and promised his children that \"being your dad will remain my most important job\".\nHowever, Mr Harris and his government came in for a lot of criticism during Tuesday's vote.\nSinn F\u00e9in president and leader of the opposition Mary Lou McDonald repeated her call for a fresh election, claiming Mr Harris had \"failed\" his way to the top.\nIn the D\u00e1il, she accused the coalition government of playing \"pass the parcel with the keys to the taoiseach's office\" and clinging to power \"at all costs\".\nSpeaking later to BBC News NI, Ms McDonald said it was time for the people to have their say on who should lead the Republic of Ireland.\nT\u00e1naiste (Deputy PM) Miche\u00e1l Martin, leader of Fianna F\u00e1il, defended the record of the three-party coalition.\nHe said the government, which came to power in June 2020, had been formed \"in the middle of the greatest public health crisis in modern times\".\n\"We are three separate parties that seek to work together, respecting both our differences and an agreed approach to the most urgent issues facing our country,\" he said.\nGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan said he disagreed with calls for an early general election because there was work to be done.\nHowever, representatives of other opposition parties also said that a change of government was badly needed. \nLabour Party leader Ivana Bacik said of Mr Harris that \"his elevation today will not deliver the change that we need\".\nSocial Democrats leader Holly Cairns said Ireland was \"facing serious challenges as a country and in order to address them we need new ideas\".\nAont\u00fa leader Peadar T\u00f3ib\u00edn said the Irish people had been \"locked out of the decision-making process\", while People Before Profit's Richard Boyd Barrett accused Fine Gael of being afraid to face the electorate.\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak congratulated Mr Harris in a message on X,  formerly known as Twitter.\n\"As the closest of neighbours, I look forward to forging even stronger ties between our two countries so we can deliver for people across these isles,\" Mr Sunak wrote.\nKeir Starmer, leader of the opposition in the UK, said: \"On behalf of the UK Labour Party, I wish him well and look forward to working together as we seek to strengthen the ties of friendship between our two countries.\"\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said he looked forward to them working together \"as we further strengthen UK-Ireland cooperation\".\nMr Harris was born in 1986 and grew up in the coastal town of Greystones in County Wicklow.\nAt 37 he is a year younger than Mr Vardadkar was when he became taoiseach in 2017.\nHe is the eldest of three children, the son of a taxi dri",
    "Every now and then, the charts get overshadowed by the return of a true classic.\nForty years after it was released, Bonnie Tyler's Total Eclipse of the Heart has had an overnight revival.\nWhile millions of people in North America looked to the skies on Monday to witness a total solar eclipse, it seems Bonnie was providing the soundtrack.\nAs the moon covered the sun, there was a sudden spike in online searches and downloads of the 1983 power ballad.\nTurn around at any karaoke night and there'll usually be someone belting out a Bonnie Tyler hit.\nThe Welsh icon was born in a council house in Skewen, Neath Port Talbot, as Gaynor Hopkins.\nAfter being discovered singing in a club in Swansea at 17, she went on to sign with the same record label as Elvis Presley.\nThen Total Eclipse of the Heart came along in 1983 - and her career took off and she became an international success.\nShe went on to have a number of hits including Holding Out For A Hero in 1984, and even represented the UK at Eurovision in 2013.\nA total solar eclipse happens about every 18 months.\nIt's when the moon moves between the Earth and the sun, blocking the light of the sun as it passes, turning daylight into darkness.\nTotal eclipses are often seen in unpopulated or remote areas.\nBut on Monday, one passed over several big cities across Mexico, the US and Canada.\nStill touring at 72, Bonnie spoke last year about how she never gets tired of listening to the sound of her greatest hit.\n\"People often ask if I get fed up with singing Total Eclipse but of course I don't. I love it,\" she said.\nWhen it was first released in 1983, it spent two weeks at number one in the UK and four weeks at the top of the charts in the US, as well as reaching number one in several countries. \nIts music video has recently surpassed a billion hits on YouTube.\nThe song might sound like your typical '80s big hair power ballad, but its original story was a little darker.\nThe song was written and produced by Jim Steinman, who told Playbill in a 2002 interview that he wrote \u201cTotal Eclipse of the Heart\u201d as a vampire love story.\n\u201cIf anyone listens to the lyrics, they\u2019re really like vampire lines. It\u2019s all about the darkness, the power of darkness, and love\u2019s place in the dark,\u201d he said.",
    "A total solar eclipse was seen across North America on 8 April - from Mexico to the very eastern tip of Canada.\nThe astronomical phenomenon was less dramatic in the UK, but a partial eclipse was visible in some parts of the country.\nA solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, blocking some or all of the Sun's rays from reaching the Earth.\nThe phenomenon is a cosmic event, requiring the Sun, the Moon and the Earth to be in a precise alignment.\nWhen this happens, the Moon casts two types of shadows.\nA \"penumbra\" results in a partial solar eclipse, which covers only part of the Sun.\nThe more spectacular \"umbra\" creates a total solar eclipse, where the Sun's disc is entirely covered by the Moon, save for a delicate halo of scattered light coming from our star's outer atmosphere.\nA total solar eclipse occurs somewhere on Earth roughly every 18 months or so. \nThe next partial solar eclipse which will be visible from the UK is due to take place on 29 March 2025, when 30 to 40% of the Sun's rays are expected to be blocked. \nOn 12 August 2026, there will be a total eclipse which should be seen from the Arctic, eastern Greenland, Iceland and northern Spain, according to the US's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \nIn parts of the UK, 90% of the Sun will be obscured by the Moon during the event. \nThe next full solar eclipse in the UK isn't expected for another 66 years, on 23 September 2090, according to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich.\nThe UK's last total solar eclipse occurred in 1999. Thousands of people flocked to Cornwall, which was the only place in the UK to witness the event in its totality. \nThe US experienced a total solar eclipse in 2017. \nTens of millions of people across Mexico, the US and Canada gathered to view the total eclipse on Monday 8 April.\nIts shadow first touched the surface of the Earth in the Pacific Ocean before travelling across Mexico.\nThe eclipse brought darkness to large areas of Texas, including the cities of Austin and Dallas.\nThe path of totality included the east coast of the US. \nCanada was the last country to catch a glimpse before it crossed into the Atlantic Ocean out of view. \nThe Moon's full shadow ended its journey across the Earth in the Atlantic Ocean about 620 miles (1,000km) from Cornwall in south-west England.\nPeople in the western parts of the UK were hoping to catch a glimpse of a partial eclipse. \nHowever, cloud cover meant many were left disappointed. \nSome people in northern and western Scotland, where there were clearer skies, did manage to get a view of the Moon biting the edge of the Sun as it disappeared over the horizon. \nThe old advice of never looking directly at the Sun applies: you should not stare at an eclipse.\nExperts recommend using solar eclipse glasses, which have a special filter that blocks damaging UV rays. These glasses are different from sunglasses, as they block all light entirely except that coming from the Sun.\nIf you can't get glasses, try piercing a hole using a pin into one piece of paper. With your back to the Sun, hold that paper above your shoulder so the sun's rays can shine through that small little hole.\nAt the same time, hold up another piece of paper in front of you. \nIt will act like a screen, on to which the Sun's rays will be projected.",
    "Travel through Luton Airport now and passengers may spot the burned-out remnants of what used to be Terminal Car Park 2. The fire on 10 October grounded aircraft, disrupted the travel plans of thousands and trapped 1,300 vehicles inside. Six months on, as the demolition vehicles tear down the car park, the BBC asks what the impact of the fire was.\nAndrew Miller had only had his car for two weeks when he lost it to the fire last year.\nThe 58-year-old wheelchair user had undertaken considerable research in order to find a vehicle which \"was quite bespoke and precious to me and really was my independence\".\nAt the time of the fire he was in Ireland and when he got back he said he \"was really shocked\" at how little information or support there was.\n\"I can't easily jump on a bus or a train as an alternative and we were utterly dependent on the kindness of the Luton Airport chaplain to get us home in the first instance.\"\nOli Jaycock, the director of corporate affairs at Luton Airport, said the airport was \"sorry Mr Miller was disappointed with the support provided\". \n\"The airport chaplaincy team are an integral part of the airport response to major incidents and, in Mr Miller's case, this included making arrangements for alternative transport to his home.\"\nMr Miller was \"left in limbo\", unable to get a courtesy car because his needs \"were just so specific\".\nHe spent about a month off the road before getting a new vehicle, missing work meetings and a funeral, saying it \"really turned my life upside down\". \nHe was one of tens of thousands of people affected, whether directly by having their vehicle in the car park, or indirectly by having flights suspended.\nLast month a joint report by Bedfordshire's fire and police services said the blaze was \"accidental\", finding most probable cause of the fire was an electrical fault or a component failure in a moving diesel vehicle.\nThe car park itself was part of a multi-million pound modernisation programme, opening in 2019.\nIt was designed without sprinklers and at the time of the blaze Andy Hopkinson, the county's chief fire officer, said: \"We are already talking to the airport about ensuring that any future, and the existing, car parks have sprinklers fitted... sprinklers may have made a positive impact on this incident.\"\nMr Jaycock said that the fire service was consulted when plans were submitted in 2017 and that it \"made no recommendation as part of the building control consultation process\".\nHe added: \"The car park design fully met all fire and safety regulatory requirements.\"\nIt was not the first time there was a major fire in one of England's car parks.\nOn New Year's Eve in 2017 flames engulfed one near the Liverpool Echo Arena, destroying more than 1,000 vehicles as temperatures reached 1,000C (1,832F).\nPatrick Hayes, the technical director at The Institution of Structural Engineers, said following the fire Merseyside Fire Service recommended sprinklers in modern car parks.\nHe added that his institution had issued a number of reports on the risks modern cars possess, and recommended the \"fire resistance\" - the period a car park structure can remain stable in the event of a fire - be raised from 15 minutes to between 30 minutes to 120 minutes.\nMr Hayes said \"modern cars are heavier than some of the car parks have been designed for and also more flammable because they contain more plastic\", while there are different fire risks posed by electric vehicles.\nHe said: \"Originally the guidance around car park design... was based on the assumption that the fire wouldn't spread beyond one or two vehicles. \n\"What we see with modern vehicles, because they are larger so they get parked closer together and they're more flammable, is that the fire can spread towards several vehicles. So it's not as contained a fire.\"\nMr Hayes said for existing car park structures he \"would promote a risk assessment approach, so looking at the potential fire risk of cars in those car parks and adding sprinklers where required to reduce that risk down to an acceptable level or managing that risk in another way, be that monitoring or alarms or even where cars park\".\nFor Mr Miller, he said: \"The Luton car park was designed and built two years after the Liverpool fire and really, I would like to see MPs legislate to ensure multi-storey car parks are fitted with appropriate fire prevention measures and sprinklers systems. \n\"It's extraordinary to me that the car park builders and operators at Luton didn't adopt any learning from Liverpool or other car park fires. \n\"I think that has got to change to ensure no-one else has to go through this awful experience, because I think it's certainly clear that there will be another fire in a similar kind of structure, more people will be put through this misery and of course, the threat to life. \n\"We have to thank our lucky stars that in neither Luton or Liverpool there was any injury or death.\"\nA spokesperson from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communi",
    "Prof Peter Higgs was best known for that mysterious-sounding thing nicknamed the 'God particle' - or just simply, and probably better-put, the Higgs boson.\nHe came up with the revolutionary idea in the 1960s when he wanted to explain why the basic building blocks of the Universe - atoms - have mass. \nHis theory about what binds the Universe together, which other scientists also worked on at the same time, sparked a 50-year search for the Holy Grail of physics.\nThe particle was finally discovered in 2012 by scientists using the Large Hadron Collider at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (Cern) in Switzerland. It completed what is called the standard model of particle physics.\nA famously shy man, he told journalists: \"It's very nice to be right sometimes.\"\nHis work earned him the Nobel Prize for physics a year later. \nPeter Higgs was born in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1929. At school in Bristol he was a brilliant student who won prizes for his science work - though it was in chemistry, not physics.\nHe completed a PhD at King's College in London but was beaten to a job there by his friend. Instead he went to the University of Edinburgh where he continued to ask the question: why do some particles have mass?\nHis theory struggled to find a place in scientific journals - partly because few understood it - but it was finally published in 1964. \nDespite rumours about \"Eureka\" moments, he said his theory was formed over years.\nTwo other groups of scientists also published work at that time about the same idea.\nBut the particle became known as the Higgs boson - and for 50 years scientists looked for it using some of the most spectacular technology on Earth.\nProf Higgs retired from the University of Edinburgh in 2006, but he continued to watch developments at Cern in Geneva, where scientists were using the Large Hadron Collider to look for the Higgs boson.\nThe particle accelerator, built at a cost of $10bn (\u00a38bn), was the most powerful yet. It was considered the machine that could prove - or disprove - Prof Higgs's theory.\nThe boson had been nicknamed the 'God particle' by the media, after a book by Nobel laureate Leon Lederman. Scientists object to the term because they say religion has no role to play in evidence-based physics.\nIn 2012 physicists at Cern finally announced to great fanfare that they had discovered the Higgs boson. \nAn advance notice had been sent: \"Peter should come to the CERN seminar or he will regret it.\" He changed travel plans to visit Geneva for the stunning announcement.\n\"It's been a long wait but it might have been even longer, I might not have been still around,\" Prof Higgs said. \"At the beginning I had no idea whether a discovery would be made in my lifetime.\"\nA year later the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences tried to call him. It's become a trope that winners miss the crucial phone call telling them they have been awarded a Nobel Prize. But Prof Higgs did not even own a mobile phone. The announcement was made in his absence.\nA neighbour stopped him in the street to break the news that he had won - alongside Belgian physicist Francois Englert.\nHe was known first for the boson, but second for his shy and low-key personality - more interested in his work than fame.\nOxford emeritus professor Ken Peach talked about returning from a conference where scientists were referring constantly to Prof Higgs.\n\"I saw Peter in the coffee lounge and said 'Hey Peter! You're famous!'\" He responded with a diffident smile.\nAnd some friends feel Prof Higgs did not make the kind of impact that might be expected of a physicist of his ability.\n \"I wouldn't say he was shy,\" said Prof Michael Fisher, who died in 2021. \n\"I might say that he was a little too retiring perhaps for the good of his own career.\"\nInside the atom-smasher\nPallab Ghosh goes inside the largest particle accelerator in the world - which discovered the Higgs boson.\nAvailable now on BBC iPlayer",
    "The family of a woman thought to have been killed by her sex offender partner who was later found dead say they are angry he has \"evaded justice\".\nRichard Scatchard had been wanted after Kelly Faiers was found dead at his home in Minehead, Somerset, in October.\nThe next day he went missing and his remains were found about 10 miles (16km) away in a caravan on Thursday.\nAvon and Somerset Police has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).\nMs Faiers' daughters told the BBC they felt \"angry and let down\" that Scatchard, 70, was not properly questioned immediately after their mother's death on 15 October.\nThe police investigation was sparked when officers had gone back to speak to him about the death, and found he was missing.\nIn December, her family made a complaint to the police about their response to the death of Ms Faiers. This was referred to the IOPC in January.\nAvon and Somerset Police then voluntarily referred itself to the IOPC on 4 January, due to officers' contacts with Scatchard at the scene of Ms Faiers' death, shortly before he disappeared.\nIt has now referred itself to the IOPC for a second time in a mandatory referral.\nA spokesperson for the force said: \"This is because we spoke with the 70-year-old at the scene of Kelly's death, shortly before he disappeared, before carrying out subsequent enquiries to find him.\"\nJazz, Ms Faiers' youngest daughter, said she believed Scatchard's death could have been prevented if police had \"followed protocols at the start\".\nA  post-mortem examination of Scatchard's body proved inconclusive in determining the cause of his death, though police say it was \"apparent Scatchard died some time ago\".\n\"I'm glad he can't harm anyone else, but it doesn't bring us any form of closure or justice,\" Jazz Faiers added.\n\"There should have been a court case. The whole thing wasn't fair on us and his past victims. \n\"He shouldn't have been allowed to die.\"\nDuring the search for Scatchard, police said he was a risk to the public, specifically those he formed relationships with.\nThe force said he was a regular user of dating apps and had previously been convicted of sexual offences in which he administered drugs to his victims to enable his crimes.\nScatchard's remains were found in an empty caravan, that he did not own, less than 10 miles away from the hotel in Minehead where he was last officially spotted on CCTV in October.\nKelly Faiers' eldest daughter, Tania Jackson, said she believed failing to check the caravan site had been an oversight by the police.\n\"It's quite unbelievable that he was that close, especially considering there was more than one sighting of him on the Dunster coastal path. \n\"Why were they not checked? They were empty. He liked caravanning. It seems the obvious place,\" Ms Jackson added.\nIn response, Avon and Somerset Police said they carried out \"more than 300 actions\" that included making CCTV inquiries, deploying specialist search teams across West Somerset, carrying out financial checks and issuing public appeals for information.\nA spokesperson said: \"We believed he [Scatchard] may have had information that could have assisted our inquiries into the death of Kelly Faiers and had not given up hope that remained a possibility, until his body was discovered last week.\n\"We provided Kelly's family with updates last week about a body being found at the earliest opportunity. Our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.\n\"At an early stage, our Professional Standards Department was made aware of Kelly's death in Minehead last October, and our initial response to it,\" the force added.\nMs Jackson said police also failed to convey accurate information to the family when Scatchard's body was discovered.\nShe claims they were initially told his remains were found in woodlands, only to discover the truth upon receiving calls from journalists, after police released a public statement.\nMs Jackson said their priority now as a family was to \"take the focus off him\". \n\"To stop seeing his face everywhere, and try to remind people that yes he's dead, but we haven't had closure and mum was still taken,\" she added.\n\"She's the focus of this, not him. She's the reason that we're all here.\"\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and, X. Send your story ideas to us on email or via WhatsApp on 0800 313 4630.",
    "The EU's Fundamental Rights Agency, FRA, says racist policing is widely under-reported in the European Union. \nIn a new report, the Vienna-based agency said most EU countries had \"no official data sources on racist incidents and discrimination involving the police\".\nIt said just a few countries recorded incidents of police racism separately.\nOf these, only Germany, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands publish the data.\nThe report builds on previous research by FRA showing that the police most often stop young men, ethnic minorities, Muslims or people who do not identify as heterosexual. \n\"The number of officially recorded incidents of police racism is very low,\" the report said. \"This makes it impossible to assess prevalence of the issue.\"\nIn 2020, it said, the Czech Republic recorded one investigation of the security forces for hate crimes or crimes with an extremist background.\nIn 2020 and 2021, Denmark recorded 12 incidents and Greece recorded 25 incidents.\nThe report said the low number of recorded cases did not mean that \"racist policing doesn't exist\" and pointed to evidence from surveys, media reports and civil society organisations.\nFRA said that in recent years in the EU, several people with minority ethnic backgrounds had been shot dead \"following interactions with the police\".\nIt referred to a series of violent incidents in Greece, involving police officers and Roma boys and men, which caused a public outcry.\nIn one case in 2022, the report said, Greek police fatally shot a 16-year-old Roma boy during a chase in which he reportedly failed to pay a petrol bill of \u20ac20. \nIn Portugal, it said seven police officers were to go on trial, charged with beating migrants from Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan.\n\"Racism in policing has far-reaching effects, fuelling social exclusion and undermining trust in police forces,\" FRA said.\nThe agency called on EU countries to do more to systematically report and record racist incidents by the police. It said all EU countries should strengthen national laws against \"racial and ethnic discrimination and racism\".\nThe report also noted that that while most European countries have police watchdogs, many are not independent. \nIt called on countries to increase diversity in police forces.\nIn 2022, FRA conducted a survey among people of African descent in 13 EU countries about being stopped by the police.\nIt found that the highest number of people of African descent stopped were in Austria, followed by Germany and Ireland. \nIt said more men reported being stopped than women.

    "US President Joe Biden has said he believes that Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is making a \"mistake\" in his handling of Gaza.\n\"I think what he's doing is a mistake. I don't agree with his approach,\" he said in an interview.\nHe said Gaza should have \"total access to all food and medicine\" for the next six to eight weeks.\nLast week he warned ongoing US support for the war depended on Israel allowing in more food and medicine.\nIsrael has denied impeding the entry of aid or its distribution inside Gaza, and has accused UN agencies on the ground of failing to get the aid that is allowed in to the people who need it.\nWeeks of talks have failed to produce a ceasefire agreement but international pressure is growing. \nThe hour-long interview was recorded last Wednesday - days after Israeli military strikes killed seven aid workers with World Central Kitchen - and it aired on Tuesday night on US Spanish-language network Univision.\nMr Biden said it was \"outrageous\" how the aid organisation's vehicles had been \"hit by drones and taken out on a highway\". \nThe Israel Defense Forces have since said \"grave mistakes\" led to the fatal targeting of the workers. An inquiry led to two senior officers being dismissed.\nIn the interview Mr Biden said: \"What I'm calling for is for the Israelis to just call for a ceasefire, allow for the next six, eight weeks, total access to all food and medicine going into the country.\" \nThe president has previously said Hamas must agree to a pause and release remaining hostages. \nIsrael said recently that it would open a crossing to northern Gaza and a deep water port, to allow more aid to flow into the area. It has not yet detailed when or how these routes will operate.\nMr Biden is facing domestic pressure over Israel. Over the past weeks he has sharpened his rhetoric, including towards Mr Netanyahu, over the conduct of the war which has now lasted six months.\nMeanwhile, military supplies including bombs, missiles and ammunition have continued to flow from the US to Israel uninterrupted.\nHamas-led gunmen attacked southern Israeli border communities on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostage. \nIsrael says that of 130 hostages still in Gaza, at least 34 are dead. \nMore than 33,000 Gazans, the majority of them civilians, have been killed during Israel's offensive in Gaza since the October attack, the Hamas-run health ministry says.

    "TikTok is to take on social media rival, Instagram, by launching a photo-sharing app.\nThe company said it was working on a \"dedicated space\" for images and text. \nSome users have received notifications saying their photo posts will be shared to a new \"TikTok Notes\" app unless they opt out.\nIt is the latest example of social media firms imitating each others' products - including Instagram launching Reels, a TikTok-like video tool, in 2020.\n\u201cThe copycat phenomenon runs rampant across social media platforms\", Mike Proulx, a research director at analysis firm Forrester, told the BBC.\nWhen done well copycat features \"pay off\", he added, giving the example of when Instagram copied Snapchat with its \"Stories\" feature.\nHowever, he pointed out a similar move by Twitter ended in failure, so there was no guarantee of success.\nInstagram's focus on making Reels more central to app has previously frustrated some users.\nKim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner were among those who shared a petition calling out changes to the platform that seemed to promote Reels over other features of the app in 2022.\nInstagram U-turned on the changes after the backlash.\nTikTok says it has not finalised the design of the Notes app, nor has it confirmed a release date.\nBut notifications received by some users suggest the app will let users upload or share photo posts - which are currently a feature of the TikTok app and let people post a series of images with sounds and filters.\nScreenshots of the notification showed a toggle on the notifications allowing TikTok users to opt out of having their photo posts shared to the app.\nSocial media consultant Matt Navarra said a text or photo app might be a space where the majority of TikTok users who \u201clurk\u201d, rather than post, would engage more.\nBut he said he did not think another photo-sharing app was something social media users were \u201cdesperate\u201d for.\n\u201cWe have plenty of them, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s that demand out there necessarily,\u201d he said.\nIt comes at a difficult time for the company, with the US passing legislation that could see TikTok banned unless its Chinese owner sells it within six months of passing its law.\n\"Launching Notes as a separate app would be a departure in strategy for TikTok, which has previously incorporated new features directly into the core app, but it makes sense given the current regulatory and consumer scrutiny,\" said Jasmine Enberg, principal social media analyst at Insider Intelligence.\n\"There are few places left where it doesn\u2019t have a stronghold, and photo-sharing is one,\" she added.\nMike Proulx suggested the best way forward for TikTok might be to copy what Meta did with its Twitter rival, Threads, where it leaned heavily on the existing Instagram user base.\n\"But like Threads, the key will be creating a compelling enough experience to get them to stick around TikTok Notes beyond the initial curiosity factor,\" he added.\n\u201cWhen social media features all start to become ubiquitous, what differentiates one social media platform from another narrows. It comes down to community, user experience, and, yes, algorithms.\u201d",

    "A formal move to dissolve the funeral firm at the centre of a police inquiry could not proceed in court. \nHull Combined Court heard the process, known as a winding-up petition which was started by Hull City Council, had stalled because the council could not reach those running Legacy Independent Funeral Directors.\nThe company is claimed to owe the authority \u00a340,938.08.\nThe case has been adjourned for a later date, which is yet to be fixed.\nTwo people are on bail after Humberside Police began investigating Legacy on 6 March following a \"concern for the storage and management processes relating to care of the deceased\" at its site on Hessle Road.\nDuring the court hearing, solicitor advocate Paul Thompson, representing Hull City Council, said the winding-up petition could \"not be served\" under the insolvency rules because the council could not reach either the director or employee of the company.\n\"In essence there's no one from the company managing the business affairs on that basis to serve a winding-up petition,\" he said.\nHe said Legacy was \"subject to intense media scrutiny following the recovery of 35 bodies from its Hessle Road premises\".\nHull City Council previously said the company had \"significant\" unpaid debt totalling \u00a351,508.46 for \"unpaid fees and charges, including cremation fees\".\nFollowing a County Court Judgement last year, arrangements were made for the firm to repay the outstanding debt with the most recent payment made on 29 February - about a week before police started its investigation. \nIn total, Legacy, which was established in 2010, allegedly racked up nearly \u00a355,000 in debt, of which \u00a32,000 is said to be owed to East Riding of Yorkshire Council for unpaid burial fees, the BBC understands.\nIt is unclear how long the debt has been accumulating but both authorities have said they were trying to recover the remaining debts.\nOn a number of occasions between 4 January 2022 and 12 March 2024, Legacy was also given formal notices that it would be struck off from the register and would no longer legally exist, according to Companies House records.\nBut on four occasions Legacy was given a reprieve to have the \"compulsory strike-off action\" discontinued and a fifth warning was \"temporarily suspended\" on 19 March because the registrar received an \"objection\".\nFew details about the police investigation have been revealed but 35 bodies and a quantity of ashes were removed from those premises and taken to another mortuary. Their families have been contacted, Humberside Police had said.\nOn Thursday, police said it was not possible to identify any of the cremated ashes because \"the DNA will have been broken down and degraded\" due to the high temperature during the cremation process.\nA 46-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman were arrested on suspicion of prevention of a lawful and decent burial, fraud by false representation and fraud by abuse of position. They have since been released on bail while police inquiries continue.\nHumberside Police said its dedicated helpline numbers remained open.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

    "Every now and then, the charts get overshadowed by the return of a true classic.\nForty years after it was released, Bonnie Tyler's Total Eclipse of the Heart has had an overnight revival.\nWhile millions of people in North America looked to the skies on Monday to witness a total solar eclipse, it seems Bonnie was providing the soundtrack.\nAs the moon covered the sun, there was a sudden spike in online searches and downloads of the 1983 power ballad.\nTurn around at any karaoke night and there'll usually be someone belting out a Bonnie Tyler hit.\nThe Welsh icon was born in a council house in Skewen, Neath Port Talbot, as Gaynor Hopkins.\nAfter being discovered singing in a club in Swansea at 17, she went on to sign with the same record label as Elvis Presley.\nThen Total Eclipse of the Heart came along in 1983 - and her career took off and she became an international success.\nShe went on to have a number of hits including Holding Out For A Hero in 1984, and even represented the UK at Eurovision in 2013.\nA total solar eclipse happens about every 18 months.\nIt's when the moon moves between the Earth and the sun, blocking the light of the sun as it passes, turning daylight into darkness.\nTotal eclipses are often seen in unpopulated or remote areas.\nBut on Monday, one passed over several big cities across Mexico, the US and Canada.\nStill touring at 72, Bonnie spoke last year about how she never gets tired of listening to the sound of her greatest hit.\n\"People often ask if I get fed up with singing Total Eclipse but of course I don't. I love it,\" she said.\nWhen it was first released in 1983, it spent two weeks at number one in the UK and four weeks at the top of the charts in the US, as well as reaching number one in several countries. \nIts music video has recently surpassed a billion hits on YouTube.\nThe song might sound like your typical '80s big hair power ballad, but its original story was a little darker.\nThe song was written and produced by Jim Steinman, who told Playbill in a 2002 interview that he wrote \u201cTotal Eclipse of the Heart\u201d as a vampire love story.\n\u201cIf anyone listens to the lyrics, they\u2019re really like vampire lines. It\u2019s all about the darkness, the power of darkness, and love\u2019s place in the dark,\u201d he said.",
    "One of the doctors at the centre of an inquest into the death of a baby boy who was in a breech position said he has \"regrets\" over the incident.\nDr Rohit Sharma delivered Troy Brady at Craigavon Hospital in August 2016.\nTroy was born in a \"state of collapse\" and died in the neonatal unit six days later.\nDr Sharma told an inquest he now regretted not \"double-checking\" the parents understood the risks of the delivery options.\nJane and John Brady told the inquest during their evidence that the first doctor they saw, Dr Lynsey Hinds, who was the doctor in admissions, failed to warn them of the risks of having a vaginal delivery with their baby in a breech position, which means the baby is lying bottom or feet first.\nThe couple said they would have chosen a Caesarean if they had had all the information.\nA pathologist told the court Troy, who was born at 33 weeks, was otherwise a normally developed baby with no evidence of abnormalities. \nTroy suffered a severe amount of brain damage due to a lack of blood and oxygen supply. \nHe had to be resuscitated after birth, which took about 17 minutes, and was then taken to the intensive care unit, the court heard.\nTroy was on life support for six days before he died.\nGiving evidence earlier in the inquest, his parents disputed the accounts from some of the medical professionals involved.\nMrs Brady told the court she was not warned of the potentially serious consequences of a vaginal breech delivery: \"If the vaginal birth risks had been discussed, I wouldn't be sitting here fighting for justice for my son.\" \n\"I only cared about the safety of my baby, I said I didn't mind going through surgery.\"\nDr Hinds, who gave evidence on Tuesday, said: \"I discussed the two options of vaginal or C-section.\"\nShe added the conversation with the couple was \"lengthy\" and they were \"made aware of the potentially serious consequences\" of a vaginal birth.\nJohn Brady told the court on Monday he had asked Dr Hinds about the risk of head injury with a vaginal delivery of a baby in the breech position.\nHe said Dr Hinds told them \"no, the baby should come out easily\" because Troy would be small at 33 weeks.\nDr Hinds told the court: \"I cannot recall him mentioning head injury.\n\"I believe they had a massive amount of information to take in that day. I believe they were in shock with their baby coming early.\n\"I don't accept their recollection.\"\nDr Hinds told the inquest she remembered the couple \"had no firm views either way\" on the delivery choice and the couple agreed to \"go for the vaginal\". \n\"Cases like Mrs Brady's don't leave you,\" she said.\n\"I recall it like it was yesterday.\"\nDr Sharma, who delivered baby Troy. also gave evidence and told the inquest he accepted the birth was high risk due to the prematurity of the birth and the breech position.\nDr Sharma said a vaginal delivery and a C-section delivery were \"offered\" to the couple and he was not alerted to any difficulties in the counselling around delivery options. \n\"I had no doubt in Dr Hinds experience and skills,\" he said.\nHowever, Dr Sharma said: \"I should have discussed this with the couple. I should have double-checked\".\nIt was also put to Dr Sharma that experts for the coroner agreed \"that with a C-section, baby Troy would have survived.\"\nDr Sharma was also asked about his choice to have Mrs Brady deliver in what the inquest called the all-fours position.\nThis instruction caused some \"surprise\" in the midwives present, and Dr Sharma agreed they were not comfortable with that delivery position.\nDr Sharma said he was experienced with the mode of delivery, having performed it at least 12 times at other hospitals. However, he acknowledged that for staff at Craigavon Area Hospital it was a new practice.\nHe said he knew it was the best way, but added: \"I should have taken staff in to account.\" \nWhen asked had he ever performed the specified delivery method in a pre-term pregnancy before, Dr Sharma replied: \"Probably not.\"\nA solicitor asked Dr Sharma if that choice of delivery could have caused a delay during the delivery, Dr Sharma said \"no\".\nDr Sharma said he was \"really sorry about what happened on the day\".\nThe inquest continues.

    "Teaching assistants who claim they face being assaulted \"most days\" while working with special educational needs children (SEND) have gone on strike.\nStaff from St Anne's School and Sixth Form College in Hessle said a new pay system did not cover their extra duties.\nEast Riding of Yorkshire Council (ERYC) said the new terms were voted on by union members and accepted. \nIn response to assaults on workers, ERYC said all staff were \"trained and heavily supported\".\nThe school is described by the council as providing education for pupils with \"severe and complex learning difficulties\".\nThe National Education Union (NEU) said the previous pay structure, before 1 April,  helped retain SEND staff and covered extra work and risks not faced by staff in mainstream settings.\nNaomi Garmston, who works at the Boothferry Road site, said staff needed \"a lot of knowledge to deal with the behaviours and the care plans\".\nShe said the worst incident she had experienced was a child biting her which left severe bruising on her face.\n\"The child was in crisis and bit me. It's just the nature of our job but that's the type of assault you don't expect to happen at work and get paid pennies for. \n\"I personally feel more sorry for the child but when I come home and my partner says it's terrible, you do think is the job worth it?\n\"You don't expect to go home with bruises and marks on your face, it's not right.\"\nERYC said talks about strike action at the school had taken place over a number of weeks.\n\"The new terms were voted on by the trade union members and accepted, and these came into force on 1 April,\" it added.\nThe NEU said it could escalate the strike action if further talks with the school and the local authority were not successful.\nKirsty, who is a teaching assistant at the school, said: \"We do medical, physio, occupational therapy.

    "Newcastle United's proposal to sell next season's shirts exclusively through JD Sports is \"unlawful\", rival firm Sports Direct has claimed.\nSports Direct, run by former Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, is seeking an injunction from the Competition Appeal Tribunal to stop the deal.\nCompany lawyers said preventing the \"home of football supplies\" selling cheaper shirts would harm fans.\nNewcastle United said there was \"no evidence\" competition would be damaged.\nAt the tribunal in London, Sports Direct's barrister Tony Singla KC said football was \"essential\" to the firm, which was the \"largest sports retailer in the UK\" with 488 stores.\nHe said Sports Direct had sold \"all of the top league replica kits including Newcastle for decades\".\nBut the company has been told that next season it will not be able to sell any Newcastle United replica kits, Mr Singla said, which was an \"abuse\", \"anti-competitive\" and \"unlawful\" without an \"objective justification\".\nHe said Newcastle United said they wanted to bring the sales in-house but, accepting it needed a wider distribution, had also agreed an exclusivity deal with JD Sports.\nMr Singla said the reason Sports Direct was being cut out was because of the firm's \"discounting practices\" which sees it selling shirts at cheaper prices than others.\nHe said the proposed deal would harm consumers and \"distort\" the market because the \"retailer that offered the lowest prices\" would be excluded.\nMr Singla said Sports Direct would suffer from a loss of \"substantial\" sales, footfall and reputation.\nHe said if Newcastle fans were unable to buy their kits at Sports Direct then they wouldn't buy other goods there either and \"may never come back\", with people \"losing faith in the credibility\" of the store.\nThomas de la Mare KC, representing Newcastle United, said Sports Direct had not produced a \"scintilla of evidence\" to show the deal would harm competition and there was \"simply no evidence\" to substantiate the claim.\nHe said what was proposed was a \"tripartite\" arrangement between the club, manufacturer Adidas and retailer JD Sports, the likes of which had \"been in the market for up to 10 years without attracting attention\".\nHe said clubs of comparable size, such as Celtic, or \"one-city\" teams including Leicester City and Leeds United, and even the Welsh and Scottish FAs had agreed exclusivity deals with JD Sports which the \"gorilla in the marketplace\", Sports Direct, had not objected to.\nMr de la Mare said the only club Sports Direct had taken legal action against was Newcastle United, which Mr Ashley sold for \u00a3305m ($386m)  to the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund in 2021 after 14 turbulent years at the Magpies' helm.\nHe also questioned the reputational loss Sports Direct would suffer among Newcastle fans by not having the new kits, as the relationship was already \"toxic\" following Mr Ashley's ownership.\nMr de la Mare said the \"unpopularity\" of Mr Ashley and Sports Direct had previously led to fan boycotts of the shop and the club itself, and it was \"bold\" for the retailer to claim it would suffer reputational problems because of the kit deal.\nHe also said the club relied on revenue from merchandise sales and a reduction in that could impact on the players they sign, where they finish in the league, qualification for competitions and resulting broadcasting rights.\nMr de la Mare also said Sports Direct had itself signed such \"cosy\" exclusivity deals with manufacturer Castore to sell Rangers and Newcastle kits.\nThat deal meant only Sports Direct could sell the teams' kits in the first month of launch which Mr de la Mare said was a \"critical period\" for selling new shirts.\nHe also said Sports Direct did not sell the full Newcastle kit, claiming the firm had not ordered any socks and wanted only one pair of shorts for every 22 shirts.\nThe tribunal heard Sports Direct currently pays Adidas \u00a316.55 per shirt for other Premier League clubs supplied by the German manufacturer, and wants to buy 51,000 - or about 14% - of the Newcastle United kits produced.\nNewcastle's kit is currently made by Castore, but the club has agreed a \"multi-year partnership\" with Adidas starting in the 2024-25 season.\nThe new home strip is due to be launched on 7 June, with the away kit coming out in July and a third outfit in August, the tribunal heard.\nSports Direct is also seeking damages and costs from Newcastle United.\nTribunal chairman Sir Marcus Smith said he and his two fellow panellists would make a decision on the injunction application \"as soon as possible\", hopefully by Friday.\nFollow BBC Newcastle on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

    "Anglian Water has recorded the biggest increase in raw sewage discharges of all of England's water companies, according to figures from the Environment Agency.\nData showed pumps across Norfolk ran for a total of 4,300 hours - or 179 days - from 40 outfalls in 2023.\nCouncils in Norfolk where pumping stations are located have called on the company to end the practice.\nAnglian Water said figures increased because the company now monitored 100% of discharges, and 2023 saw many incidences of heavy rain overwhelm sewers.\nRegan Harris, from Anglian Water, said: \"There's a couple of reasons why we've seen such an increase in storm spills data for the last year.\n\"The first thing is this last 12 months have been exceptionally wet so our storm overflow system is doing what it's supposed to do and protecting homes from flooding during that extreme rainfall.\n\"But secondary and equally as important is the fact that we've got a third more monitors now than we had this time last year, so we we were always expecting to have higher figures; more amounts of data than we had last year.\"\nThe company said its figures looked worse than other sewage treatment firms because it had installed monitors at all its sites before other firms did.\nKevin Wood, chairman of Caister Parish Council, said not enough was being done to tackle the problem.\nThe village has a large sewage treatment works serving Great Yarmouth and the villages in the north of the parish, where there are thousands of holiday chalets and caravans.\nThe local outfall, a pipe that discharges over a mile out to sea, was used 106 times in 2023, for more than 560 hours, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nMr Wood said: \"The number of new builds across the northern parishes has not helped.\n\"With the potential of a further 4,000 houses to be built in the northern parishes, that's going to increase the situation even further.\n\"Our belief as a parish [council] is not enough is being done to alleviate this problem.\"\nSewage spills can be contaminated by human waste, wet wipes and sanitary products, which can pose a serious risk to wildlife, swimmers and others who use UK waterways.\nIn a statement, the Environment Agency said: \"Storm overflow spills are measured by event duration monitors and 100% of storm overflows across the water network are now fitted with these, meeting the target set by the government to do so by the end of 2023.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "One person has been taken to hospital after flooding at a holiday park caused by gale-force winds combining with rain and high tides.\nA total of 180 people had to be evacuated overnight from the Medmerry Holiday Park, between Bracklesham and Selsey in West Sussex, and fire chiefs urged anyone in the area to get to high ground if they were able to leave their homes.\nFirefighters were also tackling flooding in Littlehampton, near Ferry Road and Rope Walk, after the River Arun burst its banks.\nSouth East Coast Ambulance said several people from the holiday camp were checked over, with one person who was showing signs of hypothermia being taken to hospital.\nAnyone needing life-saving help should call 999, West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said.\nThe Environment Agency has issued flood warnings for parts of the West Sussex coast following a high tide.\nIt said gale force 8 winds in the wake of Storm Kathleen and high waves had increased the height of the tide - which had been expected to be seven metres (22.9ft) - by 76cm (29.9in).\nFor all the latest news on the flooding across England go to our live page here.\nThe Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for England's southern coast, including Southampton and Brighton.\nForecasters have said winds were expected to reach 45-55mph (72-88.5km/h), peaking at 65mph (104.6km/h) in some areas before easing off from 09:00.\nIn Alverstoke, near Gosport, Hampshire, firefighters had to help residents from about 50 flooded homes to safety.

    "A terminally ill man from Ripon has completed a 286-mile walk in his garden to raise funds to help other patients.\nAnthony Henson walked the distance of the Pennine Way after treatment for incurable pancreatic and liver cancer meant he could not do it for real.\u00a0\nThe 53-year-old was supported by Active Against Cancer, which helps patients achieve and maintain fitness levels.\n\"Without them I would not have been able to deal with the treatments I have received,\" said Mr Henson.\u00a0\nArchitect Mr Henson was diagnosed after suddenly collapsing shortly after completing the Yorkshire Three Peaks challenge in April 2022.\u00a0\nHe was told he had 30 tumours on his liver with two being the size of a grapefruit.

It's all about the people who run Active Against Cancer and help us all. \n\"I'm very happy that I've done it.

    "When Evan John Griffiths came across an article about a solar eclipse happening on his birthday in a town with his name, he thought this was a once in a lifetime opportunity. \nThe teenager and his family flew 3,967 miles (6,384.37 km) from Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire to Evansville, Indiana in the United States for his 17th birthday.\nHe was interviewed by US reporters and said he had become a bit of \"a local celebrity.\"\nEvan said the experience had been \"extraordinary\".\nA solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the Earth and the sun, blocking some or all of the sun's rays from reaching the Earth.\nIt is a cosmic event, requiring the sun, the moon and the Earth to be in just the right alignment for the moon to cast a shadow on our planet.\nTens of millions of people watched the phenomenon sweep across North America on Monday.\nEvan said: \"One year ago I found on the internet there was a solar eclipse on my birthday in the town that bears my name, Evansville, in America, and I thought that was such a coincidence that it could not possibly happen to anybody.\n\"So I forgot about it for a year ironically and then in January I suddenly woke up in the middle of the night and I thought 'God I have got to write this down' and so I have been pestering [mum] for the last couple of weeks.\n\"I was amazed to see we have actually come,\" he said. \nHis mum, Cathrin Edwards, said: \"After quite a difficult time over the last year we thought it would be a major adventure to come somewhere like Evansville on this day.\"\nThe family also made the news in Indiana with 14 News running a story on their experience. \nEvan said they were contacted after going to collect their glasses for watching the eclipse. \n\"I've been recognised many times now, I am a local celebrity,\" he said. \"It's probably the most interesting thing that's happened to me.\"\nMs Evans said: \"To hear the reporters try to say Welsh words was quite fun to see them try. \n\"I think they reverted to either not saying Welsh place names or not saying Welsh names that were quite difficult.\"\nAdditional reporting by Iolo Cheung.

    "Dozens of suspects believed to be responsible for extreme harm to females in London have been arrested in a new data-led scheme, the Metropolitan Police says.\nThe V100 initiative, used in counter-terrorism operations, had arrested 60 suspects since August, the force said.\nCdr Ben Russell said the scheme used data analytics which then enabled the force to prioritise interventions.\n\"Results show our approach is working,\" he said.\nThe scheme was announced last January amid plans to reform the Met Police following several damning reviews.\nCdr Russell said the Met was determined to \"stop predators\" and bring them justice.\n\"We're using data to identify the most predatory offenders in London who pose the greatest threat to women and girls where evidence shows a disproportionate amount of crime is committed by a comparatively small number of people in society,\" he said.\nHe said the Met Police was working with other forces to share its findings of the new data-led initiative.\nThe Met said the V100 used data analytics to identify and target the top men and women who posed the most risk.\nThe force said the scheme used existing police data from victim reports of crime alongside the Cambridge Crime Harm Index - a tool which helps police measure the seriousness of harm to victims.\nProf Lawrence Sherman, the Met's chief scientific officer, said the \"highly precise approach\" worked by taking the names of suspects provided by victims and witnesses.\nThe names are then put through the Cambridge Crime Harm Index and are ranked in order - to give priority to those causing the greatest harm to women and girls.\nIn one case, the Met said Marcelino Goncalves, from Acton, was arrested and convicted after being highlighted as a high-harm offender and prolific abuser. \nThe force said the 56-year-old was convicted in March for rape, assault by beating, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, stalking and controlling coercive behaviour.\n\"Goncalves came to police attention when a member of public saw him assault a woman known to him,\" the Met said.\n\"The victim then disclosed her long history of abuse she faced - threatening her at her home, burning her with a cigarette because she did not want to have sex with him and punching her in the face.\n\"Goncalves even continued to target her while on remand, making 15 calls from prison, but with enhanced management within the prison system, they were able to put a stop to the harassment when it was reported.\"\nThe Met said Goncalves was one of 24 suspects out of the 60 arrested to be convicted so far through the V100 scheme.\nHe is due to be sentenced on 7 June at Isleworth Crown Court.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "An athletics club has formed a charity to take over the management of its track and save it from closure.\nRunners from St Albans Athletic Club in Hertfordshire were concerned for the future of Abbey View Athletics Track after the council closed the nearby pavilion, which had been open since 1971.\nThe charity, Abbey View Community Athletics Track, has agreed a deal with owners St Albans City and District Council to operate the track and raise funds for future improvements.\nThe council's strategic director for community and place delivery, Chris Traill, said the deal would \"ensure a bright future for this fabulous facility\".\nShe added: \u201cIt means the day-to-day management of the track is now in the hands of local people who have used the track for many years and love the sport of athletics.\"\nAbbey View Community Athletics Track said it would fundraise to build a new pavilion.\nThe previous building was closed after it was decided the building posed a safety risk as the roof was made from reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete panels. It will be demolished later.\nMs Traill said: \u201cThe enforced closure of the pavilion, combined with the difficult financial climate we are faced with as a council, resulted in some anxiety about what would happen to the track in the long-term.\"\nThe council is providing temporary toilets, and changing rooms are available at nearby Westminster Lodge Leisure Centre, which is run by Everyone Active.\nPeter Poulain, the chair of both Abbey View Community Athletics Track and St Albans Athletic Club, thanked Everyone Active and the council officers for their support.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t what we had expected, but we are excited at the prospect of managing the track as a group of volunteers,\" he said.\n\u201cReplacing a 330sq m pavilion building is no small task, so if you feel you can offer help with the design and build of a new pavilion, do contact us.\u201d\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Travel through Luton Airport now and passengers may spot the burned-out remnants of what used to be Terminal Car Park 2. The fire on 10 October grounded aircraft, disrupted the travel plans of thousands and trapped 1,300 vehicles inside. Six months on, as the demolition vehicles tear down the car park, the BBC asks what the impact of the fire was.\nAndrew Miller had only had his car for two weeks when he lost it to the fire last year.\nThe 58-year-old wheelchair user had undertaken considerable research in order to find a vehicle which \"was quite bespoke and precious to me and really was my independence\".\nAt the time of the fire he was in Ireland and when he got back he said he \"was really shocked\" at how little information or support there was.\n\"I can't easily jump on a bus or a train as an alternative and we were utterly dependent on the kindness of the Luton Airport chaplain to get us home in the first instance.\"\nOli Jaycock, the director of corporate affairs at Luton Airport, said the airport was \"sorry Mr Miller was disappointed with the support provided\". \n\"The airport chaplaincy team are an integral part of the airport response to major incidents and, in Mr Miller's case, this included making arrangements for alternative transport to his home.\"\nMr Miller was \"left in limbo\", unable to get a courtesy car because his needs \"were just so specific\".\nHe spent about a month off the road before getting a new vehicle, missing work meetings and a funeral, saying it \"really turned my life upside down\". \nHe was one of tens of thousands of people affected, whether directly by having their vehicle in the car park, or indirectly by having flights suspended.\nLast month a joint report by Bedfordshire's fire and police services said the blaze was \"accidental\", finding most probable cause of the fire was an electrical fault or a component failure in a moving diesel vehicle.\nThe car park itself was part of a multi-million pound modernisation programme, opening in 2019.\nIt was designed without sprinklers and at the time of the blaze Andy Hopkinson, the county's chief fire officer, said: \"We are already talking to the airport about ensuring that any future, and the existing, car parks have sprinklers fitted... sprinklers may have made a positive impact on this incident.\"\nMr Jaycock said that the fire service was consulted when plans were submitted in 2017 and that it \"made no recommendation as part of the building control consultation process\".\nHe added: \"The car park design fully met all fire and safety regulatory requirements.\"\nIt was not the first time there was a major fire in one of England's car parks.\nOn New Year's Eve in 2017 flames engulfed one near the Liverpool Echo Arena, destroying more than 1,000 vehicles as temperatures reached 1,000C (1,832F).\nPatrick Hayes, the technical director at The Institution of Structural Engineers, said following the fire Merseyside Fire Service recommended sprinklers in modern car parks.\nHe added that his institution had issued a number of reports on the risks modern cars possess, and recommended the \"fire resistance\" - the period a car park structure can remain stable in the event of a fire - be raised from 15 minutes to between 30 minutes to 120 minutes.\nMr Hayes said \"modern cars are heavier than some of the car parks have been designed for and also more flammable because they contain more plastic\", while there are different fire risks posed by electric vehicles.\nHe said: \"Originally the guidance around car park design... was based on the assumption that the fire wouldn't spread beyond one or two vehicles. \n\"What we see with modern vehicles, because they are larger so they get parked closer together and they're more flammable, is that the fire can spread towards several vehicles. So it's not as contained a fire.\"\nMr Hayes said for existing car park structures he \"would promote a risk assessment approach, so looking at the potential fire risk of cars in those car parks and adding sprinklers where required to reduce that risk down to an acceptable level or managing that risk in another way, be that monitoring or alarms or even where cars park\".\nFor Mr Miller, he said: \"The Luton car park was designed and built two years after the Liverpool fire and really, I would like to see MPs legislate to ensure multi-storey car parks are fitted with appropriate fire prevention measures and sprinklers systems. \n\"It's extraordinary to me that the car park builders and operators at Luton didn't adopt any learning from Liverpool or other car park fires. \n\"I think that has got to change to ensure no-one else has to go through this awful experience, because I think it's certainly clear that there will be another fire in a similar kind of structure, more people will be put through this misery and of course, the threat to life. \n\"We have to thank our lucky stars that in neither Luton or Liverpool there was any injury or death.\"\nA spokesperson from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communi",
    "One of the doctors at the centre of an inquest into the death of a baby boy who was in a breech position said he has \"regrets\" over the incident.\nDr Rohit Sharma delivered Troy Brady at Craigavon Hospital in August 2016.\nTroy was born in a \"state of collapse\" and died in the neonatal unit six days later.\nDr Sharma told an inquest he now regretted not \"double-checking\" the parents understood the risks of the delivery options.\nJane and John Brady told the inquest during their evidence that the first doctor they saw, Dr Lynsey Hinds, who was the doctor in admissions, failed to warn them of the risks of having a vaginal delivery with their baby in a breech position, which means the baby is lying bottom or feet first.\nThe couple said they would have chosen a Caesarean if they had had all the information.\nA pathologist told the court Troy, who was born at 33 weeks, was otherwise a normally developed baby with no evidence of abnormalities. \nTroy suffered a severe amount of brain damage due to a lack of blood and oxygen supply. \nHe had to be resuscitated after birth, which took about 17 minutes, and was then taken to the intensive care unit, the court heard.\nTroy was on life support for six days before he died.\nGiving evidence earlier in the inquest, his parents disputed the accounts from some of the medical professionals involved.\nMrs Brady told the court she was not warned of the potentially serious consequences of a vaginal breech delivery: \"If the vaginal birth risks had been discussed, I wouldn't be sitting here fighting for justice for my son.\" \n\"I only cared about the safety of my baby, I said I didn't mind going through surgery.\"\nDr Hinds, who gave evidence on Tuesday, said: \"I discussed the two options of vaginal or C-section.\"\nShe added the conversation with the couple was \"lengthy\" and they were \"made aware of the potentially serious consequences\" of a vaginal birth.\nJohn Brady told the court on Monday he had asked Dr Hinds about the risk of head injury with a vaginal delivery of a baby in the breech position.\nHe said Dr Hinds told them \"no, the baby should come out easily\" because Troy would be small at 33 weeks.\nDr Hinds told the court: \"I cannot recall him mentioning head injury.\n\"I believe they had a massive amount of information to take in that day. I believe they were in shock with their baby coming early.\n\"I don't accept their recollection.\"\nDr Hinds told the inquest she remembered the couple \"had no firm views either way\" on the delivery choice and the couple agreed to \"go for the vaginal\". \n\"Cases like Mrs Brady's don't leave you,\" she said.\n\"I recall it like it was yesterday.\"\nDr Sharma, who delivered baby Troy. also gave evidence and told the inquest he accepted the birth was high risk due to the prematurity of the birth and the breech position.\nDr Sharma said a vaginal delivery and a C-section delivery were \"offered\" to the couple and he was not alerted to any difficulties in the counselling around delivery options. \n\"I had no doubt in Dr Hinds experience and skills,\" he said.\nHowever, Dr Sharma said: \"I should have discussed this with the couple. I should have double-checked\".\nIt was also put to Dr Sharma that experts for the coroner agreed \"that with a C-section, baby Troy would have survived.\"\nDr Sharma was also asked about his choice to have Mrs Brady deliver in what the inquest called the all-fours position.\nThis instruction caused some \"surprise\" in the midwives present, and Dr Sharma agreed they were not comfortable with that delivery position.\nDr Sharma said he was experienced with the mode of delivery, having performed it at least 12 times at other hospitals. However, he acknowledged that for staff at Craigavon Area Hospital it was a new practice.\nHe said he knew it was the best way, but added: \"I should have taken staff in to account.\" \nWhen asked had he ever performed the specified delivery method in a pre-term pregnancy before, Dr Sharma replied: \"Probably not.\"\nA solicitor asked Dr Sharma if that choice of delivery could have caused a delay during the delivery, Dr Sharma said \"no\".\nDr Sharma said he was \"really sorry about what happened on the day\".\nThe inquest continues.

    "A formal move to dissolve the funeral firm at the centre of a police inquiry could not proceed in court. \nHull Combined Court heard the process, known as a winding-up petition which was started by Hull City Council, had stalled because the council could not reach those running Legacy Independent Funeral Directors.\nThe company is claimed to owe the authority \u00a340,938.08.\nThe case has been adjourned for a later date, which is yet to be fixed.\nTwo people are on bail after Humberside Police began investigating Legacy on 6 March following a \"concern for the storage and management processes relating to care of the deceased\" at its site on Hessle Road.\nDuring the court hearing, solicitor advocate Paul Thompson, representing Hull City Council, said the winding-up petition could \"not be served\" under the insolvency rules because the council could not reach either the director or employee of the company.\n\"In essence there's no one from the company managing the business affairs on that basis to serve a winding-up petition,\" he said.\nHe said Legacy was \"subject to intense media scrutiny following the recovery of 35 bodies from its Hessle Road premises\".\nHull City Council previously said the company had \"significant\" unpaid debt totalling \u00a351,508.46 for \"unpaid fees and charges, including cremation fees\".\nFollowing a County Court Judgement last year, arrangements were made for the firm to repay the outstanding debt with the most recent payment made on 29 February - about a week before police started its investigation. \nIn total, Legacy, which was established in 2010, allegedly racked up nearly \u00a355,000 in debt, of which \u00a32,000 is said to be owed to East Riding of Yorkshire Council for unpaid burial fees, the BBC understands.\nIt is unclear how long the debt has been accumulating but both authorities have said they were trying to recover the remaining debts.\nOn a number of occasions between 4 January 2022 and 12 March 2024, Legacy was also given formal notices that it would be struck off from the register and would no longer legally exist, according to Companies House records.\nBut on four occasions Legacy was given a reprieve to have the \"compulsory strike-off action\" discontinued and a fifth warning was \"temporarily suspended\" on 19 March because the registrar received an \"objection\".\nFew details about the police investigation have been revealed but 35 bodies and a quantity of ashes were removed from those premises and taken to another mortuary. Their families have been contacted, Humberside Police had said.\nOn Thursday, police said it was not possible to identify any of the cremated ashes because \"the DNA will have been broken down and degraded\" due to the high temperature during the cremation process.\nA 46-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman were arrested on suspicion of prevention of a lawful and decent burial, fraud by false representation and fraud by abuse of position. They have since been released on bail while police inquiries continue.\nHumberside Police said its dedicated helpline numbers remained open.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

    "A gay RAF officer who has experienced suicidal thoughts in the past says \"life is worth living\" as she prepares to run the London Marathon.\nSqn Ldr Tamsin Wakeham, who is based at RAF High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, will take on the endurance challenge to raise money for Samaritans.\nThe annual 26.2 mile (42km) event takes place on 20 April.\nMs Wakeham said: \"I'm in a good place physically and mentally so it seems a good time to give back.\"\nShe first joined the military in 1989 when there was a ban on lesbian, gay and bisexual people serving in the armed forces. The ban was not repealed until 12 January 2000.\nAlthough she was unsure about her sexuality when she signed up, Ms Wakeham later started a relationship with a woman which she was forced to keep secret to avoid losing her job.\n\"That has an effect that you can't trust any friends,\" she said.\n\"Then the rumour mill starts. I remember walking into the mess and the place would go quiet. I'm 19 at the time. If I sat at a table, people would get up.\"\nShe was banned from seeing her girlfriend and her mental health deteriorated.\n\"I was being told all gays are weird,\" she said. \"I'm being told it's wrong and I nearly lost my job. I just kept saying, 'No, I'm not'.\n\"I didn't want to talk to people.

    "A family say their child, who they believe has autism, has been \"massively\" let down after he was unable to attend school for months at a time because of a lack of suitable support.\nTheo Skelton, from Cumbria, is nearly six, but his parents say he cannot read or write, despite expressing a desire to learn.\nHis parents noticed he was displaying behaviour consistent with autism and sought a referral for assessment in January 2021, but more than three years later, they are still waiting for an appointment.\nCumberland Council emphasised its support for the family, while North Cumbria's NHS trust said it was \"very sorry\" for the time it was taking for Theo to get an assessment.\nTheo's parents Mark Skelton and Natalie Davison, who live in Allonby, near Maryport, believe their son may have autism, ADHD and Pica, an eating disorder where a person compulsively eats non-food items.\nWhile they wait for assessment, they have struggled to keep Theo in school since he started in September 2022, due to extreme delays in arranging the right support.\nThey are concerned he is missing out on his education, as well as on the opportunity to socialise with his peers.\nMr Skelton said he felt the family had banged on every door for help.\n\"He's got us and that's it,\" he said. \"We're not professionals. \n\"It's worrying when we're asking for help and we're just getting fobbed off.\n\"We're banging our heads on walls, it's all we're doing. The system as it is, is not fit for purpose. \n\"Theo has been massively let down, there is no doubt about that.\"\nHis mum added: \"It's like they're waiting for something bad to happen.\"\nMr Skelton said his son asked to learn to read and write and the parents were doing everything they could to help him, but it was also the interaction with other children that he needed.\n\"He keeps asking to go to Asda,\" he said, \"because he made a friend at the checkout the other day and now he wants to go back.\n\"He's craving that interaction.\"\nShortly after joining Allonby Primary School in 2022, it became apparent that Theo had additional needs.\nThe parents were told the school could not cope with his behaviour, which included being disruptive, destructive and aggressive.\nIn February 2023, he stopped attending school while assessments were carried out and appropriate support put in place, but it was not until the following September that Theo could return to school with a one-to-one teacher.\nAnd a month later, when the teacher left, alternative provision could not be arranged.\nIt means Theo has not attended school since October and the family are still waiting to hear how he may access education.\nThey are hoping he may now qualify for home-schooling support, but they do not know when this might be arranged.\nCumberland Council and Allonby Primary School responded jointly to the concerns raised by Theo's family, but said they could not comment on specifics related to the situation.\nThey said they had worked with partners to ensure all options were being considered and a further meeting was planned to discuss further options.\nA spokesman said: \"Education is vital for all children and young people\u2019s development and well-being, and we appreciate the distress and upset families often experience if their child/young person cannot access this. \n\"It is always the intention of the council to ensure all children and young people are accessing a full and well-rounded education wherever possible, and we are very sorry the family feel let down in this circumstance.\"\nThe council added it was working to make education more inclusive and recently funding was allocated for a school for children who struggle in mainstream education.\nTheo's parents are also unable to access any formal support while they wait for an assessment and diagnosis.\nA spokesman for North Cumbria Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust blamed unexpected delays, as as well as a significant rise in referrals.\nThey accepted waiting times for autism assessments for families were too long and were \"deeply concerned\" by this.\nThey said autism assessment could be extremely complex, especially for younger children.\n\"These assessments can take more than a year to complete. We must make sure our autism assessment is thorough, as this diagnosis stays with the child for life.\"\nFollow BBC Cumbria on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt has urged Justice Secretary Alex Chalk not to release a murderer who was given a whole-life prison term.\nVictor Farrant was told he would never be freed after killing his ex-girlfriend Glenda Hoskins, 43, in Portsmouth, in 1996.\nMrs Hoskins' children were told he may be released on compassionate grounds.\nProbation and prison staff and police will meet today to discuss the level of risk he poses.\nFarrant murdered Mrs Hoskins, an accountant, by holding her under water in her bath.\nMrs Hoskins' body was found by her then 15-year-old daughter Katie at their home on the quayside in Portsmouth in February 1996.\nThe judge at Winchester Crown Court told Farrant: \"This murder was so terrible, and you are so dangerous, that in your case the sentence of life should mean just that.\"\nFarrant raped a woman and seriously assaulted another before killing Mrs Hoskins.\nIn February this year, Mrs Hoskins' family was contacted by probation officials, who said Farrant was being considered for release - which can be ordered by Mr Chalk as Justice Secretary - on health grounds.\nThey were asked if they wanted an exclusion zone and an order not to contact the Hoskins family to be added to the terms of Farrant's licence.\nMs Mordaunt, the MP for Portsmouth North, is supporting Mrs Hoskins' children's campaign for Farrant to stay behind bars.\nShe said in a letter to Mr Chalk: \"Mr Farrant should never be released.

    "A nursing home has been placed into special measures after inspectors were called in to investigate claims residents' safety, care and dignity were being compromised.\nThe Care Quality Commission (CQC) took action following a visit to Summerfield House Nursing Home in Halifax.\nIt said staff had used room numbers rather than names to refer to residents and ignored calls for help.\nSummerfield House said it had plans in place for \"widespread improvements\".\nCQC inspectors visited the home, which provides nursing and personal care for up to 107 people, some of whom are living with dementia, in January and February.\nThe regulator said it had been prompted by \"concerns received about the management of the home, people's care and treatment, and how their privacy and dignity was maintained\".\nIt said it had also been notified of \"incidents where people's safety, health and wellbeing had been put at risk\", but that these allegations were being investigated separately.\nFollowing the visit Sheila Grant, CQC deputy director of operations in the north said, the inspection team found \"widespread and significant shortfalls in the management and oversight of the service\" as well as \"several areas of concern where people's safety, care and dignity was being compromised due to standards that had been allowed to slip\".\n\"During the inspection we saw people showing signs of distress and calling out for support from staff, but they were often ignored which is totally unacceptable,\" said Ms Grant.\n\"We also saw staff referring to people by their room numbers instead of their names, which is degrading and disrespectful.\"\nThe CQC said managers at the home had taken action during and after the inspection in response to the concerns raised and an action plan had been put in place.\nMs Grant said she expected to see the necessary improvements being made \"as quickly as possible\", adding that the CQC would \"continue to monitor the home closely to keep people safe\".\nIn response to the report, a spokesman for Summerfield House said their \"primary concern is the wellbeing of our residents\".\n\"Our new care manager, who has a track record of service turnaround, knows what is required and together with her dedicated team at Summerfield House expects to see widespread improvements in the coming weeks,\" he said.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "An employment tribunal has ruled a council acted unlawfully when it sent an email to staff about a long-running pay dispute.\nMembers of the GMB union said they felt an email sent by Wiltshire Council in November 2022, on the eve of a strike ballot, was threatening in its tone. \nOne person said as a result they \u201cfelt like we had a target on our backs\u201d.\nThe council and the union have been in a dispute over out-of-hours pay for civil enforcement officers - or traffic wardens.\nThe council said the purpose of the email was not to intimidate, rather to \"set the record straight\". \nIt said it was now seeking legal advice about potentially appealing against the tribunal's decision.\nThe tribunal was told the email was sent the day before GMB members were due to be balloted for strike action and one section of it appeared to suggest a pay offer could be taken off the table.\n\"Should we be unable to reach agreement, we will need to review whether this offer remains on the table,\" it stated.\nTwo other unions - UNISON and Unite the Union - which represented some of the traffic wardens, had already come to an agreement over out-of-hours pay.\nThe email, sent by the council's chief executive Terence Herbert, stated the council wished to resolve the issue and uncertainty for staff, and asked people to \"please consider carefully whether further strike action will support this approach\".\nIt was the first time Mr Herbert - who is moving to another council in the summer - had sent an email directly to the team itself, the tribunal was told.\nHe told the tribunal he had intended to \"set the record straight\" but denied it was a \u201cbully-boy ploy to intimidate staff from voting yes to industrial action\u201d, as GMB branch secretary Andy Newman said, following the ruling.\nGMB said the situation had brought Wiltshire Council into disrepute.\nIn response to a request by the LDRS,\u00a0Mr Herbert said the council was disappointed by the ruling as it believed it had a strong position.\nHe said his intention was to correct inaccurate information and the council's priority was to resolve the pay issue as \"quickly and fairly\" as possible.",
    "Amid ever increasing demand for electricity, artificial intelligence (AI) is now being used to help prevent power cuts.\n\"I woke up in the middle of the night very, very cold,\" remembers Aseef Raihan. \"I pulled out my military sleeping bag, and slept in that overnight for warmth.\n\"In the morning I figured out that the power was definitely not on.\"\nMr Raihan is describing the scene back in February 2021 when he was stationed in San Antonio, Texas, while serving in the US Air Force.\nThat month the state was blasted by winter storm Uri. As temperatures plummeted to -19C, Texans sought to keep warm, sending the demand for electricity sky high.\nAt the same time, Texas' electricity grid started to unravel. Wind turbines froze over, snow covered solar panels, and a nuclear reactor had to be taken offline as a precaution.\nWith not enough electricity to go around, the power went off for more than 4.5 million homes and businesses, first for hours, and then for days on end.\n\"Without power, the heating wasn't working at all. And you couldn't use the electric stove or microwave for food,\" recalls Mr Raihan.\nIn the end it took more than two weeks for the Texan power grid to return to normal.\nThe storm revealed the fragility of the systems we take for granted to deliver us electricity around the clock.\nAnd while not all countries have winters as severe as they can be in North America, demand for electricity is ever increasing around the world. From charging electric cars, to more homes getting air conditioning installed, we are using more and more power in our daily lives. \nThis comes at the same time as countries are increasingly moving towards renewable sources of energy, which are more variable in the amount of energy they generate. If the wind doesn't blow, and the sun doesn't shine, then electricity production drops.\nAll this led to UK Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho warning last month that the country could face blackouts in the future without new gas powered power stations as \"back up\".\nAnother way to make energy systems more resilient is by adding huge batteries to the grid. \nThe thinking goes that when there is electricity going spare, batteries can charge up, and then release electricity later when there is more demand for power. \nThis is an approach that has been taken in Texas. \n\"Since the storm we built over five gigawatts of battery storage capacity in Texas in three years, which is really an incredible pace,\" says Dr Michael Webber, professor of energy resources at the University of Texas at Austin. That much energy, he says, is about \"four large nuclear power plants\".\nHowever, for such batteries to be really useful, they need to know the best time to charge, and the best time to discharge. That means making complex predictions about how much electricity is going to be needed in the future.\n\"The main thing that makes the biggest difference is weather and electricity demand,\" says Gavin McCormick, founder of the tech start-up WattTime. \nHis Oakland, California-based company makes AI software that predicts electricity supply and demand in a given area or region. This information can then tell batteries when to charge and discharge. \nThe same information can also be used in homes to help people use mains electricity more cheaply.\n\"So if you had an electric vehicle that you need to be ready in eight hours, but it only takes two or three hours to charge, what it can do is it can find the five minute periods all night where there's surplus energy, or maybe there's clean energy,\" Mr McCormick says.\n\"It will charge in little spurts at all the best times and still be ready by morning.\"\nThe AI can make these predictions by analysing weather patterns, holiday dates, work schedules, and even when the football is on. \"Everybody gets up and makes a cup of tea at halftime,\" Mr McCormick says.\nAnother company using AI to predict electricity demand is Danish firm Electricity Maps. It focuses its AI on forecasting weather patterns like cloud cover, wind strength, temperature and rainfall.\nThis information is used to better understand how much electricity will be generated from wind turbines or solar panels. \n\"If you can predict quite accurately in advance how much wind you're going to have in the system, you can plan ahead.\" says Olivier Corradi, the company's founder. \n\"One example is Google, where we're providing them forecasts of how clean the grid is going to be in the next couple of hours. They can use that in their data centres to change the time at which they're consuming electricity \"\nRead more stories on artificial intelligence\nAI is also now being used to protect the physical infrastructure that carries electricity to our homes. \nOne company, Buzz Solutions, uses AI to scan through imagery of electricity cables, pylons and substations, identifying signs of damage such as broken parts or rust. \nThe system also identifies when trees and other greenery are growing too close to power lines. \nNot only can this prevent p",
    "A woman has told how the kindness of strangers saved her having to move house after a giant sinkhole opened up in her garden.\nDorothy Rigby, 83, said she has been banished from much of her garden due to the crater which appeared in August. \nShe said she did not know what to do after both her home insurer and the council told her they could not help.\nBut local firms then stepped in and helped restore her beloved garden in Walton-le-Dale, near Preston.\nSince its sudden appearance in August, Ms Rigby said the sinkhole continued to grow and left her worrying she could go the same way as many of her plants - which simply vanished into the void.\nSouth Ribble Borough Council's environmental health team did an inspection of her drains but the authority said it was ultimately unable to help because the sinkhole had sprung up on private land.\nMs Rigby said she was particularly disappointed that an engineer's report prepared by her home insurer was not shared with her, leaving her in the dark about the cause of the hole - and unsure how to tackle it once she was advised it was her responsibility to have it put right.\n\"They wouldn't tell me anything. So I just hope it doesn't happen again because we never found out what caused it in the first place,\" she said.\nVanessa Banks, of the British Geological Survey, said the \"weight of limited evidence\" from local data points to one particular option, which is likely to have been exacerbated by recent wet weather conditions.\nMs Rigby said the crater led her to consider leaving her home of almost 25 years \"because I just felt so helpless\".\u00a0\n\"My garden is my life and I'd really given up on it,\" she added.\nNick Whittle, 33, from Chorley-based NFW Landscapes and Paving removed all traces of the unwanted crater which had terrorised Ms Rigby for months with materials supplied by C&W Berry Builders' Merchants in Leyland and plants from Bannister Hall Nurseries in Higher Walton.\nMr Whittle explained the reason he and his 19-year-old colleague Rob Smith carried out the work.\n\"If it were my nan, I'd want someone to help. I just felt sorry for her. You could tell how much it meant to her,\" he said.\nMs Rigby said she now cannot wait to get cracking on tending to her garden again, adding: \"I just can't thank everybody enough.

    "Stunning artworks have been uncovered in a new excavation at Pompeii, the ancient Roman city buried in an eruption from Mount Vesuvius in AD79.\nArchaeologists say the frescos are among the finest to be found in the ruins of the ancient site.\nMythical Greek figures such as Helen of Troy are depicted on the high black walls of a large banqueting hall.\nThe room's near-complete mosaic floor incorporates more than a million individual white tiles.\nA third of the lost city has still to be cleared of volcanic debris. The current dig, the biggest in a generation, is underlining Pompeii's position as the world's premier window on the people and culture of the Roman empire.\nPark director Dr Gabriel Zuchtriegel presented the \"black room\" exclusively to the BBC on Thursday.\nIt was likely the walls' stark colour was chosen to hide the smoke deposits from lamps used during entertaining after sunset. \n\"In the shimmering light, the paintings would have almost come to life,\" he said.\nTwo set-piece frescos dominate. \nIn one, the god Apollo is seen trying to seduce the priestess Cassandra. Her rejection of him, according to legend, resulted in her prophecies being ignored. \nThe tragic consequence is told in the second painting, in which Prince Paris meets the beautiful Helen - a union Cassandra knows will doom them all in the resulting Trojan War.\nThe black room is the latest treasure to emerge from the excavation, which started 12 months ago - an investigation that will feature in a documentary series from the BBC and Lion TV to be broadcast later in April.\nA wide residential and commercial block, known as \"Region 9\", is being cleared of several metres of overlying pumice and ash thrown out by Vesuvius almost 2,000 years ago.\nStaff are having to move quickly to protect new finds, removing what they can to a storeroom. \nFor the frescos that must stay in position, a plaster glue is injected to their rear to prevent them coming away from the walls. Masonry is being shored up with scaffolding and temporary roofing is going over the top.\nChief restorer Dr Roberta Prisco spent Tuesday this week trying to stop an arch from collapsing. \n\"The responsibility is enormous; look at me,\" she said, as if to suggest the stress was taking a visible toll on her. \n\"We have a passion and a deep love for what we're doing, because what we're uncovering and protecting is for the joy also of the generations that come after us.\"\nRegion 9 has thrown up a detective story for archaeologists.\nExcavations in the late 19th Century uncovered a laundry in one corner. The latest work has now revealed a wholesale bakery next door, as well as the grand residence with its black room.\nThe team is confident the three areas can be connected, physically via the plumbing and by particular passageways, but also in terms of their ownership.\nThe identity of this individual is hinted at in numerous inscriptions with the initials \"ARV\". The letters appear on walls and even on the bakery's millstones.\n\"We know who ARV is: he's Aulus Rustius Verus,\" explained park archaeologist Dr Sophie Hay. \"We know him from other political propaganda in Pompeii. He's a politician. He's super-rich. We think he may be the one who owns the posh house behind the bakery and the laundry.\"\nWhat's clear, however, is that all the properties were undergoing renovation at the time of the eruption.\nEscaping workers left roof tiles neatly stacked; their pots of lime mortar are still filled, waiting to be used; their trowels and pickaxes remain, although the wooden handles have long since rotted away. \nDr Lia Trapani catalogues everything from the dig. She reaches for one of the thousand or more boxes of artefacts in her storeroom and pulls out a squat, turquoise cone. \"It's the lead weight from a plumb line.\" Just like today's builders, the Roman workers would have used it to align vertical surfaces. \nShe holds the cone between her fingers: \"If you look closely you can see a little piece of Roman string is still attached.\"\nDr Alessandro Russo has been the other co-lead archaeologist on the dig. He wants to show us a ceiling fresco recovered from one room. Smashed during the eruption, its recovered pieces have been laid out, jigsaw-style, on a large table.\nHe's sprayed the chunks of plaster with a mist of water, which makes the detail and vivid colours jump out.\nYou can see landscapes with Egyptian characters; foods and flowers; and some imposing theatrical masks.\n\"This is my favourite discovery in this excavation because it is complex and rare. It is high-quality for a high-status individual,\" he explained.\nBut if the grand property's ceiling fresco can be described as exquisite, some of what's being learned about the bakery speaks to an altogether more brutal aspect of Roman life - slavery.\nIt's obvious the people who worked in the business were kept locked away in appalling conditions, living side by side with the donkeys that turned the millstones. It seems there was one window and it had iron ba",

    "President Biden's pressure on Israel after last week's deadly attack on aid workers did not go far enough and will fail to stem the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, according to current and former US officials who have spoken to the BBC.\nThey said internal dissent in government was growing and called for tougher action on arms transfers.\nIsrael said it would open new aid routes after President Biden threatened to reassess policy following Israeli strikes that killed seven workers from food charity World Central Kitchen (WCK), including a US citizen.\nBut the tougher line was \"too little, too late\", said Annelle Sheline, an official working in human rights who quit the state department in protest a fortnight ago.   \nShe said the White House \"could have done this months ago and prevented famine in northern Gaza\".\nThe US-Israel relationship is currently experiencing its most serious strain in decades, after President Biden's phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week that amounted to a defining moment in the six-month conflict.\nWithin hours of Mr Biden's call, Israel said it would open the Erez crossing in northern Gaza and the port of Ashdod in southern Israel to aid, and pledged to drastically improve security co-ordination with groups delivering assistance to Palestinians. \nIn a newly-aired interview, Mr Biden said he believed the Israeli prime minister was making \"a mistake\" in his handling of Gaza. \nThe US president spoke to Univision two days after the Israeli strike on WCK workers - and before Israel announced the opening of the Erez crossing - though the footage was only aired on Tuesday,\nIn the interview, Mr Biden said the US ally should \"just call for a ceasefire\" with Hamas, and allow \"total access to all food and medicine\" for Gaza.\nDespite the steps taken by Mr Netanyahu last week, the views of seven current and former US government officials reflect the way internal objections to policy continue to mount. They said many government workers were voicing their frustrations in unofficial forums that include at least a dozen groups on messaging apps, which the officials said counted hundreds of administration staff as members. \nA spokesperson for the US state department said it encouraged different views on policy and staff could make them known through \"appropriate channels\". The US had \"been clear at the highest levels publicly and privately with Israel that it must abide by international humanitarian law\", the spokesperson said.\nFour current officials at varying levels of seniority in different government departments spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity. Two have roles in areas with direct links to foreign policy, including on Israel and Gaza. \nOne who has 25 years of national security experience said internal opposition had become \"deeper, wider and more despairing\" than at any previous point in the war. While the increase in pressure from President Biden last week was welcome, it did not go far enough to reflect the \"moral urgency\" to act, they said.\n\"I read it as Israel doing the bare minimum to get through the day and avoid arms transfers being halted,\" the official added.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday more than 400 trucks had been cleared to go into Gaza the previous day, describing \"important commitments\" made by Israel. However, UN officials told the BBC the figure was in fact 223, less than half the daily number it says is required as a minimum to stem the crisis.\nSome of the officials who spoke to the BBC said they wanted the Biden administration to explicitly condition arms supplies to Israel in order to avoid a full-scale humanitarian collapse. \nThe administration has been under increasing pressure to say whether it is conducting a full review by the state department's Office of the Legal Advisor into whether Israeli actions in Gaza have breached international law, which could lead to a bar on US weapons shipments. \nJosh Paul, a former senior official who resigned last year in protest, said the state department had not asked the office to make an assessment because \"it does not want the answer it will get\". The state department declined to confirm whether it had referred any cases to the office.\nThe officials' concerns echoed those of dozens of Democrats in Congress, including Biden ally and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - who signed a letter on Friday urging the US to pause weapons' transfers to Israel in the wake of the 1 April strikes on the WCK aid convoy, which sparked international outrage. The Israeli military called the attack a \"grave accident\".\nIsrael has consistently denied violating international law in Gaza, blaming thousands of civilian deaths from its offensive on Hamas for operating from civilian areas. It says it has fought a threat to Israel's existence after the attacks by Hamas on 7 October, in which some 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 were taken hostage back to Gaza.\nThe three former officials the BBC s",
    "Under clear blue skies, extra French police have been making a show of force around Paris today, on foot patrol at railway stations and near stadiums, seeking to reassure the public amid new warnings that the Islamic State group might be planning to attack European football events.\nThe heightened security in the French capital marks a moment of growing concern across Europe, as governments seek to assess, and react to, threats made on a pro-IS media channel.\nIt also comes at a complicated moment for France itself, as it prepares to host the Olympic Games in July following growing concerns that the Kremlin is deliberately trying to spread doubts and fears about the French government's ability to keep its citizens safe.\nInterior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin said he had \"considerably strengthened security\" around Wednesday night's Champions League quarter-final match at the Parc des Princes in southwest Paris. \nThe move follows an online threat to European sporting events that Mr Darmanin said had been \"publicly expressed\" by IS. The pro-IS media channel had reached out to supporters in France and elsewhere, who may feel emboldened after seeing the recent IS-claimed attack on a concert hall in Moscow.\nBut Mr Darmanin was keen to put the threat, and a raised national threat level, in context, stressing that the risk of an IS attack was \"not new\" and that \"I don't have - and I say this quite frankly - any specific information. We don't know which location might be particularly affected, nor under what conditions\".\nHe also pointed out that his forces, with long experience of tackling Islamist extremism, had foiled two attacks since the start of the year and arrested five individuals in three different cases in the past fortnight. \nTwo fans who had come from Toulouse ahead of the PSG-Barcelona match, were quick to brush aside the risks.\n\"We live constantly under the threat of terrorists and attacks so we have not stopped ourselves from living and coming to a superb match even after these threats,\" said Julien, 21.\n\"We must not be afraid,\" declared Alexandre. who's 27. \"If they are doing this communication campaign, it is above all to scare us and terrorise us, so that the French no longer go out. So we must continue to live, and show them we are stronger than that.\"\nBut across Europe, with a long summer of sporting and cultural events ahead, governments are expressing growing concern about IS-K, as the jihadist group's Afghanistan-based wing is known. \nGermany now calls it the country's biggest internal threat and is increasing security ahead of this summer's European Football Championship, including the rare step of introducing land border checks. \nIn recent months there have been police raids targeting IS-K supporters in Germany, Belgium and Austria and reports by police of foiled plots, for example against Cologne Cathedral on New Year's Eve.\nBut finding the right balance between security preparations and public reassurance is never easy, and France faces some particularly tricky challenges with the Olympic Games due to begin with an unprecedented opening ceremony along the river Seine in the heart of Paris in little more than 100 days.\nThe right-leaning French newspaper, Le Figaro, has already warned that too much attention is being given to IS threats, claiming that \"the propagandists of the Islamic State have already achieved part of their objective\". \nFrench security expert Guillaume Farde argued that it was important for a democracy like France to be seen not to be cowed, otherwise \"we are playing the game of terrorist organisations who want to establish a climate of terror, a climate of distrust\".\nFrance has experienced many devastating Islamist incidents in recent years, from the Charlie Hebdo killings of 2015, the Bataclan attack of the same year, the Bastille Day murders in Nice in 2016, and a series of brutal murders of teachers.\nThe authorities have responded with Operation Sentinelle, a military force focused on protecting people from terrorist threats. Twenty thousand soldiers will be involved in securing the Olympic Games in Paris, alongside some 40,000 police and gendarmes. \nArmy training was in full force ahead of the Olympics at Gap in south-eastern France on Wednesday, simulating a knife attack and a hostage situation.\nThe lieutenant-colonel supervising France's 4th regiment de chasseurs had a message of reassurance for visitors to Paris: \"At my level, I just can say that we are well prepared for this mission and my battalion is ready to protect the population during the Olympic Games.\"\nBut the war in Ukraine has added a new dimension, with President Emmanuel Macron warning that Russia now presents \"a risk\" to the Olympics. \nPresident Macron has taken an increasingly tough line with the Kremlin, which appears to have responded with an aggressive cyber-campaign designed to discredit France at every opportunity.\n\"I'm not going to link Russia with jihadist terrorist organisations.

The Democratic Party will lead the way in solving the livelihood crisis,\" he told reporters.\nToday's result could embolden Mr Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 presidential election to Mr Yoon, to make another presidential run.\nMr Yoon is under pressure to address a number of issues including rising food prices, a rapidly aging population and an ongoing doctor's strike.\nIn recent weeks, he has been criticised for appearing to be out of touch with the impact of inflation on voters. \nJust last month, he was criticised for commenting during a visit to a Seoul supermarket that a bundle of green onions priced at 875 won (\u00a30.51; $0.65) was \"reasonable\".\nThe item had been priced at discount because of subsidies and would normally have cost between 3,000 and 4,000 won.\nThe comment sparked a backlash, with bundles of green onions later being used as props at farmers' protests and DPK election rallies.\nMr Yoon's wife, Kim Keon Hee, has also been embroiled in a controversy for allegedly accepting a luxury bag as a gift, while separate corruption and abuse of power allegations have been levelled at senior members of his party.\nThe DPK has also been beleaguered by its own political controversies and internal struggles, and has faced corruption allegations.",
    "Three people have died and four are missing following an explosion at a hydroelectric power plant in northern Italy.\nThe blast occurred underwater at the plant on Lake Suviana, 70km (43 miles) from the city of Bologna on Tuesday.\nRescuers have said they were unlikely to find any survivors as the area of the explosion is located 30m (100ft) below the surface of the lake and is now entirely flooded.\nFive people were seriously injured.\nThey are known to have suffered severe burns following the explosion and were flown to nearby hospitals by helicopter. \nTwo men have been taken to an intensive care unit, according to Italian media.\nThe three victims of the disaster - all contractors - were aged between 36 and 73. Unconfirmed reports say two were from the south of Italy, while one was Romanian. \nIt is thought that a fire broke out when a turbine exploded on the eighth floor below the surface, causing the floor below to become flooded.\nOne of the divers involved in the search and rescue operation told Italian newspaper La Repubblica he had managed to reach the seventh floor below the surface but could not reach the three people trapped further down.\nBologna Mayor Matteo Lepore, who visited the scene on Tuesday evening, said conditions for the search teams dozens of metres underground were \"really complicated\". He said it was one of the worst work tragedies in Italy's recent history.\nThe mayor of the nearby town of Camugnano, Marco Masinara, said: \"Everyone around here cares about the plant which has never been a source of danger but one of employment.\"\nHe said that the man who was most seriously injured was a young man from the area who was in the process of starting a family.\nThe city's chief prosecutor, Giuseppe Amato, told Italian media an investigation would be launched once the plant was safe and the missing people were found.\nRegional fire chief Francesco Notaro said firefighters and police \"are all trying to secure the facility\". \nThe cause of the accident is yet to be determined, but what happened is likely to fuel concerns expressed by trade unions about workplace safety in Italy. \nTwo of the country's largest unions were already due to hold a four-hour nationwide strike on Thursday to protest over the issue.\nLake Suviana is an artificial lake located in the Appennine mountain range near Bologna. The lake was formed following the construction of a dam in 1932. \nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni wrote on X, formerly Twitter, to thank the rescue services and say she was \"anxiously\" following news on the explosion.\nThe power plant is owned by Enel Green Power, a subsidiary of Italian energy giant Enel. The company expressed its deepest condolences and closeness to all the victims and their families and said that while there was no indication that the dam had suffered any damage, the power plant had stopped production.

    "More than a year after he resigned from his post as Venezuela's oil minister, Tareck El Aissami has been arrested accused of corruption. \nMr El Aissami is accused of stealing from Venezuela's state oil company. \nOnce a powerful ally of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Mr El Aissami has not been seen in public since his resignation in March 2023. \nOn Tuesday, Attorney General Tarek Saab shared photos showing the ex-minister being led away in handcuffs. \nA former economy minister, Sim\u00f3n Zerpa, and a businessman who had close ties to the Maduro government, Samark L\u00f3pez, have also been detained.\nMr Saab, who is an ally of President Maduro, announced the arrests in a news conference on Tuesday, but did not say when they had been carried out.\nThere had been much speculation about Mr El Aissami's whereabouts after the influential politician, who served as vice-president and minister of industry before becoming oil minister, completely disappeared from public view last year.\nThe attorney general said that the investigation into the corruption scheme Mr El Aissami is accused of having lead had taken time, but critics of the government noted his arrest comes just months before the presidential election in which President Maduro will run for a third consecutive term. \nMr Saab said Mr El Aissami had syphoned off money from state-oil company PdVSA. \nDuring his time as oil minister, Mr El Aissami had used some of the money to renovate his houses and sent some of it abroad, the attorney general alleged. \nAccording to Mr Saab, Mr El Aissami had conspired with PdVSA executives and officials at the Venezuelan government agency overseeing crypto-currency to steal hundreds of millions of dollars. \nHe is accused of treason and misappropriation. Mr El Aissami has not spoken publicly about these latest allegations.\nLast year, when he stepped down from the oil ministry as dozens of PdVSA executives were arrested for alleged corruption, he said that he was resigning so that a full investigation could take place.\nMr El Aissami and the two other senior politicians arrested on Tuesday were already under sanctions issued by the United States.\nIn 2017, the US treasury department accused Mr El Aissami of playing a major role in drug trafficking and Samark L\u00f3pez of being his frontman. \nSim\u00f3n Zerpa was placed on a US sanctions list in the same year for his alleged role in corruption.",
    "Australia's foreign minister has suggested the country could recognise Palestinian statehood, to increase momentum towards peace.\nHowever, Hamas could have no role in its governance, Penny Wong said.\nBoth Australia's opposition and the Zionist Federation of Australia say such a move would be premature.\nCanberra has long said that recognition of a Palestinian nation could only come as part of a two-state solution brokered with Israel.\nBut Ms Wong's comments echo a speech by UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron earlier this year, in which he hinted the UK too could recognise Palestinian statehood without the support of Israel.\nAnd on Wednesday, Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez confirmed his government was already working towards recognition, arguing it was \"in the geopolitical interest of Europe\".\u00a0\n\"The international community will not be able to help the Palestinian State if it does not recognise its existence,\" he told lawmakers.\nThe Australian government has in recent months increasingly voiced concerns about the war against Hamas in Gaza - including after an Australian aid worker was killed alongside six others in an Israeli air strike. The aid workers were travelling in a convoy after picking up supplies when the IDF says they were wrongly identified as Hamas operatives and targeted.\nIn a speech on Tuesday night, Ms Wong said a two-state solution - where Israelis and Palestinians lived side by side in separate countries - was \"the only hope to break the endless cycle of violence\".\n\"The failures of this approach by all parties over decades - as well as the Netanyahu government's refusal to even engage on the question of a Palestinian state - have caused widespread frustration,\" she said.\n\"So the international community is now considering the question of Palestinian statehood as a way of building momentum towards a two-state solution.\"\nThe opposition's foreign affairs spokesman, Simon Birmingham, said it did not support such a move and that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government was threatening to \"break decades of bipartisan Australian foreign policy\".\n\"The Albanese government's argument to pre-emptively recognise a Palestinian state puts statehood before security, and will be seen as a win by the terrorists who initiated the current horrific conflict,\" he said in a statement.\nZionist Federation of Australia president Jeremy Leibler said any talk of recognition of Palestinian statehood was \"entirely premature\".\n\"Before any talk of statehood is credible, Hamas must be removed and a new generation of Palestinian leadership must emerge, which isn't corrupt, don't condone violence and recognises Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state,\" he said.\nHowever, Ms Wong said claims that recognition of a Palestinian state would be \"rewarding the enemy\" were \"wrong\". Israel's security depends on a two-state solution, she said, and recognition of statehood would help undermine and marginalise Hamas.\nAbout 140 countries recognise Palestinian statehood, but many including the US, the UK, Germany and Australia do not.\nThe United Nations is this week set to consider granting Palestine - which is currently an \"observer state\" - full membership of the international body.\nThe war in Gaza, Israel's response to a Hamas-led attack on 7 October that killed about 1,200 people and saw more than 250 taken hostage, has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Large parts of the territory are destroyed and many other Palestinians have been left on the brink of famine.\nWeeks of talks have failed to produce an agreement but international pressure is growing.",
    "Tesco has said price pressures on grocers have eased as it reported bumper sales and profits for the past year.\nThe UK's biggest supermarket chain said pre-tax profits hit \u00a32.3bn, up from \u00a3882m, while sales rose by 4.4% to \u00a368.2bn in the year to 24 February.\nThe company said price inflation in groceries had \"lessened substantially\".\nHowever, its boss Ken Murphy said the firm was conscious \"things were still difficult for many customers\".\nTesco had \"worked hard\" to cut prices, he said, and \"doubled down\" on schemes aimed at offering shoppers better value for money, such as its Aldi Price Match offer and Clubcard promotions.\nMore than 4,000 products were cheaper at the end of the year than at the start, with an average price cut of about 12%, the firm said. \nMr Murphy said he expected food inflation - which measures the rate at which food prices rise over time - to stabilise in the \"low single digits for the rest of the year\".\nHowever, he said that the cost increases seen across select items like cocoa, potatoes and coffee might prove \"sticky\".\nThe chain also came in for criticism from the Unite union. General secretary Sharon Graham said Tesco was \"raking in mountains of cash while families struggle to put food on the table because of sky high prices\".\nTesco has more than 330,000 employees and a 27.3% share of the grocery market, which Mr Murphy said was growing as customers \"respond to the improvements we've made to the value and quality of our products\". \nHe told reporters on Wednesday that shoppers were also sticking to habits they had taken on over the last two years as the cost of living soared.\n\"I do think there is a little bit more now of a habit of eating in and entertaining in and then treating yourself,\" he said.\nLike-for-like food sales, which strip out the effect of new shops opening, were up by 7.7% in the UK, with consumers opting for premium ranges like Tesco Finest and meat-free ready meals to treat themselves at home.\nWhile home and clothing sales were flat as the retailer stopped offering big-ticket electrical items, it said that womenswear had held up well.\nGlobal retail analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence Charles Allen told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the company had done a \"lot of work\" to keep up with its rivals such as German discounters Aldi and Lidl.\nHe said that the results were \"broadly in line\" with expectations, though \"just a shade weaker than anticipated\".\nHe said things would not get any easier for the retailer during the coming year as increasing staff bills would take effect just as inflation was slowing down.\nThis meant \"you haven't got the same sales boost\" from higher prices, he said, adding that the company would need to focus on selling a higher number of items.\nAsked what Tesco was doing to hang on to new customers, Mr Allen said \"mostly it's been very price competitive\".\nIt had also \"worked away at its costs\". For example, he said they were taking specialist counters out of the shops, which cut costs and enables it to be \"attractive to a wider group of consumers\".\nIn the year ahead, the supermarket was still, however, continuing on its cost-cutting drive, aiming for \u00a3500m in savings in the year ahead.\nIt also confirmed that it would have to spend in the \"mid to high single digit\" millions on changing its Clubcard price signs in shops after losing a long legal battle with rival Lidl over the logos.\nLike many other retailers, it will also face a higher wage bill as a higher minimum wage has come in and it joined other retailers in increasing pay overall in a bid to retain staff.\nRead more tips here",
    "In February, the price of a single apple in Korea hit $7 (\u00a35.5), albeit at a fancy department store. Fruit is notoriously expensive here, but for voters, who have been struggling with punishing grocery price rises, this crossed a line.  \nIn a botched attempt to address their concerns, President Yoon Suk Yeol visited a food market and marvelled at how \"reasonably priced\" the spring onions were. The market in question was in fact heavily subsidised. Online outrage and mockery ensued.  \n\"The president is going to be brought down by a spring onion,\" the leader of one of the opposition parties exclaimed. \nBut the price of food is just one in a long list of reasons why President Yoon's conservative party has lost South Korea's parliamentary elections, which were regarded as a vote of confidence on his first two years in office. \nMr Yoon has always been unpopular. Since being elected by the narrowest share of the vote in South Korean history - 0.7% - his approval rate has tended to hover around 30-40%. Last month, half of those surveyed judged him to have done a \"very bad\" job so far. \n\"There are many incidents that have chipped away at his standing,\" said the political scientist and polling expert Dr Lee Sangsin. First is a series of diplomatic gaffes, which have made international headlines, like when Mr Yoon was caught swearing on mic shortly after meeting US President Joe Biden. These incidents embarrassed Koreans who felt Mr Yoon had tarnished their reputation overseas. \nThen there is his wife, First Lady Kim Keon Hee, who, according to Prof Lee, \"people dislike even more than the president\". \nShe has been accused of plagiarising her university dissertation and of manipulating stocks. Last year, footage emerged of her appearing to break anti-corruption laws by accepting an expensive Dior handbag. Despite initially playing an active role as first lady, Ms Kim has not been seen in public with her husband since. \nMr Yoon has also alienated voters because of his confrontational political style. A former prosecutor with no prior political experience, Mr Yoon is sometimes said to act more like a prosecutor than a politician. \n\"He gives the impression that he is stubborn, doesn't listen or compromise, and has developed an almost authoritarian manner,\" said Dr Lee from the Korea Institute for National Unification.\nIn short, President Yoon has failed to win over voters beyond his loyal conservative support base. The consequence is that his party has failed to win control of the parliament, meaning it will be difficult for him to pass laws and fix urgent issues - such as a slowing economy, unattainable house prices and a rapidly ageing population. \nBefore Wednesday, the opposition already controlled the parliament. This defeat makes him the only president in South Korea's constitutional history to face an opposition-led assembly for the entirety of their single five-year term. His authority has been severely weakened and he risks becoming what analysts call a \"lame-duck\". \nWith his domestic agenda hobbled, Mr Yoon has so far focused his efforts on foreign policy, and for all his unpopularity at home he has succeeded in making friends abroad. He entered office wanting South Korea to play a bigger role on the world stage, determined to move on from what he saw as the myopia of his predecessor, who towards the end of his term became all-consumed with making peace with North Korea. \nMr Yoon presented himself as a champion of liberal, democratic values, promising to call out those who did not adhere to them. His strategy has therefore been to get tough with Pyongyang. He has upped military drills on the peninsula, slapped sanctions on the North, and retaliated whenever Kim Jong Un has baited him. \nHis critics say he has been needlessly provocative. The North is launching more weapons than ever before, and relations between the two Koreas are at their worst in years. \nBut his relationship with the US has blossomed. Strengthening Seoul's security alliance with Washington has been at the heart of Mr Yoon's foreign policy. When he serenaded President Biden with a rendition of Don McLean's American Pie at the White House it was symbolic of how both countries were singing from the same page. Mr Yoon has been music to America's ears, as it pushes to strengthen its alliances in Asia to counter China.  \nMr Yoon won further respect from the US when he buried historic disputes with Japan, to spark up a three-way security relationship between Tokyo, Seoul and Washington, at significant political cost. The move was not popular at home, but western diplomats lauded the leader for his bravery and boldness. The lack of security ties between Japan and South Korea had been seen a major weak link in Asia. \nBut such boldness has carried a cost. In the past, South Korea has walked a delicate tightrope between the US and China, carefully balancing the needs of its military ally and its largest trading partner. \"Strategic ambiguity\" was the name ",
    "After years of negotiations, the European Parliament has approved a major reform tightening the EU's migration and asylum rules.\nThe EU Asylum and Migration Pact has been in the works since 2015. It will come into force in two years' time.\nIt is designed to speed up the asylum process and boost the return of irregular migrants to home countries. \nIt will also require EU member states to share responsibility for asylum seekers. \nLast year saw some 380,000 people illegally crossing the EU's borders - the highest number since 2016.\nThe EU said the pact combined \"mandatory solidarity\" between member states with flexibility. Although some EU states remain opposed to parts of the agreement, it is expected to receive full approval at the end of April under majority voting.\nUnder the proposed rules, the EU's 27 countries will be required to either take in thousands of migrants from \"frontline\" countries, such as Italy, Greece and Spain, or provide extra funding or resources instead. \nThe pact also says that asylum claims with \"low chances of being accepted\" should be examined rapidly, without necessarily admitting the applicant into EU territory. \nThe agreement also aims to deal with asylum requests within a maximum of 12 weeks. In case of rejection, asylum seekers would have to be returned forcibly to their home country within the same period.\nMigrants will be subject to a toughened pre-entry screening procedure within seven days, which would include identification and health and security checks.\nBiometric data for any migrant aged six or older will be collected and there will be a mechanism to respond to sudden increases in arrivals.\nThe migration pact has been backed by the two main political groups - the centre-right European People's Party Group (EPP Group) and the centre-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D).\nBoth groups are trying to fend off a strong challenge from the right in parliamentary elections in June.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz praised a \"historic, indispensable step\" and Roberta Metsola, the president of the European Parliament, said it struck a \"balance between solidarity and responsibility\".\n\"It will not solve everything overnight but it is 10 giant leaps forward,\" she said. \nHungary has vowed not to take any irregular migrants \"regardless of any migration pact\", and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has rejected as \"unacceptable\" the mechanism of taking in some asylum seekers or paying into an EU fund for frontline states. \nAlthough many MEPs welcomed the result, several also noted that the agreement was not \"perfect\".\n\"It is a compromise we can work with,\" said Slovenian MEP Matjaz Nemec, while Belgium's Hilde Vautmans said the legislation was \"not perfect\" but that she had voted for it nonetheless.\nHowever, left-wing and far-right groups opposed the agreement.\nJordan Bardella of France's far-right National Rally said the migration pact was \"terrible\" and urged Europeans to vote against President Emmanuel Macron, who backed the agreement, at the upcoming European elections on 9 June.  \nAt one point, protesters disrupted the vote, chanting \"this pact kills, vote No\" and throwing paper planes.\nMany NGOs also urged MEPs to vote down the reform, with Amnesty International warning the pact would lead to a \"surge in suffering\" for asylum seekers. \nOne common objection from NGOs is that asylum seekers with low chances of being accepted would have their claims processed either on small border islands or in detention facilities in frontline states, and have less access to fair procedures.\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said it was worried by both \"the normalisation of detention and speedier processes at borders\". Quick decisions risked sending back people who should be granted asylum, it warned.",
    "Russia has said the situation is \"very, very tense\" as floodwaters continue to rise in the city of Orenburg and surrounding areas.\n\"Large amounts of water are coming to new regions,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned on Wednesday.\nThe flooding is being described as the worst to hit the region in 80 years.\nWater levels in the Ural river near Orenburg rose to over 10m (33ft) on Wednesday, Ria news agency reported, well above its bursting point.\nThousands of people have had to flee their homes in southern Russia, while officials in neighbouring Kazakhstan say the number of evacuees there has risen to 97,000.\nLast week, several rivers - including the Ural, Europe's third-largest - burst their banks after rapidly melting snow and ice caused them to swell.\nThe Ural flows through the city of Orsk, on to Orenburg, into Kazakhstan and then on to the Caspian Sea. Floodwaters are threatening several areas of northern Kazakhstan and many dams and reservoirs are filled to capacity.\nEntire villages have been engulfed by overflowing rivers. As many as 2,000 homes have been flooded in Orenburg, where water levels have surpassed the critical level of 9.3m and still rising. The city has a population of 550,000 and lies about 1,500km (930 miles) south-east of Moscow. \n\"So far, the forecast is not favourable. The water level continues to rise,\" Mr Peskov said, adding that a \"large amount\" of floodwater would soon also reach the nearby regions of Kurgan and Tyumen. \nMr Peskov added that the situation \"of course requires the most energetic efforts from government officials at all levels to help people\".\nHe said President Vladimir Putin was not intending to visit the flood zone and said the Russian leader was instead \"getting information and co-ordinated the work of all branches of authorities\".\nOrsk, about 300km (180 miles) downstream from Orenburg, was flooded when water burst through a dam embankment. Authorities there say the situation is now stable.\nEarlier this week in Orsk, angry flood victims shouted '\"Shame on you!\" at local officials, in response to low compensation offers and officials' perceived failure to prevent the dam from bursting. \nThey also chanted, \"Putin help us\" - a reminder that in Russia, in times of trouble, very often the president is the last person people blame for their problems. On the contrary, they look to the Kremlin for help.\nFlooding often happens in Russia when winter transitions to spring. But there has been nothing on this scale in living memory.\nNorth Kazakhstan regional leader Gauez Nurmukhambetov has warned that a \"huge flow\" of water is heading to the city of Petropavl, with a population of 200,000.\n\"Once again, I emphasise, huge!\" he said.",
    "A busload full of Chinese high school students coerced into voting for a Liberal candidate. An opaque cash injection of thousands of dollars from China. A proxy agent of India's government providing illegal financial support to pro-India politicians.\nThese allegations and more surfaced during two weeks of testimony in Canada's ongoing public inquiry into foreign interference in its elections. \nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau is testifying on Wednesday before the commission.\nThe accusations heard so far - which were made by Canada's spy agency in a series of redacted documents provided for the inquiry - are to be taken with caution, officials said.\nThe reports may include uncorroborated information that is single-sourced or incomplete, and that has not been properly investigated, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) warned.\nChina and India have repeatedly denied any allegations that they are among the countries that have interfered in Canada's affairs - with India recently calling them \"baseless allegations\". \nBut some politicians have said interference may have affected their political careers.\nAnd testimony from members of Canada's varied diaspora communities shone a light on alleged threats to their safety by agents tied to governments in their home countries.\nThe inquiry, led by Quebec judge Marie-Josee Hogue, is hearing from more than 40 community members, politicians and federal election officials before its first report is published next month.\nThose affected by the alleged meddling efforts have accused officials and CSIS of not doing enough to combat it, or of keeping them in the dark altogether. \nAnd Canada's own spy agency has said the government is not doing enough to tackle the issue, and that the country lags behind its \"Five Eyes\" intelligence allies - the US, UK, Australia and New Zealand.\nMr Trudeau - whose Liberal Party won the last two federal elections in 2019 and 2021 - came under pressure to set up the inquiry after allegations of foreign interference emerged from leaked intelligence in Canadian media.\nLast week he sidestepped reporters' questions about the purported meddling, simply saying the issue was \"extremely important\" and that he looked forward to testifying on Wednesday.\nFrom testimony and partially unsealed classified documents, Canadians have learned some of the ways China and other foreign governments may have attempted to interfere in those two elections.\nThere is no evidence the results of the election were affected. \nCSIS has alleged that the Chinese government \"clandestinely and deceptively\" interfered in both elections. \nThe interference was \"pragmatic in nature and focused primarily in supporting those viewed to be either 'pro-PRC' (Peoples' Republic of China) or 'neutral' on issues of interest to the PRC government,\" said a briefing by the agency.\n\"We also observed online and media activities aimed at discouraging Canadians, particularly of Chinese heritage, from supporting the Conservative Party (and former) leader Erin O'Toole,\" the briefing note added.\nMr O'Toole testified last week that his campaign was marred by a deluge of misinformation that he believes lost his party up to nine seats in the 2021 election.\nHe said that, while the overall result of the election - which his party lost to Mr Trudeau's Liberals - was not affected, he believes it led to his ouster as leader.\nCSIS reports mentioned a possible C$250,000 ($184,000; \u00a3145,300) funnelled from China during the 2019 election to an unnamed candidate's staff member, and then to others, in a meddling attempt.\nThe spy agency also accused China of funding a charter bus in 2019 to send Chinese private high school students to help a Liberal politician, Han Dong, secure his party's nomination. \nCSIS suggested that the students were coerced, that \"their student visas would be in jeopardy and that there could be consequences for their families back in the PRC\" if they did not support Mr Dong.\nIn his testimony, Mr Dong, who now sits as an independent, said he met with Chinese students and encouraged them to register as Liberal members during his campaign. \nBut he denied knowledge of anything nefarious. International students are allowed to vote in Liberal party nominations as long as they can prove they live in the riding (constituency or electoral district). \nIndia and Pakistan also were named by CSIS as trying to interfere in both elections.\nIn India's case, the spy agency said activities were carried out by a proxy agent of the Indian government, and \"were centred on a small number of electoral districts\" to support pro-India candidates.\nThey were motivated by the perception that \"a portion of Indo-Canadian voters were sympathetic to the Khalistani movement or pro-Pakistan political stances,\" CSIS reported.\nMr Trudeau previously accused India of being involved in the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist who was killed on Canadian soil in June 2023.\nMeanwhile, Pakistan's attempted meddling was",
    "Lady Gaga is seen bringing the music, dance and a very bad romance to the Joker film sequel in its first trailer.\nThe singer and actress plays a new version of Harley Quinn in Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux opposite Joaquin Phoenix, who won an Oscar for the original movie.\nThe pair seemingly meet and fall in love in Arkham Asylum before apparently escaping and forming a musical duo.\nDirector Todd Phillips said it isn't a musical, as had been rumoured, but that music is \"an essential element\".\nPhoenix won an Oscar for best actor for his performance in 2019's Joker.\nHere are seven things of note from the sequel's trailer.\nArthur Fleck (aka Joker) and Harley Quinn's eyes appear to meet as she takes part in a singing group in Arkham Asylum, where he was left at the end of the 2019 film.\nHer origin story is as a psychiatrist at the institution who is obsessed with the failed comedian and \"crown prince of crime\" - but here, she could be a fellow inmate. It's not quite clear which side of the bars she's on. \n\"It seems to confirm a massive shift in Harley Quinn's origin story,\" wrote IGN's Alex Stedman, \"as it appears to show her as a patient in Arkham Asylum rather than as a psychiatrist\".\n\"Long gone, it seems, are the days of Dr Harleen Quinzel.\"\nBut if she is working rather than residing there, that might help explain how she can help him escape.\n\"Let's get outta here,\" she whispers, before the pair are seen in a fantasy rooftop dance sequence.\nThat abruptly cuts to a gritty Gotham City street, where they continue their carefree dance as emergency vehicles rush in the direction of whatever chaos they have just caused.\n\"We use music to make us whole - to balance the fractures within ourselves,\" the title character is heard saying in voiceover.\nJoker has found a partner in love and crime, but also music. In one clip, they perform as Joker & Harley on a TV show, complete with full band and backing singers.\nThe trailer is soundtracked by What the World Needs Now Is Love, made famous in 1965 by Jackie DeShannon.\n\"I like to say it's a movie where music is an essential element,\" Phillips told CinemaCon on Tuesday, when asked whether this is a musical.\n\"To me that doesn't veer too far from the first film,\" he said, adding that in that original film, \"Arthur has music in him. He has a grace to him.\"\nIndeed, one of the most famous scenes from the first film was where Joker danced down a flight of stone steps. In the new trailer, Harley is seen walking up those same steps. \nIn another snippet, she and Joker mimic his original dance as they go down what look like courthouse steps, with cheering crowds on either side.\nThankfully, there's no Gary Glitter music this time.\nAt another point, Harley, wearing a white wedding dress and veil, dances down an aisle to a chapel, where Joker is waiting in a white suit, apparently accompanied by backing singers as bridesmaids.\nThis is, however, one of several fantasy sequences that are reminiscent of classic Hollywood movie musicals.\nThat led one person on X to say it looks like 2016 musical La La Land, but for \"people who hear voices\".\nThe British comedian and actor pops up in the trailer as some sort of authority figure who asks Arthur/Joker: \"What's changed?\"\n\"I'll tell you what's changed - I'm not alone any more,\" he replies.\nCoogan's appearance led some to hope for a repeat of a line by his most famous character, Alan Partridge, when he declared: \"I'm Batman!\" Which really would be a plot twist.\nAfter causing mass mayhem, with riots on the streets, an explosion in a packed room with TV cameras (the same studio as their performance?), and Joker and Harley running hand-in-hand out of a flaming building, the trailer ends quietly with Harley apparently visiting Arthur in prison.\nUsing her red lipstick, she draws a curved line on the glass between them and tells him: \"I want to see the real you.\"\nPhoenix's glum face slowly shifts and breaks into a big smile, which aligns with the now out-of-focus lipstick to suddenly become Joker's famous red face paint.\nA masterful shot which we hope took several hundred attempts to perfect, rather than having the lipstick digitally added in post-production.\nThe trailer actually ends with the release date - 10.04.24 - which means it's out TODAY! Hurrah!\nOh, wait. Americans write their days and months the wrong way around. So we'll actually have until 4 October.",
    "A TV cosmetic doctor gave free Botox to a patient in return for sex at his clinic, a medical tribunal has found.\nDr Tijion Esho, who has featured on ITV's This Morning, BBC's Morning Live and E4's Body Fixers, admitted an improper relationship with a woman in Newcastle, but denied it was physical.\nThe Medical Tribunal Practitioners Service (MPTS) found he exchanged treatment for sex with the woman.\nDr Esho said he was \"disappointed\" with the tribunal's decision.\nHis fitness to practise will be determined at a later date.\nDr Esho admitted to an improper emotional relationship with the woman, referred to as Patient A, with whom he exchanged \"inappropriate\" sexual messages on Instagram.\nBut the 42-year-old told the MPTS hearing he never had any physical sexual contact with Patient A, who provided sex services via OnlyFans and webcams.\nThe panel, sitting in Manchester, ruled Dr Esho did have sexual intercourse with Patient A at his clinic in Newcastle in 2021 and administered Botox free of charge.\nIt also ruled that he told her he \"could get away with giving her Botox in exchange for sexual services\".\nThe panel also concluded he and the woman had had sexual contact at previous consultations.\nThe panel ruled the conduct of the doctor, also known as Oluwafemi Esho, was sexually motivated, but did not find Patient A to be vulnerable because of her profession.\nThe hearing will reconvene later this month to decide whether Dr Esho's fitness to practise is impaired because of his misconduct.\nDr Esho featured on the ITV morning programme to provide his medical opinion and comment on cosmetic surgery discussions.\nHe was also regularly consulted on Body Fixers for E4, a channel operated by Channel 4, which aired for two seasons in 2016 and 2017, and made appearances on segments of BBC's Morning Live until the summer of 2022.\nDr Esho is the founder of the Esho Clinic, which also has locations in London, Liverpool and Dubai, and has a host of celebrity clients.\nIn a statement, he said: \"Throughout the hearing and investigation, with which I have cooperated fully, I stressed that I deeply regretted the mistakes which I made in engaging in communications with Patient A, and I admitted to the charges which related to those serious errors of judgement. \n\"I am truly sorry for those actions, and apologise to everyone I let down as a result. \n\"However, I have always been clear that whilst my conduct in communicating with Patient A was wrong, I repeat categorically that it never crossed over into any physical sexual contact.\n\"My life's work has been and will remain focused on helping people.

    "The first oral treatment for preventing both chronic and episodic migraines could soon be available on the NHS.\nHealth experts said up to 170,000 people in England could benefit from taking atogepant to prevent severe head pain, which can be debilitating.\nIt has been recommended for those who have not responded well to other medications or cannot have injections.\nOne migraine charity described it as a positive step and said it hoped access to the drug would be \"swift\".\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended the drug, which comes in tablet form, after clinical trials suggested it was effective in some adults.\nIn its final draft guidance, NICE said atogepant should be offered to people who had unsuccessfully tried three other medications, many of which need to be taken by injection or infusion.  \nIt's not always obvious if you are experiencing a headache or the start of a migraine. \nMigraines are more severe and are often accompanied by other symptoms such as dizziness, sensitivity to light, and difficulty speaking.\nThe pain may be throbbing pain in one side of the head and can last several days.\nIt is not clear how many people are affected by migraines, but the NHS believes the number to be about six million across the UK, with many more women experiencing them than men.\nAtogepant is designed to be taken daily to prevent both chronic migraines (occurring more than 15 times a month) and episodic migraines (occurring between four and 15 times a month).\nAt first, it will only be available from specialist doctors in secondary care settings, rather than from GPs.\nRob Music, chief executive of the Migraine Trust, said it was good news as migraines could be very \"debilitating\". \n\"It is positive to see even more therapies emerging for people with migraine, as many still rely on treatments developed for other conditions.\"\nHowever, the charity warned that many people had struggled to access similar new drugs, because of a lack of knowledge among doctors, and long waiting lists for specialists.\n\"We now need to ensure access is swift, so that migraine patients can benefit from them as quickly as possible,\" Mr Music said. \nAre you affected by the issues raised in this story?

You can also get in touch in the following ways:\nAtogepant is a new type of anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) drug, which is specifically designed to treat migraines. They work by blocking the receptor of the CGRP protein. This is found in nerves in the head and neck and is thought to cause inflammation and migraine pain. These drugs have fewer side effects than older migraine drugs, some of which were originally developed for other conditions.\nIt follows the introduction of a similar drug, rimegepant, in England and Scotland. \nDeborah Sloan, from Brighton, told the BBC that rimegepant had put her life \"back on track\" after suffering chronic migraines for 40 years. Other treatments led to severe side effects.\nShe said can now work again after losing two careers because of being unwell with migraines for 20 days of each month.\n\"I was at the end of my tether,\" she said. \"I became so desperate, I wasn't sure how I was going to carry on. I didn't think I could take another migraine attack because they are so disabling.\n\"They can last three days, constantly vomiting. You're not able to do anything. You feel like you want to die, that's how I felt.\"\nHowever, Mrs Sloan said she had to obtain rimegepant privately at first because of a long wait for a referral to a specialist doctor who could prescribe it.\nAtogepant is expected to be made available on the NHS in England from next month.\nIt is already available in Scotland to prevent and relieve migraine symptoms.",
    "Elon Musk has announced on his social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that he will visit India to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi without giving a date.\nThe Tesla boss is expected to announce major investment plans in the country soon.\nLast month, India cut import taxes on electric vehicles (EV) for global carmakers which commit to investing $500m (\u00a3399m) and starting local production within three years.\nIn 2021, the Tesla boss said that India's high import duties had prevented the firm from launching its cars in the world's fastest-growing major economy.\nMr Musk wrote in a post on Wednesday: \"Looking forward to meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in India!\"\nA senior Indian government official told the BBC that the meeting is scheduled for the last week of April and will take place at Mr Modi\u2019s official residence in New Delhi.\nThe BBC understands that Tesla\u2019s plans for starting manufacturing in India will feature in the talks.\nTesla did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.\nMr Musk's visit comes just as the country begins voting in marathon, six-week-long elections on 19 April.\nMr Modi's Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is widely expected to win a third term in power.\nA Tesla investment announcement during the election would bolster the business-friendly credentials of Mr Modi, who has courted foreign companies to set up manufacturing operations in India and create jobs.\nThe two men met last June in New York when the technology multi-billionaire said Mr Modi had been \"pushing us to make significant investments in India, which is something that we intend to do\".\nTesla's plans to move into India comes at a time when the company is battling weakening sales in the US and China.\nDeliveries slid sharply in the first three months of this year as Tesla grappled with a fire at its European factory, global shipping disruption and growing competition.\nTesla has cut prices repeatedly in response to increased competition from rivals such as BYD but demand in key markets like China has fallen.\nTesla's shares have lost almost a third of their value since the start of this year.\nIndia overtook the UK in 2022 to become the world's fifth-largest economy, and grew by 8.4% in the December quarter, helped by a surging manufacturing sector.",
    "Tesco has said price pressures on grocers have eased as it reported bumper sales and profits for the past year.\nThe UK's biggest supermarket chain said pre-tax profits hit \u00a32.3bn, up from \u00a3882m, while sales rose by 4.4% to \u00a368.2bn in the year to 24 February.\nThe company said price inflation in groceries had \"lessened substantially\".\nHowever, its boss Ken Murphy said the firm was conscious \"things were still difficult for many customers\".\nTesco had \"worked hard\" to cut prices, he said, and \"doubled down\" on schemes aimed at offering shoppers better value for money, such as its Aldi Price Match offer and Clubcard promotions.\nMore than 4,000 products were cheaper at the end of the year than at the start, with an average price cut of about 12%, the firm said. \nMr Murphy said he expected food inflation - which measures the rate at which food prices rise over time - to stabilise in the \"low single digits for the rest of the year\".\nHowever, he said that the cost increases seen across select items like cocoa, potatoes and coffee might prove \"sticky\".\nThe chain also came in for criticism from the Unite union. General secretary Sharon Graham said Tesco was \"raking in mountains of cash while families struggle to put food on the table because of sky high prices\".\nTesco has more than 330,000 employees and a 27.3% share of the grocery market, which Mr Murphy said was growing as customers \"respond to the improvements we've made to the value and quality of our products\". \nHe told reporters on Wednesday that shoppers were also sticking to habits they had taken on over the last two years as the cost of living soared.\n\"I do think there is a little bit more now of a habit of eating in and entertaining in and then treating yourself,\" he said.\nLike-for-like food sales, which strip out the effect of new shops opening, were up by 7.7% in the UK, with consumers opting for premium ranges like Tesco Finest and meat-free ready meals to treat themselves at home.\nWhile home and clothing sales were flat as the retailer stopped offering big-ticket electrical items, it said that womenswear had held up well.\nGlobal retail analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence Charles Allen told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the company had done a \"lot of work\" to keep up with its rivals such as German discounters Aldi and Lidl.\nHe said that the results were \"broadly in line\" with expectations, though \"just a shade weaker than anticipated\".\nHe said things would not get any easier for the retailer during the coming year as increasing staff bills would take effect just as inflation was slowing down.\nThis meant \"you haven't got the same sales boost\" from higher prices, he said, adding that the company would need to focus on selling a higher number of items.\nAsked what Tesco was doing to hang on to new customers, Mr Allen said \"mostly it's been very price competitive\".\nIt had also \"worked away at its costs\". For example, he said they were taking specialist counters out of the shops, which cut costs and enables it to be \"attractive to a wider group of consumers\".\nIn the year ahead, the supermarket was still, however, continuing on its cost-cutting drive, aiming for \u00a3500m in savings in the year ahead.\nIt also confirmed that it would have to spend in the \"mid to high single digit\" millions on changing its Clubcard price signs in shops after losing a long legal battle with rival Lidl over the logos.\nLike many other retailers, it will also face a higher wage bill as a higher minimum wage has come in and it joined other retailers in increasing pay overall in a bid to retain staff.\nRead more tips here",
    "Part of an LNER train dating back to the 1930s which was discovered by archaeologists in Belgium last month is exceptionally rare, experts have said.\nThe red storage wagon, used for transporting belongings when people moved house, was unearthed in Antwerp.\nAfter the discovery of the wooden truck, archaeologists said it was a \"mystery\" how it had ended up there.\nYork-based LNER has now confirmed the wagon was one of the firm's rare first models dating back nearly 100 years.\nThe vehicle was found in March by a team from the Urban Archaeology department of the City of Antwerp.\nIt was buried near the wall of a 19th Century fortress known as the Northern Citadel.\nThe archaeologists had been excavating the area as part of work with organisations building a new ring road around the city. \nLNER said that since the initial discovery, internal research into the truck suggested it was the first model of wagon which was briefly in service with the firm in about 1930.\nIt was particularly rare because, at the time, the company used blue wagons - while the new discovery was red. \nAntwerp archaeologist Femke Martens said closer examination of the wagon showed the only features identifying it were several inscriptions, including the letters \"LNER\".\nMr Martens said other inscriptions included one stating \"furniture removal to house\", another which read \"enquire at any station\", and a third, \"BK769\", which identified its size and what it was used for.\nHe confirmed that the wagon was \"thought to be around 100 years old\".\n\"It's a mystery as to how the carriage came to be in Antwerp, and unfortunately there's very little left of the relic as it disintegrated while being excavated. \nStuart Thomas, LNER communications director, said: \"This curious find has certainly generated lots of interest.\"\n\"We are delighted the team from the Urban Archaeology department of the City of Antwerp have helped shed more light on the discovery,\" he added.\n\"We're fascinated by LNER's history, and we'd like to thank the team for their help in unearthing more information about LNER's proud past.\" \nTrain services run by LNER, or London and North Eastern Railway, started operating in January 1923 on what later became known as the East Coast Mainline.\nThe LNER name returned in June 2018 after previous operator Virgin Trains East Coast returned the franchise to the government. \nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "After years of negotiations, the European Parliament has approved a major reform tightening the EU's migration and asylum rules.\nThe EU Asylum and Migration Pact has been in the works since 2015. It will come into force in two years' time.\nIt is designed to speed up the asylum process and boost the return of irregular migrants to home countries. \nIt will also require EU member states to share responsibility for asylum seekers. \nLast year saw some 380,000 people illegally crossing the EU's borders - the highest number since 2016.\nThe EU said the pact combined \"mandatory solidarity\" between member states with flexibility. Although some EU states remain opposed to parts of the agreement, it is expected to receive full approval at the end of April under majority voting.\nUnder the proposed rules, the EU's 27 countries will be required to either take in thousands of migrants from \"frontline\" countries, such as Italy, Greece and Spain, or provide extra funding or resources instead. \nThe pact also says that asylum claims with \"low chances of being accepted\" should be examined rapidly, without necessarily admitting the applicant into EU territory. \nThe agreement also aims to deal with asylum requests within a maximum of 12 weeks. In case of rejection, asylum seekers would have to be returned forcibly to their home country within the same period.\nMigrants will be subject to a toughened pre-entry screening procedure within seven days, which would include identification and health and security checks.\nBiometric data for any migrant aged six or older will be collected and there will be a mechanism to respond to sudden increases in arrivals.\nThe migration pact has been backed by the two main political groups - the centre-right European People's Party Group (EPP Group) and the centre-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D).\nBoth groups are trying to fend off a strong challenge from the right in parliamentary elections in June.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz praised a \"historic, indispensable step\" and Roberta Metsola, the president of the European Parliament, said it struck a \"balance between solidarity and responsibility\".\n\"It will not solve everything overnight but it is 10 giant leaps forward,\" she said. \nHungary has vowed not to take any irregular migrants \"regardless of any migration pact\", and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has rejected as \"unacceptable\" the mechanism of taking in some asylum seekers or paying into an EU fund for frontline states. \nAlthough many MEPs welcomed the result, several also noted that the agreement was not \"perfect\".\n\"It is a compromise we can work with,\" said Slovenian MEP Matjaz Nemec, while Belgium's Hilde Vautmans said the legislation was \"not perfect\" but that she had voted for it nonetheless.\nHowever, left-wing and far-right groups opposed the agreement.\nJordan Bardella of France's far-right National Rally said the migration pact was \"terrible\" and urged Europeans to vote against President Emmanuel Macron, who backed the agreement, at the upcoming European elections on 9 June.  \nAt one point, protesters disrupted the vote, chanting \"this pact kills, vote No\" and throwing paper planes.\nMany NGOs also urged MEPs to vote down the reform, with Amnesty International warning the pact would lead to a \"surge in suffering\" for asylum seekers. \nOne common objection from NGOs is that asylum seekers with low chances of being accepted would have their claims processed either on small border islands or in detention facilities in frontline states, and have less access to fair procedures.\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said it was worried by both \"the normalisation of detention and speedier processes at borders\". Quick decisions risked sending back people who should be granted asylum, it warned.",

She told the inquest all the midwives were \"very shocked\" when the labour ward co-ordinator left the night before.\nMs Muoni also said she felt there was a \"form of censorship\" about the whole event. She said a different labour ward coordinator had asked her to remove details of it from her serious incident statement.\nThe labour ward co-ordinator told the inquest she was \"aware that it was an unusual situation\" for her to leave the ward. \nHowever, she said the feelings of her colleagues \"came as real shock\".\nOn Monday, Mrs Clyde-Smith told the inquest about her birthing experience.\nShe said she was \"wandering on the labour ward trying to find someone\" to give her pain relief. \nShe added the \"state Amelia came out in\u2026 was horrible to watch\" and she was aware of \"things going wrong\" with a resuscitation machine. \nThe coroner read out a letter Mr and Mrs Clyde-Smith sent to the Deputy Viscount asking for Amelia's death to be investigated. \nIn it, the parents raised a number of concerns including the absence of doctors, the long wait for an epidural and staff failing to monitor the baby's distress before birth. \n\"We felt like no-one had Amelia's interests in mind that night,\" they wrote. \nThe coroner said the inquest was due to conclude on Friday.\nFollow BBC Jersey on Twitter and Facebook.

    "The Muslim festival of Eid al-Fitr has begun, marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan.\nIt was declared after the new Moon was sighted in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday 9 April. \nEid al-Fitr is the \"festival of breaking the fast\".\nIt takes place the day after the new Moon is seen at the end of the month of Ramadan, and marks the start of Shawwal - the 10th month of the Islamic calendar.\nAlong with Eid al-Adha, it is one of the two main festivals in Islam.\nMany Muslims attend prayers at their mosque on the morning of Eid al-Fitr.\nBy this time, they are expected to have made their end-of-Ramadan donation to charity - known as Zakat-ul-Fitr or Fitrana - to help feed the poor.\nEid al-Fitr is usually a period of great celebration, with families and friends coming together and sharing large meals. \nIt is also common for children to receive either money or small gifts from their elders.\nTo wish someone well at Eid, you can say \"Eid Mubarak\", which means \"Blessed Eid\".\nIn the Middle East, you may also hear \"Eid Saeed\" which simply means \"Happy Eid\".\nEid al-Adha is expected to take place in 2024 between 16 and 20 June. \nIt lasts for four days and coincides with the later part of the Hajj - the annual pilgrimage to Mecca.\nEid al-Adha means \"feast of the sacrifice\", and it commemorates prophet Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son on God's orders.\nRamadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. It has a special significance in Islam. \nIt is during this month that Muslims believe the first verses of the Quran - Islam's holy book - were revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.\nDuring this period, Muslims are required to fast and to give to charity, to show kindness and patience, and to strengthen their relationship with God. \nExtra emphasis is placed on reciting the Quran.\nFasting during Ramadan is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, which lay the basis for how Muslims are required to live their lives. \nThe other pillars are the profession of faith, prayer five times a day, zakat - a form of charity, and making the pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca once in their lifetime.\nFasting is meant to encourage spiritual reflection.\nMuslims have an early morning meal before dawn, known as suhoor or sehri. \nDuring the day, they are not supposed to eat or drink anything - including water - until after sunset, when they break their fast with an evening meal, called iftar or fitoor.  \nSome Muslims are, however, exempt from fasting. They include children who have not reached puberty, pregnant or breastfeeding women, menstruating women, those who are ill or whose health could be affected by fasting, and those who are travelling.\nIf you want to wish someone a good start of Ramadan, it is customary to say \"Ramadan Mubarak\", which means \"Blessed Ramadan\".\nYou can also say \"Ramadan Kareem\", which translates as \"Generous Ramadan\".\nThe Islamic calendar follows the lunar cycle. \nEach month begins with the sighting of the new crescent moon and lasts either 29 or 30 days.\nIn 2024, Ramadan lasted 30 days, with fasting having started on Monday 11 March. It ended on Wednesday 10 April. ",
    "Sex, money and \"power\" led an Idaho man to murder his first wife and two of his second wife's children in a \"doomsday plot\", prosecutors have alleged. \nChad Daybell is accused of killing ex-wife Tammy Daybell, as well as Joshua \"JJ\" Vallow, 7, and Tylee Ryan, 16.\nThe children's mother, Lori Vallow Daybell, was sentenced to life in prison for their murders last year. \nMr Daybell, 55, faces the death penalty if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty. \nAt the start of Mr Daybell's trial on Wednesday, prosecutors said that he and Ms Vallow believed her children were \"dark spirits\" and \"zombies\" and murdered them in 2019, approximately a year after the pair met at a religious event.  \nProsecutors claimed the two were having an affair together and came to view Mrs Daybell as a potential obstacle. \n\"When he had a chance at what he considered his rightful destiny, he made sure that no person, no law would stand in his way,\" prosecutor Rob Wood said. \n\"His desire for sex, money and power led him to pursue those ambitions and this pursuit led to the deaths of his wife and Lori's two innocent children.\"\nAfter a long search, the remains of the children were found buried on Mr Daybell's property in June 2020. \nOne of the children had been dismembered and burned, while the other was bound. \nMrs Daybell died of asphyxiation in October 2019, 17 days before Mr Daybell married Ms Vallow at a ceremony in Hawaii. \nMr Wood said that jurors will be shown \"extended text messages to reveal his mindset and his motivations\". \nThe attorney defending Mr Daybell, John Prior, said expert witnesses would testify that his client's DNA was never found on the children's remains. \nInstead, he sought to shift blame to Ms Vallow's brother, Alex Cox, who died in 2019. At the time of his death, police were investigating an incident in which Mr Cox shot dead his sister's fourth husband, Charles Vallow. \n\"Whenever there was a problem or threat, you will hear testimony that Alex Cox came to the rescue,\" Mr Prior said, adding that Mr Cox's DNA was found on a piece of plastic alongside one of the children's remains. \nAdditionally, Mr Prior claimed there was no evidence to suggest that Mrs Daybell's death was the result of foul play. \nMr Daybell has also been charged with conspiracy to commit murder and faces insurance fraud charges stemming from life insurance policies he had taken out.\nThe judge in the case, Steve Boyce, sentenced Ms Vallow to three consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole in July 2023. \nThe trial is expected to last approximately nine weeks.

    "As the festival of Eid al-Fitr came to an end, an estimated 2,500 people gathered in west Belfast to celebrate.\nThe Muslim festival marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan - a period of fasting for many adults.\nThe biggest gathering in Northern Ireland to celebrate Eid was at Colin Glen Leisure Park.\nOne of the organisers of the event said the Muslim community in Northern Ireland was almost three times the size it was five years ago.\nMuhammad Atif from the Belfast Multi-Cultural Centre said the organisation felt there was a need for a bigger venue this year,\n\"We felt that there was a need to go to a bigger place and organise something big where you could actually have the Eid feel - the celebration, people come around, they get together, pray together,\" he said.\n\"The last time we counted nationalities, which was about a year ago, we had 42 different nationalities coming around and today I think we have more than 50 nationalities.\n\"In terms of the numbers today, we've done some headcounts and we believe it's around two-and-a-half thousand.\"\nMr Atif said events such as Wednesday's were important in promoting understanding for both Muslims and non-Muslims in Northern Ireland.\n\"There's a big educational piece which we feel like we need to do and we are doing our bit to make people aware of what Islam is, what this religion is,\" he said.\n\"It's not the religion that some people portray it as - Islam is a very peaceful religion.\n\"I personally felt when I came to this country around 16 years ago that I didn't have that platform.\n\"Now people have the platform, they mix, they integrate and we help them integrate between the two communities, including the local communities.\n\"Northern Ireland people are very hospitable, this is my home and I can't see myself living anywhere else,\" \nEid marks the end of the month-long dawn-to-sunset fasting of Ramadan and is therefore a feast day, as well as a religious holiday, and is often marked by family celebrations, gifts and gatherings.\nThe name Eid al-Fitr translates as \"the festival of the breaking of the fast\".\nOne of those attending Wednesday's event was Sareena Ikram, who said she was grateful to everyone who had made it possible.\n\"It's really good to have this festival here because we are Muslims and we need something to be heard,\" she said.\n\"This time it's a big festival and it's on open ground, even though the weather's not good, but it's indoor.\n\"The Muslim community is spreading all over Northern Ireland.\"\nAmina Obefunse said to experience the festival staged in such a way in Belfast was very important.\n\"It's very encouraging, it's massive,\" she said.\n\"We feel good, we are so happy, you can see no-one wants to leave yet, they're still taking pictures because the environment looks so good, so it's perfect.\"   \nJason Barnes said it was a special occasion for him as it was not something he had been to before.\n\"It's very, very impressive - we weren't sure because of the weather and everything how many people were going to be here, but we realised coming in that there were so many cars and lots and lots of people here,\" he said.\n\"I think the main thing we noticed was that there were people from all over the world, which is an amazing thing to see in Northern Ireland.\n\"What I think is really amazing is over the last five, 10 years we've really seen the diversity increasing in Belfast and in Northern Ireland and I think that really enriches our culture in general because we can learn from each other.\n\"People here are very keen to integrate into society and I think are very proud to make Northern Ireland their home.\"",
    "South Korea's liberal opposition party has won a landslide majority in the country's general election to retain control of parliament.\nThe Democratic Party (DPK) and smaller opposition parties jointly won 192 of 300 seats in the National Assembly.\nThe vote is widely seen as a midterm referendum on President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has three years left in office.\nHis party leader Han Dong-hoon has resigned and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo has offered to resign. \nThis is a crushing defeat for Mr Yoon and his People Power Party (PPP), which has been struggling to achieve its agenda in a legislature dominated by the DPK. The DPK's win means they will be able to fast-track and push legislation through parliament. \nBoth the DPK and PPP use breakaway satellite parties to maximise their vote under South Korea's electoral system, which assigns some seats to smaller parties whose seat counts fall short of their overall support. \n\"This isn't the Democratic Party's victory but a great victory for the people,\" said DPK leader Lee Jae-myung on Thursday.\n\"Politicians on both sides of the aisle must pool our strength to deal with the current economic crisis. The Democratic Party will lead the way in solving the livelihood crisis,\" he told reporters.\nToday's result could embolden Mr Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 presidential election to Mr Yoon, to make another presidential run.\nMr Yoon is under pressure to address a number of issues including rising food prices, a rapidly aging population and an ongoing doctor's strike.\nIn recent weeks, he has been criticised for appearing to be out of touch with the impact of inflation on voters. \nJust last month, he was criticised for commenting during a visit to a Seoul supermarket that a bundle of green onions priced at 875 won (\u00a30.51; $0.65) was \"reasonable\".\nThe item had been priced at discount because of subsidies and would normally have cost between 3,000 and 4,000 won.\nThe comment sparked a backlash, with bundles of green onions later being used as props at farmers' protests and DPK election rallies.\nMr Yoon's wife, Kim Keon Hee, has also been embroiled in a controversy for allegedly accepting a luxury bag as a gift, while separate corruption and abuse of power allegations have been levelled at senior members of his party.\nThe DPK has also been beleaguered by its own political controversies and internal struggles, and has faced corruption allegations.",

    "At least two people were shot near an event celebrating the end of Ramadan in Philadelphia, police said.\nPolice Commissioner Kevin Bethel said five people were arrested after \"young people actively engaged in gunfire\" close to the Eid al-Fitr celebration.\nNo one was killed in the shooting, the commissioner emphasised.\nHe said that the shooting occurred between \"two factions\" at the outdoor event where 1,000 people were present. \nAn adult was hit in the exchange of gunfire, the police official said, and a 15-year-old suspect was shot in the leg and shoulder by police. \nThe teenaged gunman is in stable condition and was taken to hospital, said Mr Bethel. \nHe also noted that a third person appeared at a nearby hospital with a gunshot wound to his hand, though it was not immediately clear whether the person was involved in the gun battle. \nAuthorities have recovered five weapons that they suspect were involved in the shooting.\nOne child pedestrian was hit by a police vehicle while fleeing the scene and suffered a broken leg, Mr Bethel said.\n\"Ninety-nine percent of the individuals at this event are good people who wanted to have a good time,\" the commissioner said.

    "Russia has said the situation is \"very, very tense\" as floodwaters continue to rise in the city of Orenburg and surrounding areas.\n\"Large amounts of water are coming to new regions,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned on Wednesday.\nThe flooding is being described as the worst to hit the region in 80 years.\nWater levels in the Ural river near Orenburg rose to over 10m (33ft) on Wednesday, Ria news agency reported, well above its bursting point.\nThousands of people have had to flee their homes in southern Russia, while officials in neighbouring Kazakhstan say the number of evacuees there has risen to 97,000.\nLast week, several rivers - including the Ural, Europe's third-largest - burst their banks after rapidly melting snow and ice caused them to swell.\nThe Ural flows through the city of Orsk, on to Orenburg, into Kazakhstan and then on to the Caspian Sea. Floodwaters are threatening several areas of northern Kazakhstan and many dams and reservoirs are filled to capacity.\nEntire villages have been engulfed by overflowing rivers. As many as 2,000 homes have been flooded in Orenburg, where water levels have surpassed the critical level of 9.3m and still rising. The city has a population of 550,000 and lies about 1,500km (930 miles) south-east of Moscow. \n\"So far, the forecast is not favourable. The water level continues to rise,\" Mr Peskov said, adding that a \"large amount\" of floodwater would soon also reach the nearby regions of Kurgan and Tyumen. \nMr Peskov added that the situation \"of course requires the most energetic efforts from government officials at all levels to help people\".\nHe said President Vladimir Putin was not intending to visit the flood zone and said the Russian leader was instead \"getting information and co-ordinated the work of all branches of authorities\".\nOrsk, about 300km (180 miles) downstream from Orenburg, was flooded when water burst through a dam embankment. Authorities there say the situation is now stable.\nEarlier this week in Orsk, angry flood victims shouted '\"Shame on you!\" at local officials, in response to low compensation offers and officials' perceived failure to prevent the dam from bursting. \nThey also chanted, \"Putin help us\" - a reminder that in Russia, in times of trouble, very often the president is the last person people blame for their problems. On the contrary, they look to the Kremlin for help.\nFlooding often happens in Russia when winter transitions to spring. But there has been nothing on this scale in living memory.\nNorth Kazakhstan regional leader Gauez Nurmukhambetov has warned that a \"huge flow\" of water is heading to the city of Petropavl, with a population of 200,000.\n\"Once again, I emphasise, huge!\" he said.",
    " \"Things are dangerous right now. Death can come from anywhere,\" Paul tells us. Small, skinny and about 30 years old, he is a member of one of Ecuador's most violent criminal gangs.\nHe believes he has been on a rival group's hit list for a year and a half and the only reason he is still alive is thanks to his mother's prayers: \"It's like God doesn't want me up above, and the devil won't take me down below.\"\nPaul (not his real name) explains he has spent about half of his life in the gang. Like many, he joined young, when he was 15. He thought it was going to be all \"raves, parties, and girls\".\nAs we talk, we drive around Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city. Paul is afraid that if he stays still too long, his enemies from rival gangs - which are waging a bloody turf war - will catch up with him. So we keep moving to make it harder for anyone to follow us.\n\"I wanted respect,\" he says about his reasons for joining one of the up to 20 gangs which have contributed to the violence that has changed the face of Ecuador. \nUntil recently considered one of the safest countries in the region, Ecuador, which is also the gateway to the Galapagos Islands and home to the rainforest, attracted many tourists.\nBut now it has the highest recorded murder rate in Latin America.\nIn 2023, police recorded about 8,000 violent deaths. That is eight times more than in 2018 and puts Ecuador ahead of countries like Mexico and Colombia.\nIn January, Ecuador made headlines around the world when a TV station was taken over by armed masked men during a live broadcast. At the same time, gangs carried out kidnappings and set off explosions in multiple cities, and prisoners rioted in jails.\nPresident Daniel Noboa, who had been sworn in just two months earlier, declared a state of emergency. Since then, police have arrested more than 16,000 people. \nThe state of emergency ended on Monday, but the president maintained a state of \"internal armed conflict\", with the military retaining exceptional powers.\nHe wants to introduce further measures such as stricter gun controls and tougher prison sentences. These will be put to a vote in a referendum on 21 April. \nThere is no doubt that the lives of many Ecuadoreans have changed due to the rise in gang violence.\nDr Gabriela Almeida says she is seeing \"more and more patients with anxiety, and people who are suffering from panic attacks\".\nDr Almeida herself avoids going out at night. \"There was a kidnapping near here, four blocks away,\" she explains. \n\"When I was a teenager, I remember seeing what was going on in Colombia,\" she says of the neighbouring country's drug-related violence.  \n\"We never thought anything like that could happen in our country,\" she says, adding that she is considering emigrating to Spain because in Ecuador \"we're living a nightmare\".\nMuch of that nightmare has been fuelled by the growth of the drugs trade.\nWorldwide production and consumption of cocaine have reached record levels, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. \nBetween 2020 and 2021 alone, cocaine production shot up by nearly a third and international drug cartels began looking for new routes through which to smuggle the cocaine produced in Colombia and Peru.\nEcuador, which is sandwiched between Peru and Colombia and whose authorities lacked experience in fighting trafficking, was seen as the perfect option.\nAs a result, Ecuador has been transformed into a global distribution hub, where drugs are stored, prepared for transit - often hidden inside shipping containers - and sent out to their final destination. \nGangs like the one Paul is part of play a key role. \nPaul tells us that he shifted from dealing relatively small quantities of drugs to trafficking kilogrammes of cocaine. He says his new role consisted of hiding illegal drugs among other products inside shipping containers.\nNinety per cent of illegal drugs leaving Ecuador are hidden inside shipping containers departing the port of Guayaquil, according to Ecuador's coastguard.\nThe coastguard has stepped up its surveillance but it says the risk for its staff has increased, too. \n\"In the past, we were dealing with common criminals. Now, anyone we see could have high-calibre weapons,\" one of the coastguard commanders tells us, as we join his team on a boat patrolling the port and surrounding areas.\nHe does not want us to reveal his name for fear of reprisals from the gangs and wears a grey balaclava to hide his face.\nHis armed team carries out up to four patrols a day, looking for gang members who use small boats to try to hide drugs in containers stacked on the huge ships.\nThe commander says that they have been hampered by corruption in the past and Paul confirms that the gang used to pay off someone in the port to turn the security cameras away at key moments so gang members could carry out their illicit activities undetected.  \nFor Paul, more drug trafficking meant \"more money, better weapons\". But it also unleashed bloody turf wars between rival gan",
    "Tesco has said price pressures on grocers have eased as it reported bumper sales and profits for the past year.\nThe UK's biggest supermarket chain said pre-tax profits hit \u00a32.3bn, up from \u00a3882m, while sales rose by 4.4% to \u00a368.2bn in the year to 24 February.\nThe company said price inflation in groceries had \"lessened substantially\".\nHowever, its boss Ken Murphy said the firm was conscious \"things were still difficult for many customers\".\nTesco had \"worked hard\" to cut prices, he said, and \"doubled down\" on schemes aimed at offering shoppers better value for money, such as its Aldi Price Match offer and Clubcard promotions.\nMore than 4,000 products were cheaper at the end of the year than at the start, with an average price cut of about 12%, the firm said. \nMr Murphy said he expected food inflation - which measures the rate at which food prices rise over time - to stabilise in the \"low single digits for the rest of the year\".\nHowever, he said that the cost increases seen across select items like cocoa, potatoes and coffee might prove \"sticky\".\nThe chain also came in for criticism from the Unite union. General secretary Sharon Graham said Tesco was \"raking in mountains of cash while families struggle to put food on the table because of sky high prices\".\nTesco has more than 330,000 employees and a 27.3% share of the grocery market, which Mr Murphy said was growing as customers \"respond to the improvements we've made to the value and quality of our products\". \nHe told reporters on Wednesday that shoppers were also sticking to habits they had taken on over the last two years as the cost of living soared.\n\"I do think there is a little bit more now of a habit of eating in and entertaining in and then treating yourself,\" he said.\nLike-for-like food sales, which strip out the effect of new shops opening, were up by 7.7% in the UK, with consumers opting for premium ranges like Tesco Finest and meat-free ready meals to treat themselves at home.\nWhile home and clothing sales were flat as the retailer stopped offering big-ticket electrical items, it said that womenswear had held up well.\nGlobal retail analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence Charles Allen told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the company had done a \"lot of work\" to keep up with its rivals such as German discounters Aldi and Lidl.\nHe said that the results were \"broadly in line\" with expectations, though \"just a shade weaker than anticipated\".\nHe said things would not get any easier for the retailer during the coming year as increasing staff bills would take effect just as inflation was slowing down.\nThis meant \"you haven't got the same sales boost\" from higher prices, he said, adding that the company would need to focus on selling a higher number of items.\nAsked what Tesco was doing to hang on to new customers, Mr Allen said \"mostly it's been very price competitive\".\nIt had also \"worked away at its costs\". For example, he said they were taking specialist counters out of the shops, which cut costs and enables it to be \"attractive to a wider group of consumers\".\nIn the year ahead, the supermarket was still, however, continuing on its cost-cutting drive, aiming for \u00a3500m in savings in the year ahead.\nIt also confirmed that it would have to spend in the \"mid to high single digit\" millions on changing its Clubcard price signs in shops after losing a long legal battle with rival Lidl over the logos.\nLike many other retailers, it will also face a higher wage bill as a higher minimum wage has come in and it joined other retailers in increasing pay overall in a bid to retain staff.\nRead more tips here",
    "Lady Gaga is seen bringing the music, dance and a very bad romance to the Joker film sequel in its first trailer.\nThe singer and actress plays a new version of Harley Quinn in Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux opposite Joaquin Phoenix, who won an Oscar for the original movie.\nThe pair seemingly meet and fall in love in Arkham Asylum before apparently escaping and forming a musical duo.\nDirector Todd Phillips said it isn't a musical, as had been rumoured, but that music is \"an essential element\".\nPhoenix won an Oscar for best actor for his performance in 2019's Joker.\nHere are seven things of note from the sequel's trailer.\nArthur Fleck (aka Joker) and Harley Quinn's eyes appear to meet as she takes part in a singing group in Arkham Asylum, where he was left at the end of the 2019 film.\nHer origin story is as a psychiatrist at the institution who is obsessed with the failed comedian and \"crown prince of crime\" - but here, she could be a fellow inmate. It's not quite clear which side of the bars she's on. \n\"It seems to confirm a massive shift in Harley Quinn's origin story,\" wrote IGN's Alex Stedman, \"as it appears to show her as a patient in Arkham Asylum rather than as a psychiatrist\".\n\"Long gone, it seems, are the days of Dr Harleen Quinzel.\"\nBut if she is working rather than residing there, that might help explain how she can help him escape.\n\"Let's get outta here,\" she whispers, before the pair are seen in a fantasy rooftop dance sequence.\nThat abruptly cuts to a gritty Gotham City street, where they continue their carefree dance as emergency vehicles rush in the direction of whatever chaos they have just caused.\n\"We use music to make us whole - to balance the fractures within ourselves,\" the title character is heard saying in voiceover.\nJoker has found a partner in love and crime, but also music. In one clip, they perform as Joker & Harley on a TV show, complete with full band and backing singers.\nThe trailer is soundtracked by What the World Needs Now Is Love, made famous in 1965 by Jackie DeShannon.\n\"I like to say it's a movie where music is an essential element,\" Phillips told CinemaCon on Tuesday, when asked whether this is a musical.\n\"To me that doesn't veer too far from the first film,\" he said, adding that in that original film, \"Arthur has music in him. He has a grace to him.\"\nIndeed, one of the most famous scenes from the first film was where Joker danced down a flight of stone steps. In the new trailer, Harley is seen walking up those same steps. \nIn another snippet, she and Joker mimic his original dance as they go down what look like courthouse steps, with cheering crowds on either side.\nThankfully, there's no Gary Glitter music this time.\nAt another point, Harley, wearing a white wedding dress and veil, dances down an aisle to a chapel, where Joker is waiting in a white suit, apparently accompanied by backing singers as bridesmaids.\nThis is, however, one of several fantasy sequences that are reminiscent of classic Hollywood movie musicals.\nThat led one person on X to say it looks like 2016 musical La La Land, but for \"people who hear voices\".\nThe British comedian and actor pops up in the trailer as some sort of authority figure who asks Arthur/Joker: \"What's changed?\"\n\"I'll tell you what's changed - I'm not alone any more,\" he replies.\nCoogan's appearance led some to hope for a repeat of a line by his most famous character, Alan Partridge, when he declared: \"I'm Batman!\" Which really would be a plot twist.\nAfter causing mass mayhem, with riots on the streets, an explosion in a packed room with TV cameras (the same studio as their performance?), and Joker and Harley running hand-in-hand out of a flaming building, the trailer ends quietly with Harley apparently visiting Arthur in prison.\nUsing her red lipstick, she draws a curved line on the glass between them and tells him: \"I want to see the real you.\"\nPhoenix's glum face slowly shifts and breaks into a big smile, which aligns with the now out-of-focus lipstick to suddenly become Joker's famous red face paint.\nA masterful shot which we hope took several hundred attempts to perfect, rather than having the lipstick digitally added in post-production.\nThe trailer actually ends with the release date - 10.04.24 - which means it's out TODAY! Hurrah!\nOh, wait. Americans write their days and months the wrong way around. So we'll actually have until 4 October.",
    "An insurance fraudster who exaggerated injuries from a car accident was caught after being seen running on a TV show.\nPatricia Rogers, 25, from Barnsley, claimed damages worth \u00a3492,141 from her insurer after the crash in 2014. \nShe claimed she could not walk unaided, but was seen running across the stage on the Jeremy Kyle show in 2017.\nAfter she admitted fraud, Rogers was given a 12-month jail term, suspended for 18 months, at Sheffield Crown Court on Tuesday.\nShe was also ordered to pay \u00a3500 in compensation.\nAt the same court, she had earlier admitted fraud by false representation after the case was referred to City of London Police's insurance fraud enforcement department. \nPolice said Rogers' insurer, NFU Mutual, had gathered surveillance which showed she was able to walk unaided for an extensive period of time. \nThe company recorded the footage on 26 April 2021, after it found inconsistencies in the medical reports that Rogers had submitted to support her claim. \nIn one report, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon wrote that he was unable to explain Rogers' condition and concluded it was either grossly exaggerated or due to an underlying psychological condition.\nThe surveillance footage, which showed Rogers on the way to a medical appointment, revealed she had travelled there in a taxi, going to the car with a walking stick hanging from her arm, but she walked into the medical centre leaning heavily on the stick.\nDuring the appointment, she alleged that her back pain stopped her from standing up for more than 10 minutes at a time and that she could only walk with a stick or crutches.\nHowever, City of London Police said that footage from earlier that day showed Rogers walking her two dogs for about 40 minutes with no obvious discomfort, and she was also walking while holding the stick without using it for support.\nShe told officers from the force's insurance fraud enforcement department that she could not hold the dogs' leads as well as a walking stick.\nWhen police showed Rogers footage of her walking, standing and running unaided on the Jeremy Kyle show, she said she had been able to walk around the set because she was feeling angry and was distracted from the pain.\nBefore being axed by ITV in 2019, the programme often featured disputes between partners and family members which Mr Kyle attempted to resolve on stage - regularly using lie detectors.\nDet Con Carley Parodi, from City of London Police, said: \"Rogers took advantage of a genuine car accident and, for almost a decade, kept up the pretence it had a substantial effect on her life.\n\"There was a huge difference between Rogers' ability to carry out her day-to-day activities in the surveillance footage and the serious impact of the accident as she described during her medical appointments.\"\nDet Con Parodi added that it was \"astounding\" Rogers had told medical professionals she could not walk unaided, but then appeared on national television \"doing just that\".\n\"Rogers thought she could convince medical professionals and the insurer using methods such as going to her medical appointments with a walking stick.\"\nThe sentence given to Rogers \"should serve as a reminder that, however clever you think you are being, committing insurance fraud will have repercussions\", Det Con Parodi said.\nRichard Turnell, claims specialist at NFU Mutual, said: \"Fraud of this kind is a crime which can and does have a real impact on innocent people and ultimately impacts premiums.  \n\"We are determined to continue to protect our members from third party insurance fraud and we will continue to work with [police] to hold criminals to account for their actions.\" \nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "Part of an LNER train dating back to the 1930s which was discovered by archaeologists in Belgium last month is exceptionally rare, experts have said.\nThe red storage wagon, used for transporting belongings when people moved house, was unearthed in Antwerp.\nAfter the discovery of the wooden truck, archaeologists said it was a \"mystery\" how it had ended up there.\nYork-based LNER has now confirmed the wagon was one of the firm's rare first models dating back nearly 100 years.\nThe vehicle was found in March by a team from the Urban Archaeology department of the City of Antwerp.\nIt was buried near the wall of a 19th Century fortress known as the Northern Citadel.\nThe archaeologists had been excavating the area as part of work with organisations building a new ring road around the city. \nLNER said that since the initial discovery, internal research into the truck suggested it was the first model of wagon which was briefly in service with the firm in about 1930.\nIt was particularly rare because, at the time, the company used blue wagons - while the new discovery was red. \nAntwerp archaeologist Femke Martens said closer examination of the wagon showed the only features identifying it were several inscriptions, including the letters \"LNER\".\nMr Martens said other inscriptions included one stating \"furniture removal to house\", another which read \"enquire at any station\", and a third, \"BK769\", which identified its size and what it was used for.\nHe confirmed that the wagon was \"thought to be around 100 years old\".\n\"It's a mystery as to how the carriage came to be in Antwerp, and unfortunately there's very little left of the relic as it disintegrated while being excavated. \nStuart Thomas, LNER communications director, said: \"This curious find has certainly generated lots of interest.\"\n\"We are delighted the team from the Urban Archaeology department of the City of Antwerp have helped shed more light on the discovery,\" he added.\n\"We're fascinated by LNER's history, and we'd like to thank the team for their help in unearthing more information about LNER's proud past.\" \nTrain services run by LNER, or London and North Eastern Railway, started operating in January 1923 on what later became known as the East Coast Mainline.\nThe LNER name returned in June 2018 after previous operator Virgin Trains East Coast returned the franchise to the government. \nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "Belfast's York Street Interchange road project could take another 11 years to complete, a Stormont assembly committee has heard.\nIt was first commissioned in 2007 to address a traffic bottleneck between the Westlink, M2 and M3 - three of Northern Ireland's busiest roads.\nInfrastructure Minister John O'Dowd said in a letter that the project was \"not progressing at present\".\nFuture works would depend on available budgets, his department said.\nThe project is estimated to cost between \u00a3120m and \u00a3165m, with almost \u00a324m spent so far.\nIt was included in the New Decade New Approach Agreement which led to the restoration of devolved government in 2020.\nSecuring funding for it was part of a confidence and supply agreement in 2017 between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and then Prime Minister Theresa May.\nBut work on the project has been held up due to issues including a successful legal challenge to the tendering process.\nAn external review was commissioned in 2020 by former infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon, who later asked for a further review to consider \"place-making and active travel\" within the plans.\nIn a letter to the infrastructure committee, seen by BBC News NI, Mr O'Dowd said the road scheme was \"not progressing at present\".\nHe said that \"whenever it does progress again\", there could be a two-year public inquiry, further development work lasting \"at least five years, followed by four years of construction period\".\nThe letter was raised at the committee on Wednesday by DUP assembly member Deborah Erskine, chair of the infrastructure committee.\nShe said it seemed \"to indicate that it's stalled and would be another 11 years before completion once it's restarted\".\nMrs Erskine described it as \"highly disappointing and very frustrating\" and said she intended to write to the minister.\n\"I would like to see where the funding has went so far in relation to the development - get a proper breakdown in relation to the costs,\" she told the committee.\n\"Eleven years is crazy.\"\nA Department for Infrastructure spokeswoman said major road schemes were an \"important part of the work that is delivered by the department as we seek to reduce journey times, increase reliability and improve road safety\".\n\"Some ongoing work to investigate place-making and active travel opportunities as part of the York Street Interchange scheme is now almost complete and will be with the minister in the coming weeks for his consideration.\n\"When that work is completed development work on the scheme will be paused in accordance with the department's prioritised list of major road schemes which were published on 14 August 2023.\n\"Schemes to be placed on a future major works programme will be informed by the department's emerging transport plans and available budgets.\"",

    "The price of a UK passport will rise on Thursday, for the second time in just over 14 months. \nThe cost of applying online to get a new or renewed adult passport will go up from \u00a382.50 to \u00a388.50 from midnight.\nThis 7% rise follows a 9% rise in February 2023. Consumer group Which? said travellers due to renew would \"likely be shocked\" by the hike.\nThe Home Office said it did not make a profit from the applications and the fee rise would help improve services. \nWhich? Travel expert Guy Hobbs said: \"If you've been meaning to renew your passport, today is your last opportunity to beat the price hikes.\"\nThe cost of applying for a child's passport online is also going up from \u00a353.50 to \u00a357.50. If you apply by post the price rises from \u00a364 to \u00a369.\nA postal application for an adult passport will rise from \u00a393 to \u00a3100.\nIt costs more if you apply from abroad, or if you require a passport urgently. Passports are free for people born on or before 2 September 1929. \nPrior to last year's rise, passport fees had not gone up for five years and a standard adult online application cost \u00a375.50. \nThe Post Office, meanwhile, said its \"check and send\" service will still be on offer for \u00a316.\nMr Hobbs at Which? said: \"The cost of renewing a passport has jumped significantly in the last few years, with this latest price hike following hot on the heels of a hefty 9% rise just last year.\"\nHe added: \"While these price rises may well reflect rising production or processing costs, the UK passport is now amongst the priciest in Europe.\"\nThe online cost of an \u00a388.50 UK passport is among the most expensive in Europe. The UK comes in behind countries like Switzerland (\u00a3122), Denmark (\u00a3103) and Italy (\u00a399.50). The cost of a US passport, meanwhile, is \u00a3103.\nOne reader called Ian told the BBC: \"The quality of these new passports is shocking.

The starting point with any price increase - and this is 16 percentage points over 14 months - should be what are you doing to make the service better.\"\nIn the aftermath of the Covid pandemic hundreds of thousands of people were affected by passport processing delays, with many experiencing travel disruptions. Some 360,000 customers waited more than 10 weeks to receive their passports in the first nine months of 2022, the National Audit Office found.\nMr James said: \"The Passport Office has struggled with meeting its basic obligations, so many users will question what they are getting for their money.\"\nAnother reader, Hugh from Cheshire, however, told the BBC that he applied online and got his renewal within a week. \"It lasts me for 10 years, so just \u00a38.25 per year.\"\nThe Home Office said the higher overall fees would go towards the cost of delivering passports and reduce the reliance on funding from tax.\nSeparately, holidaymakers travelling to the EU are being warned not to get caught out by the \"passport 10-year rule\". UK travellers used to be able to carry up to nine months from an old passport over on to a new one. But post-Brexit, EU countries will not accept passports issued more than 10 years ago. Up to 32 million people applied for passports before the new rules, but it is unknown how many have been affected.\nTravel association ABTA on Wednesday reminded travellers to follow existing rules for airport security regarding liquids and hand luggage.

    "The Arizona Supreme court has ruled that the state can enforce a 160-year-old near-total abortion ban.\nThe 1864 law - which precedes Arizona becoming a state - makes abortion punishable by two to five years in prison, except when the mother's life is at risk. \nThe ruling could shutter all clinics in the state, and affect both women's healthcare and the coming election.\nArizona voters may be able to undo the ruling in a November referendum.\nThe decision follows months of legal wrangling about whether the pre-statehood law could be enforced after years of dormancy. Many argued it had been effectively nullified by decades of state legislation, including a 2022 law that allows abortions until 15 weeks of pregnancy. \nArizona's top court agreed to review the case in August 2023 after a right-wing legal advocacy group, Alliance Defending Freedom, appealed against a lower court ruling that said the more recent law should stand. \nIn a 4-2 ruling on Tuesday, the state supreme court overturned that decision. It said the 1864 law was \"now enforceable\" because there were no federal or state protections for the procedure. \nThe Alliance Defending Freedom joined anti-abortion activists in celebrating the decision, saying the \"significant\" ruling would \"protect the lives of countless, innocent unborn children\". \nArizona's Supreme Court delayed enforcement of the law for 14 days, and the justices sent the case back to a lower court to hear further arguments. \nBut it remains unclear how the law will be enforced. \nGovernor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, issued an executive order last year that placed the matter of enforcing abortion law in the hands of state attorney general Kris Mayes - a fellow Democrat who has promised that Arizonans will not be prosecuted for getting or performing an abortion. \nMs Mayes reiterated that promise on Tuesday, calling the law \"draconian\".\n\"Today's decision to reimpose a law from when Arizona wasn't a state, the Civil War was raging, and women couldn't even vote will go down in history as a stain on our state,\" she said, criticism that was soon echoed by the White House and other leading Democrats. \nSome Arizona Republicans also expressed concerns about the ruling. \nKari Lake, a close ally of Donald Trump and a Republican candidate for the state's seat in the US Senate, said she opposed the decision.\nShe called on Governor Hobbs and the state legislature to find a \"common sense solution\". \nRuben Gallego, Ms Lake's Democratic opponent, noted Ms Lake had previously supported the ban, pointing to a 2022 interview where she called the 1864 law \"great\".  \n\"Today's ruling is devastating for Arizona women and their families,\" Mr Gallego added.\nThe owner of one abortion clinic in Phoenix said the state was \"stepping back in time\". Gabrielle Goodwick, of Camelback Family Planning, told the BBC that the move would affect \"marginalised populations\" the most.\nAbortion access - which is broadly supported among the American public - has helped Democrats overperform in local and state elections since the US Supreme Court overturned a landmark legal decision that protected reproductive rights nationwide. \nThe issue is now expected to influence election results again in November, with Democrats hoping the issue gives them a boost in battleground states like Arizona.\nTuesday's ruling will certainly raise the stakes for a state ballot initiative that aims to protect abortion rights until 24 weeks of pregnancy. \nActivists in the state say they have already met the signature threshold required to put the question to voters this autumn.\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, the head of anti-abortion group Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America, indicated she would work to defeat the referendum, and hailed an \"enormous victory\" following the state supreme court's decision. \nIn the almost two years since Roe was overturned, activists who support widening abortion access have won all seven ballot initiatives related to the issue, even in Republican-controlled states.\nLast week, Florida's Supreme Court gave the green light to another abortion referendum. If approved, Florida voters would overturn the state's six-week ban and enshrine broad abortion access in the state's constitution.",

I started crying and stopped singing,\" she said.\n\"Someone had a go at them and told them to move but I put my stuff away at that point because I couldn't carry on.\"\nThe 17-year-old said incidents like that have had a negative impact on her mental health and she has experienced \"mini panic attacks\" before performing.\nShe added: \"I've now got really, really bad anxiety when I go busking and if I see a group of people I get nervous thinking it's going to happen again.\"\nWillow's mum, Chrissy, said her daughter's experiences mean she \"worries\" every time she visits the city centre to sing.\nShe said: \"That's my little girl there feeling really unsafe and uncomfortable.

He's a people-carrier for my family, he's a campervan for adventures and holidays, and he is also a crane,\" he said.\nClean Ocean Sailing has collected more than 70 tonnes of waste since it started in 2017.\nCecil grabs dumpy bags using a home-made crane made of scaffolding poles and takes them by trailer to a recycling plant in Exeter.\nVolunteer crews of rubbish collectors travel to the beaches of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly on Mr Green's boat Annie, a traditional sailing boat, which is itself more than 100 years old.\nThe campervan also has a winch and tow hook in front to haul ghost gear or discarded fishing nets from beaches.\nCecil had been a shuttle bus for airport travellers between Canberra and Sydney before Mr Green bought him for AUD $400 (\u00a3208).\n\"He's approaching 14 times round the clock, which is about 900,000 miles (1.4m km) which, I think, as far as I can find out, is the highest mileage one of these in the world,\" he said.\nCecil was a serious gas guzzler, so, on arriving in the UK, his engine was swapped for a diesel which runs on waste chip fat oil from locals pubs and cafes.\n\"It's a two-way relationship,\" said Mr Green.\n\"The number of hours fixing Cecil and the number of hours driving him are probably similar.\n\"He's definitely an expression of my optimism.\"\nHe said his view was that keeping an old car was better for the environment because it cut out the carbon footprint of manufacturing a new one.\n\"He's been going 52 years and I can't see why he can't last another 52,\" he said.\n\"We're just going to keep on cutting the rust out and keep him going as he is.

    "Five Australian women who were strip-searched and invasively examined at Doha airport have failed in their bid to sue Qatar Airways.\nThey and other women were ordered off a flight and checked for whether they had given birth after a baby was found abandoned in an airport bin in 2020.\nThe incident sparked public outrage and it was condemned by several nations.\nAn Australian court found the state-owned airline could not be prosecuted under the laws governing global travel.\nThe five women filed a claim in the Federal Court of Australia in 2021, seeking damages over the alleged \"unlawful physical contact\" and false imprisonment, which had caused mental health impacts including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Other passengers - including from the UK and New Zealand - were not part of the lawsuit.\nBut on Wednesday, Justice John Halley found that Qatar Airways could not be held responsible under a multilateral treaty called the Montreal Convention, which is used to establish airline liability in the event of death or injury to passengers.\nHe also found that the airline's staff could not have influenced the actions of Qatari police who removed the women from the flight, nor the nurses who examined them in ambulances on the tarmac.\nThat proposition \"can fairly be characterised as 'fanciful, trifling, implausible, improbable, tenuous'\", the judgment said.\nJustice Halley also struck out the women's case against Qatar's aviation regulator, saying it was immune from foreign prosecution.\nHowever he said they could pursue their claim against a subsidiary of Qatar Airlines called Matar, which is contracted to run Hamad International Airport.\nThey will be able to argue they were owed a duty of care by Matar employees, who they allege failed to prevent the invasive searches.\nThe women have previously told the BBC they did not consent to the examinations and were not given explanations for what was happening to them.\n\"I felt like I had been raped,\" said British grandmother Mandy, who asked to withhold her surname.\nAnother said she thought she was being kidnapped and held hostage.\nAt the time, Qatari officials said the abandoned baby was being cared for, and Prime Minister Khalid bin Khalifa bin Abdulaziz Al Thani tweeted: \"We regret the unacceptable treatment of the female passengers... What took place does not reflect Qatar's laws or values.\"\nThe Gulf launched a criminal prosecution which led to a suspended jail term for an airport official. \nBut lawyer Damian Sturzaker in 2021 told the BBC the women were suing because of a perceived lack of action from Doha.\nThey wanted a formal apology from Qatar and for the airport to change its procedures to make sure the incident does not happen again. \n\"By speaking up, we want to ensure that no woman is ever subjected to the demoralising, horrendous treatment we were subjected to,\" one of the women told the BBC.",

    "A father and son have been jailed for more than two years for selling \"useless\" sanitiser during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nWilliam Irving, 69, and Alexander Irving, 35, claimed their product was \"effective against coronavirus\".\nThe pair sold almost 25,000 bottles, but customers raised concerns with Trading Standards.\nThey pleaded guilty to fraudulent trading offences in January 2023, and were sentenced at Bristol Crown Court on Monday.\nThe Irvings, both of both of Woodend Lane, Hill, South Gloucestershire, ran Aquatic Chemicals Limited (ACL) from a unit at Woodlands Farm near Berkeley where, in March 2020, they began to produce and sell hand sanitiser. \nIt sold for up to \u00a310 per 100ml, with the company making at least \u00a395,000 in just two weeks amid an unparalleled demand for the product. \nThe pair claimed that the product contained 70% alcohol, could \"kill 99% of germs\" and was \"effective against coronavirus\", as well as indicating that it had been laboratory tested by the World Health Organisation, according to South Gloucestershire Council. \nBut Trading Standards soon began to receive complaints from customers raising suspicions that the sanitiser may be fake, and did not smell of alcohol. \nThe council said its Trading Standards team initially tried to engage with the pair, but launched a criminal investigation after they refused to cooperate. \nCustomers who had brought the product, including a charity and a housing association, were contacted and more than 1,300 bottled were removed from sale. \nTesting of product samples showed that the majority of bottles contained just 1% alcohol, far lower than the 60% required to meet effectiveness requirements.\nProfessor Primrose Freestone, associate professor in clinical microbiology at the University of Leicester, further analysed the samples and said the product was \"useless\" as a hand sanitiser. \nWilliam Irving William attempted to convince Trading Standards that the sanitiser had been produced by an unidentified individual who had rented a unit from him at his premises but had left it there, so he simply decided to sell it.\nThe Irvings were prosecuted for fraudulent trading offences under the Companies Act by South Gloucestershire Council and initially both pleaded guilty to them at Bristol Crown Court in January 2023, but later applied to the court to withdraw their pleas, claiming they had been under pressure to plea guilty. \nBoth applications failed in February 2024. \nJailing the Irvings to two years and two months each on Monday, judge Michael Cullum said the pair clearly knew the product was not as they claimed it to be, but had persisted in \"preying on public fears\".\nShaun Fudge, service manager for Trading Standards at South Gloucestershire Council, said The Irvings \"blatantly profiteered from a \u2018useless\u2019 product\".\nThe two will also face another hearing under the Proceeds of Crime Act, to take place on 1 July 2024.

    "The Arizona Supreme court has ruled that the state can enforce a 160-year-old near-total abortion ban.\nThe 1864 law - which precedes Arizona becoming a state - makes abortion punishable by two to five years in prison, except when the mother's life is at risk. \nThe ruling could shutter all clinics in the state, and affect both women's healthcare and the coming election.\nArizona voters may be able to undo the ruling in a November referendum.\nThe decision follows months of legal wrangling about whether the pre-statehood law could be enforced after years of dormancy. Many argued it had been effectively nullified by decades of state legislation, including a 2022 law that allows abortions until 15 weeks of pregnancy. \nArizona's top court agreed to review the case in August 2023 after a right-wing legal advocacy group, Alliance Defending Freedom, appealed against a lower court ruling that said the more recent law should stand. \nIn a 4-2 ruling on Tuesday, the state supreme court overturned that decision. It said the 1864 law was \"now enforceable\" because there were no federal or state protections for the procedure. \nThe Alliance Defending Freedom joined anti-abortion activists in celebrating the decision, saying the \"significant\" ruling would \"protect the lives of countless, innocent unborn children\". \nArizona's Supreme Court delayed enforcement of the law for 14 days, and the justices sent the case back to a lower court to hear further arguments. \nBut it remains unclear how the law will be enforced. \nGovernor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, issued an executive order last year that placed the matter of enforcing abortion law in the hands of state attorney general Kris Mayes - a fellow Democrat who has promised that Arizonans will not be prosecuted for getting or performing an abortion. \nMs Mayes reiterated that promise on Tuesday, calling the law \"draconian\".\n\"Today's decision to reimpose a law from when Arizona wasn't a state, the Civil War was raging, and women couldn't even vote will go down in history as a stain on our state,\" she said, criticism that was soon echoed by the White House and other leading Democrats. \nSome Arizona Republicans also expressed concerns about the ruling. \nKari Lake, a close ally of Donald Trump and a Republican candidate for the state's seat in the US Senate, said she opposed the decision.\nShe called on Governor Hobbs and the state legislature to find a \"common sense solution\". \nRuben Gallego, Ms Lake's Democratic opponent, noted Ms Lake had previously supported the ban, pointing to a 2022 interview where she called the 1864 law \"great\".  \n\"Today's ruling is devastating for Arizona women and their families,\" Mr Gallego added.\nThe owner of one abortion clinic in Phoenix said the state was \"stepping back in time\". Gabrielle Goodwick, of Camelback Family Planning, told the BBC that the move would affect \"marginalised populations\" the most.\nAbortion access - which is broadly supported among the American public - has helped Democrats overperform in local and state elections since the US Supreme Court overturned a landmark legal decision that protected reproductive rights nationwide. \nThe issue is now expected to influence election results again in November, with Democrats hoping the issue gives them a boost in battleground states like Arizona.\nTuesday's ruling will certainly raise the stakes for a state ballot initiative that aims to protect abortion rights until 24 weeks of pregnancy. \nActivists in the state say they have already met the signature threshold required to put the question to voters this autumn.\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, the head of anti-abortion group Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America, indicated she would work to defeat the referendum, and hailed an \"enormous victory\" following the state supreme court's decision. \nIn the almost two years since Roe was overturned, activists who support widening abortion access have won all seven ballot initiatives related to the issue, even in Republican-controlled states.\nLast week, Florida's Supreme Court gave the green light to another abortion referendum. If approved, Florida voters would overturn the state's six-week ban and enshrine broad abortion access in the state's constitution.",

    "Scientists are to double match blood intended for use for kidney transplant patients in a bid to make sure their donated kidney is less likely to be rejected.\nIf the six-month pilot scheme at Hammersmith Hospital in London is a success then the initiative could be rolled out nationally, the NHS said.\nBlood will be matched by type and as close as possible to white blood cells.\nNHS Blood and Transplant said it was hoped to \"improve patient outcomes\".\nAbout two in five kidney transplant patients need blood transfusions, figures show.\nAfter transfusion some patients make antibodies. If these are directed to the newly donated kidney, this can increase chances of organ rejection.\nThe NHS hopes that by matching white blood cell type - also known as tissue type or HLA type - as close as possible between the blood donor and the organ transplant patient, it will mean the patient is less likely to reject the \"foreign\" organ.\nThe blood will be matched at a specialist laboratory in Colindale, north-west London, and it will be supplied for transplant patients at Hammersmith Hospital, part of Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust.\nNHS Blood and Transplant consultant clinical scientist Dr Colin Brown said it was an \"innovative\" pilot programme.\n\"Each year, around 1,000 kidney patients who are transplanted will also receive a transfusion,\" he said.\n\"If all of them could benefit from a successful transfusion programme and a wider roll-out, our models show 100 kidney transplants a year could be saved.\"\nAlisha Gorkani, from Sidcup, south London, has juvenile nephronophthisis and has spent seven years waiting for a matching kidney transplant.\nThe 25-year-old has developed antibodies from a mix of blood transfusions and a past kidney transplant.\n\"I have a lot of antibodies so I could be waiting a very long time. I try to make the best of things but waiting for a kidney and being on dialysis is incredibly hard,\" she said.\n\"It does give me hope that people like me could have better matched blood in the future. There are thousands of people hoping for a miracle match.\"\nGemma Louis, from Chester-le-Street in County Durham, has waited 11 years for a kidney transplant because of \"sensitisation from a blood transfusion\".\nMs Louis, 44, said: \"It's harder to find a match which won't be rejected. \n\"I was told initially my wait would be twice as long as normal, so around six years. I am 11 years in now.\"\nAt the end of March, 5,870 people in the UK were on the kidney transplant waiting list.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A judge in New York has sentenced the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization to five months in prison on two counts of perjury.\nAllen Weisselberg, 76, pleaded guilty to the charges last month, admitting he had lied under oath three times during the company's recent civil fraud trial.\nUnflinching in his loyalty to the Trump family, the Florida retiree now faces his second stint behind bars.\nHe served 100 days last year on tax fraud charges involving the company.\nOn Wednesday morning, he spoke only once - to tell Justice Laurie Peterson he had nothing to say - before she imposed his sentence and he was led out of court in handcuffs.\nThe two felony counts against him relate to false sworn testimony the executive gave in two separate deposition, as well as in trial testimony, regarding the size of former President Donald Trump's triplex apartment in New York.\nAttorneys prosecuting the case argued the company had - with Mr Weisselberg's explicit knowledge - overvalued the penthouse in financial statements at roughly three times its actual size.\nUnder oath, Mr Weisselberg claimed he had learned about the false valuation from a Forbes report, but prosecutors in the Manhattan district attorney's office said he has since admitted he knew about it long before then.\nThe civil case ended with the former president ordered to pay more than $450m, including interest, and Mr Weisselberg ordered to pay $1m.\nBoth men have appealed the ruling, and Mr Trump has since posted a $175m bond in response to the judgment.\nMr Weisselberg, who began working for the Trumps in the early 1970s, retired in 2021 after being hit with the earlier tax charges. The Trump Organization provided him a $2m (\u00a31.6m) severance package and continues to pay his legal bills.\nHe pleaded guilty in 2022 to helping facilitate a 15-year scheme by which he and other company executives evaded taxes on company perks, such as a rent-free luxury apartment in Manhattan, tuition for his grand children and two Mercedes-Benz vehicles.\nAlthough his plea agreement resulted in a five-month sentence at New York's notorious Rikers Island complex, he was released on good behaviour after serving 100 days.\nAs he now returns to Rikers, he will again be eligible for release in 100 days.\nProsecutors have agreed not to call Mr Weisselberg as a witness in Mr Trump's criminal trial beginning Monday over hush money payments to a porn star before the 2016 election. Mr Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies any wrongdoing.\nBut Mr Weisselberg's alleged role in helping falsify company records to cover up those payments is expected to nevertheless factor into the trial.",
    "Russia has said the situation is \"very, very tense\" as floodwaters continue to rise in the city of Orenburg and surrounding areas.\n\"Large amounts of water are coming to new regions,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned on Wednesday.\nThe flooding is being described as the worst to hit the region in 80 years.\nWater levels in the Ural river near Orenburg rose to over 10m (33ft) on Wednesday, Ria news agency reported, well above its bursting point.\nThousands of people have had to flee their homes in southern Russia, while officials in neighbouring Kazakhstan say the number of evacuees there has risen to 97,000.\nLast week, several rivers - including the Ural, Europe's third-largest - burst their banks after rapidly melting snow and ice caused them to swell.\nThe Ural flows through the city of Orsk, on to Orenburg, into Kazakhstan and then on to the Caspian Sea. Floodwaters are threatening several areas of northern Kazakhstan and many dams and reservoirs are filled to capacity.\nEntire villages have been engulfed by overflowing rivers. As many as 2,000 homes have been flooded in Orenburg, where water levels have surpassed the critical level of 9.3m and still rising. The city has a population of 550,000 and lies about 1,500km (930 miles) south-east of Moscow. \n\"So far, the forecast is not favourable. The water level continues to rise,\" Mr Peskov said, adding that a \"large amount\" of floodwater would soon also reach the nearby regions of Kurgan and Tyumen. \nMr Peskov added that the situation \"of course requires the most energetic efforts from government officials at all levels to help people\".\nHe said President Vladimir Putin was not intending to visit the flood zone and said the Russian leader was instead \"getting information and co-ordinated the work of all branches of authorities\".\nOrsk, about 300km (180 miles) downstream from Orenburg, was flooded when water burst through a dam embankment. Authorities there say the situation is now stable.\nEarlier this week in Orsk, angry flood victims shouted '\"Shame on you!\" at local officials, in response to low compensation offers and officials' perceived failure to prevent the dam from bursting. \nThey also chanted, \"Putin help us\" - a reminder that in Russia, in times of trouble, very often the president is the last person people blame for their problems. On the contrary, they look to the Kremlin for help.\nFlooding often happens in Russia when winter transitions to spring. But there has been nothing on this scale in living memory.\nNorth Kazakhstan regional leader Gauez Nurmukhambetov has warned that a \"huge flow\" of water is heading to the city of Petropavl, with a population of 200,000.\n\"Once again, I emphasise, huge!\" he said.",

    "Assaulting a shop worker will be made a separate criminal offence in England and Wales as part of a government response to a wave of retail crime.\u00a0\nEarlier this year a report found violent and abusive incidents against shop workers rose by 50% in 2022-23.\nRishi Sunak said shops must be free from the threat of crime or abuse.\nThe government previously told campaigners for a new law it was not needed and would not be effective.\nBut the government says it is concerned about an increase in attacks. The prime minister said the new law was about \"sending a message\" to criminals stealing from local businesses or abusing shop workers that \"enough is enough\".\nHelen Dickinson, chair of the British Retail Consortium, welcomed the announcement, saying \"the voices of the three million people working in retail are finally being heard\".\nHowever, the charity Transform Justice argues that a specific offence will not reduce attacks on shop workers. \nIt cited evidence that a new offence of assaulting an emergency worker had not seen the number of attacks fall. \nThe new offence will carry a maximum sentence of six months. \nPerpetrators could also receive an unlimited fine and be banned from the shop where they committed the offence.\nSerial offenders could be forced to wear tags so their movements can be tracked and \u00a350m will be spent on facial recognition technology.\nDedicated facial recognition units will be used in high streets to catch perpetrators and prevent shoplifting. Police have been told to check more CCTV images against police databases.\u00a0\nIn more serious cases, offenders found guilty of grievous bodily harm will face jail sentences.\nBut anyone convicted of the new offence would not routinely go to prison.\nThe Sentencing Bill, which is currently going through Parliament, would mean sentences of 12 months or less would be suspended and served in the community, although a prison sentence could be imposed in exceptional circumstances.\nThe government has promised reforms to free up prison space in response to overcrowding due to tougher sentences and court backlogs.\nThe announcement comes as Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper and other senior party figures are on a local election campaign visit to Tees Valley to promote the party's polices to revive high streets.\nLabour is promising neighbourhood police patrols to tackle anti-social behaviour and shoplifting, as well as plans to bring empty premises back into use.\nCreating a new specific offence of assault against shop workers is already Labour policy. \nThe party also wants to scrap a rule which makes it less likely police will investigate the theft of goods under the value of \u00a3200 because they are dealt with less severely by the courts.\nMs Cooper said: \"Labour has been calling for tougher action against those who assault shop workers for more than 10 years. \n\"The Tories opposed and voted against our plans for better protection. Why has it taken them so long to act?\"\nLiberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael said: \"As the majority of shoplifting cases go unsolved, the Conservatives have repeatedly failed to get even the basics right of tackling this issue - something their new gimmicks won't change.\"\nThe government will introduce the new offence in its Criminal Justice Bill, currently being considered by Parliament.\nAssault or abuse of staff has been a specific offence in Scotland since 2021.\nAre you affected by the issues raised in this story?

    "At least two people were shot near an event celebrating the end of Ramadan in Philadelphia, police said.\nPolice Commissioner Kevin Bethel said five people were arrested after \"young people actively engaged in gunfire\" close to the Eid al-Fitr celebration.\nNo one was killed in the shooting, the commissioner emphasised.\nHe said that the shooting occurred between \"two factions\" at the outdoor event where 1,000 people were present. \nAn adult was hit in the exchange of gunfire, the police official said, and a 15-year-old suspect was shot in the leg and shoulder by police. \nThe teenaged gunman is in stable condition and was taken to hospital, said Mr Bethel. \nHe also noted that a third person appeared at a nearby hospital with a gunshot wound to his hand, though it was not immediately clear whether the person was involved in the gun battle. \nAuthorities have recovered five weapons that they suspect were involved in the shooting.\nOne child pedestrian was hit by a police vehicle while fleeing the scene and suffered a broken leg, Mr Bethel said.\n\"Ninety-nine percent of the individuals at this event are good people who wanted to have a good time,\" the commissioner said. And once again, we have young people engaging in gunfire who just really destroyed the sanctity of the event.\"\nHelicopter footage from the Clara Muhammad Square park shows a large crime scene outside the Philadelphia Masjid mosque. The video shows the food trucks and tents brought in for the celebration.\nWitnesses described a chaotic scene during an event that was supposed to memorialise the holy day, with families separated from their loved ones as the crowd fled the scene.\nAbdallah Legh, an employee at the Girard Meat Market near the crime scene, told Fox's local affiliate WTXF-TV that between 20 to 30 children came rushing into his store seeking shelter soon after he heard the crack of gunfire. \nThe FBI and Pennsylvania State Police are assisting Philadelphia police in the investigation, according to CBS.\nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro posted on X, formerly Twitter: \"Eid should always be a time of joy for our Muslim neighbors \u2014 and I grieve for every member of the Philadelphia Muslim community whose celebration was shattered by gun violence today.\"",

    " \"Things are dangerous right now. Death can come from anywhere,\" Paul tells us. Small, skinny and about 30 years old, he is a member of one of Ecuador's most violent criminal gangs.\nHe believes he has been on a rival group's hit list for a year and a half and the only reason he is still alive is thanks to his mother's prayers: \"It's like God doesn't want me up above, and the devil won't take me down below.\"\nPaul (not his real name) explains he has spent about half of his life in the gang. Like many, he joined young, when he was 15. He thought it was going to be all \"raves, parties, and girls\".\nAs we talk, we drive around Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city. Paul is afraid that if he stays still too long, his enemies from rival gangs - which are waging a bloody turf war - will catch up with him. So we keep moving to make it harder for anyone to follow us.\n\"I wanted respect,\" he says about his reasons for joining one of the up to 20 gangs which have contributed to the violence that has changed the face of Ecuador. \nUntil recently considered one of the safest countries in the region, Ecuador, which is also the gateway to the Galapagos Islands and home to the rainforest, attracted many tourists.\nBut now it has the highest recorded murder rate in Latin America.\nIn 2023, police recorded about 8,000 violent deaths. That is eight times more than in 2018 and puts Ecuador ahead of countries like Mexico and Colombia.\nIn January, Ecuador made headlines around the world when a TV station was taken over by armed masked men during a live broadcast. At the same time, gangs carried out kidnappings and set off explosions in multiple cities, and prisoners rioted in jails.\nPresident Daniel Noboa, who had been sworn in just two months earlier, declared a state of emergency. Since then, police have arrested more than 16,000 people. \nThe state of emergency ended on Monday, but the president maintained a state of \"internal armed conflict\", with the military retaining exceptional powers.\nHe wants to introduce further measures such as stricter gun controls and tougher prison sentences. These will be put to a vote in a referendum on 21 April. \nThere is no doubt that the lives of many Ecuadoreans have changed due to the rise in gang violence.\nDr Gabriela Almeida says she is seeing \"more and more patients with anxiety, and people who are suffering from panic attacks\".\nDr Almeida herself avoids going out at night. \"There was a kidnapping near here, four blocks away,\" she explains. \n\"When I was a teenager, I remember seeing what was going on in Colombia,\" she says of the neighbouring country's drug-related violence.  \n\"We never thought anything like that could happen in our country,\" she says, adding that she is considering emigrating to Spain because in Ecuador \"we're living a nightmare\".\nMuch of that nightmare has been fuelled by the growth of the drugs trade.\nWorldwide production and consumption of cocaine have reached record levels, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. \nBetween 2020 and 2021 alone, cocaine production shot up by nearly a third and international drug cartels began looking for new routes through which to smuggle the cocaine produced in Colombia and Peru.\nEcuador, which is sandwiched between Peru and Colombia and whose authorities lacked experience in fighting trafficking, was seen as the perfect option.\nAs a result, Ecuador has been transformed into a global distribution hub, where drugs are stored, prepared for transit - often hidden inside shipping containers - and sent out to their final destination. \nGangs like the one Paul is part of play a key role. \nPaul tells us that he shifted from dealing relatively small quantities of drugs to trafficking kilogrammes of cocaine. He says his new role consisted of hiding illegal drugs among other products inside shipping containers.\nNinety per cent of illegal drugs leaving Ecuador are hidden inside shipping containers departing the port of Guayaquil, according to Ecuador's coastguard.\nThe coastguard has stepped up its surveillance but it says the risk for its staff has increased, too. \n\"In the past, we were dealing with common criminals. Now, anyone we see could have high-calibre weapons,\" one of the coastguard commanders tells us, as we join his team on a boat patrolling the port and surrounding areas.\nHe does not want us to reveal his name for fear of reprisals from the gangs and wears a grey balaclava to hide his face.\nHis armed team carries out up to four patrols a day, looking for gang members who use small boats to try to hide drugs in containers stacked on the huge ships.\nThe commander says that they have been hampered by corruption in the past and Paul confirms that the gang used to pay off someone in the port to turn the security cameras away at key moments so gang members could carry out their illicit activities undetected.  \nFor Paul, more drug trafficking meant \"more money, better weapons\".

    "A man who was not warned about the possible side effects of the drugs he was prescribed has said they left him hallucinating a bear and a burglar.\nAndrew Holland, 61 and from Manchester, was diagnosed with \"steroid mania\" after being prescribed the medication at the city's Royal Eye Hospital.\nHe said he experienced hallucinations and was found wandering the streets.\nAn ombudsman has ruled he was not fully informed of potential side effects and had endured a \"terrifying experience\".\nMr Holland was prescribed steroids in January 2022 after losing his sight in one eye and suffering a severe infection in the other.   \nHe said the medication left him \"seeing all sorts\".\n\"It was crazy,\" he said.    \n\"There was a bear at the end of the garden one day and a burglar coming over the garage roof.\"\nHe said at the time, he had not known what he \"was capable of\".\n\"Apparently, I had the ambulance sat outside for about half an hour, while I insisted on doing my ironing before I went with them,\" he said.\n\"It was just crazy.\"\nHe told the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) he had hallucinations of seeing animals and dust on people and was found inexplicably wandering the street. \nAfter being rushed to the Royal Manchester Infirmary, he was diagnosed with \"steroid mania\" and told to stop taking the medication. \nHe added he \"did not really blame\" the doctors who treated him for prescribing the steroids as he accepted it was \"very rare to get a reaction off them\".\nThe NHS website lists a number of mild to severe side effects of taking steroids, which include changes in mood and the possibility of mental health problems such as depression, but does not specifically list psychosis.\nIf you're affected by the issues in this piece, you can find support from BBC Action Line.\nThe PHSO found that although there were no failings in the decision to prescribe Mr Holland the medication, Manchester University NHS Trust's staff had failed to fully warn him of the potential side effects and as such, he was not able to make an informed decision about whether to take them. \nIt said an apology had been issued to Mr Holland by the trust, but it had failed to acknowledge its mistakes, and recommended he received \u00a3700 in compensation.\nIt also said the trust should write to him to accept something went wrong in communicating the side effects.\nPHSO chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath said it must have been a \"terrifying experience\" for Mr Holland.\n\"No-one wants to suffer a psychotic episode, no-one should do so as a result of medication without fully understanding and accepting the risk,\" she added.\nA spokeswoman for Manchester University NHS Trust said Mr Holland's care \"didn't meet the high standards which we expect\" and repeated an apology to him.\n\"We have made changes since that time, but we will carefully study the Ombudsman's ruling to assess if more learning can be taken from it to further improve our services.\"\nWhy not follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X and Instagram?

    "The Conservative London mayoral candidate has promised an \"extra 1,500 police officers\" on the streets of the capital if she is elected.\nSusan Hall said she wanted to go \"back to borough policing\" to cut crime.\nShe pledged to introduce two police bases in every borough, funded as part of an overall \u00a3200m investment in policing.\nIt comes after Labour candidate Sadiq Khan announced he would recruit 1,300 additional officers if elected.\nAnnouncing her policing policies on Wednesday, Ms Hall said \"crime is, in my view, getting out of control\", adding: \"Never before have we needed police around on our streets as much as we do now.\"\nShe said she chose to visit the site of the former Eltham police station because it had been \"flattened thanks to Sadiq Khan\".\n\"In 32 boroughs I'll put an extra two bases so police will be actually based where they are working,\" she said.\nBut, she clarified, this would include hubs to store kit and not every base would have public-facing services.\nAsked how she planned to fund the bases, Ms Hall said some of the money would come from a wider package of funding for policing but it also depended on the situation in each borough.\n\"Some boroughs already own places that we can open up again, in some areas we're going to have to find areas that we can open up in,\" she explained. \nAdditionally, the candidate said she would appoint a women's commissioner, whose sole focus would be implementing a strategy to make London safer for women.\nShe also announced she would fund the installation of knife arches in every London school to make schools \"knife-free zones\".\nMs Hall said more must also be done to recruit officers into the Metropolitan Police, pointing out Mr Khan had to return \u00a390m in government funding because the force was not able to meet its recruitment target.\nLondon has a record number of almost 34,000 police officers, backed by 1,300 community support officers, 1,300 specials and almost 11,000 staff in administrative roles.\nHowever, officers are retiring at a faster rate than new ones are being taken on, and recruitment is being hampered by a combination of general recruitment problems in the public sector and extra vetting prompted by the review by Dame Louise Casey.\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley told a committee of MPs in April last year the force had missed its recruitment target \"in part\" because \"the reputation of the organisation at the moment doesn't help\".\nMr Khan's spokesperson said Ms Hall was \"making bogus unfunded pledges she simply can't deliver\". \n\"The Tories have cut \u00a31bn from the Met budget in real terms since 2010, and the last Tory mayor Boris Johnson closed over 60 police stations when he was mayor. \n\"Due to Tory funding cuts, Susan's Hall unfunded commitments are based on money that simply doesn't exist.\"\nLiberal Democrat candidate Rob Blackie said: \"I find it surprising the Conservatives are proposing more police stations when they had a policy of closing them for many years.\"\nGreen candidate Zoe Garbett said she wanted \"to see the police out there in the community working to local priorities\".\n\"Through my work as a councillor, I have spent a lot of time building connections between the police and the local community to help officers understand the priorities of communities and local businesses they serve. This is the work I want to do across London.\"\nMs Hall was also asked about claims that Mr Khan plans to bring in \"pay-per-mile\" road charging - something he has repeatedly denied.\nEarlier this week she faced criticism after a campaign suggested Mr Khan had plans for the charges. Her team also circulated leaflets looking like penalty charge notices with a scannable link to a webpage making the same claim.\nMs Hall reiterated her claim, saying: \"Sadiq Khan said that he would never bring in the Ulez expansion... he has.\"\nMr Khan's spokesperson previously said the circulated leaflets \"peddle a barefaced lie\", and accused the Conservatives of \"deliberately misleading Londoners\".\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A landmark review of gender services for under-18s in England and Wales has warned that children have been let down by a lack of research and \"remarkably weak\" evidence on medical interventions.\nDr Hilary Cass's review followed concerns about care at the Gender Identity and Development Service (Gids) - based at the Tavistock clinic in London.  \nIt was NHS England's only specialist gender clinic for children and young people but is now being replaced with new regional centres.\nThe Scottish government says it will consider her findings while reviewing services in Scotland.\nLike other parts of the UK, Scotland has seen a rapid rise in the number of young people questioning their identity or experiencing gender dysphoria.  \nFor many, this will only require support from family, friends and school but some become so distressed they seek medical help.\nThe only specialist service for under-18s is the Sandyford clinic in Glasgow.  \nPeople can self-refer or can be referred through their GP.  \nFigures released to BBC Scotland news under a Freedom of Information request showed that at the end of 2023, 1,100 patients were on the waiting list.  \nThe longest wait is 1,692 days, about four-and-a-half-years.\nIn her report, Dr Cass says the increase in the numbers of young people who have a trans or gender diverse identity, is the result of a \"complex interplay between biological, psychological and social factors\". \nShe warns that the \"toxicity of the debate\" around gender has had a negative impact on the quality of care they receive.\nShe says many doctors are afraid of working with them, because of the controversy around medical treatments, and that this means they are not getting the individualised care the NHS should provide, including mental health assessments and screening for autism and other neurodevelopmental conditions.\nOne of the most controversial issues for children and young people with gender incongruence is around prescribing puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones.\nDr Cass says the lack of evidence on the long-term impact of taking hormones from an early age has let children down.  \nHer recommendation is that hormones should only be prescribed with \"extreme caution\".\nNHS England recently announced that puberty blockers would no longer be routinely prescribed to children outside of clinical trials.\nDetails of those trials are still to be announced.\nA routine ban has not been announced in Scotland but the Scottish government says it is working with NHS England as it develops plans for clinical research in this sphere.  \nFewer than 100 children - who had already started a prescription - are now taking puberty blockers on the NHS in England. \nIn Scotland, the number is likely to be far smaller.\nNHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, who run the Sandyford Clinic, said: \"We carry out a multidisciplinary assessment over a number of appointments, including a robust psychological assessment.\n\"There are times following these appointments where some patients are referred to endocrinology for puberty blockers. \n\"They would be further assessed for suitability. Puberty Blockers are just one point of intervention and they are currently used in small numbers.\"\nDr Cass says she is also concerned that some young people who can't access support on the NHS are obtaining \"unregulated and potentially dangerous hormone supplies over the internet\", or using private providers without a clear plan for long-term monitoring, and recommends that the UK government should consider ways to prevent inappropriate prescribing.\u00b7         \nNHS Scotland is reviewing gender services for both adults and children.  New protocols for adults have been delayed but are expected to be published before the summer.\nFor children, the government says it is developing a separate pathway.  \nDr Cass's report only looked at NHS England, but in December, she gave a presentation to the Scottish government's National Gender Identity Healthcare Reference Group, which is overseeing this work.\nFactors affecting Scotland include the similar challenge experienced in England, of recruiting from a limited number of skilled and expert staff to specialist services, and the impact of this on an already stretched NHS.\nThe group is also considering the structure of clinical services both locally and nationally, as well as potential collaboration between the Scottish government and NHS England on its puberty hormone suppression study in children and young people.\nThe government's National Services Division is continuing work formally to commission a young people\u2019s gender identity service for Scotland, including consideration of  ongoing support \"embedded\" at local and regional level, alongside pathways for referral to an expert national service.\nDr Cass says in England and Wales there has been what she calls 'diagnostic overshadowing' with too many children being referred straight to national gender services, when they may get quicker and better help elsewhere. \nIt's just one of the 32 r",
    "The Arizona Supreme Court on Tuesday pushed the abortion issue to centre stage in a state that could be pivotal in deciding who wins November's US presidential election.\nIt has prompted Democrats to go on the attack, and set many Republicans scrambling to align themselves more closely with the public sentiment.\nThe court paved the way for a near-total ban on abortion, a law passed in 1864 when Arizona was still a US territory, to go into effect in the coming weeks if there is no further legal action. The law had been pre-empted for nearly a half-century, as a result of the 1973 US Supreme Court ruling in Roe v Wade that guaranteed a woman's right to abortion. \nTwo years ago, however, the US Supreme Court overturned that abortion precedent. This gave old bans like the one in Arizona - which became a state in 1912 - new life.  \nThe Arizona court decision prompted quick condemnation from the Biden administration as well as from local Democrats and pro-choice activists. \n\"This ruling is a result of the extreme agenda of Republican elected officials who are committed to ripping away women's freedom,\" the president said in a statement provided by the White House.\nWhile anti-abortion groups heralded the decision, many Republicans have distanced themselves from the state court action, reflecting polls that suggest a majority of the public - in the US and in Arizona - favour abortion rights and oppose strict bans on the procedure.\nThe party had largely opposed abortion before Roe was overturned, but is now grappling with the fallout from that decision. Kari Lake, the presumptive Republican nominee for an open Arizona Senate seat, provided a vivid illustration of the challenges and contradictions the abortion issue is presenting for conservative candidates.\nIn a statement released on Tuesday, the former television news presenter condemned the court ruling and said that the 1864 law, which she had previously supported, was \"out of step with Arizonans\". She said Arizona voters would have the chance to decide the abortion issue in the forthcoming ballot referendum - although she has said she is against its passage. \nShe called on the Democrat who beat her in 2022, Governor Katie Hobbs, to work with the Republican-controlled legislature to find a \"common sense\" solution - without spelling out what that would entail.\nOn Monday, former President Donald Trump released a short video detailing his own shifting position, which included leaving the ultimate decision on legality to individual states. It was a message that Ms Lake echoed.\n\"I wholeheartedly agree with President Trump,\" she said. \"This is a very personal issue that should be determined by each individual state and her people.\"\nBy Wednesday, Mr Trump himself had weighed in on the Arizona ruling, saying it had gone \"too far\".\nWhile the Arizona Supreme Court left the door open to further legal challenges, if the 1864 ban goes into effect it could provide a stark illustration for voters of what individual states determining abortion policy can look like.\nTwo weeks ago, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that the state's six-week abortion ban could go into effect. This has fuelled speculation the issue could make the large state, which has trended toward Republican of late, a key presidential battleground.\nNow there's a new ground zero in the national abortion fight.\nArizona is already an electoral battleground. Joe Biden was the first Democrat in 24 years to win the state, with its 11 electoral votes, by a margin of about 10,000 votes. If he can repeat the feat there, it gives the president a path to victory even if he drops other closely contested states he won four years ago, like Wisconsin, Nevada and Georgia.\nThe state's Senate race, between Ms Lake and Democrat Ruben Gallego, will also help determine which party controls the upper chamber of Congress.\nWith the abortion-rights referendum expected to appear on the November ballot, Democrats were already hoping the issue would help drive turnout from voters more inclined to support Mr Biden and the rest of the party's slate of candidates. \nSimilar abortion-rights measures have passed in every state that has put them to a vote, including Republican-dominated states like Kansas, Kentucky and Ohio. Democrats have campaigned aggressively on the abortion issue, and the connection is widely considered to have helped the party post better-than-expected results in the 2022 midterm congressional elections.\nIn a March Fox News poll, 39% of Arizona voters said abortion would be \"extremely important\" in determining the presidential candidate they would support in November, and that those voters were much more likely to back Mr Biden.\nWith the state court's decision, the stakes have only been raised. November's ballot measure could determine whether Arizona enshrines abortion rights in its constitution, or has a virtual ban on the procedure. \nIt's the kind of clear choice that Democrats will relish.",

    "Consumer prices in the US rose faster than expected last month, in a sign that the fight to slow inflation has stalled.\nPrices rose 3.5% over the 12 months to March, up from 3.2% in February, the US Labor Department said. \nHigher costs for fuel, housing, dining out and clothing drove the increase.\nAnalysts warned that the lack of progress in curbing price rises will force the US central bank to keep interest rates higher for longer.\nHigher rates help stabilise prices by making it more expensive to borrow for business expansions and other spending. In theory, that in turn slows the economy, and eases the pressures pushing up prices. \nThe Federal Reserve's key interest rate is now at the highest level in more than two decades, in the range of 5.25%-5.5%.\nForecasters had expected the bank to start lowering borrowing costs this year, reflecting the fact that the inflation rate, which tracks the pace of price rises, has fallen significantly since hitting 9.1% in 2022.\nBut recent economic data, including strong jobs creation figures last week, has raised doubts about how soon those cuts might come.\nShares on Wall Street closed lower on Wednesday as investors had been betting that rates could soon be cut.\nAnalysts, who once expected rate cuts as soon as March, have been rapidly revising bets, with many now not expecting any until later this summer and some predicting the bank could wait until next year.\nWhat the Fed decides to do is likely to shape decisions by central banks around the world, said Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton Diversified Funds.\n\"The Fed has got some head scratching to do and if other central banks were waiting for the Fed to move, they have got a conundrum on their hands now,\" he said. \nInflation cooled rapidly over 2023 as pandemic-era supply issues healed and the spike in food and energy prices sparked by the war in Ukraine faded, but it still remains higher than the bank's 2% target.\nAn uptick in oil prices in recent months has also pushed energy costs higher, while prices for services show little sign of stabilising. \nThe Labor Department said prices had jumped 0.4% from March to February, the same as in February.\nHigher petrol and housing costs accounted for more than half the increase. \nCar insurance, medical care and costs for internet also contributed.\nSo-called core inflation, which is seen by economists as a better indicator of future trends because it does not include more volatile food and energy prices, stood at 3.8%, the same as in February. \n\"We shouldn't overreact to the jump in headline inflation - which was all about energy,\" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. But he added: \"The details are not at all reassuring for the Fed.\"",
    "The Crown Office has launched a fatal accident inquiry into the death of Scottish serial killer Peter Tobin.\nTobin died aged 76 on 8 October 2022 at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary (ERI) while serving three life sentences.\nHe had been an inmate at HMP Edinburgh when he was taken to hospital on 9 September 2022 following a fall in his cell the previous night.\nTobin was serving the sentence for the murders of Angelika Kluk, 23, Vicky Hamilton, 15, and Dinah McNicol, 18.\nHe was only unmasked as a serial killer after his final victim, Ms Kluk, was found hidden under the floor of a church in Glasgow in 2006.\nHe was later convicted of raping and murdering the Polish student.\nThe Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) has lodged a first notice to begin the court process for a fatal accident inquiry (FAI).\nTobin had been receiving palliative care before his death as his health worsened. He was monitored by GeoAmey officers at all times while in hospital.\nThe FAI, which is mandatory by law, will look into the cause of death and the circumstances in which it occurred. It will try to establish whether any reasonable precautions could have been taken to prevent the death.\nIt aims to minimise the risk of deaths in the future. Unlike criminal proceedings, FAIs are used to establish facts instead of attributing blame to an individual or group.\nProcurator fiscal Andy Shanks, who leads on fatalities investigations for COPFS, said: \"The Lord Advocate considers that the death of Peter Tobin occurred while in legal custody and as such a fatal accident inquiry is mandatory.\n\"The lodging of the first notice enables FAI proceedings to commence under the direction of the Sheriff.\"\nA preliminary hearing will be held on 27 May at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.\u202f\u202f \nFollowing the discovery of Angelika Kluk's body, Tobin's arrest set in motion a UK-wide investigation which ultimately led officers to the remains of two teenage girls.\u00a0\nVicky Hamilton had disappeared in February 1991 as she travelled to her home near Falkirk.\nDinah McNicol from Essex was last seen in August 1991, when she hitched a lift from Tobin after a music festival. \nBoth their remains were found 16 years later, buried in the garden of Tobin's former home in Kent.\nThe killer had long been suspected by police of murdering several other women as he lived under more than 40 aliases and had owned more than 150 cars in his life.\nFormer Strathclyde Police detective David Swindle, who led the investigation into Peter Tobin, previously said he had no doubts the predator had killed more people.\nHe said: \"This is someone who had no respect for humanity.\"\nAccording to Police Scotland, fruitless attempts had been made towards the end of Tobin's life to get him to reveal information about other potential victims.\nBut despite being linked with many unsolved cases, he never co-operated with police.",
    "Home Secretary James Cleverly is coming under increasing pressure to rethink plans to clamp down on \"nuisance\" rough sleeping in England and Wales.\nThe government is expected to make concessions in the coming weeks to try to stave off a backbench rebellion. \nDozens of Conservative MPs are thought to oppose the plans.\nNow more than 30 charities have written to Mr Cleverly to warn the plans could see vulnerable women being fined for seeking shelter.\nMeasures in the Criminal Justice Bill would allow police to move on \"nuisance\" rough sleepers and, if they do not comply, issue a fine or arrest them.\nHowever, critics have argued the definition of nuisance behaviour is too broad and includes things such as causing excessive noise or smells, as well as being threatening or causing damage to property.\nMinisters have been holding talks with potential Conservative rebels seeking to block the plans in Parliament in a bid to find an approach that keeps them on side.\nThose discussions are expected to resume when Parliament returns from its Easter break next week and the backbenchers are confident there will be some movement.\nThe Home Office argues the measures will tackle rough sleeping and begging \"where it causes damage, disruption, harassment or distress to the public, while avoiding criminalising the genuinely vulnerable\". \nThey are set to replace the 1824 Vagrancy Act, which makes begging and rough sleeping a criminal offence.\nHowever, Tory backbencher Bob Blackman, who has tabled several amendments to the bill, believes the new plans are worse than the 19th-century legislation. \n\"These people are not there by choice, they are there because they've got nowhere else to go,\" he told the BBC. \n\"They should be assisted, not arrested,\" he added.\nConservative former minister Sir Iain Duncan Smith is among 11 Tories who are publicly backing his proposals, along with opposition MPs.\nMore Conservative names are expected to be added to the amendments when Parliament returns from its Easter break next week.\nAbout 32 Tory MPs would need to back the proposals in order to win, but it is understood the government is not keen to have a public argument within its own ranks over the topic.\nMinisters are likely to tweak the wording of the bill to address concerns that people could be arrested simply because they smell.\nHome Office sources say they do not believe their plans criminalise rough sleeping.\nBut they want to ensure the police have sufficient powers to deal with aggressive begging.\nThe legislation was written when Suella Braverman was home secretary and government figures stress the Home Office now has a different person at the top in Mr Cleverly.\nAn ally of Mrs Braverman's said the \"reality is sometimes the government has to make tough decisions to the benefit of the majority\".\nThey said homelessness is a \"difficult subject\" and \"nobody likes talking about it\" but you \"can't have a situation where shopkeepers have people blocking their doors and are unable to move them on\".\nThe letter, signed by organisations including Crisis, Amnesty UK and the Big Issue, praises government steps to end rough sleeping but argues that elements of the Criminal Justice Bill \"undermine\" those commitments.\n\"It could see women, who are disproportionately likely to suffer violence and sexual abuse on the streets, penalised for seeking shelter and safety in well-lit doorways,\" they write.\n\"It could see a fine of \u00a32,500 issued to a person carrying an 'excessive smell'.\"\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"The bill concentrates on behaviour that is anti-social, including causing environmental damage such as with excessive noise or litter. No one will be criminalised for simply having nowhere to live. \n\"We will continue to engage with stakeholders and parliamentary colleagues in the usual way as the bill passes through parliament.\"\nAt least 93 amendments have been tabled to the Criminal Justice Bill, on issues ranging from abortion to gay conversion therapy.\nOn Tuesday the government announced its own amendment, adopting a Labour policy to create a specific offence of assaulting a shop worker.\nThe bill has been likened to a \"Christmas tree\", with its wide scope enabling MPs to attach various issues to it.\nWith a general election around the corner, one government source said they thought the legislation had become a \"last chance saloon\" for MPs to propose changes they cared about.\nIt is not clear when the bill will return to the Commons, but its increasing complexity is thought to be holding it up.

It took hours for me to recover,\" he says.\nHe says he broke his leg around Christmas while fighting in a \"remote place\" - his family, he says, didn't know about his situation at that time.\nMr Moothappan spent two and a half months in different hospitals in Luhansk, Volgograd and Rostov before recovering partially. \nIn March, a group of Indians helped him reach the country's embassy in Moscow, which then arranged for him to travel back home. \nSome 61km away in Anchuthengu, another fishing hamlet in Kerala, Prince Sebastian has a similar story of escape - and trauma - to tell. \nDuped by a local agent, he was deployed in a group of 30 fighters in the Russian-occupied eastern Ukrainian town of Lysychansk. After just three weeks of training, he says he was sent to the frontline with several weapons including an RPG-30 (a handheld, disposable rocket-propelled grenade launcher) and bombs, which prevented him from moving quickly.\nFifteen minutes after he reached the front, he says a bullet fired from close range deflected off the tank he was in and pierced below his left ear. He fell - on to what he realised was a dead Russian soldier.  \n\"I was shocked and I couldn't move. After an hour, as the night fell, another bomb exploded. It badly injured my left leg.\"\nHe spent the night in a trench, bleeding. He escaped the next morning and subsequently spent weeks in different hospitals.\nHe then got a month's leave to rest. During this time, a priest helped him contact the Indian embassy which then issued him a temporary passport and arranged for his return home. \nHe says two of his friends who went with him, also fishermen, are still missing. Neither he nor their families have heard from them in weeks.\nOfficials in Kerala say they have so far received complaints from the families of four men - Mr Moothappan, Mr Sebastian and his two friends - about being duped by agents. \nMr Sebastian says he and his friends went to a local agent in their village to check if they could find jobs somewhere in Europe (the man is currently absconding). \nThe agent suggested Russia, speaking of a \"golden opportunity\" to work as a security guard for a monthly salary of 200,000 rupees ($2,402; \u00a31,898). They agreed instantly.\nThe friends paid 700,000 rupees each to him for a Russian visa. On 4 January, they reached Moscow, where an Indian agent identified as Alex, who spoke their language, Malayalam, welcomed them. \nThey spent the night in a flat, following which a man took them to a military officer in the city of Kostroma, 336km (208 miles) away, where they were made to sign a contract in Russian, a language they couldn't read, Mr Sebastian said. \nThree Sri Lankan recruits also joined them there. Then the six men were taken to a military camp in the Rostov region, which borders Ukraine. The officers took their passports and mobile phones. \nThe training started on 10 January. In the following days, they learnt how to use handheld anti-tank grenades and what to do if they were injured.\nAfter this, they were taken to a secondary base known as the Alabino Polygon. There, the training continued for 10 days, \"day and night\".\n\"All kinds of armaments were waiting for us there,\" Mr Sebastian said. \"I started enjoying the weapons like toys.\"\nBut the brutal reality of the war hit him on the battlefield. \nNow, he is ho",
    "Councillors have refused for the second time to accept the suggested words for a new plaque where a slave trader's statue once stood. \nBristol City Council's development control committee voted 3-2 in February against the text for the plinth of the Edward Colston statue, toppled during a Black Lives Matter protest in 2020, \"celebrating him as a city benefactor\".\nBut councillors were presented with the same wording on Wednesday as they had rejected, with an explanation from the We Are Bristol History Commission about why the words were chosen.\nOne committee member said the wording was still \"unacceptable\".\nThe proposed plaque would have said: \u201cOn November 13, 1895, a statue of Edward Colston (1636\u20131721) was unveiled here celebrating him as a city benefactor.\n\u201cIn the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, the celebration of Colston was increasingly challenged given his prominent role in the enslavement of African people.\n\u201cOn June 7, 2020, the statue was pulled down during Black Lives Matter protests and rolled into the harbour.\n\u201cFollowing consultation with the city in 2021, the statue entered the collections of Bristol City Council\u2019s museums.\u201d\nAfter voting against the officers\u2019 recommendation to approve the wording, the committee decided unanimously to defer the application until their next meeting on 5 June.\nCouncillor Guy Poultney said: \"It is to be regretted that the council felt they couldn't compromise, that they couldn't deviate from the wording the committee saw last time. \n\"Given that the committee made it very clear the wording was unacceptable, I don't see how it has become more acceptable now,\" he added.\nHe said the committee suggested removing the references to Colston being celebrated as a benefactor, and also to Black Lives Matter as they were not purely factual or neutral. \nAnother councillor, Lorraine Francis, told the meeting she was \"uncomfortable\" with the wording. \n\"We're being told 'this is what it is, you need to accept it'.\"\nHer preference would be the simple statement: \"The statue of Edward Colston once stood here, 1895-2020.\"\nOther councillors were more supportive.\nLesley Alexander said the proposed text was simple and factual.\nShe said: \u201cThe average tourist is not looking for a history lesson, he wants to know why we\u2019ve got an empty plinth, and if he wants more information, it says it can be viewed at the museum and more information given, so it\u2019s fine as it is.\u201d",

    "Fire crews have spent a second night at a blaze in a battery recycling plant in North Ayrshire.  \nThe fire is said to be contained but around 10 firefighters with three appliances remain at the scene in Kilwinning.\nEmergency teams were called to the Fenix plant on Byrehill Road just after 22:00 on Monday.\nAround 40 firefighters were required to tackle the fire at its peak and union leaders are concerned about the impact of their exposure to fumes over the 48 hours.\nResidents have been advised to keep doors and windows closed as a precaution against smoke. \nJohn McKenzie, Scottish secretary of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), warned that the health and safety of fire crews was at a heightened risk due to having been on the scene for such a long period of time.\nHe said the crews \"have been doing a fantastic job at a challenging incident preventing the spread of the fire and keeping the public safe.\n\"However, we know that Scottish firefighters are up to four times more likely to get certain cancers than the general population and are therefore concerned about the potential impact of fire contaminants on firefighters at the scene.\n\"The FBU continues to call for much needed additional investment to ensure that all appropriate decontamination and associated measures are in place to protect firefighters across Scotland from fire contaminants.\"\nSpeaking on Tuesday, Scottish Fire and Rescue Service area commander Jim Quinn said locals should remain at home and keep windows and doors closed as a precaution.\n\u201cIf travelling through smoke, motorists should keep windows closed, turn off air conditioning and keep their air vents closed,\u201d he said.\nDamian Lambkin from Fenix Battery Recycling told BBC Scotland News the plant's response team had contacted emergency services, who he thanked for the \"prompt and professional handing of the incident\".\nHe said: \"While the cause of the fire is still under investigation, we are fully co-operating with the authorities by providing all necessary information and support and Fenix Battery Recycling will continue to liaise closely with emergency services, regulatory bodies, and local authorities throughout the ongoing incident.\"",
    "More than 100 schools have refused to create new specialist classes for children with Special Educational Needs (SEN).\nThat is according to a senior official at the Department of Education (DE).\nJanis Scallon revealed the figure when questioned by MLAs on Stormont's Education Committee.\nThe Education Minister Paul Givan has previously said that more than 1000 extra school places are needed for children with SEN in September 2024.\nIn 2023, hundreds of children started the summer holiday without knowing which school they would be going to when the new school year began.\nMs Scallon was asked by the Education Committee chair, Alliance MLA Nick Mathison, how the \"crisis\" of 2023 could be avoided.\n\"We appear to be entirely on a crisis footing at every stage through this process and I feel we are there again,\" he said.\nMs Scallon told MLAs on the committee that around 7000 children with SEN would need a new school place or to change schools in 2024.\nShe said there had been a 50% rise in the number of children with a statement of SEN over the past five years and a 25% increase in pupils in special schools.\nShe said the department expected to spend over half a billion pounds on supporting pupils with SEN in 2024.\nMs Scallon said the rise in children with SEN meant an additional 1000 school places were needed.\nThat meant there was a need for 66 new special school classes and 94 new specialist classes in mainstream schools.\n\"I don't want to use the word crisis here,\" Ms Scallon said.\n\"It is challenging but I don't want to give the impression that no work has been done.\"\nMs Scallon said the Education Authority (EA) had written to every mainstream school to ask if they could open a specialist class for pupils with SEN.\n\"Around 134 have said no to creating specialist provision,\" Ms Scallon said.\nBut she added that 80 mainstream schools had agreed to set up new specialist classes.\nMs Scallon said some schools, who had refused to consider opening specialist classes, had concerns about not getting enough support or staff to meet the needs of the children.\nOthers said they were full and had no room or spare classrooms.\n\"Some, I have to be perfectly honest, have just said they're just not interested,\" Ms Scallon continued.\nSinn F\u00e9in MLA Pat Sheehan asked how many grammar schools had come forward to offer specialist places.\nMs Scallon replied that she did not have the exact number to hand but said that some grammar schools \"had come forward\".\nEarlier, Ms Scallon admitted that, when it came to children with special educational needs, there was \"a lack of confidence in the system and its ability to respond to the needs of children and young people and their parents\".\n\"Parents, carers, teaching and wider staff often don't have confidence that children's needs will be met early enough,\" she said.\n\"An assessment and subsequent statement of special educational needs is often perceived as the only way of securing the additional supports that children need to aid their learning.\"\nShe said recent problems with school placements showed a \"need for better and longer term planning\".\nA number of MLAs on the committee expressed concern at the fact that so many places for children with SEN were likely to be needed.\nThe Alliance MLA Kate Nicholl criticised what she called the \"ping-pong attitude between the department and the EA\".\n\"If I were a parent I would be so concerned and I wouldn't be hearing anything to be optimistic about right now,\" she said.\n\"It is a crisis.\"\nThe DUP MLA David Brooks said he had been to a special school in his constituency which was so full it had to use a \"storage cupboard\" as a classroom.\n\"They are literally packed to the brim,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, the Ulster Unionist MLA Robbie Butler questioned why there was a \"presumption of mainstream\" schools for pupils with SEN.\n\"I think that isn't child-focused, I don't think it's child-centred,\" he said.",
    "An MP is calling for the government to revoke the permit for a planned incinerator in his constituency.\nAndrew Murrison, Conservative, has written to the Defra minister Sir Mark Spencer about the pause to incinerator permits to see if the one for Westbury in Wiltshire can be revoked. \nPlans to build the controversial incinerator were granted in February.\n\"The future isn't in burning our waste, it's in managing our waste far more responsibly,\" said Dr Murrison.\n\"After the minister's announcement last week, I'm more confident than I've been in a long time that Westbury incinerator will not be built and I will certainly be the first one to congratulate Hills Waste NREL [Northacre Renewable Energy Limited] if they decide to pull the plug on this one,\" added the MP for South West Wiltshire.\nA spokesperson on behalf of NREL said the company had already been granted its environmental permit by the Environment Agency.\nThey added: \"Work on the next phase of the development is progressing.\"\nThe government has temporarily banned permits for new incinerator plants in England.\nSir Mark Spencer instructed the Environment Agency [EA] to temporarily stop granting licences, saying he was worried about the risk that expanding incineration capacity could pose to environmental obligations.\nThe environment department will now consider how many plants are needed.\nDr Murrison said he was \"really pleased\" with this move.\nThe NREL incinerator, which will burn non-recyclable waste to generate electricity, is due to be built on an industrial park in Westbury.\nThousands of residents and campaigners have objected to the plans.\nLast month, Wiltshire Council said it would not be appealing the decision after previously changing its mind over the plans.\nMr Murrison told BBC Radio Wiltshire there were \"much better ways of managing waste\" than burning it. \n\"You can reduce the amount you generate, you can recycle what you can and use more environmentally-friendly techniques than old-style moving in great incinerators.\"\nHe explained Sir Mark Spencer was able to ask the EA to revoke permits.\n\"I hope they'll get the message and that the incinerator in Westbury will never be built,\" he added.\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A pub hotel owner says he is losing customers after being told to remove hot tubs from his national park site.\nThe Wilson Arms, in Coniston, in the Lake District, was first told to remove its four tubs by the Lake District National Park Authority (LDNP) in July 2022, which the pub\u2019s co-owner subsequently appealed.\nBut government planners ruled against Matthew Mayver\u2019s appeal and said the development harmed the appearance of the area.\nMr Mayvers called the whole situation a \u201cfarce\u201d.

    "A mother is working to help other neurodiverse young people in memory of her son.\nJane Roberts is personally funding a three-year project offering support and training in Gloucestershire.\nHer son, Ben Brimley, struggled with the challenges of living with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and eventually took his own life. \nMs Robert says she wants to make Gloucestershire England's most \"neurodivergent-friendly\" county. \nShe has joined forces with the ADHD Foundation to provide experts to work with young people aged 11 to 24 and to offer training to youth workers.\nMs Roberts, from Stroud, has helped created the Gloucestershire Neurodiversity Youth Project, alongside the foundation. \nShe says she will also work with organisations like The Music Works, ADHD Hub, The Door and Active Impact to embed a culture of understanding and celebration of neurodiversity in the county.\nShe said she first became aware of Ben's ADHD symptoms when he was in school.\n\"When he was six, his teacher suggested he might have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,\" said Ms Roberts. \n\"He struggled at senior school. People with ADHD mask their symptoms - which is terrible for their self-esteem. He dropped out of sixth form, and started taking drugs.\n\"He was officially diagnosed at 17, but [by then] a lot of the damage had been done,\" she added. \nMr Brimley eventually had a \"psychotic episode\" due to the drugs, Ms Roberts said.\nHe tried to start different careers as a chef, a gardener and working with fine furniture but found them hard to follow through.\n\"Ben never had the benefit of going to a support group. He really wanted to be independent, financially, and move properly into adulthood, but just couldn't. He gave up, lost hope, lost all his self esteem,\" she said.\nMr Brimley took his own life in 2020, when he was 30. Ms Roberts says her deep personal loss made her want to help others.\n\"After Ben died, I realised the root cause of the struggle was ADHD,\" said Ms Roberts. \n\"We'd set some money aside to buy him a house so decided to help other young people with ADHD - I want to see people understand ADHD, help people get a diagnosis, and run support groups to help them come to terms with it and find the positive side.\"\nDr Tony Lloyd, CEO of the ADHD Foundation, told the BBC that children with ADHD and autism are at a \"significantly greater risk\" of having anxiety, depression, eating disorders and suicidal thoughts - but that these are \"not a given\".\n\"It's not that it's in their genes,\" Dr Lloyd said.\n\"It's usually a product of the fact these children have faced a lot of discrimination and isolation.\"\nDr Lloyd said that children with ADHD are made to feel like they don't belong in school \"from a very early age\", which he said can cause further problems.\nHowever, he feels suicide statistics for those with ADHD are \"unhelpful\" due to the proportion of people who go undiagnosed.\n\"In terms of the data, we know 11 per cent of children with ADHD have suicidal ideation,\" he said.\n\"But we don't know the true picture because we don't even diagnose 75 per cent of people who have ADHD.\n\"There are now some support groups in Gloucestershire and, in the next three years, this project that Jane is funding is going to be about developing skills and expertise in all the different agencies that work with young people in Gloucestershire.\n\"All the research has shown that, the earlier we identify - the earlier we put support in place - then the life chance trajectories are better.\"\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook,X and Instagram.

    "Extreme weather caused by climate change is already costing farmers in Wales tens of millions of pounds, a report has said.\nThe effects of changing weather patterns cost farmers \u00a3175m in 2018 alone, a new report for WWF Cymru estimates.\nIt means those in the industry need to create a more \"diverse and resilient food and farming system\" to withstand the pressures of climate change.\nPuffin Produce, the largest fresh produce supplier in Wales, said it had been the \"most challenging\" period in memory.\nThe Met Office estimates that 27% more rainfall fell in the UK last month compared to an average March.\nAs the atmosphere warms it can hold more moisture, roughly 7% more per 1\u00b0C.\nMarc Jones, a farmer at Trefnant Hall Farm near Welshpool, Powys, has about 700 cattle and 800 sheep and said there had been significant extra costs due to the weather.\nHe said: \"I've been farming 20 years and this is the most consistent rain we've had as long as I've been farming.\n\"It particularly affects the cattle. Due to the wet conditions in the autumn, we had to keep feeding silage throughout and we're also feeding concentrates so probably added between \u00a315,000 and \u00a320,000 to the feed bill for the farm.\"\nPuffin Produce, based in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, provide potatoes and vegetables for the major UK supermarkets but has been hit by the prolonged rainfall.\nFarm manager Charlie Felstead said: \"We still have potatoes in the ground that were supposed to be harvested last August or September and it's going to be a struggle to get them out. \n\"We're trying to plant next year's crop. We've only got 20 acres in the ground where there should hundreds of acres in by now.\n\"Trying to harvest through some of the wettest conditions anyone has ever seen makes it hard for the guys in the field.\"\nThe report by Farmlytics estimates that farmers had to buy an extra \u00a3151m of livestock feed in 2018 due to droughts and floods, as well as crop and grass growth.\nExperts looked at the impact of the Beast from the East and heavy snowfall in 2018, the summer drought in 2018 followed by Storm Callum, Storm Dennis in February 2020, Storm Ciaran in November 2023 and drought in summer 2022.\nAn estimated \u00a323.8m worth of lambs were lost in 2018 due to extreme weather while a drought in 2022-23 led to feed cost rises totalling \u00a3265m.\nAt the livestock market at Newcastle Emlyn, the wet weather is the only topic of conversation.\nRoss Beynon, a beef and sheep farmer from Dryslwyn, said: \"It\u2019s been a total disaster if you want the truth. We\u2019ve got a part of our farm that we\u2019ve hardly used since last October, it joins the river.\"\nTeleri Bowen from Trelech said extensive rain meant \"the extra cost of purchasing bales for feeding the cattle has been quite extensive and it\u2019s something we don\u2019t really need at this time of year\".\nAled Davies from Felinfach said it felt like he had only seen \"three or four days of dry weather\" since July.\nEconomist Dr Edward Jones said the extra costs could make Welsh produce less competitive against cheaper imports.\nDespite food inflation dropping from 15.7% to 3.7% since this time last year, he said while Welsh farmers \"may hope to gain a greater price for their produce, unfortunately, the main food consumers will be buying will be food produced in other countries\".\nExperts say farmers should consider increasing crop rotations, harvesting rainwater and providing greater tree cover to cope with more extreme weather.\nShea Buckland-Jones, head of policy and advocacy at WWF Cymru, said: \"Those who farm in a nature-friendly, regenerative way, are more resilient to the impacts of climate change.\"\nHe also said the Welsh government should be supporting farmers to adapt through its sustainable farming scheme.\nThe Welsh government said \"We want our future generations to continue to produce top quality food in Wales, but they will be farming in very different conditions to today.\n\"The proposed sustainable farming scheme has been designed to help farmers respond to these challenges and help us to meet our commitments to the people of Wales.\"\nMr Jones said it would take time for farms like his to adapt by sowing different crops and grasses to survive drier periods and winter and would take \"five to 10 years to put a process in place that will work for us\".",

    "A low traffic neighbourhood (LTN) in a city suburb is be scrapped.\nBollards which block drivers from using some residential streets in Heaton, Newcastle, will be removed after 23 April, council officials said.\nThe LTN, which has been in place since October 2022 as part of a trial, saw too many vehicles being rerouted to other residential areas rather than main roads.\nBut one councillor called the move \u201cretrograde\u201d.\nThe decision leaves just one of the latest set of LTNs remaining in Newcastle, after bollards in South Gosforth were made permanent in January.\nA scheme in Fenham was removed in September and one in Jesmond was axed in February.\nPrevious bridge closures-turned-LTNs remain at locations including Haldane Bridge.\nNewcastle City Council said it had collected traffic data as part of the Heaton LTN trial which showed 700 vehicles were using the back lanes of Heaton Park Road, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\n\u201cThis creates a number of road safety risks as these lanes are not designed for, or expected to carry, this level of through traffic,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\u201cThere was also no data to suggest that there had been a significant shift to walking and cycling during the trial.\u201d\nBut Liberal Democrat councillor Mike Cookson said he wanted to see the LTN modified instead of completely removed.\nHe said: \u201cIf you were to open Heaton Park View up to through traffic again it would be a completely retrograde step. \n\"We were getting 3,000 vehicles a day along there and I could easily see that increasing.\u201d\nThe Labour-led local authority said it had engaged with Heaton residents on other traffic options for the area, including the re-opening of Heaton Park View or closing every through-route between Heaton Road and Heaton Park Road\n\"[This] conversation will continue and we will use the feedback we have received to help shape revised proposals for Heaton which we will consult with residents on in due course,\u201d the council said.\nFollow BBC Newcastle on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Medals awarded to a man who was buried alive in an explosion during the Blitz have sold at auction for \u00a3110,000.\nSub Lt Jack Easton was a member of the Admiralty's secretive Land Incident Section when a parachute bomb detonated in London's East End.\nWhen eventually pulled from the debris, he had a fractured skull, a broken back and broken legs.\nThe decapitated body of his assistant, Ordinary Seaman Bennett Southwell, was discovered six weeks later.\nOn 8 October 1940, a mine fell through the roof of a house in Hoxton and came to rest in an awkward position.\nThe surrounding area had been evacuated and Sub Lt Easton decided to try to defuse it where it was, to avoid disturbing it. \nAs he worked, OS Southwell passed him the tools. They had not been working for long when suddenly the device dropped and started ticking.\nKnowing they had only 12 seconds until it detonated, they both ran. Sub Lt Easton was buried under rubble from the explosion but OS Southwell was caught in the blast.\nBoth Bennett Southwell and Jack Easton were awarded the George Cross - and Sub Lt Easton's was among a group of seven of his honours that sold at Noonan's Auction House.\nOS Southwell's medal is on display at the Imperial War Museum.\nSub Lt Easton recounted his experience in a book called Wavy Navy: By Some Who Served.\n\"I did not know this would be my last assignment in mines disposal work when I left the Admiralty before breakfast that morning and was carried by car to Hoxton. \n\"At the back of the minds of us who did this work was an acceptance that there probably would be a 'last'. \n\"In defence of our sanity, perhaps, to stop us leaping from the cars that carried us to each assignment, or maybe just in case we began to think ourselves heroes, we did not dwell on this probability. \n\"It was there. But suppressed. If and when the 'last' mine came\u2026 well it came. \n\"Several of our section had found it; some, less fortunate than I, did not live to tell the story. \n\"My 'last' buried me in rubble for several hours with my back broken and other injuries, and it kept me in plaster for the best part of a year.\"\nSub Lt Easton had previously made safe 16 such devices, including one which had crashed through the roof of the Russell Hotel in Bloomsbury and ended up hanging from the chandelier in the main dining room.\nThe hotel owner tried to give Lt Easton a cheque for \u00a3140 and an offer of Sunday lunch for his family for life.\nBoth had to be rejected \"as a matter of honour\".\nThe medals in the lot were:\nSub Lt Easton attended a crash course on defusing explosives after volunteering for a \"secret mission\".\n\"There were many speculations as to why the mines had not exploded, even on contact. But that their mechanisms would start operating again to even the slightest movement or tap (as you might start a stopped watch by the gentlest finger-nail tap on its face glass) was something known.\n\"Our warning that the mine was alive again was the ticking of its mechanism, and when we heard that we knew we had a maximum of 12 seconds to get to safety. \n\"In certain situations, this time margin meant nothing. \n\"One Sub Lt who died was dismantling his first mine. No part of him was found, not even a uniform button or badge. He just disintegrated.\"\nHe also described the feeling when he approached the location of the bomb he was to defuse.\n\"Those solitary walks towards the location of a mine always reminded me of the last scenes in the pictures of Charlie Chaplin. \n\"I had the feeling that a vast audience was watching the way I walked. It had been a last scene for several men I knew.\n\"It was the usual type of working class home in the East End of London, one of a continuous structure of two-storied, drab erections, more miserable than usual because of the stillness, the emptiness of the houses. \n\"Through the windows one saw the miserable interiors, the little proud possessions in ornaments, plants, enlarged and coloured photographs of soldier and sailor sons, the parlour luxuries of poor folk. \n\"The mine hung suspended through a hole in the ceiling, its nose within six inches of the floor. The parachute was wrapped partly round a chimney pot and again caught on an ancient iron bedstead in the room above.\"  \nWhen the bomb started ticking, Lt Sub Easton used the 12 seconds to fling himself into an above-ground bomb shelter across the road.\n\"To this day I do not know how long I spent in my grave. I was buried deep beneath bricks and mortar and was being suffocated. My head was between my legs, and I guessed my back was broken, but could not move an inch. I was held, imbedded.\"\nAfter being taken to hospital, the Admiralty sent three cases of champagne and told him to listen to the 18:00 news, in which the George Cross was announced.\nRemarkably, after a year in plaster, Sub Lt Easton made a full recovery.\nHe died in 1994, aged 88.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Airline Aurigny made a profit in 2023, the company's CEO says. \nNico Bezuidenhout confirmed for the second year running the Guernsey States-owned airline was in the black, but added he could not give exact figures yet.\nThe company recorded a surplus in 2022 of \u00a33m, having been forecast to deliver a \u00a31m deficit.\nHe said: \"Our financial result for last year was a marginal profit, the year before was because of accounting treatments, whereas from operations last year we got a pure profit.\"\nCurrently, Aurigny is working with a number of companies to provide crews and planes through wet leasing arrangements as parts of its fleet are maintained. \nMr Bezuidenhout confirmed the cost of these leasing arrangements was between \u00a3500,000 and \u00a31m. \nThe company currently has arrangements with Luxwing, Avanti Air and is set to utilise one with JumpAir.\nThe cover is partly needed as Aurigny's jet is set to leave service this month, but is due to stay on-island to provide cover in May. \nIn the last year, the company has hired two new senior staff, a chief financial officer and chief commercial officer, including Wolf Meyer who Mr Bezuidenhout used to work with. \nMr Bezuidenhout has also defended the company's decision to hire his wife as its head of IT. \nHe said: \"I didn't hire any of these people myself because of the potential risk of the optics; that process was run independently.\n\"Aurigny needed a new head of IT as we had a system change last year that wasn't run effectively. \n\"We needed someone with experience and we advertised publicly.\"\nAbout the company's new website, he said that, while it was the same as the system operated by Blue Islands and Loganair, he did admit it could do with improvement.\n\"We've been going through a process to stabilise the situation. The current website could be better,\" he said.\nIn 2018, Aurigny said it was investing in aircraft with Clear Vision technology to help planes land in fog. \nMr Bezuidenhout said the technology was not \"exactly fog-busting\".\nBut he added that it did help and had been in operation for the last year. \n\"There have been a good 50 to 60 flights which have landed which would usually have been diverted because of the technology,\" he said.\nNico Bezuidenhout had built up some serious capital with politicians and the public in his tenure at the helm of Aurigny. \nThis year's \"black swan\" event, which saw serious disruption almost went some way to demolishing it. \nHe now has an uphill task this year to ensure the airline's brand doesn't take another battering as it did at the end of February this year. \nNews the company is once again in the black will be welcome, with concerns about the airline's finances a constant point of discussion for deputies. \nBut the question now will be, what does \"doing more for less\" mean in practice, and will services suffer in favour of the financial bottom line? \nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "The Crown Office has launched a fatal accident inquiry into the death of Scottish serial killer Peter Tobin.\nTobin died aged 76 on 8 October 2022 at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary (ERI) while serving three life sentences.\nHe had been an inmate at HMP Edinburgh when he was taken to hospital on 9 September 2022 following a fall in his cell the previous night.\nTobin was serving the sentence for the murders of Angelika Kluk, 23, Vicky Hamilton, 15, and Dinah McNicol, 18.\nHe was only unmasked as a serial killer after his final victim, Ms Kluk, was found hidden under the floor of a church in Glasgow in 2006.\nHe was later convicted of raping and murdering the Polish student.\nThe Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) has lodged a first notice to begin the court process for a fatal accident inquiry (FAI).\nTobin had been receiving palliative care before his death as his health worsened. He was monitored by GeoAmey officers at all times while in hospital.\nThe FAI, which is mandatory by law, will look into the cause of death and the circumstances in which it occurred. It will try to establish whether any reasonable precautions could have been taken to prevent the death.\nIt aims to minimise the risk of deaths in the future. Unlike criminal proceedings, FAIs are used to establish facts instead of attributing blame to an individual or group.\nProcurator fiscal Andy Shanks, who leads on fatalities investigations for COPFS, said: \"The Lord Advocate considers that the death of Peter Tobin occurred while in legal custody and as such a fatal accident inquiry is mandatory.\n\"The lodging of the first notice enables FAI proceedings to commence under the direction of the Sheriff.\"\nA preliminary hearing will be held on 27 May at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.\u202f\u202f \nFollowing the discovery of Angelika Kluk's body, Tobin's arrest set in motion a UK-wide investigation which ultimately led officers to the remains of two teenage girls.\u00a0\nVicky Hamilton had disappeared in February 1991 as she travelled to her home near Falkirk.\nDinah McNicol from Essex was last seen in August 1991, when she hitched a lift from Tobin after a music festival. \nBoth their remains were found 16 years later, buried in the garden of Tobin's former home in Kent.\nThe killer had long been suspected by police of murdering several other women as he lived under more than 40 aliases and had owned more than 150 cars in his life.\nFormer Strathclyde Police detective David Swindle, who led the investigation into Peter Tobin, previously said he had no doubts the predator had killed more people.\nHe said: \"This is someone who had no respect for humanity.\"\nAccording to Police Scotland, fruitless attempts had been made towards the end of Tobin's life to get him to reveal information about other potential victims.\nBut despite being linked with many unsolved cases, he never co-operated with police.",
    "Seven more areas in England have been selected to trial a programme to improve child protection.\nThe Families First for Children (FFC) scheme was launched in three areas in 2023 after after a major child care review in 2022 and reports into the murders of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes and Star Hobson in 2020.\nThe government said the \u00a345m programme would make sure targeted early help was available for families experiencing domestic abuse, addiction, or poor mental health before issues escalated and children were put at risk of harm.\nNew ways of working include involving the wider family in decision making at an earlier stage and introducing \"stronger and clearer multi-agency safeguarding arrangements\".\nThe scheme will be implemented in Luton in Bedfordshire, Redbridge and Lewisham in Greater London, Warrington in Cheshire, Walsall in the West Midlands, Warwickshire and The Wirral later this year.\nIt follows initial testing in Dorset, Lincolnshire, and Wolverhampton.\nThe 2022 review found that tens of thousands more children could end up in care without radical changes to child protection and called for early intervention for struggling families.\nAs part of the programme, multi-disciplinary family help teams will be created to make sure families with multiple needs can access all the support they need earlier and dedicated multi-agency child protection teams.\nThe changes are expected to have a significant impact on how teams operate and the system will be tested and adapted if necessary ahead of any further roll out to other areas, the Department for Education said.\nAlmost \u00a38m has been allocated within the \u00a345m project to fund a new family network pilot in seven additional local authority areas.\nThe scheme will look at supporting and keeping families together and children out of care where appropriate, which was a recommendation made by the review of children\u2019s social care in 2022, the department said.\nChildren, Families and Wellbeing Minister David Johnston said: \u201cEvery child deserves a safe and loving environment, where they are protected and can thrive.\"\n\u201cThe progress we are making with our children\u2019s social care reforms,\" he said, \"will make sure all families can access the right support before issues escalate, helping keep more children in safe and loving homes.\u201d\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A man who waited more than a year to be diagnosed with cancer has called on health services to better understand black people\u2019s experiences during their  journey as patients.\nSimeon Greene, from Wolverhampton, first saw a doctor in 2015 after noticing symptoms but he was not diagnosed with prostate cancer until the following year, more than 12 months after the initial meeting.\nThe 59-year-old - now a patient representative on the board of the West Midlands Cancer Alliance - said the delay was partly due to doctors dismissing his low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels that may have pointed to an issue as they were usually lower in black men than in white men.\nHe was diagnosed with cancer when he had a procedure to treat an enlarged prostate and tissue from the surgery was tested.\nHis comments came after a report by biopharmaceutical company Bristol Myers Squibb that said people from minority ethnic backgrounds faced longer delays in getting diagnosed with cancer than those from white backgrounds.\nThe report said people from these groups would usually experience an average of a year\u2019s delay between first experiencing symptoms and receiving a cancer diagnosis.\nThey were, the report added, also more likely to attribute their symptoms to other conditions than white people (51% compared to 31%), and were less likely to take their symptoms seriously (34% compared to 21%).\nMr Greene, who had successful cancer surgery in 2017, told BBC Midlands Today he got involved in patient representation \"because I didn\u2019t want others to go through the same kind of experience that I had\u201d. \nHe urged black men in particular to seek help from their GP if they experienced symptoms of his illness.\nHe said black men were more than twice as likely as white men to get prostate cancer, and two-and-a-half times more likely to die from it.\nBut Mr Greene, whose diagnosis came six months after his partner was diagnosed with breast cancer, said there were issues beyond the physiological for health services to consider. \nHe explained that during his experience as a patient, he was also embroiled in a battle related to the Windrush scandal, having been accused of not having the right documentation - a matter since resolved.\nWhile he was fighting deportation, he said he could not get employment or claim benefits and feared he would have to sell his possessions to keep a roof over his head.\nHe said such experiences needed to be taken into account when health services treated patients from minority ethnic backgrounds.\nHe told the BBC: \u201cThe experiences that we have as black people with cancer treatment are greatly impacted by the other things that go on in our lives that we have no control over.\n\u201cThose who deliver the services need to have a better understanding.\"\nIf you have been affected by issues in this story, BBC Action Line has advice.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

They have their young out on the fields, often early in the morning.\n\"With the wind and rain we've had, a young lamb is often too vulnerable to cope,\" Mr Farrington explained.\n\"Some die, some are abandoned by their mother as they tend to other new-borns.\"\nHe showed me his \"orphan-shed\", where stray lambs are matched with mothers whose own lambs have died.\nUsing an ancient shepherd practice, the dead lambs are skinned, and the orphans given a makeshift \"coat\". \nThe mother then recognises her offspring's scent, and bonds with the strays.\nI watched as a ewe suckled two lambs that she had adopted in this way.\n\"It's a happy ending for them,\" Mr Farrington explained, \"and for us.\n\"We don't have to feed them artificial milk and the ewe is earning her keep.\"\nCharlie Farrington is the third generation to farm here, and he keeps detailed rain measurements.\nUntil recently, in a typical year they saw 900mm of rain. In 2023 that rose to 1350mm, and so far this year they are already at 450mm.\nTom Collins was also born on his farm, in the Cotswolds. He's the fourth generation to work this land, and has seen his local climate change.\n\"I'm no meteorologist but it is definitely getting wetter and warmer,\" he said.\n\"Climate change is definitely happening, you can feel it as a farmer. We are going to have to adapt as farmers, to this wetter climate.\"\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and, X. Send your story ideas to us on email or via WhatsApp on 0800 313 4630.",
    "Campaign groups are calling for more resignations at Herefordshire Council following the departure of the director of children's services. \nDarryl Freeman quit his role in March following an Ofsted report that criticised the pace of improvement within his department.\nIt follows years of criticism, with Ofsted first raising concerns in 2018 and then rated it inadequate four years later.\nLeader of Herefordshire Council Councillor Jonathan Lester said he understood parents' frustrations and said the council was \"committed to working with children and families to deliver an improved service\". \nMr Freeman joined the local authority in 2021 and following his departure, groups of parents are calling for council chief executive Paul Walker and the head of legal services Claire Porter to also step down.\nA joint statement from the A Common Bond support group, the Stolen Childhood (Herefordshire) group and others claimed Mr Freeman had been \"slow to understand\" his department\u2019s impact on families, while independent reviews he promised \"failed to materialise\".\nThey added: \"But the continued failings of this department to improve at pace do not fall on one person\u2019s shoulders alone.\"\nThe groups have also restated their call for a judge-led public inquiry into the department\u2019s long-term failings, \"to allow those gagged by the family courts to fully speak out\".\nThe department was issued with a non-statutory improvement notice from the Department for Education after a High Court judgement in April 2021, which found the council had \"utterly failed\" three foster children.\nThe issue was also brought the national consciousness with the broadcast of a Panorama episode in 2022 focussing on the council's decision-making regarding children in care.\nThe Ofsted report last month echoed some of the points raised by government-appointed commissioner Eleanor Brazil in December. Her report said any improvements made by children's services had been slow, with little confidence they would be sustained. \nThe council has appointed Tina Russell to succeed Mr Freeman, though she will not take up the position until July.\nAnother long-time campaigner for reform of the department, Liz Anstey, said: \"My biggest fear is that the appointment of Ms Russell will be used to gain more time as a \"bedding-in period\" where more families are ripped apart\".\nMr Lester said: \u201cI understand that there are parents who still remain frustrated about Herefordshire children\u2019s services.\"\nHe added the local authority would work with them as well as with the children\u2019s commissioner and Ofsted \"who are highlighting the challenges we still face\".\nA spokesperson for Herefordshire Council added: \"We acknowledge that we need to pick up the pace and we need to make improvements in many areas of the service.\n\"Tina Russell has been appointed as our new Corporate Director of Children\u2019s Services, who will drive forward a programme with the ambition to provide a service that the whole county can have confidence in and be proud of.\"\nThis news was gathered by the Local Democracy Reporting Service which covers councils and other public service organisations.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "A teenager has pleaded guilty to causing the death of a seven-year-old girl who was hit by a motorcycle as she was riding her scooter.\nKatniss Seleznev died after suffering severe injuries when she was hit by a motorbike that failed to stop in Turnstone Road, Walsall, in July last year.\nA 15-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted causing death by dangerous driving when he appeared at Wolverhampton Magistrates' Court's youth court on Wednesday.\nJudge Michael Wheeler said the case was too serious for him to pass sentence and ordered he appear at Wolverhampton Crown Court on 22 May for sentencing. \nProsecutor Simon Brownsey told the court a number of children were playing on the quiet side street when the crash happened. \nHe said the motorbike involved in the collision had been reported stolen the month before the child's death and was later burned in scrub land.\n\"CCTV shows the children came around the corner on scooters with Katniss at the back,\" he said.\n\"When you look at the footage, what she didn't realise is that she had only seconds to live.\"\nThe footage showed Katniss, who later died in hospital, \"flying through the air\" and landing, the prosecutor continued.\nMembers of the public rushed to administer CPR before the emergency services were called, the court heard. \nMr Brownsey said Katniss' mother had struggled to leave the house since the crash, describing the impact on relatives as \"very grave indeed\". \nThe teenager, who was convicted of taking a car in the weeks before the hit and run, was said to have driven to a nearby road where a number of other young people were.\nIt was there he was captured on CCTV remarking \"she's a vegetable\", the court heard. \n\"Katniss was seven, she was a vulnerable road user,\" Mr Brownsey continued.\n\"A very serious aggravating factor is that [the boy] did not stop. \n\"He carried on, knowing what he had done. Knowing he had, in his words, left her as a vegetable.\"\nMr Wheeler said the teenager's crime was in the top category of offending.\n\"It is a case where you have come into possession of a motorbike and drove it in a way that disregarded the safety of others,\" the judge said. \n\"Katniss was very small and very vulnerable. The incident has had a profound effect on her parents.\"\nThe judge added the teenager was also guilty of failing to stop at the scene but had not been charged for this offence because a six-month time limit had expired. \nDet Sgt Paul Hughes, from West Midlands Police, described the guilty plea as a positive step and said the court process needed to run to its conclusion.\n\u201cI will continue to remind people that speculation, especially on social media, does not help Katniss\u2019 family,\" he said. \n\u201cKatniss\u2019 death has had a huge impact on her family and our thoughts remain with them as they continue to come to terms with her tragic death.\u201d\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X, and Instagram, Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk",

    "Churches and other institutions being asked by Stormont to contribute towards redress for victims of historical child abuse have been accused of \"trying to wind the clock down\".\nA compensation scheme was set up for victims and survivors in 2019. \nIt followed a public inquiry that reported back in 2017. \nBut religious orders where abuse took place have yet to make any financial contributions to offset part of the compensation.\nOn Wednesday, a Stormont committee heard concerns about the process.\nAlthough the inquiry recommended that institutions should be asked to make an \"appropriate financial contribution\" to the overall cost of redress, they cannot currently be compelled to do so. \nSinn F\u00e9in assembly member (MLA) Car\u00e1l N\u00ed Chuil\u00edn said: \"I can't help but feel the religious orders are taking the same approach as the state did in terms of legacy, they're trying to wind the clock down and hope that these people (victims) just go away.\n\"They're not going to.\"\nHistorical institutional abuse (HIA) survivors from groups representing people who were abused in state, church or charity-run homes also appeared at the committee.\nJon McCourt, from Survivors North West, said about \u00a390m had been paid out by Stormont since applications for redress opened in April 2020.\nBut the scheme is only due to run for a period of five years.\n\"Surely it is time to press the institutions to step up and contribute significantly to the overall cost of redress and any specialist services,\" he told MLAs.\n\"Any contributions should not be viewed just through a fiscal lens, but acknowledge the harms done, and the pain and suffering of survivors.\"\nMargaret McGuckin from Savia (Survivors & Victims of Institutional Abuse) told MLAs \"many people have been failed\".\n\"What really irks me is TEO (the Executive Office) not doing their job once again and going after the religious orders, it has been one fight after another - why should we do this fighting?\"\nHIA commissioner Fiona Ryan said contributions were \"overdue\" from the institutions, but she said she hoped there was an opportunity to make progress now with an executive in place.\n\"It is a matter of justice and accountability - it is not just financial, it is about acknowledgement and recognising the harm that was done,\" she told the Executive Office committee\nIn 2019, the then-head of the civil service at Stormont, David Sterling, said the government would \"pursue\" churches and others for money to offset part of the HIA compensation.\nHe then wrote to six institutions, including religious orders, about compensation payments in 2019, but to no avail.\nBBC News NI has asked the Executive Office for a response. \nThe Sisters of Nazareth said it was \"continuing to engage\" but it would \"not comment on the ongoing discussions\" with the Executive Office.\nMeanwhile, campaigner Gerry McCann from the Rosetta Trust told the committee he had concerns about a permanent memorial for HIA survivors.\nEarlier this year it emerged that a memorial bench was on track to be installed at Stormont later this year, as part of recommendations from the inquiry calling for a memorial. \n\"I feel it would be inappropriate and insensitive if this bench goes ahead in phase one, it should be a wider programme - a bench doesn't fit it,\" said Mr McCann.\n\"We do have an opportunity, let's get it right.\"\nThe Executive Office previously said the bench would be part of a wider \"phased approach\" to accommodate a range of views, and there would be two further phases of implementation.",
    "An admiral of the Manx herring fleet has been appointed for the first time in more than three decades.\nMarine scientist David Beard was formally appointed to the now ceremonial role by the island\u2019s lieutenant governor during a ceremony at Government House on Tuesday.\nThe 420-year-old tradition was reinstated after a new quota was agreed with the UK, allowing Manx fishermen to fish for it for the first time in 25 years.\nDr Beard said it was an \"honour\" to take on the role, which held \"immense historical significance\".\nTraditionally, the admiral was responsible ensuring vessels were ready for the opening of the fishing season and monitoring fishermen's' conduct at sea.\nThe fleet had existed for centuries, with as many as 350 boats at sea and thousands of people employed during the late 18th Century, however as stocks fell over the intervening decades boats owners looked to shellfish to make a living.\nThe EU Common Fisheries Policy introduced quotas in the 1980s and by the time stocks had recovered the island had been excluded.\nThe admiral\u2019s duties diminished over time and eventually ceased altogether, and although it was briefly revived in the 1960s, nobody has held the role since 1993.\nDr Beard is chief executive of the Manx Fish Producers Organisation (MFPO), which works with the Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture to support the recently reinstated Manx herring fishery.\nHe said the new quotas were helping to \"diversify\" the island's fisheries.\nThe initial 100 tonne limit for 2023, caught by two crews, is set to be increased to 200 tonnes in 2024, so twice as many of the oily fish can be caught and landed by local fishermen.\nLt Gen Sir John Lorimer said Dr Beard was the \"perfect candidate\" as in his position at the MFPO he already worked to \"ensure the Island's fishing industry can be profitable and sustainable\".\nThe appointment was a \"fitting way to celebrate the reintroduction\" of the quota and \"honour an important Manx tradition\", he added.\nThe updated agreement also includes a 100 tonne quota for langoustines in 2024, which have recently been caught by local crews.\nWhy not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

    "It was the most spectacular trial ever held in Vietnam, befitting one of the greatest bank frauds the world has ever seen. \nBehind the stately yellow portico of the colonial-era courthouse in Ho Chi Minh City, a 67-year-old Vietnamese property developer was sentenced to death on Thursday for looting one of the country's largest banks over a period of 11 years. \nIt's a rare verdict - she is one of very few women in Vietnam to be sentenced to death for a white collar crime. \nThe decision is a reflection of the dizzying scale of the fraud. Truong My Lan was convicted of taking out $44bn (\u00a335bn) in loans from the Saigon Commercial Bank. The verdict requires her to return $27bn, a sum prosecutors said may never be recovered. Some believe the death penalty is the court's way of trying to encourage her to return some of the missing billions. \nThe habitually secretive communist authorities were uncharacteristically forthright about this case, going into minute detail for the media. They said 2,700 people were summoned to testify, while 10 state prosecutors and around 200 lawyers were involved. \nThe evidence was in 104 boxes weighing a total of six tonnes. Eighty-five others were tried with Truong My Lan, who denied the charges and can appeal. \nAll of the defendants were found guilty. Four received life in jail. The rest were given prison terms ranging from 20 years to three years suspended. Truong My Lan's husband and niece received jail terms of nine and 17 years respectively.\n\"There has never been a show trial like this, I think, in the communist era,\" says David Brown, a retired US state department official with long experience in Vietnam. \"There has certainly been nothing on this scale.\"\nThe trial was the most dramatic chapter so far in the \"Blazing Furnaces\" anti-corruption campaign led by the Communist Party Secretary-General, Nguyen Phu Trong. \nA conservative ideologue steeped in Marxist theory, Nguyen Phu Trong believes that popular anger over untamed corruption poses an existential threat to the Communist Party's monopoly on power. He began the campaign in earnest in 2016 after out-manoeuvring the then pro-business prime minister to retain the top job in the party. \nThe campaign has seen two presidents and two deputy prime ministers forced to resign, and hundreds of officials disciplined or jailed. Now one of the country's richest women has joined their ranks.  \nTruong My Lan comes from a Sino-Vietnamese family in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. It has long been the commercial engine of the Vietnamese economy, dating well back to its days as the anti-communist capital of South Vietnam, with a large, ethnic Chinese community. \nShe started as a market stall vendor, selling cosmetics with her mother, but began buying land and property after the Communist Party ushered in a period of economic reform, known as Doi Moi, in 1986. By the 1990s, she owned a large portfolio of hotels and restaurants.\nAlthough Vietnam is best known outside the country for its fast-growing manufacturing sector, as an alternative supply chain to China, most wealthy Vietnamese made their money developing and speculating in property. \nAll land is officially state-owned. Getting access to it often relies on personal relationships with state officials. Corruption escalated as the economy grew, and became endemic. \nBy 2011, Truong My Lan was a well-known business figure in Ho Chi Minh City, and she was allowed to arrange the merger of three smaller, cash-strapped banks into a larger entity: Saigon Commercial Bank. \nVietnamese law prohibits any individual from holding more than 5% of the shares in any bank. But prosecutors say that through hundreds of shell companies and people acting as her proxies, Truong My Lan actually owned more than 90% of Saigon Commercial. \nThey accused her of using that power to appoint her own people as managers, and then ordering them to approve hundreds of loans to the network of shell companies she controlled.\nThe amounts taken out are staggering. Her loans made up 93% of all the bank's lending. \nAccording to prosecutors, over a period of three years from February 2019, she ordered her driver to withdraw 108 trillion Vietnamese dong, more than $4bn (\u00a32.3bn) in cash from the bank, and store it in her basement. \nThat much cash, even if all of it was in Vietnam's largest denomination banknotes, would weigh two tonnes. \nShe was also accused of bribing generously to ensure her loans were never scrutinised. A former chief inspector at the central bank was given a life sentence for accepting a $5m bribe.\nThe mass of officially sanctioned publicity about the case channelled public anger over corruption against Truong My Lan, whose fatigued, unmade-up appearance in court was in stark contrast to the glamorous publicity photos people had seen of her in the past. \nBut questions are also being asked about why she was able to keep on with the alleged fraud for so long.\n\"I am puzzled,\" says Le Hong Hiep who runs the Vietna",

    "A former sub-postmistress who was wrongly jailed while she was pregnant has rejected an apology by a former Post Office boss who congratulated the team behind her conviction.\n\"Brilliant news. Well done,\" wrote then managing director David Smith in an email to colleagues in 2010.\nSeema Misra was eight weeks pregnant with her second child when she was sentenced to 15 months in prison.\nMr Smith apologised to Mrs Misra at the inquiry into the Post Office scandal.\nHe said that in hindsight, his email following her conviction was \"poorly thought through\".\nBut following Thursday's evidence, Mrs Misra told the BBC: \"How can I accept the apology? They need to apologise to my 10 year old, they took his mum away on his birthday.\n\"I was eight weeks pregnant - they need to apologise to my youngest son. It was terrible. I haven't accepted the apologies.\"\nMrs Misra was sent to Bronzefield prison on the day of her eldest son's 10th birthday after being wrongly convicted of stealing \u00a370,000 from her Post Office branch in the village of West Byfleet in Surrey.\nShe served four-and-a-half months and gave birth to her second son wearing an electronic tag. \nShe told the BBC that she had seen Mr Smith's email before. \"Seeing it again makes me more and more angry,\" she added.\nMrs Misra was one of more than 700 sub-postmasters and postmistresses prosecuted between 1999 and 2015 for theft and false accounting after a faulty computer system called Horizon made it look like money was missing from their branches.\nSome, like Mrs Misra, were convicted and sent to prison. Many others were left financially ruined and lost their jobs, businesses and homes. Some died while waiting for justice.\nHundreds of people wrongly convicted are set to have their names cleared under new legislation expected to come into force in July, but when it comes to financial redress, just 37 people have received full and final compensation settlements to date.\nMr Smith was managing director of the Post Office from April to October 2010. His brief stint in charge was prior to Paula Vennells - who was heavily depicted in the ITV drama which thrust the scandal back into the spotlight - taking up the role as chief executive from 2012 to 2019.\nIn his witness statement to the public inquiry, Mr Smith said his email following Mrs Misra's conviction was \"intended to be a congratulatory\" to the legal team.\n\"Brilliant news. Well done. Please pass on my thanks to the team,\" said Mr Smith's 2010 email. \nAsked by Sam Stevens, counsel to the inquiry, on Thursday why Mrs Misra's conviction was \"brilliant news\", Mr Smith replied: \"I would just like to place on record an apology to Seema Misra and family because of the way this has been perceived and portrayed subsequently. \n\"Looking at it through their eyes rather than through mine you can see that it may have caused substantial upset and I really do apologise for that.\"\nMr Smith said his email to the legal team was \"thank you for all your hard work. It's terrific that you got the result you got and I'm really happy that we have progressed\".\n\"It's nothing more or less than that,\" he added, but admitted: \"In the benefit of hindsight and looking through the 2024 lens and not the 2010 lens, at best, from Seema's perspective, you can see this is really poorly thought through.\"\nThe former managing director said Mrs Misra's conviction, which has since been overturned, was seen as a \"test\" of the Horizon system, which the organisation believed was \"tamper proof\".\nMr Smith denied having knowledge of a Horizon bug before the trial of the subpostmistress in 2010, and said he was \"shocked and frankly appalled\" at claims the Post Office knew of faults in the IT system while prosecuting Mrs Misra.\nMr Smith also rejected claims that an investigation commissioned - known as the Ismay report - into the computer system's integrity was a cover up.\nThe essence of the report, produced by Rod Ismay who worked in finance at the Post Office in 2010, was that there were no fundamental problems with Horizon.\nIn May last year, Mr Ismay told the inquiry he agreed with the suggestion he was asked to \"present one side of the coin\", rather than carry out a full investigation.\nMr Smith denied the report was intended as a \"counter-argument\" to allegations against Horizon, but accepted in his witness statement that in hindsight he should have commissioned a full, independent probe.\n\"At the time we were repeatedly given reassurance that the system was robust,\" said Mr Smith.\nFormer Post Office chairman Sir Michael Hodgkinson also apologised to sub-postmasters on Thursday.\nSir Michael, who was chairman from 2003 to 2007 admitted to the inquiry he \"didn't do anything\" to check if the business was prosecuting its own people properly.",
    "President Joe Biden has vowed that the US will defend the Philippines from any attack in the South China Sea, calling its support for Manila \"ironclad\". \nMr Biden's comments come amid regular skirmishes and rising tensions between Chinese and Philippine coast guard vessels in the disputed waterway.\nThe US and Philippines have had a mutual defence treaty in place since 1951. \nChina has repeatedly blamed the US for raising tensions in the region. \nSpeaking at the start of three-way talks at the White House with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, Mr Biden said that \"any attack on Philippine aircraft, vessels or armed forces in the South China Sea would invoke our mutual defence treaty\".\nMr Marcos visit to Washington comes several days after his country accused a Chinese vessel of \"highly dangerous manoeuvres\" near the Second Thomas Shoal, a disputed maritime region near the Spratly Islands. \nThe incident is one of several in which Chinese ships have been accused of harassment in the area, which has included firing water cannons and ramming Philippine ships. \nWhile the three leaders did not specify China by name, Mr Marcos said that they share an \"unwavering commitment to the rules-based international order.\" \nChina, for its part, has repeatedly shrugged off criticism of its actions in the South China Sea and blamed the US for inflaming tensions in the Indo-Pacific.\n\"No one should violate China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and China remains steadfast in safeguarding our lawful rights,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Thursday. \nAccording to the White House and Japan's foreign ministry, the three countries plan to advance \"trilateral defence cooperation\", including through joint naval exercises. \nThe trilateral meeting comes one day after Mr Biden and Mr Kishida announced a raft of agreements between the US and Japan, focused in large part on strengthening defence ties in the face of a potential threat from China. \nThose plans include an an expanded air defence network incorporating Australia, as well as a joint command structure between the US and Japan. \nAdditionally, US and Japanese forces will participate in three-way military exercises with the UK. \nSpeaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr Kishida acknowledged that the US and Japan would respond to \"challenges\" from China, even if they hope to continue \"our dialogue with China and co-operating with China on common challenges\".

    "Net migration to the UK fell more than 10% in 2023, according to official figures.\nAfter a record number of people came to the UK in 2022, the government sharply increased salary requirements for visas, to try to cut numbers.\nNet migration - the number of people coming to the UK, minus the number leaving - was 685,000 in 2023, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show. \nJust over 1.2 million people came to the UK expecting to stay at least a year, and around 532,000 departed. \nThat's a fall from 2022's record net migration figure, which has been revised upwards to 764,000.\nHowever, the ONS said it was \"too early to say if this is the start of a new downward trend\".\nOf the 1,218,000 who came to the UK in 2023, 10% (126,000) were EU nationals.

The top five non-EU nationalities were: \nThe ONS says approximately 62,000 more Pakistani nationals, 127,000 more Nigerian nationals and 178,000 more Indian nationals came to the UK in 2023 compared with 2019.\nThe number of people coming to the UK for humanitarian reasons in 2023 - including from Ukraine and Hong Kong - was 50,000, compared to 160,000 in 2022. \nMost people wanting to work in the UK still have to apply for a visa through the points-based system (PBS).\nBut since 11 April 2024, they have needed a job offer with a higher salary.\nApplicants have to earn at least \u00a338,700 - an increase of nearly 50% from the previous \u00a326,200 minimum.\nThe threshold does not apply to some jobs - such as in health and social care, and teachers on national pay scales. But overseas care workers can no longer bring family dependants with them. \nAnnouncing the new rules, Home Secretary James Cleverly claimed300,000 people who were eligible to come to the UK in 2022 would no longer qualify.\nAt the time, groups including the CBI and the Royal College of Nursing criticised the government for failing to address the UK's labour shortages.\nYou need a family visa if you want to live with a relative who is a British citizen, or someone who has the right to be in the UK for more than six months.\nHome Office statistics show thatnearly 80,000 family-related visas were grantedin the year ending March 2024, an increase of 22% on the previous year.\nYou can apply to live with your:\nYou have to demonstrate a good knowledge of English, and meet the minimum income threshold.\nThis was initially due to rise to \u00a338,700 - a sharp increase from the previous \u00a318,600 figure.\nBut after warnings the new rules risked separating families, the government dropped the new minimum to \u00a329,000.\nThe amount will increase in the future, however, first to \u00a334,500 and then \u00a338,700. Mr Sunak said the higher threshold would be reached \"in early 2025\".\nAnyone renewing an existing family visa will not have to meet the new earnings threshold, the Home Office has confirmed.\nHome Office data showed the number of people coming to the UK to work in health and social care has fallen to its lowest monthly level for more than two years.\nIt said 2,200 health and care worker visas and 6,400 visas for their dependents were granted in April.\nThe total number of visas granted during the first four months of the year showed a 76% fall compared with the same period in 2023.\nThe number of dependents' visas for care workers dropped by 6% over the same period.\nApplicants need 70 points to qualify for a skilled worker visa.\nYou get 50 points from having a job offer above a minimum skill level, and speaking English.\nThe remaining 20 points can come from a higher salary, working in a sector with job shortages, or having a relevant PhD.\nThe standard fee for a skilled visa is usually between \u00a3719 and \u00a31,500. \nVisa applicants also have to pay a healthcare surcharge for each year of their stay.\nThe amount can vary - but since April 2024, the standard fee has been \u00a31,035 per year, up from \u00a3624. \nThe immigration salary list has replaced what was previously called the shortage occupation list. \nIt helps employers fill vacancies in key sectors. \nThese jobs have a lower salary threshold, making it easier for applicants to gain enough points to get a visa.\nThe list includes:\nEmployers used to be able to pay foreign workers 80% of the usual \"going rate\" to fill these positions. \nBut this rule has been abolished for people applying after 4 April 2024. \nIn the 12 months to the end of March 2024, the government issued almost 450,000 study visas, 6% fewer than the previous year.\nOf these, 116,000 were issued to Indian nationals, and 109,000 to Chinese nationals.\nThose on postgraduate courses could also apply for visas for qualifying dependants: a husband, wife, civil or unmarried partner and children under 18. \nIn the year to March 2024, 111,000 visas were issued to student dependants, a fall of 25%.\nSince January 2024, international postgraduate students have not been able bring dependants unless their course is a research programme.\nBetween January a",
    "A memoir written by Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny before his imprisonment and death is to be published later this year.\nThe political campaigner \"wrote the entire memoir himself,\" publishers Vintage told the BBC.\nNavalny began work on his book while recovering from his 2020 poisoning with a nerve agent.\nHe died in February after three years in jail for charges widely seen as politically motivated. \nHis memoir will be \"the full story of his life: his youth, his call to activism, his marriage and family, and his commitment to the cause of Russian democracy and freedom in the face of a world superpower determined to silence him,\" Vintage said.\nThe publisher added that it \"expresses Navalny's total conviction that change cannot be resisted and will come\".\nThe book - due out in around six months - is slated to include \"never-before-seen correspondence from prison\", according to Vintage. \nThe campaigner and lawyer recounts \"his political career, the many attempts on his life, and the lives of the people closest to him, and the relentless campaign he and his team waged against an increasingly dictatorial regime\" in the work.\nNavalny's widow, Yulia, said: \"This book is a testament not only to Alexei's life, but to his unwavering commitment to the fight against dictatorship - a fight he gave everything for, including his life. \n\"Through its pages, readers will come to know the man I loved deeply - a man of profound integrity and unyielding courage.\"\nShe said that sharing his story would honour his memory and \"inspire others to stand up for what is right and to never lose sight of the values that truly matter\".\nNavalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) exposed corruption at almost every level of the Russian state - frequently targeting President Vladimir Putin and his entourage. \nNavalny was immediately imprisoned after returning to Russia in 2021. He was moved to one of Russia's toughest penal colonies shortly before his death.\nAccording to the prison service, he had gone for a walk when he lost consciousness and died.\nOne of his closest allies, FBK chief Ivan Zhdanov, said it was \"highly likely\" Navalny had been murdered. \nVintage described the book as \"Navalny's final letter to the world\".\nThe publisher called it an account of his last years spent in \"the most brutal prison on Earth; a reminder of why the principles of individual freedom matter so deeply; and a rousing call to continue the work for which he sacrificed his life\".\nNavalny, 47, was last seen in public the day before his death, looking well and laughing during a court hearing via video link.\nThe book will be published on 22 October.",
    "Unpaid carers who have been told to repay thousands of pounds of benefits after accidentally earning too much money years ago say it is wrong and unfair. \nTwo former Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) ministers have told the BBC they are calling for the government to pause its demands for repayments of large sums of money.\nGina Price had been looking after her dad for a decade before she realised she could apply for Carer's Allowance in 2013. \nBy this time she was working part-time at a petrol station as well as caring for her father, who had a series of conditions including a hip replacement that did not go to plan. She says she received Carer's Allowance for about five years. \nShe says she would sometimes agree to work an extra shift, but would do fewer other weeks. This way, she believed she would remain under the earnings threshold to qualify for the benefit.\nBut in 2019, she received a letter saying she owed the DWP about \u00a37,600, to cover overpayments for periods over three-and-a-half years to February 2018. \nThe 59-year-old says she was \"astounded\" by the amount, and has been repaying \u00a3100 a month since. \n\"It's always grieved me,\" she says. \"I think it's so unfair.\" \nA DWP spokesperson said it is \"committed to fairness in the welfare system\" and that safeguards are in place \"for managing repayments while protecting the public purse.\"\nMs Price is one of dozens of listeners who shared their stories with the BBC after the issue was covered on Radio 2's Jeremy Vine show.\nFull-time carers can claim \u00a381.90 a week, but they become ineligible for the whole amount if they earn just a pound over \u00a3151 a week, after tax and expenses. Carers told the BBC they were unaware they had exceeded the threshold until being informed years later, when the sums had run into the thousands.\nMs Price, from Carmarthenshire in south-west Wales, says: \"I'm sorry to my heart I ever [claimed it], because it was an absolute nightmare amount to owe.\"\nIt added to her grief after her father died in 2019, she says, describing the debt as a \"big, big weight on me on top of everything else\".\n\"I was so browbeaten after everything with my father, he was dying by the time they'd approached me, and I just wanted to pay them, keep them off my back, and I needed to get on with my life,\" she said.\nThe DWP has faced criticism for failing to prevent overpayments, despite having the ability to do so, and allowing some recipients to end up in legal trouble.\nBenefit staff get automatic alerts from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if a Carer's Allowance claimant is earning too much.\nClaimants have a responsibility to ensure they are entitled to benefits they claim, the DWP says.\nFive years ago, the House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee accused the DWP of \"bullying and harassing\" those who had been overpaid.\nIn a report it published in 2019, it also said problems with the DWP's systems, and staff shortages, had led to \"substantial backlogs\" in checking flagged cases of potential overpayments.\nAs of February 2023, the DWP said it was seeking to recover 145,567 overpayments of Carer's Allowance, which is given to people who provide at least 35 hours a week of care. That includes almost 12,000 cases concerning overpayments of between \u00a35,001 and \u00a320,000.\nAndrea Hawley, from Battle in East Sussex, believes she will be repaying money for the next decade. \nThe 50-year-old left her job in 2009 to care for her son, who has a genetic disorder, autism, a learning delay, and skeletal and heart problems. \nShe started working part-time in her family business for about two hours a day, while claiming Carer's Allowance.\nIn 2019, Mrs Hawley says she received a letter telling her she owed the DWP just over \u00a314,000 - later reduced to about \u00a312,700 - in overpayments made between May 2013 and December 2017.\n\"I can remember being so shocked I could have fallen through the floor,\" she told BBC News.\nThe DWP arranged to deduct \u00a380 a month from her Carer's Allowance to cover the overpayments. Mrs Hawley says she stopped receiving the benefit in 2022, and now pays \u00a350 monthly from her wages. \nShe says she did not realise she was above the earnings threshold, adding: \"It's just so wrong. Why don't they let you know sooner? \n\"Why do they let it go for years and years and years, and then say 'you owe us all this money'?\".\nCristina Odone, head of the family policy unit at the Centre for Social Justice, told the BBC the \"so-called debts should be forgiven\".\nShe added: \"One of the causes for this scandalous miscarriage of justice is that the DWP's own IT system was able to flag when the earnings threshold was breached, but they failed to alert the carers themselves that they were now in a perilous situation and could end up owing thousands of pounds.\"\nLesley Whitehouse, 53, from Coventry, spent years as the primary carer for her sister who has severe mental and physical disabilities.\nA social worker told her she was eligible for Carer's Allowance and helped her fill in the for",
    "The UK has returned dozens of artefacts looted from what is today Ghana - more than 150 years after they were taken. \nSome 32 gold and silver items have been sent on long-term loan to the country by the Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A) and the British Museum.\nThey were stolen from the court of the Asante king, known as the Asantehene, during 19th century conflicts between the British and powerful Asante people. \nThe objects are expected to be returned to the current king on Friday.\nHis chief negotiator, Ivor Agyeman-Duah, told the BBC that the objects are currently in \"safe hands\" in Ghana ahead of them being formally received. \nThey are due to go on display next month at the Manhyia Palace Museum in Kumasi, the capital of the Ashanti region, as part of celebrations to mark the silver jubilee of the current Asante King Otumfuo Osei Tutu II.\nIn January, the BBC reported long-term loan deals to return the items had been agreed. \nAmong the returned artefacts are a gold peace pipe, a sword of state and gold badges worn by officials charged with cleansing the soul of the king.\nThe gold artefacts are the ultimate symbol of the Asante royal government and are believed to be invested with the spirits of former Asante kings.\nNana Oforiatta Ayim, special adviser to Ghana's culture minister, previously told the BBC that the objects were \"part of the soul of the nation\" and that it was \"pieces of ourselves returning\". \nThe loan, which was negotiated with the king and not with the Ghanaian government, will last for three years with the option to extend for a further three years.\nThe Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A) is lending 17 pieces and 15 are from the British Museum.\nBoth museums have said they are delighted to have been able to have returned the objects on loan as part of an important cultural collaboration. \nSome national museums in the UK - including the V&A and the British Museum - are banned by law from permanently giving back contested items in their collections, and loan deals such as this are seen as a way to allow objects to return to their countries of origin.\nThe return of the Asante items comes a month ahead of celebrations marking the silver jubilee of the Asantehene. \nThe Asante people built what was once one of the most powerful and formidable states in west Africa - trading in, among others, gold, textiles and enslaved people.\nThe kingdom was famed for its military might and wealth. Even now, when the Asantehene shakes hands on official occasions, he can be so weighed down with heavy gold bracelets that he sometimes has an aide whose job is to support his arm.\nEuropeans were attracted to what they later named the Gold Coast by the stories of African wealth and Britain fought repeated battles with the Asante in the 19th Century.\nIn 1874 after an Asante attack, British troops launched a \"punitive expedition\", in the colonial language of the time, ransacking Kumasi and taking many of the palace treasures.\nMost of the items the V&A returned were bought at an auction on 18 April 1874 at Garrards, the London jewellers who maintain the UK's Crown Jewels, while some of those the British Museum is loaning were looted during a later conflict in 1895-96. \nThe return of the artefacts comes during a continuing debate over what to do with other items exported from their native lands - including the Benin Bronzes and Elgin Marbles, also known as the Parthenon Sculptures. \nSome countries laying claim to disputed artefacts fear that loans may be used to imply they accept the UK's ownership.\nHowever, these types of agreements are seen by others as a way for Britain to confront the cultural legacy of its colonial past while also building better relationships for the future.

    "US President Joe Biden has said he is considering a request from Australia to drop the prosecution of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.\nThe country's parliament recently passed a measure - backed by PM Anthony Albanese - calling for the return of Mr Assange to his native Australia. \nThe US wants to extradite the 52-year-old from the UK on criminal charges over the leaking of military records.\nMr Assange denies the charges, saying the leaks were an act of journalism.\nThe president was asked about Australia's request on Wednesday and said: \"We're considering it.\"\nMr Albanese said Mr Biden's comments were \"encouraging\" and he was \"increasingly optimistic about an outcome\".\n\"We want Mr Assange to be able to return home,\" he told Sky News Australia.\nThe Australian measure passed parliament in February. At the time, Mr Albanese told MPs: \"People will have a range of views about Mr Assange's conduct... But regardless of where people stand, this thing cannot just go on and on and on indefinitely.\"\nMr Assange, 52, is fighting extradition in the UK courts. \nThe extradition was put on hold in March after London's High Court said the United States must provide assurances he would not face the death penalty.\nThe High Court is due to evaluate any responses from the US authorities at the end of May. \nMr Assange's wife Stella said she was also encouraged by Mr Biden's comments.\n\"It looks like things could be moving in the right direction,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that she believed the president should have dropped the case against her husband on the first day of his premiership. \n\"Lots of people around the world... have been saying for years that this case should be dropped, that it is a danger to press freedom.\"\nWhen asked about her husband's health, Stella Assange said he was \"extremely unwell\".\n\"He's stressed, obviously, because he could be extradited to the US to face 175 years in prison.\"\nKristinn Hrafnsson, the current editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, said that it was \"not too late\" for the American president to stop the extradition attempt, which he said was a \"politically motivated act\" by Mr Biden's predecessor.\nUS prosecutors want to try the Wikileaks founder on 18 counts, almost all under the Espionage Act, over the release of confidential US military records and diplomatic messages relating to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nMr Assange founded the Wikileaks website in 2006. It claims to have published more than ten million documents, including many confidential or restricted official reports related to war, spying and corruption.\nIn 2010, it released a video from a US military helicopter which showed civilians being killed in the Iraqi capital Baghdad. \nIt also published thousands of confidential documents supplied by former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. \nThese suggested that the US military had killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents during the war in Afghanistan.\nManning leaked the files to Wikileaks in 2010. She was later jailed for 35 years, but former President Barack Obama commuted her sentence in 2017.\nThe US Department of Justice called the leaks \"one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States\".\nMr Assange has been in Belmarsh prison in London for the past five years pending a number of legal challenges. \nBefore that he had taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy for seven years.\nHe initially faced a Swedish arrest warrant accusing him of having raped one woman and sexually assaulted another. He denied the claims. \nIn 2019 the Swedish authorities dropped the case, after he had been indicted on the US charges, saying too much time had passed since the original complaint.",
    "Canada's government says it is preparing for another \"explosive\" wildfire season, for which it is training extra firefighters.\nA warmer-than-normal winter has left little snow on the ground and has compounded droughts in several regions. \nLast year was by far Canada's worst for wildfires, with 15 million hectares (37 million acres) of forest burned. \nLinking the issue to climate change, a minister warned that this year could prove even more devastating.\nThe summer was impossible to predict, but wildfires would continue to pose a \"significant challenge\" for the foreseeable future, said Harjit Sajjan, the minister for emergency preparedness. \nAt a news conference, Mr Sajjan called attention to \"extreme drought conditions\" in southern Alberta, British Columbia and Southern Ontario.\nHe said above-normal temperatures had also caused earlier snow-melts, and that heat and dryness nationwide meant that the wildfire season was likely to start sooner.\nGlobally, last year was the hottest on record - driven by human-caused warming, but also boosted by a natural weather system called El Ni\u00f1o.\nThe continuing effects of El Ni\u00f1o mean that 2024 could see even higher temperatures.\nUnder a raft of measures, ministers say they will double a tax credit available to volunteer firefighters, and will provide millions of dollars to provinces and territories for the purchase of specialised equipment.\nEight firefighters died and some 230,000 people were displaced from their homes during last year's worst-ever season.\nThousands of firefighters - including some drafted in from countries including South Africa and Spain - were deployed to fight the blazes, along with members of the armed forces.\nAuthorities' figure of 15 million hectares burnt in 2023 is a downward revision of the 18 million they had previously given. But this is still roughly seven times the annual average.\nSmoke from the fires was also experienced as far away as the US and Europe.\nThis year, dozens of fires are already burning, with several categorised by fire authorities as being \"out of control\".\nElsewhere, so-called zombie fires have been burning over the winter under thick layers of snow cover.\nFires happen naturally in many parts of the world. It is difficult to know if climate change has caused a specific wildfire to spread because other factors are also relevant, such as changing land use.\nBut climate change is making the weather conditions needed for wildfires to spread more likely, according to the UN's climate body.\nExtreme and long-lasting heat draws more and more moisture out of the ground and vegetation.\nThese tinder-dry conditions provide fuel for fires, which can spread at an incredible speed, particularly if winds are strong.\nRising temperatures may also increase the likelihood of lightning in the world's northernmost forests, increasing the risk of fires.\n\"Wildfires have always occurred across Canada,\" acknowledged another minister, Jonathan Wilkinson, during Wednesday's briefing. \"What is new is their frequency and their intensity.\" ",

The UK government is contributing \u00a3500m towards the total cost of the project.\nUnions had produced their own alternative plan which reduced job losses by keeping at least one blast furnace going until the new electric arc furnace was ready. But the idea was rejected by Tata Steel, which cited safety risks if the new furnace was built near a hot metal production line.\nSupport in place for staff includes a \u00a3100m transition fund, which includes \u00a380m from the UK government and \u00a320m from Tata.",
    "Three men were rescued by the US Coast Guard off an island in Micronesia after they sent out a plea for \"HELP\" using palm tree leaves.\nThey spelled out \"HELP\" with the leaves, which led to the rescue nine days after they left on a sailing trip.\nThey had been reported missing after failing to return from a journey to Pikelot Atoll - an uninhabited coral island about 415 miles from Guam. \nIt is the second time in four years people were rescued from the island.\nThe Coast Guard said in a statement that the three experienced mariners, all unnamed men in their 40s, had embarked on their sailing trip from Polowat Atoll - an island that is a part of the Federated States of Micronesia. \nThey departed on Easter Sunday for Pikelot Atoll, about 115 miles away, in a traditional 20-foot skiff with an outboard motor, the Coast Guard added. \nAfter failing to return, a relative of the men alerted the Coast Guard's Joint Rescue Sub-Center in Guam that her three uncles were missing, sparking a search and rescue mission.\nFirst responders were initially searching an area that was more than 78,000 square nautical miles in poor weather conditions. But then they spotted the men from the air - thanks to the makeshift \"HELP\" sign.\n\"In a remarkable testament to their will to be found, the mariners spelled out 'HELP' on the beach using palm leaves, a crucial factor in their discovery,\" said Lt Chelsea Garcia, who led the search and rescue mission the day they were located.\n\"This act of ingenuity was pivotal in guiding rescue efforts directly to their location,\" she said.\nCoast Guard personnel then airdropped survival packages and a radio to the men while a US Coast Guard vessel made its way to the island.\nThe mariners later radioed back and said they were in good health and had access to food and water, the US Coast Guard said. \nThey also had recovered their skiff, which sustained damage that rendered it non-functional, and said they needed help getting back to Polowat. \nAfter departing on their voyage on 31 March, the sailors were officially rescued off the island on 9 April.\nThe US Coast Guard said the rescue is an example of the strong coordination between the US and the Federal States of Micronesia, as well as US Navy personnel who are stationed in the area.\nMicronesia, in the western Pacific, consists of some 600 tiny islands scattered over a vast ocean expanse.\n\"Every life saved, and every mariner returned home is a testament to the enduring partnership and mutual respect that characterizes our relationship,\" said Lt Cdr Christine Igisomar, who was also part of the search and rescue mission.\nThough uninhabited, Pikelot Atoll is often temporarily visited by hunters and fishermen. It has also been the site of another rescue in recent years. \nIn 2020, three Micronesian mariners were saved - by the Australian Defence Force - after spelling out \"SOS\" on the beach. ",
    "Former Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson had an affair with his deputy press secretary during his time in No 10, two of his advisers have revealed. \nJoe Haines and Lord Donoughue kept the secret for nearly 50 years. \nMr Haines, 96, spoke about Mr Wilson's relationship with Janet Hewlett-Davies for the first time in an interview with the Times newspaper.\nLord Donoughue told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he also knew about the affair. \nThere were persistent rumours that Mr Wilson, who was married, had an affair with his political secretary, Marcia Williams, later Baroness Falkender. He repeatedly denied the claims. \nHowever, this is the first time there has been any suggestion of a romantic relationship with Ms Hewlett-Davies, who was Mr Haines's deputy as press secretary and was also married.\nMr Wilson was prime minister twice, from 1964 to 1970, as well as 1974 to 1976. \nMr Haines told the Times Ms Hewlett-Davies confessed to the affair \"by pure chance\" after he spotted her climbing the staircase to the prime minister's room in Downing Street one evening in 1974, during his second term in No 10. \nWhen asked what she was doing, she then revealed the relationship to him. \nOn another occasion, in 1976, Mr Haines said he had given up his usual room at Chequers, which had an adjoining door to the prime minister's for Ms Hewlett-Davies, and Mr Wilson left his slippers under her bed.\nMs Hewlett-Davies was 22 years younger than Mr Wilson and in her thirties at the time.\nLord Donoughue, who was the head of Mr Wilson's policy unit and made a Labour peer in 1985, said he was told about the relationship by Mr Haines and later raised it indirectly with the prime minister. \n\"Towards the end, because he had a lot of time on his hands, he used to take me for walks around Number 10 to have a little gossip,\" he told Today.\n\"On one such walk, he in a very Wilsonian way, because he wasn't a very direct person, he said he was very pleased I was a friend of Janet...\n\"And I replied by saying I thought Janet was a lovely and terrific person. And I then added in the Wilsonian way, which I'd learned from him, and I'm very pleased your relationship is so close and so good.\"\nLord Donoughue, 89, said the PM then told him \"he'd never been happier\". \nAt the end of his premiership Mr Wilson was often portrayed as running a divided government, paranoid about the security services and showing the first signs of dementia. \nHowever, Lord Donoughue said the affair was \"a little sunshine at sunset\".\nHe said the two advisers had kept the secret until now because \"we thought it would be used damagingly against them at that time\" and wanted to wait until they had both died. \nAfter Ms Hewlett-Davies died last October, they decided to reveal the relationship to ensure the \"full story\" of Mr Wilson's premiership was told. \n\"I felt as a sometime historian this was important to go in the historical record of Wilson,\" Lord Donoughue added. \nHe told the BBC Mr Wilson had also had a brief sexual relationship with Baroness Falkender 20 years earlier, despite the former prime minister suing publications which reported they had an affair.\nAs one of only three Labour leaders since World War Two to win a general election, Harold Wilson is a towering figure in the party and a political hero of current leader Sir Keir Starmer.\nHe served as prime minister twice, from October 1964 to June 1970 and from March 1974 to April 1976, when he unexpectedly stood down, after realising his once formidable mental powers were in decline.\nBorn in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, he came to power as the 1960s began to swing, promising to forge a new Britain in the \"white heat of technology\". In 1965, he shocked the establishment by having The Beatles awarded with MBEs.\nBut his time in power was marred by economic decline and industrial strife. Perhaps his most enduring legacy - and the thing he was most proud of - was the creation of the Open University in 1969.\nHe died in 1995 at the age of 79, while his wife of 55 years, Mary, died in 2018 aged 102.

    "The first time I crossed into Gaza through the Erez checkpoint in 1991 it was not much more than a few bored Israeli soldiers in a shed, checking IDs, before they let visitors drive their cars through an opening in the barbed wire and into Gaza. \nIn the years since then, it evolved into a gleaming terminal, with complex layers of concrete walls, defences and steel gates, all covered with dozens of CCTV cameras. Only the very trusted and privileged were allowed to drive through Erez. Journalists had to walk and drag their bags with them. \nUntil 7 October, when Hamas fighters smashed through Erez. They attacked the nearby military base, killing Israeli soldiers and taking others hostage. Since then, it has been closed to all but the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). \nAs part of Israel's attempt to placate President Joe Biden after seven workers from the World Central Kitchen charity were killed by the IDF, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to reopen Erez to humanitarian convoys. \nThat matters because it is the simplest way to get aid to perhaps 300,000 Palestinians in northern Gaza. The most authoritative measure of food emergencies, known as the IPC, has warned that famine will have gripped the area in the next four weeks or so. Joe Biden's humanitarian envoy to Gaza, David Satterfield, said on Wednesday that there was \"an imminent risk of famine for the majority, if not all, the 2.2 million population of Gaza\". \nThe famine has been caused by the siege Israel imposed just after the 7 October attacks. At the time the Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant said: \"I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip. There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed. \n\"We are fighting human animals, and we are acting accordingly.\" \nIsrael was forced by international pressure to allow in limited supplies of aid. But over six months it has not been anything like enough. Israel argued, inaccurately, that hunger in Gaza was caused by Hamas stealing and stockpiling aid and the UN's failure to distribute what was left.\nClose supporters of Prime Minister Netanyahu continue to deny there is a famine. One of them, an MP called Boaz Bismuth, told me at Israel's parliament that there was no famine in Gaza and allegations that Israel was starving civilians were based on antisemitism. The evidence of famine, however, is overwhelming.\nThe Erez crossing, despite the prime minister's promise to Joe Biden, is still closed. I managed to get close enough to look down on the Erez terminal. Nothing was moving. I couldn't see people, let alone trucks. Reports in Israel say the government is talking about opening another crossing, less easily accessible to Israeli demonstrators who do not want any food or medical aid to enter Gaza while the hostages are still there and have been blocking some convoys. \nThe UN and other aid providers say every day counts to try to help people caught up in the humanitarian catastrophe inside Gaza. The fact that Erez is closed looks like a delaying tactic. The Jewish ultranationalists whose backing keeps Mr Netanyahu in power also do not want to send in aid.  \nThe denial of famine fits seamlessly into the century of conflict between Arabs and Jews for possession of the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. \nThe conflict is sustained not just by years of Israeli occupation of land in Gaza and the West Bank including East Jerusalem that Palestinians want as a state, and the opposition of armed groups, notably Hamas, to Israel's existence. They also have opposing, wildly different national stories about their right to be there. The bitterness and bloodshed of the last six months have deepened the dehumanising differences between the two sides. \nI have spoken to many Palestinians and Israeli civilians in the last six months about their views of the war. It is hard to speak to Israeli soldiers, at least when they are in uniform. IDF spokespeople try hard to control the messages that reach journalists. But since much of Israel's fighting strength depends on mobilising reservists, it is much easier to talk to them when they are back in civilian life. \nIn an unscientific attempt to get a feel for the beliefs and perceptions of Israeli soldiers after six months of war I went to Ben Gurion University of the Negev, in the town of Beersheba in southern Israel. It is only about 25 miles from Gaza. \nThe rector of the university, Chaim Hames, told me that more than 100 members of their community - students, staff, faculty and their families - had been killed or taken hostage on 7 October. 6,500 students from a student body of 20,000 were mobilised. The war, Mr Hames said, was always close. \n\"The hospital is just across the road, the helicopters constantly ferrying the wounded from Gaza. Students are sitting in the classrooms. They hear the helicopters coming in and out, and many of them have friends who are still on active duty. It impacts everything.\" \nI spoke to three young men ",
    "A variety of stories feature on Friday's front pages. \nThe Times reports that teachers, MPs and campaigners have accused technology company Meta of taking a \"highly irresponsible\" approach to child safety after it lowered the minimum age for WhatsApp from 16 to 13. A member of the Commons Education Select Committee describes the decision as reckless. The paper says there are concerns the messaging app is fostering cyberbullying, sleep deprivation, and the spread of harmful content among children.  \nComments by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer feature in two papers. He's told the i that he would increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP if he becomes prime minister. He said a more dangerous world made it necessary to spend more on the military. \nIn an article for the Daily Mail, Sir Keir promises what he calls a \"triple lock\" on the UK's nuclear weapons - to build at least four new nuclear submarines in Barrow-in-Furness, to maintain a continuous at-sea nuclear deterrent and to deliver all future upgrades needed. In a separate editorial, the paper says defence has historically been Labour's weak spot, but not today. It points to a recent poll showing that the party is now more trusted to keep the country safe than the Tories.   \nAccording to the Guardian, Labour is at risk of losing a number of its target seats at the next general election because Muslims and progressive voters are turning away from the party, angered by its stances on Gaza and the climate. The paper says polls currently suggest Labour is on track to win by a landslide but that some insiders fear that, if the margins narrow, the loss of some of the party's core vote could prove the difference between a hung parliament and an outright majority.   \nThe Financial Times says Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's hopes of going into the election on the back of lower taxes and cheaper mortgages have suffered a blow because of higher-than-expected inflation in the US. Financial markets now expect the Bank of England to cut interest rates just twice this year, rather than six times as had been anticipated in January. The paper says that's pushing up the cost of government borrowing, potentially reducing the government's scope for pre-election tax cuts in the autumn.\nOn its front page the Daily Express decries what it calls a \"triple lock pension injustice for millions\". Writing in the paper, former minister Baroness Altman explains that fewer than one third of pensioners have received the full 8.5% increase in their retirement income this week. She says that is because men aged 73 and over, and women older than 71 are on the old basic state pension and have received a smaller rise, leaving them \u00a3200 a year worse off.  \nThe Daily Telegraph reports that Royal Mail has accused Border Force of failing to prevent counterfeit stamps being brought into Britain from China. An executive said the government should put pressure on law enforcement to stop the fakes coming into the country.  \nAnd finally a number of the front pages feature OJ Simpson, the American football star who has died almost 30 years after he was cleared of murdering his former wife and her friend.

    "President Joe Biden has promised Israel \"ironclad\" US support amid fears that Tehran could launch reprisals for an attack that killed senior Iranians.\nHe warned that Iran is threatening to launch a \"significant attack\" after it blamed Israel for a strike on its consulate in Syria 10 days ago. \n\"We're going to do all we can to protect Israel's security,\" he added.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Iran's leader said the attack in Damascus was equivalent to an attack on Iran itself. \n\"When they attacked our consulate area, it was like they attacked our territory,\" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a televised speech.\n\"The evil regime must be punished, and it will be punished.\"\nIt is unclear what form any reprisal attack would take. \nFor Iran to strike Israel directly would risk an even greater escalation in the conflict, and analysts have said Iran does not have the military capability for a significant confrontation. \nA possible alternative is an attack via an Iranian proxy like Hezbollah, which has traded fire with Israel across the border from Lebanon almost daily since 8 October. Those exchanges have intensified in recent weeks.\n\"Hezbollah is very capable, hundreds of thousands of rockets and missiles there, on the border that can reach all the way into southern Israel,\" Joe Buccino, former Communications Director at the US military's Central Command, told the BBC.\n\"Hezbollah is much more capable than Hamas. So they'd have the capability to do significant damage into Israel.\" \nOn Sunday an Iranian official warned Israel's embassies were \"no longer safe\", suggesting a consulate building could be a possible target.\nExperts have also suggested Iran could target Israel with a cyber-attack. \nThirteen people were killed in the 1 April attack on the Iranian consulate building, including senior Iranian military leaders. Among them was Brig-Gen Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior commander of Iran's elite Quds Force in Syria and Lebanon.\nIsrael has not claimed responsibility for the attack, but is widely considered to have been behind it.\nUS and Israeli forces in the region have been put on high alert in the days since. Last week the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) cancelled leave for soldiers serving with combat units and called up reservists to bolster air defence units.\nIsraeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Israel Katz responded on social media to Ayatollah Khamenei's comments by saying if Tehran attacked from its territory, Israel would react and \"attack in Iran\".\nMeanwhile the head of US forces in the region, Gen Michael Kurilla, is to discuss the threat of a possible Iranian attack in talks with Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and army Chief of Staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi in Israel on Thursday, according to Israeli media reports.\nMr Biden's remarks came as he was speaking to journalists at the White House on Wednesday alongside Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. \n\"As I told Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu, our commitment to Israel's security against these threats from Iran and its proxies is ironclad - let me say it again, ironclad,\" Mr Biden said.\nHis comments come one day after an interview, recorded a week ago, was aired in which Mr Biden urged Mr Netanyahu to \"just call for a ceasefire\" in Gaza and in which he said he disagreed with the prime minister's war strategy.\n\"I think what he's doing is a mistake. I don't agree with his approach,\" he said in the interview with US network Univision.\nIt also comes days after a tense phone call between Mr Biden and Mr Netanyahu in the wake of the Israeli killing of seven humanitarian aid workers in Gaza. \nMr Biden has sharpened his rhetoric over Israel's conduct in the nearly six-month-old war sparked by Hamas's 7 October attack, and voiced his growing frustration with Mr Netanyahu. Iran backs Hamas and Iranian officials have praised the attack in which about 1,200 people were killed and 253 taken to Gaza as hostages.\nUS officials have been attempting to send a message to the Iranians that, despite differences of opinion between Mr Biden and Mr Netanyahu, any attack on Israel will be met with an aggressive US response.\nIn an effort to ease tensions, the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar and Iraq spoke to their Iranian counterpart this week, according to Axios. \nThe ministers were asked to convey a message from Mr Biden's senior Middle East advisor, Brett McGurk, about the need to de-escalate. \nAccording to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, more than 33,000 people - mostly women and children - have been killed in the Israeli offensive, which was triggered by Hamas's attack.\nAdditional reporting by Raffi Berg",
    "Legal bills paid by the taxpayer after Science Secretary Michelle Donelan falsely accused an academic of extremism came to more than \u00a334,000.\nThe department had already confirmed \u00a315,000 had been paid in damages to Professor Kate Sang.\nNew figures show \u00a319,000 in extra costs - more than doubling the final bill.\nThe government has defended using public money to pay the bill, claiming her comments had been made \"in the course of her ministerial duties\".\nHowever, Labour's shadow science secretary Peter Kyle said the total bill was a \"slap in the face to hardworking families\". \n\"Instead of trying to cover up the true cost of her actions, Michelle Donelan should have had the decency to pay the money back to the taxpayer.\"\nLiberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper also urged the minister to cover the cost herself adding: \"People's taxes should not be used to bail out disgraced Conservative ministers.\"\nProf Sang, who works at Heriot Watt University, took legal action after Ms Donelan accused the academic of sharing \"extremist views\"and expressing sympathy for Hamas after the 7 October attacks against Israel.\nIn a letter to UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), Ms Donelan expressed her \"disgust and outrage\" about the views of the academic, who sat on an advisory board at the organisation. \nThe minister cited a social media post in which Prof Sang had said \"this is disturbing\" alongside a Guardian article about a government crackdown on support for Hamas in the UK. \nMs Donelan later said she accepted that the comment was about the Guardian story as a whole, and not just the headline. \nIn a statement she said she had \"misunderstood\" the post and fully accepted the academic was \"not an extremist, a supporter of Hamas or other proscribed organisations\". \nProf Sang said she was \"delighted that this matter has now concluded, but very disturbed by the way in which Michelle Donelan and UKRI behaved\".\nFollowing the minister's letter, the UKRI launched an investigation which found no evidence Prof Sang had expressed extremist views. \nA freedom of information request made to the Research Professional News website found that UKRI's investigation cost \u00a323,280. \nIn March, Labour's Peter Kyle wrote to Sarah Munby, the permanent secretary at the science department, asking for the overall cost of the legal fees.\nHe also asked why she considered using taxpayers' money to foot the bill was justified and whether she consulted anyone before approving the payment. \nIn a reply, first reported in the Guardian, Ms Munby said it was \"established practice\" that ministers are \"indemnified by the Crown for any actions taken against them for things done or decisions made in the course of their ministerial duties\".\n\"This reflects the important principle that ministers should be able to carry out their official duties in the way that they see fit, without the risk of personal liability constraining their ability to take those official actions.\"\nIn the case of Prof Sang, Ms Munby said the minister had been writing to a body over which she had oversight and that the letter, in which she made accusations against the academic, had been published \"following the usual clearances\". \nShe said that when proceeding with the payment to Prof Sang the department had taken \"specialist advice\" and were advised that the \"the actions were properly viewed as having been taken by the Secretary of State in the course of her ministerial duties\". \n\"In such circumstances, agreeing the \u00a315,000 settlement without admitting liability was intended to reduce the overall costs to the taxpayer that could result from protracted legal action for the government.\"\nThe civil servant confirmed that in addition to the \u00a315,000 paid to Prof Sang, the costs incurred by the Government Legal Department were \u00a37,785.30 and that fees for external counsel amounted to \u00a311,600.

    "Three men were rescued by the US Coast Guard off an island in Micronesia after they sent out a plea for \"HELP\" using palm tree leaves.\nThey spelled out \"HELP\" with the leaves, which led to the rescue nine days after they left on a sailing trip.\nThey had been reported missing after failing to return from a journey to Pikelot Atoll - an uninhabited coral island about 415 miles from Guam. \nIt is the second time in four years people were rescued from the island.\nThe Coast Guard said in a statement that the three experienced mariners, all unnamed men in their 40s, had embarked on their sailing trip from Polowat Atoll - an island that is a part of the Federated States of Micronesia. \nThey departed on Easter Sunday for Pikelot Atoll, about 115 miles away, in a traditional 20-foot skiff with an outboard motor, the Coast Guard added. \nAfter failing to return, a relative of the men alerted the Coast Guard's Joint Rescue Sub-Center in Guam that her three uncles were missing, sparking a search and rescue mission.\nFirst responders were initially searching an area that was more than 78,000 square nautical miles in poor weather conditions. But then they spotted the men from the air - thanks to the makeshift \"HELP\" sign.\n\"In a remarkable testament to their will to be found, the mariners spelled out 'HELP' on the beach using palm leaves, a crucial factor in their discovery,\" said Lt Chelsea Garcia, who led the search and rescue mission the day they were located.\n\"This act of ingenuity was pivotal in guiding rescue efforts directly to their location,\" she said.\nCoast Guard personnel then airdropped survival packages and a radio to the men while a US Coast Guard vessel made its way to the island.\nThe mariners later radioed back and said they were in good health and had access to food and water, the US Coast Guard said. \nThey also had recovered their skiff, which sustained damage that rendered it non-functional, and said they needed help getting back to Polowat. \nAfter departing on their voyage on 31 March, the sailors were officially rescued off the island on 9 April.\nThe US Coast Guard said the rescue is an example of the strong coordination between the US and the Federal States of Micronesia, as well as US Navy personnel who are stationed in the area.\nMicronesia, in the western Pacific, consists of some 600 tiny islands scattered over a vast ocean expanse.\n\"Every life saved, and every mariner returned home is a testament to the enduring partnership and mutual respect that characterizes our relationship,\" said Lt Cdr Christine Igisomar, who was also part of the search and rescue mission.\nThough uninhabited, Pikelot Atoll is often temporarily visited by hunters and fishermen. It has also been the site of another rescue in recent years. \nIn 2020, three Micronesian mariners were saved - by the Australian Defence Force - after spelling out \"SOS\" on the beach. ",
    "Sumo legend Taro Akebono, who drove a resurgence in the sport's popularity and became its first foreign grand champion, has died of heart failure at the age of 54.\nThe Hawaiian-born wrestler passed away in a Tokyo hospital earlier this month, his family said in a statement.\nA towering figure of the sport, both literally and figuratively - the 210kg, 2.03m-tall (462lb; 6ft 8in) giant was famous for his unique fighting style that often saw him thrust his opponents out of the ring.\nOn both sides of the Pacific, fans and peers paid tribute to him as a pioneer who had blazed a path for other foreign sumo wrestlers to follow.\nAkebono had been battling illness since collapsing in the city of Kitakyushu seven years ago, according to local media.\nBorn Chad Rowan in 1969, he grew up in Honolulu before moving to Japan in 1988 to pursue his wrestling career.\nWithin six years he would become Japan's 64th yokozuna - or grand champion - an honour which the sumo council had previously ruled was off-limits to non-Japanese athletes.\nAs well as breaking barriers, his devotion to the sport saw his popularity skyrocket and won him the respect of local fans.\n\"He makes me forget he is a foreigner because of his earnest attitude toward sumo,\" the editor of Sumo Magazine, Yoshihisa Shimoie, said in 1993.\nDuring his career he went on to claim 10 more championship titles, while bringing in millions of viewers from around the world.\nHis famous rivalry with the Japanese brothers Takanohana Koji and Masaru Hanada is widely credited as breathing fresh life into the sport, at a time when it was struggling for relevance. \nIn 1996 he became a naturalised Japanese citizen, taking the name Taro Akebono. When he retired from sumo wrestling in 2001 due to repeated knee injuries, over 11,000 spectators attended his leaving ceremony - during which he had his topknot gradually cut off by 320 friends and former competitors.\n\"I feel sad, much more than I had expected. I feel my head is lighter. I think it is not the weight off my hair but the weight off my responsibility,\" he said at the time.\nAs tributes poured in on Thursday, some of the biggest names in the sport honoured him for his strength, modesty, and kindness.\n\"It was all so sudden, and I cannot come up with words to send him. He was a person full of love,\" Hanada wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\nUS Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel praised Akebono for serving as a \"bridge between the United States and Japan\" and strengthening cultural ties between both countries.\nFormer sports broadcaster Neil Everett credited him with representing Hawaii in Japan and \"carrying the weight of the entire state\" on his shoulders.\nAkebono is survived by his wife Christine Rowan, as well as their daughter and two sons.\nAdditional reporting by Shaimaa Khalil and Chie Kobayashi in Tokyo"
