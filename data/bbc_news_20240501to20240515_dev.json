    "What would it be like to meet one of our closest human relatives from 75,000 years ago in the flesh?\nScientists have produced a remarkable reconstruction of what a Neanderthal woman would have looked like when she was alive.\nIt is based on the flattened, shattered remains of a skull whose bones were so soft when excavated they had the consistency of \"a well-dunked biscuit\".\nResearchers first had to strengthen the fragments before reassembling them.\nExpert palaeoartists then created the 3D model.\nThe representation appears in a new BBC Studios documentary for Netflix called Secrets of the Neanderthals, which examines what we know about our long-lost evolutionary cousins, who became extinct about 40,000 years ago.\nThe sculpture puts a face to these people.\n\"I think she can help us connect with who they were,\" said Dr Emma Pomeroy, a palaeoanthropologist on the project from the University of Cambridge.\n\"It's extremely exciting and a massive privilege actually to be able to work with the remains of any individual but especially one as special as her,\" she told BBC News.\nThe skull on which the model is based was found in Shanidar Cave in Iraqi Kurdistan. It is an iconic place where the remains of at least 10 Neanderthal men, women and children were unearthed in the 1950s. \nWhen a British group was invited back by the Kurdish authorities in 2015, they soon chanced upon a new skeleton - dubbed Shanidar Z - that comprised much of the individual's upper-body, including the spine, shoulders, arms and hands.\nThe skull was largely all present, too, but squashed into a 2cm (0.7in)-thick layer, probably by a rock that had fallen from the roof of the cave at some point in the distant past.\n\"The skull was as flat as a pizza, basically,\" said Cambridge's Prof Graeme Barker, who leads the new excavations at Shanidar.\n\"It's a remarkable journey to go from that to what you see now. As an archaeologist, you can sometimes get blas\u00e9 about what you're doing. But every now and then you are brought up short by the fact you are touching the past. We forget just what an extraordinary thing it is.\"\nWith permission of the local department of antiquities, the skull fragments were brought to the UK in blocks of sediment to begin the painstaking process of freeing them, stabilising them and then putting them back together.\nThe complicated jigsaw puzzle took an archaeological conservator more than a year to complete. \nThe rebuilt skull was then surface-scanned and a 3D print given to Dutch artists Adrie and Alfons Kennis, who are renowned for their skill in creating anatomically faithful representations of ancient people from their bone and fossil remains.\nBut as intriguing as the sculpture is, with her rather contemplative expression, it is the original skeleton that holds the real value.\nThe team is pretty sure \"she is a she\". \nPelvic bones would help the determination but those were not recovered with the upper-part of the body.\nInstead the researchers have relied on certain dominant proteins found in the tooth enamel that are associated with female genetics. The slight stature of the skeleton also supports the interpretation.\nHow old? She probably died in her mid-40s, indicated again by her teeth which are worn down almost to the roots.\n\"By the time the teeth are getting this worn, chewing is not as effective as it would have been - so she's not able to eat in quite the same way,\" explained Dr Pomeroy.\n\"We've got some other indications of poor dental health - some infections, some gum disease as well. By this time, I think she was getting to the natural end of life.\"\nFor a long time, scientists considered Neanderthals brutish and unsophisticated by comparison with our species. \nBut that view has been transformed since the discoveries at Shanidar.\nThe cave is famous for displaying what appears to be some kind of burial practice. Bodies were carefully placed in a gully next to a tall rock pillar. All the dead shared a similar orientation in how they were laid out.\nPollen throughout one skeleton led some to argue these Neanderthals might have been interred with flowers, suggestive perhaps of a spiritual awakening, even religion.\nBut the British team thinks it more likely the pollen was left by later burrowing bees, or perhaps from flowering branches that were placed on top of the bodies.\n\"Not because of the flowers on the branches but because the branches themselves could have prevented the likes of hyenas getting at the bodies,\" said Prof Chris Hunt of Liverpool John Moores University.\n\"I would hesitate to use the word 'burial'; I think I would use the word 'placement' to get away from the idea of a vicar and the church. But there's absolutely no doubt that they maintained a tradition of this is where you put grandma.\"\nSecrets of the Neanderthals arrives on the Netflix streaming platform globally on Thursday. \nAdditional reporting by Gwyndaf Hughes.",
    "A schoolboy who was killed in a sword attack in London on Tuesday has been named as Daniel Anjorin.\nThe 14-year-old died in hospital after being stabbed in Hainault, where four other people - including two police officers - were seriously injured.\nA 36-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder and is in police custody.\nDaniel's school, Bancroft's, said he was a \"true scholar\" who had a \"positive nature and gentle character\".\nIt described him as a \"core member\" of the community, and continued: \"Losing such a young pupil is something we will always struggle to come to terms with.\"\nThe teenager attended the school where Grace O'Malley-Kumar - who was killed in a random stabbing attack in Nottingham in June 2023 - was previously a pupil.\nIn a letter to parents seen by BBC News, the school's head said it \"seems scarcely believable\" that children and teachers were \"facing fresh sorrow\".\nThe suspect hit a 33-year-old when he crashed his van into a property in Laing Close, at about 07:00 BST on Tuesday, and then attacked the man who suffered a neck wound, the Met said. \nAnother man, 35, was cut on his arm when he was attacked inside a nearby house.\nTheir conditions are not considered to be life-threatening, police said.\nThe suspect then went on to attack Daniel. He died from stab wounds shortly after being taken to hospital. \nThe Met said police arrived within 12 minutes of the first call and officers had used a kind of pepper spray and a Taser on the suspect, which did not stop him.\nTwo officers were then attacked, suffering serious injuries, and will need long-term treatment to recover, the force added.\nThe suspect fled before eventually being surrounded by other officers in Thurlow Gardens where he was overpowered with a Taser.\nHe was arrested and taken to hospital due to injuries from the crash. He is now in police custody.\nDet Ch Insp Larry Smith described it as a \"complex investigation due to the number of crime scenes, forensic evidence, hours of CCTV footage and witnesses we need to speak to\".\n\"I know that many people will want answers and we are working to provide them as soon as we can,\" he added.\n\"I would also echo previous calls for patience as my officers carry out a painstaking investigation to deliver justice for Daniel, his family, those injured and the wider community.\"\nIn a letter to parents, the school's head teacher, Simon Marshall, wrote: \"Naturally this event will have a profound effect on the whole school, but this will be especially true of his peers.\n\"All we can do for now is to look after one another and respect the privacy of Daniel's family - it is a time of profound grief and as a community we will endure best if we come together in kindness and compassion.\"\nA flag was seen flying at half-mast at the school on Wednesday.\nJubilee Church, which Daniel was a member of, expressed their \"immense sadness\" at the \"sudden and tragic death\".\nSeparately, the school where his mother works, Holy Family Catholic School, has issued a statement naming her as Mrs Anjorin. \nIt said: \"It is with great sadness that I share with you the news of the death of the child of one of our staff members.\n\"Please keep Mrs Anjorin, her husband and their other children in your prayers.\"\nJanti Charalambous, whose son attended Snaresbrook Prep School with Daniel, dropped off a bag of supplies to the Anjorin family on Wednesday afternoon.\nThe family friend told reporters: \"Daniel was an amazing young man.\n\"He was good at his studies. He was good at his sports. Very much loved by many, many people and came from a wonderful family.\n\"The family are in shock. Obviously they are very heartbroken. He was such a young boy taken away from his family.\n\"It's sad that it's happened in a family, a community, like this. It's heart-breaking.\n\"At least they got their time to spend with Daniel, 14 years. Their faith is sustaining them and we are all supporting them in any shape or form that they need.\n\"He was a joyful boy - he brought his family lots of joy and his life has just been taken away. Just walking out on his way to school. He was much-loved, his family are much-loved.\n\"I was talking to my son and he was so heartbroken, he can remember Daniel driving his little car and playing in the street.\n\"He said he can't imagine it happening to his own brother.\"\nSpeaking to LBC, Met Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said: \"The first thing you have to say is for the parents involved, who've lost their 14-year-old, and that is just horrific, and it's everyone's worst nightmare.\n\"I'm sure we're all thinking about them.\"\nThe Met said urgent checks on their system had so far found no traces of the suspect having previous involvement with the police but it was \"investigating further for certainty\".\nIt confirmed he had not been arrested by officers on Monday.\n\"An arrest did take place at Copperwell on Monday, 29 April which relates to a different person and a separate incident,\" a spokesperson said.\nGrace O'Malley-Kumar die",
    "Two men who blamed an innocent driver for speeding offences have been sentenced after pleading guilty to perverting the court of justice.\nSamadur Rahman Choudhury and Shan Antonio Deng both said the same man was the driver of their speeding vehicles in incidents in North Yorkshire.\nIn a separate offence, Choudhury named a second innocent man as the driver behind another speeding offence.\nBoth men have been given suspended prison sentences.\nThey will also have to carry out unpaid work, pay a sum of money to the victims and pay costs.\nChoudhury, 28, of Ashmore Gardens, Bradford, was caught speeding in his work van in North Yorkshire on 7 December 2020 and 1 May 2021.\nDeng, 25, of Ashville Grove, Halifax, was also caught speeding in a work van in North Yorkshire on 7 December 2020.\nAccording to North Yorkshire Police, the victims who were wrongly named by Choudhury and Deng as being responsible had initially appeared to admit to police by post that they had been the drivers at the relevant times. \nHowever, afterwards, police launched an investigation into all three prosecutions due to suspicions false nominations had been made for each.\nFootage taken from the camera vans which captured Deng's offence and one of Choudhury's offences confirmed the pair had been driving at the time.\nChoudhury's employer was able to corroborate that it was the 28-year-old who was driving at the time of the second offence.\nBoth men were subsequently charged with perverting the course of justice and pleaded guilty. \nAt York Crown Court on 19 April, Choudhury was handed a nine-month suspended prison sentence, suspended for 18 months. \nHe was also told to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work within the next 12 months, pay \u00a3150 to the victim, and pay costs of \u00a3430.\nOn the same day at York Crown Court, Deng was handed a six-month suspended prison sentence, suspended for 18 months. \nHe was also ordered to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work within the next 12 months, pay \u00a3150 to the victim, and pay costs of \u00a3430.\nNo evidence was found that Choudhury and Deng conspired together to name the first victim for their offences, according to North Yorkshire Police.\nSpeaking after the men were sentenced, PC Michael Ray, of North Yorkshire Police's Traffic Bureau, said: \"Making false nominations to avoid prosecution for speeding offences is a serious criminal offence and will be robustly investigated by North Yorkshire Police. \n\"The victims in these cases had to expend some considerable effort in making statutory declarations to the court that they were not responsible for the speeding offences committed.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "A man who was sexually assaulted by his karate master said it had been his \"lifelong dream\" to train with him.\nStuart Amos, now 31, moved to Liverpool in 2011 to learn under ninth dan black belt Andrew Sherry.\nBut Sherry sexually abused him and was this week jailed for two years at Liverpool Crown Court for his crimes against him and another, younger boy.\nMr Amos said Sherry, now 80, had manipulated him and \"abused his dream\".\nHe had relocated from Bedfordshire to Liverpool to train at Red Triangle karate club in Everton.\nMr Amos, who waived his anonymity as a victim of a sexual offence to speak out, said: \"When I met Andrew Sherry it was a lifelong dream to come to Liverpool to train with him and he abused that dream to get what he wanted, \" he said.\n\"It was a horrific time. I was groomed for a long period and manipulated into silence and sexually assaulted by someone who was in a great position of trust.\n\"He was my teacher - I believed he was my friend. \n\"In my first statement to police, one of the words I gave was that it felt 'practiced'.\"\nSherry, of Mann Island in Liverpool, was convicted in March of indecently assaulting a boy under the age of 16 in the mid-1980s, and of four counts of sexual assault on an older teenager in 2011 or 2012.\nHis trial heard the karate master, who was chief instructor for the Karate Union of Great Britain, claimed the allegations had been the result of a conspiracy by other practitioners who wanted to \"overthrow their leader\".\nSentencing judge David Swinnerton told him his actions had been \"an abuse of trust\". \nMr Amos said Sherry \"knew exactly what he was doing, he knew exactly what he was saying\".\n\"He referred a lot to behavioural psychology, which he said was an interest of his,\" he said.\n\"He bought me a book once on behavioural psychology, which had a long chapter on manipulation.\"\nHe said Sherry had \"his choice of children from all over the country\".\n\"He was the chief instructor, he was the chief examiner and he was the squad coach,\" he said.\n\"He had the pick of the litter, for want of a better word.\"\nMr Amos said the investigation had been an \"uphill battle\" and had taken its toll on him.\n\"I have been shunned by my old friends who he turned against me,\" he said.\n\"I have had to deal with a lot of personal abuse from people I thought were my friends.\"\nHe added that the case had brought him closure, although it would have been better if Sherry had been handed a longer sentence.\n\"I always said if he got to trial I would have my day in court and stand there and look him in the eye,\" he said.\n\"I was able to do that.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds\u00a0and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X and Instagram?

    "A first failed asylum seeker has gone to Rwanda under a voluntary removals programme, it is understood.\nUnder the scheme, announced last month, migrants whose claims are rejected are offered up to \u00a33,000 to move to the east African country.\nIt is separate to the forced returns scheme the government announced two years ago.\nThat scheme, which has been beset by delays, is due to begin by mid-July.\nThe Sun, which first reported the story, said the unnamed man was flown out of the UK on Monday on a commercial flight.\nOfficials would not be drawn on any details, other than to say the asylum seeker had exhausted all rights to be in the UK. \nThe Rwandan government confirmed that a failed asylum seeker arrived on Tuesday on a flight from London.\nLabour said the move showed ministers were \"desperate\" to get a flight off to Rwanda before Thursday's local elections in England.\nThe scheme announced in March is understood to be a variation of an existing voluntary returns scheme for failed asylum seekers.\nThe scheme will also be opened up to other people with no right to remain in the UK, and foreign criminals.\nThe Home Office says payments under the current scheme \"can pay for\" temporary accommodation in the destination country, or education costs, or the cost of setting up a business.\nBusiness Secretary Kemi Badenoch suggested the fact someone had volunteered to go to Rwanda undermined the argument that it was not a safe country. \nIn response to criticism of the \u00a33,000 paid for relocation, she told Sky News there was no \"cost-free option\" for border control.\nAccording to official statistics, 19,253 people with no right to remain in the UK were voluntarily removed from the UK last year. \nOf these, 3,319 received a \"reintegration package\" or flights paid by the Home Office. \nJacqueline McKenzie, partner and head of immigration at Leigh Day solicitors, said she was aware from contacts that many people had recently been offered this package to go to Rwanda, including some very vulnerable individuals. \n\"I am surprised, given the amount of calls that have been made, that more people haven't gone, if it's a good idea,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \nShadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called news of the voluntary return a \"pre-election gimmick,\" adding taxpayers were \"forking out \u00a33,000 for a volunteer to board a plane\".\n\"The Tories are so desperate to get any flight off to Rwanda before the local elections that they have now just paid someone to go,\" she added.\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the individual went to Rwanda under \"an old scheme\", which \"won't stop the boats\".\n\"They've had to pay someone \u00a33,000. There's a suspicion out there that this is about an election - it's not about seriously stopping the boats,\" he said, in a reference to the local elections taking place in England on Thursday.\n\"Liberal Democrats believe this scheme is extremely expensive and won't actually work,\" he added. \nIt comes after the Home Office confirmed Rwanda had agreed to accept an initial cohort of 5,700 asylum seekers under the separate forced returns scheme.\nThe scheme - which the government argues will deter future migrants from crossing the English Channel in small boats - has been dogged by legal delays.\nHowever, it is finally set to begin in the summer, after legislation to override a Supreme Court ruling entered into force earlier this month.\nThe Home Office has said 2,143 asylum seekers can immediately be located for detention in the run-up to their flights, as they are reporting to the department.\nIt has denied losing track of the remaining 3,557, who are subject to a range of different monitoring requirements.\nDowning Street insisted on Tuesday it remained confident of their whereabouts, after the figures became public as part of a policy document.\nHowever, a government source admitted it was possible some could abscond before they were detained.",
    "In the early afternoon of 29 November last year, several Palestinian boys descended on to their street in the occupied West Bank, where they often played together.\nMinutes later, two of them lay dead from gunshots fired by Israeli soldiers - Basil, 15, and eight-year-old Adam.\nAs part of an investigation into the conduct of Israel's security forces in the West Bank, which has been under military occupation for more than half a century, the BBC has pieced together what happened on the day the two boys were killed.\nMobile phone and CCTV footage, information about the movements of Israel's military, witness testimony and detailed investigation of the scene, including taking measurements, combine to reveal evidence suggesting serious human rights violations.\nThe evidence we found has prompted Ben Saul, UN special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, to say the death of Adam appears to be a \"war crime\".\nAnother legal expert, Dr Lawrence Hill-Cawthorne, described the use of lethal force as \u201cindiscriminate\u201d.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the circumstances of the deaths were \u201cunder review\u201d but said \u201clive fire is used only in order to remove immediate threats or for arrest purposes, following arrest protocols after exhausting other options\u201d.\nWith violence having surged in the West Bank in the months since Hamas's attack on Israel from Gaza on 7 October, the BBC has also found evidence of Palestinian homes being vandalised with graffiti, Palestinian civilians threatened with weapons and told to leave the territory for neighbouring Jordan, and the possible mutilation of the body of a Palestinian gunman.\nVideo footage from 29 November shows Basil standing next to a hardware store, its shutters firmly locked down. When Israel's military arrives, shops close quickly in Jenin, a city in the West Bank - Palestinian territory which, unlike Gaza, is not run by Hamas.\nWitnesses said gunfire had been ringing out from a nearby operation by Israel's army in the Jenin refugee camp.\nAdam, a football fanatic and massive Lionel Messi fan, stood with his older brother Baha, 14. There were about nine boys on the street in total, all captured on CCTV cameras that provided a nearly 360-degree view of what happened next.\nA few hundred metres away, a convoy of at least six armoured Israeli military vehicles turned a corner and began heading towards the boys, who clearly became uneasy. Several of the boys started to move away.\nAt this precise moment, mobile phone footage shows the front door of an armoured vehicle opened. The soldier inside had a direct view of the boys. Basil had darted into the middle of the road, while Adam was 12m further from the soldiers, running away.\nThen at least 11 gunshots rang out.\nExamining the scene, the BBC found the bullets struck a wide area. Four bullets hit a metal pole, two the shutter of the hardware store, one burrowed its way through the bumper of a parked car, and another pierced a handrail.\nMedical reports obtained by the BBC show that two shots hit Basil in the chest.\nAnother bullet struck eight-year-old Adam in the back of the head as he ran away; his older brother Baha desperately tried to drag him to cover, leaving a trail of blood as he screamed for an ambulance.\nBut it was too late. Baha said Adam and his friend Basil died in front of him.\n\u201cI was in a state of shock; I wasn\u2019t even thinking about myself. I tried to speak to him. I started saying, \u2018Adam, Adam!\u2019 But his soul was basically leaving his body because he didn't answer,\u201d Baha told the BBC tearfully.\nBefore being shot, Basil can be seen clutching something in his hand. It is not clear what it is. The IDF later shared a picture taken at the scene, which it says shows an explosive device.\nEvidence from our investigation of the scene was shared with a number of independent experts, including human rights lawyers, a war crimes investigator and a counter-terrorism expert, as well as members of the UN and other, neutral bodies. Some gave their analysis anonymously.\nThe experts agreed the incident should be investigated and some went further, saying there appeared to be violations of international law.\nBen Saul, the UN special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, said there may be questions about whether lethal force could have been used legally in Basil's case, if he was holding an explosive.\n\"For Adam, this appears to be a violation of the International Humanitarian Law prohibitions on deliberately, indiscriminately or disproportionately attacking civilians, a war crime, and a violation of the human right to life,\" Mr Saul said.\nDr Lawrence Hill-Cawthorne, co-director of the Centre for International Law at the University of Bristol, said: \"The soldiers were in armoured vehicles. Even if there was a threat, they should have driven away and planned an arrest, rather than defaulting to apparently indiscriminate, lethal force, which is a violation of international law.\u201d\nThe IDF said the suspects had been about t",
    "The family of a gay British-Mexican man held in Qatar for alleged drug offences has given further details of what they say was a \"honeytrap\" operation using the gay dating app, Grindr.  \nManuel Guerrero Avi\u00f1a was approached online by a man called \"Gio\" and they arranged to meet - but he was instead met by police and arrested on false drug charges, Manuel's brother Enrique told the BBC. \nManuel, who has HIV, has now completely run out of his usual medication, his family says. They want the UK government to bring him back home for treatment.\nAmnesty International has described Manuel's experience in detention as \"nothing short of horrific\" and says that his trial was \"marred by a range of due process violations.\" Its concerns are echoed by other human rights organisations the BBC has spoken to. \nQatari officials insist Manuel has been treated \"with respect and dignity\". \nAt first glance \"Gio\" - who also used the name \"Mike\" - looked like the thousands of other men on dating apps around the world.\nHis Grindr profile, seen by the BBC, was full of gym selfies showing off his six-pack. His listed interests were karaoke, football and Netflix. \nThe man also had a similar profile on Tinder, where his identity would have had to be verified by the app's facial recognition technology.\nEnrique says his brother swapped phone numbers with the man and invited him over to his apartment in Qatar's capital, Doha. \nBut when Manuel went down to the lobby of his building to meet \"Gio\", he was instead confronted by Qatari police officers, according to his brother, who says they immediately handcuffed Manuel and placed him under arrest. \nHomosexuality is illegal in Qatar but Manuel, an airline worker, had lived a \"normal life\" for the past seven years and had never been in trouble with the authorities, his family says.\nQatari officials insist the 44-year-old's arrest in February was \"for possession of illegal substances on his person and in his apartment\" and that \"no other factors were taken into account\".\nThey say he \"acknowledged\" possessing illegal substances, adding: \"A drug test later came back positive, confirming the presence of illegal substances, specifically amphetamine and methamphetamine, in Mr Avi\u00f1a's system at the time of his arrest.\"\nEnrique maintains that Manuel didn't take any drugs and says a small amount of methamphetamine was planted on him, which he was \"pressured\" into accepting was his.  \nBBC News has not been able to independently verify all of the claims made by Manuel and his family. Many of the accusations about his treatment after his arrest took place behind closed doors with few witnesses. \nHowever Manuel's family has presented a detailed timeline of events, and previous reporting, on both the treatment of LBGT people and the behaviour of police in the country, suggest others have had similar experiences.\nWhile being held in custody at the police station, Manuel allegedly witnessed others being \"whipped on their backs\" by officers - and was threatened with similar treatment if he did not sign several legal documents.\nManuel told his family that these documents were written in Arabic - a language he could not read - and that he was not given access to a translator or any legal advice. \nHis brother says that when Manuel told the prison about his HIV they moved him into solitary confinement and would sporadically withhold his medication to pressure him into sharing information about other gay men - which he refused to do.  \nEnrique has told the BBC that Manuel was interrogated for hours at a time.\nWithholding medication in prison is \"morally intolerable\" and could already have had very serious consequences for Manuel's health, the UK's National Aids Trust says. \nThe charity is calling on the UK government to intervene and bring Manuel back for proper treatment. \nQatari officials have told the BBC that Manuel was \"treated with respect and dignity throughout his detention\".\nHe was told that he is facing anything from six months to three years in prison for possession and consumption of drugs. \nBut for the time being, after having spent 42 days in a Qatari detention centre, he has been granted provisional release and is staying with friends while he waits for further court appearances.  \nManuel's passport has been taken away - the conditions of his release mean he is banned from travelling abroad. \nDana Ahmed, a Middle East researcher at Amnesty International, says his treatment in detention, and later in his first trial sessions \"raises serious fears that Manuel is being targeted for his sexual orientation and is being coerced into providing the authorities with information that they could use to pursue a crackdown on LGBTI individuals in Qatar\". \nManuel's family has told the BBC that his usual treatment, prescribed by British doctors, ran out in mid-April. He now has to take an alternative provided by the Qatari authorities.\nBefore his arrest, Manuel's HIV was being treated with antiretroviral medication",
    "Outgoing First Minister Humza Yousaf has said he \"paid the price\" for the way he ended the SNP's power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens.\nSpeaking for the first time since announcing his resignation, Mr Yousaf told BBC News ending the Bute House Agreement was the \"right decision\".\n\"But I have to acknowledge the manner in which I did it caused great upset and that's on me,\" he said. \nMr Yousaf announced on Monday that he would resign as first minister.\nHe intends to remain in office until a new SNP leader is named. \nA motion of no confidence in his government, which would have forced all SNP ministers to resign, was defeated by 70 votes 58 in the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday. \nMr Yousaf said it was clear to him that the SNP's power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens was \"coming to an end anyway\".\nGreen members had been asked to vote on whether to end a power-sharing deal with the SNP after it scrapped key climate change targets, and there was also disquiet from some within his own party about the alliance. \nHe said: \"In my mind, whether it was a matter of days or weeks, the Bute House agreement was coming to an end.\n\"That's why I say that ending the Bute House agreement was the right thing to do for the party and the country.\n\"But I accept fully the manner in which it was done clearly caused upset and therefore I've paid the price of that.\"\nThe first minister insisted he did not regret ending the deal, adding: \"I just regret the manner in which I ended it\".\nTension between the parties had increased following the announcement that NHS Scotland was pausing prescribing puberty blockers to under-18s referred by the country's only specialist clinic, following a report by Dr Hilary Cass.\nMr Yousaf said Green co-leader Patrick Harvie's response to the move - including his refusal to accept the Cass review as a valid scientific document - had \"upset a lot of people\" in the SNP but that it was \"not necessarily\" a factor in ending the Bute House Agreement. \nMr Yousaf announced his intention to step down as he faced two no-confidence votes tabled by opposition parties following the turbulent ending of the  Bute House Agreement - a deal signed by his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon three years ago that brought two Green ministers into government.\nFormer Deputy First Minister John Swinney and ex-Finance Secretary Kate Forbes have emerged as the frontrunners in the process to succeed him, although neither has yet declared they are standing. \nMr Yousaf said he would not endorse either potential candidate.\nHe called for unity within the party and urged any potential candidates not to openly criticise their rivals. \n\"We will gain nothing if we talk each other down,\" the first minister said. \"The only people who benefit from that are our opponents.\"\nMs Forbes, who narrowly lost out to Mr Yousaf in the 2023 leadership contest, was criticised during the campaign for revealing she would have voted against gay marriage legislation had she been an MSP at the time due to her religious beliefs as a member of the Free Church of Scotland.\nWhen asked if he felt Scotland could have a first minister who opposed gay marriage, Mr Yousaf said: \"You can be a person of faith and be first minister.\" \n\"What people will judge any potential candidate on are their policies,\" he said, adding: \"That is the right discussion to have - not whether somebody of faith can be first minister.\"\nBoth Mr Swinney and Ms Forbes have said they are considering SNP leadership bids but that they need to consider what they feel is right for their families, party and country. \nA source close to Mr Swinney, who led the party between 2000 and 2004, told BBC Scotland News he had no plans to make an announcement on Wednesday.\nHe has been backed by several senior party figures, including Westminster leader Stephen Flynn, deputy leader Keith Brown and cabinet ministers Neil Gray, Shirley-Anne Somerville and Mairi McAllan.\nMs Forbes has been publicly supported by ex-ministers Fergus Ewing and Ivan McKee, as well as backbench MP Joanna Cherry.\nAllies of Ms Forbes told BBC Scotland News she had made progress planning a potential leadership bid, including on policy positions and resources, in case she decided to stand. \nHer supporters said she was not expected to make an announcement on Wednesday as it had only been 48 hours since Mr Yousaf announced his resignation.\nNominations for the SNP leadership opened on Monday and will close in one week. If more than one candidate receives 100 nominations from at least 20 local party branches, a ballot will be held among members to decide on a new leader.\nMr Yousaf has said he will resign as first minister once a new leader is chosen. At that point, parliament would have 28 days to nominate new first minister to be appointed by the King. \nIf MSPs could not reach an agreement after 28 days, a snap election would be called.  \nOne of the no-confidence motions, directed at the first minister himself, was pulled by the Scottish Tories",
    "Over 300 pro-Palestinian protesters at New York City university campuses were arrested Tuesday night after hundreds of police officers raided a building the students had taken over. \nDramatic footage showed police climbing a ladder to enter Hamilton Hall, which had been occupied at Columbia University, and later removing people handcuffed with zip ties. \nThe university had earlier told any students involved to leave or face expulsion.\nOfficials have said the building was cleared and no injuries were reported.\nThe New York Police Department (NYPD) said on Wednesday that nearly 300 people in total were arrested - including 119 at Columbia University and 173 from the nearby City College of New York - on charges of trespassing, criminal mischief and burglary.\nThe NYPD is still working to decipher who was affiliated with the university out of those who were arrested. \nAt Wednesday's news conference, New York Mayor Eric Adams said students had a \"right to protest\". \nBut he added: \"There's nothing peaceful about barricading buildings, destroying property or dismantling security cameras.\"\nThe demonstrators want the university to divest from Israel over its continuing deadly military operation in the Gaza Strip.\nThe Columbia protest is one of dozens across the country, including at campuses in Texas, California, Georgia, North Carolina, Utah, Virginia, New Mexico, California, New Jersey, Connecticut and Louisiana, where police have arrested more than 1,000 protesters.\nThe Columbia arrests came just before violence erupted over the war in Gaza at another campus hundreds of miles away on the West Coast. \nLengthy clashes broke out early Wednesday morning between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrators at the University of California in Los Angeles, after school administrators moved to shut down an encampment it called \"unlawful\". \nCounter-demonstrators clad in black arrived at the campus around midnight local time, before trying to tear down barricades around the encampment, the LA Times reported. Video footage showed flares and fireworks being set off, while other clips showed scuffles between the groups. \nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the scenes \"abhorrent and inexcusable\" and said police officers had arrived at the campus. \nIn New York, meanwhile, school officials authorised police officers to enter Hamilton Hall at Columbia University after student demonstrators inside defied a deadline to disperse. One student told the BBC that around 80-100 police stormed the building. \nColumbia said that after the hall was \"occupied, vandalised and blockaded, we were left with no choice\". In a letter to the New York Police Department (NYPD), President Minouche Shafik wrote that she requested police aid \"with the utmost regret\". \nOfficers said they used flashbang grenades to \"disorient protesters\" as the raid commenced, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. \nSome students could be heard shouting \"Shame on you!\" at the officers as they entered the building around 21:30 EST. \nNYPD Commissioner Edward Caban said those in the building tried to lock the police out, but officials were still able to gain access. \nSome students alleged that police clad in riot gear manhandled demonstrators as they stormed the building, with one telling the BBC that three people had been pushed down the stairs by NYPD officers. The interview was cut short moments later after an officer interrupted and slammed shut a window through which the conversation had been happening. \nNYPD assistant commissioner of public information, Carlos Nieves, defended the officers. He said that students had \"barricaded\" the doors to Hamilton Hall with \"conference tables, chairs or soda machines\". He alleged they had also blocked windows with newspaper so officers \"couldn't see\". \nHuge cheers of support by anti-war crowds were heard as the arrested students were marched off with their hands in zip ties. People also chanted: \"Let them go!\"\nThe activists have been occupying a tent camp at the Ivy League school in upper Manhattan for nearly two weeks.\nAll was relatively quiet on Columbia's campus on Wednesday as non-essential visitors are not allowed to enter. Some Columbia students could be seen packing up their possessions with the help of their parents. \nThe school has gone fully remote, and it will retain NYPD officers on campus until 17 May. \nNational politicians have called on colleges to do more, highlighting reports of antisemitism at some of the demonstrations.\nPresident Joe Biden earlier said demonstrations should be peaceful, but \"forcibly taking over buildings is not peaceful - it is wrong\".\nHis Democratic colleague, New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, condemned the police response at Columbia and urged Mayor Eric Adams to find a \"de-escalatory path\". \n\"This is the opposite of leadership and endangers public safety,\" she wrote. \"A nightmare in the making. I urge the mayor to reverse course.\"\nAnother New York Democrat, Congressman Jamaal B",
    "Kendrick Lamar has released a diss track attacking fellow rap star Drake, escalating their long-running feud.\nCalled Euphoria, the song is a response to weeks of taunting by Drake, who has taken pot-shots at Lamar on a series of viral diss tracks.\nOver six minutes, Lamar calls Drake a \"manipulator and habitual liar\", and criticises his parenting skills.\nHe also accuses the Canadian star of selling out, saying he only makes music to \"pacify\" fans.\nAnd he leaves listeners under no illusions about the strength of his feelings towards Drake. \n\"This ain't been 'bout critics, not about gimmicks, not about who the greatest,\" he raps. \"It's always been about love and hate, now let me say I'm the biggest hater.\"\n\"I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress.\"\nThe rappers' feud dates back to 2013, when Lamar was a relative newcomer. \nDuring a performance at the BET Awards, he boasted that his skills had \"tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pyjama clothes\". The line was interpreted as a reference to Drake, whose soul-baring blend of rap and R&B had changed the sound of hip-hop.\nThe feud simmered for a few years, boiling over again last year, when J Cole and Drake described themselves, along with Lamar, as the \"big three\" of rap, on the song First Person Shooter.\nThe seemingly innocuous comment went unremarked for months. Then, in the middle of March, Lamar delivered a fiery verse on Like That, declaring that there was no \"big three - it's just big me\".\nIn April, Drake released the first of two diss tracks, titled Push Ups, in which he mocked Lamar's height as well as his collaborations with Maroon 5 and Taylor Swift.\nLater that month, Drake dropped another song, Taylor Made Freestyle, in which he taunted Lamar, calling him a coward for failing to respond. \nThe track controversially used AI technology to imitate the voices of Snoop Dogg and the late Tupac Shakur - one of Lamar's heroes. \nAfter a complaint from Shakur's estate, Drake pulled the song off his Instagram.\nLamar's Euphoria similarly criticises the use of AI, saying it would \"make [Tu]pac turn in his grave\". \nHe also asks \"Am I battlin' ghost or AI?\" - a reference to the accusation that Drake has used ghostwriters in the past.\nLamar even addresses the time it took to record a response, with the combative lyric: \"Y'all think all of my life is rap? I got a son to raise, but I can see you know nothin' 'bout that.\"\nA former Pulitzer Prize winner for his fourth album, Damn, Lamar uses the song to display the dexterity of his voice, switching between flows and rhythmic meters throughout. \nHe even appears to be mimicking Drake's Toronto accent in the closing bars.\nHowever, fans who were hoping for a slam-dunk conclusion to the rap beef were disappointed.\nLamar conceded: \"I like Drake with with the melodies, I don't like Drake when he act tough,\" and declined to respond to Drake naming his wife on a previous song. \n\"We ain't gotta get personal, this a friendly fade, you should keep it that way,\" he rapped.\nThe rift has drawn in several other rappers over the last few months, with stars such as Kanye West, The Weeknd and Rick Ross releasing songs that reference the fall-out.\nDrake responded to Lamar's latest volley on Instagram, sharing a scene from the 1990s romcom 10 Things I Hate About You, where Julia Stiles' character recites a poem listing her grievances against Heath Ledger's \"bad boy\" character.\nIt's presumably intended as a parody of Lamar's lyrics - but Drake seems to have forgotten how the scene ends.\n\"I hate the way I don't hate you,\" says Stiles, choking back tears. \"Not even close, not even a little bit.\"",
    "Felix Collins' job would not be suitable for anyone who is squeamish about insects.\nThe founder and boss of a company called Full Circle Biotechnology, he is in charge of 20 million black soldier fly larvae.\nBased at a small, indoor facility on the outskirts of Bangkok, the firm rears the insects to produce animal feed for the country's shrimp and pig farms.\nThe larvae, which live in a dark, warm and humid environment, feed on fruit and vegetable waste sourced from food and drink manufacturers, before being harvested and combined with probiotic bacteria and mushrooms.\nMr Collins says the product is a more environmentally-friendly alternative to the soybean-based animal feeds that dominate the market. The latter have been repeatedly linked to deforestation in South America.\nHe also claims that the firm's insect-based feed has a carbon footprint that is \"100 times lower than that of soymeal\".\nStudies agree that insect-based feed generally does have a lower carbon footprint, but only if the larvae have been fed natural food waste. If the insects have been given a processed food source, then one report says that soybean-based feed produces less carbon.\nMr Collins adds that the feed made by Full Circle, contains up to 70% protein, compared with soy, which has less than 50% protein - making the insect feed more filling and nutritious.\nFounded in 2019, Full Circle now employs 14 people, and supplies 49 farms across Thailand. It wants to increase this, but faces a hurdle - soybean-based feed is currently substantially cheaper.\nSoybean feed is presently around 460 euros ($490; \u00a3400) per tonne, compared with \u20ac1,400 for insect-based, according to one European comparison earlier this year.\nTo try to reduce the price of its feed, Full Circle is now turning to AI to help maximise production at a lower cost. To do this it is training an AI system to study all available past and present data on insect farming to determine and then continuously fine tune the best methods.\nThis can include everything from temperature to food quantity, the optimum space that the larvae need, quickly and accurately counting thousands of flies, and whether to introduce new strains or species.\n\"AI can help us speed up the process of trial and error, helping us overcome obstacles, and develop a thorough enough understanding of insect production, to be reasonably confident that our production is optimised,\" says Mr Collins.\n\"AI can help us process, record and understand every attempt at insect farming to date, and expand the potential for a larger and more nutritious crop every time we grow one.\"\nRead more stories on artificial intelligence\nSome 5,000 miles away in Lithuania, insect farm software provider Cogastro is also working on an AI-based system. It currently sells monitoring software that automatically collects data for users to analyse, but the AI upgrade will enable to system to learn, adapt and make changes inside an insect farm for itself.\nCogastro says it is not rushing the launch of the AI, and instead plans to launch it commercially in the next three years.\nIts founder and chief executive Mante Sidlauskaite, says she is wary of companies in the space that claim they already have AI systems readily available. \"We know from our example that it takes time to develop a layer of software, and we have been here already for five years.\n\"It has taken us time to work with as many companies as possible globally, to understand the differences and similarities of their processes, so that we would be able to standardise our data models to cover their overlapping needs. So we now have a baseline to build an AI solution.\n\"But when we see start-ups coming up just yesterday, and then announcing that they have something related to AI, they cannot have an accurate AI model before they start to train it, and to train it, you need to have some data, and to have data you need to have some customers first.\"\nShe adds that she is concerned about the overuse of AI as a buzzword, without firms explaining exactly how their AI supposedly works.\nBack at Full Circle, it is developing its AI system with a Singapore-based expert in the field called Simon Christofides.\nMr Collins says that as black soldier fly larvae have only been farmed commercially over the past decade and a half, there is still much to learn, and that the use of AI can rapidly speed up this process.\n\"Rice farmers are still trying to create the perfect crop after 13,500 years of passed down generational learning,\" he says. \"Black soldier fly larvae have been farmed for 0.1% of the time rice has been grown, and that's reflected in our current understanding.\"\nMr Collins adds that the firm's strategy will be to use AI to glean insights \"no human could ever achieve\", by using multiple sensors and crunching millions of data points.\nYet he adds that sometimes you just need to leave the flies to get on with things on their own. Such as the breeding process, whereby mature flies mate on green ribbons laid",
    "Johnson & Johnson has outlined a new settlement that it said would resolve nearly all of the lawsuits it faces over claims that its talc products, including baby powder, caused cancer.\nThe pharmaceutical giant said it was offering $6.475bn (\u00a35.2bn) over 25 years to former customers with ovarian cancer claims.\nThose represent the vast majority of the more than 59,000 lawsuits it faces.\nIn all, it said it was now setting aside about $11bn (\u00a38.8bn) to address the talc litigation.\n\nThis is the third settlement offer Johnson & Johnson has put forward to try to address the claims from former customers, which have weighed on the company's reputation and stock price. \nIt said none of the cases against it had \"merit\" but it was now seeking votes of support for the proposal from its opponents in the hope of ending the litigation. \nLast year, it proposed to pay nearly $9bn (\u00a37.2bn) for a more comprehensive deal, which would have addressed lung cancer and mesothelioma claims, as well as litigation from state attorneys general in the US. \nThe company said it was working separately to resolve those matters and had addressed 95% of the mesothelioma claims. \nIt also announced a tentative $700m (\u00a3560m) settlement with the states in January.  \nErik Haas, the company's worldwide vice president of litigation, said he hoped that putting the latest deal directly to ovarian cancer claimants would help bring the fights to a close.\n\u201cUnlike the prior cases, it is the vote of the claimants \u2013 and not the conflicting financial incentives of the small minority of plaintiff lawyers who stand to receive excessive legal fees outside of a reorganization \u2013 that decides whether the Plan may proceed,\u201d he said.\nThe company said the $6.475bn sum was \"far better recovery than the claimants stand to recover at trial\" and that the slow nature of the legal process meant most of those effected would never have \u201ctheir day in court\u201d.\nThe deal drew mixed reactions from lawyers representing former customers.\n\"If a bankruptcy court accepts the proposal, J&J would pay pennies on the dollar for ovarian cancer and mesothelioma claims,\" lawyers Mike Papantonio and Andy Birchfield said in a statement.\nJohnson & Johnson stopped US sales of its talc-based baby powder in 2020, citing \"misinformation\" that had sapped demand for the product, applied to prevent nappy rash and for other cosmetic uses, including dry shampoo. In 2022, it announced plans to end sales globally.\nBefore that decision, the company had sold the baby powder for almost 130 years. It continues to sell a version of the product that contains cornstarch.\nJohnson & Johnson has won a majority of the talc lawsuits against it and has maintained the products did not contain asbestos and did not cause cancer.\nBut it has been stuck with some significant losses, including one decision in which 22 women were awarded a judgement of more than $2bn.\nIt previously tried to resolve the lawsuits in bankruptcy court.\nBut its efforts ran into trouble after judges have ruled that the subsidiary it created to be responsible for the claims was not in financial distress and could not use the bankruptcy system to resolve the lawsuits.\n\n",
    "The US central bank again said it would keep interest rates unchanged, noting a \"lack of further progress\" toward lowering inflation.\nThe decision left the Federal Reserve's key rate hovering at the highest level in more than two decades, in the range of 5.25%-5.5%, where it has stood since last July.\nBy keeping borrowing costs high, the Fed is hoping to cool the economy and reduce the pressures pushing up prices.\nBut with inflation in the US proving more persistent than expected, the bank is facing questions about its next move.\nAnalysts who had expected the bank to start cutting rates early this year have been forced to postpone forecasts - and some have even raised the possibility of a rate rise. \nAt a press conference following the announcement, Fed chairman Jerome Powell said he thought that a rate increase was \"unlikely\", while repeating that officials wanted greater confidence that inflation was easing before moving to cut. \n\"It really will depend on the data,\" he said. \n\"It's going to take longer to reach that point of comfort. I don't know how long it will take,\" he added. \nIn the US, consumer prices rose 3.5% over the 12 months to March.\nThat is down sharply from the 9.1% rate seen in June 2022, but remains above the Fed's 2% target, ticking higher in recent months. \nIn its statement announcing its latest decision on Wednesday, the Fed drew attention to those trends, noting \"a lack of further progress\" bringing inflation back to its goal.\n\"The statement explicitly recognises the recent deterioration in inflation dynamics,\" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.\n\"Patience is the watchword now for the Fed and the risk of fewer or no rate cuts this year is growing.\" \nThe Fed has left rates untouched since last July, after boosting them aggressively from near zero in March 2022.\nHigher interest rates trickle out to the public in the form of more expensive mortgages, car and business loans and other debt.\nThe Fed's moves are being closely watched around the world where many central banks, including the Bank of England, have also had a prolonged period of sharply raised rates. \nMr Powell said policymakers in other countries may move more quickly than the US to cut rates due to worries about economic slowdown.\n\"The difference between the United States and other countries that are now considering rate cuts is they're just not having the kind of growth we're having,\" he said. \"We can be patient.\"\nSeparately, the Fed also outlined its previously-discussed plans to slow the pace at which it is shrinking its holdings of US Treasuries.\nIt built up those holdings as part of its stimulus efforts to bolster the economy when the pandemic hit in 2020, starting to reverse the moves two years later. \nMr Powell said the decision to slow that process was aimed at avoiding disruption to financial markets and not intended to influence the inflation fight.",
    "A man died in hospital eight days after being beaten following a road rage incident, a murder trial has heard.\nAndrew Peart, 39, suffered a serious head injury when he was assaulted with a \"bat\" by Jake McIntyre in Guide Post, Northumberland, prosecutors told Newcastle Crown Court.\nMr McIntyre, 28 and from Stakeford, Ashington, denies murder.\nOpening the trial, prosecutor David Lamb KC, said Mr McIntyre intended to hurt or seriously harm Mr Peart.\nMr Lamb said Mr Peart had left his partner's home on the evening of 22 August and was heading towards the Co-op store in Guide Post.\nAs he neared the shop, Mr Peart stepped into the road in front of a Mitsubishi Shogun being driven by Mr McIntyre, the court heard.\n\"That resulted in some words being exchanged\", Mr Lamb said, adding: \"It was a fairly minor episode and over quite quickly.\"\nBut after driving away, Mr McIntyre drove back round and assaulted Mr Peart with some form of weapon, Mr Lamb said.\nA worker in the shop saw Mr McIntyre punching Mr Peart and knocking him to the ground before driving away, the court heard.\nMr Lamb said Mr Peart was able to get up and walk away, and rang someone to say he had been \"struck by the lad in the car with a bat\".\nHe also told his partner he had been hit with a \"metal bar\", Mr Lamb said.\nAbout three hours later while at a friend's house, a large lump appeared on his head and Mr Peart's condition began to \"deteriorate\" with him \"wobbling and rocking around\", Mr Lamb said.\nHis friends called for an ambulance but were told it would take an hour to arrive, so two friends carried him outside to try and flag down a car.\nA van stopped and took him to Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital in Cramlington, where a CT scan revealed a large haemorrhage in his head.\nHe was transferred to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary where he underwent surgery for a fractured skull and blood clot squeezing his brain.\nDespite medical treatment, Mr Peart died from an \"unsurvivable traumatic brain injury\"  at about 12:30 BST on 30 August, the court heard.\nMr Lamb said: \"The prosecution's case is [Mr McIntyre] deliberately struck Andrew Peart to the head and, as a result of the injury he inflicted on him, Andrew died.\n\"And at the time that Jake McIntyre hit him, he intended either to kill him or at the very least to do him serious bodily harm.\"\nThe day after the attack, Mr McIntyre sent voice messages and videos to friends in which he said he hit Mr Peart on the leg with a metal wheel brace, \"wrapped a pole\" around his head and had \"given some little crackhead street justice\".\nHe also said he was \"hiding\" from police and using another car to avoid the Shogun being found, the court was told, with detectives not discovering the car until March.\nThe court heard he and his girlfriend went to the Lake District the day after the attack and Mr McIntyre was arrested at a hotel in Bowness-on-Windermere.\nIn interview, Mr McIntyre, of Stakeford Crescent, told police he was \"six out of 10\" angry after Mr Peart shouted at him and he felt \"threatened\".\nHe said there was a minor physical altercation in which he punched Mr Peart in \"self defence\".\nMr McIntyre said he went to the Lake District as his family had been threatened and he wanted to protect his girlfriend.\nPathologist Dr Sam Hoggard found a \"faint probable tramline bruise\" on Mr Peart's left thigh suggesting he had been struck with a heavy cylindrical object, and \"such a weapon could also account for the fatal head injury sustained\", Mr Lamb said.\nThe trial, which is expected to last up to two weeks, continues.\nFollow BBC North East  on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

    "The UK government has said it will look into the case of a Glasgow-based Iranian national believed to have been identified for deportation to Rwanda.\nThe case of 21-year-old Abdullah Salimi was raised in the House of Commons by SNP MP Anne McLaughlin.\nShe said her constituent had been detained on Tuesday while attending a routine Home Office appointment. \nShe said he had then been driven for 10 hours to a detention centre in the London area. \nMs McLaughin also claimed that Mr Salimi had been given \"no food or water\" on the journey, had his phone confiscated and was without legal representation. \nThe Glasgow North East MP told the Commons: \"I am his MP. I have the right to know what's going on in his life and the right to represent him.\"\nThe Home Office minister Tom Pursglove said it was \"entirely right and proper that people are detained on a legal basis for the purposes of removal under this policy\".\nHe added: \"There are always safeguards around that. We will of course in the normal way look very carefully at any concerns she wishes to raise.\n\"I recognise that she is entirely opposed to the policy objective that we're seeking to advance - there is a principle disagreement there.\n\"But on those specific points if she'd like to share them with me I will gladly ensure she receives a full response.\"\nIt came as the government confirmed that migrants identified for deportation to Rwanda have started to be detained in a series of operations across the UK.\nThe policy seeks to deter people from crossing the English Channel from France in small boats.\nThe Home Office has not said how many people have been detained, but more operations are due to be carried out in the coming weeks. \nThe announcement came the day before people in England go to the polls in local elections.\nLegislation aimed at reviving the plan to send some asylum seekers to the east African country was passed into law last week.\nThe government says any asylum seeker entering the UK \"illegally\" after 1 January 2022, from a safe country such as France, could be sent to Rwanda.\nThey would have their asylum claims processed there, rather in than the UK.\nIf successful, they could be granted refugee status and allowed to stay in the landlocked east-central African country.\nIf not, they could apply to settle in Rwanda on other grounds, or seek asylum in another \"safe third country\".\nNo asylum seeker would be able to apply to return to the UK.\nThe government had previously said it was aiming for flights to Rwanda to take off by the spring but now says this should happen in nine to 11 weeks - although the plan could still be held up by legal challenges. \nAfter the Supreme Court ruled that the scheme was unlawful in November of last year, the UK government introduced a bill stating that Rwanda is a safe country.\nThe legislation - which was finally approved on 22 April after intense political wrangling - orders the courts to ignore key sections of the Human Rights Act.\nIt also compels the courts to disregard other British laws or international rules - such as the international Refugee Convention - which would block deportations to Rwanda.\nThe Supreme Court had ruled unanimously that the Rwanda scheme was unlawful, with judges raising concerns that genuine refugees would be at risk of being returned to their home countries, where they could face harm.\nThe ruling also cited concerns about Rwanda's poor human-rights record and its past treatment of refugees, with judges also saying that the UK government has previously Rwanda over \"extrajudicial killings, deaths in custody, enforced disappearances and torture\".\nResponding to the initial detentions, Home Secretary James Cleverly said: \"Our dedicated enforcement teams are working at pace to swiftly detain those who have no right to be here so we can get flights off the ground.\"\nHome Office director of enforcement Eddy Montgomery said teams were trained to ensure detentions were carried out safely.\nHe added: \"It is vital that operational detail is kept to a minimum, to protect colleagues involved and those being detained, as well as ensuring we can deliver this large-scale operation as quickly as possible.\"\nProvisional figures released by the Home Office show a total of 7,567 people crossed the Channel in boats between January and April of this year - 27% more than the number of arrivals recorded in the same period last year.

    "Looted artefacts from the Asante kingdom are finally on display in Ghana, 150 years after British colonisers took them.\nGhanaians flocked to the Manhyia Palace Museum in Kumasi, the capital of Asante region, to welcome the 32 items home.\n\"This is a day for Asante. A day for the Black African continent. The spirit we share is back,\" said Asante King Otumfuo Osei Tutu II.\nAt this stage the items have only been loaned to Ghana for three years.\nThis loan can be extended, but only with the approval of the British culture secretary.\nThe agreement is between two British museums - the Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A) and British Museum - and the Asante king, not the Ghanaian government.\nThe Asante king, or Asantehene, is seen as a symbol of traditional authority, and is believed to be invested with the spirits of his predecessors. But his kingdom is now part of Ghana's modern democracy.\n\"Our dignity is restored,\" Henry Amankwaatia, a retired police commissioner and proud Asante, told the BBC, over the hum of jubilant drumming.\nThe V&A is lending 17 pieces while 15 are from the British Museum.\nThe return of the artefacts coincides with the silver jubilee celebration of the Asantehene.\nSome of the items, described by some as \"Ghana's crown jewels\" were looted during the Anglo-Ashanti wars of the 19th Century, including the famous Sagrenti War of 1874.  \nOther items like the gold harp (Sankuo) were given to a British diplomat in 1817.\n\"We acknowledge the very painful history surrounding the acquisition of these objects. A history tainted by the scars of imperial conflict and colonialism,\" said Dr Tristam Hunt, director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, who has travelled to Kumasi for the ceremony.\nAmong the returned artefacts are the sword of state, gold peace pipe and gold badges worn by officials charged with cleansing the soul of the king.\n\"These treasures have borne witness to triumph and trials of the great kingdom and their return to Kumasi is testament to the power of cultural exchange and reconciliation,\" said Dr Hunt.\nOne of the returned items, the sword of state, also called the \"mpompomsuo sword\" holds great significance for the Asante people. \nIt serves as a sword of office that is used in swearing the oath of office to the kingdom by paramount chiefs and the king himself.\nRoyal historian Osei-Bonsu Safo-Kantanka told the BBC that when the items were taken from the Asante it took away \"a portion of our heart, our feeling, our whole being\".\nThe return of the artefacts is as controversial as it is significant. \nUnder UK law, national museums like the V&A and British Museum are banned from permanently giving back contested items in their collections, and loan deals such as this are seen as a way to allow objects to return to their countries of origin.\nSome countries laying claim to disputed artefacts fear that loans may be used to imply they accept the UK's ownership.\nMany Ghanaians feel the ornaments should remain permanently. However, this new arrangement is a way to overcome British legal restrictions.\nAfrican countries have repeatedly called for the return of looted items with some regaining ownership over precious historical artefacts in recent years.\nIn 2022 Germany gave back over 1,000 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria. The German foreign minister said at the time it was a step in dealing with a \"dark colonial history\".\nAll pictures subject to copyright",
    "Pro-Palestinian students have occupied some university campuses in the UK, to protest against the war in Gaza. \nStudents in Leeds, Newcastle and Bristol set up tents outside university buildings, on Wednesday, and called for supporters to donate food, drinks and hygiene products. \nElsewhere, student activists held marches and one-off protests.\nOne camp, at Warwick University, has been set up in the town's piazza for a week.\nThe UK protests follow much larger demonstrations on campuses across the US, most prominently at Columbia University, in New York.\nMore than 1,000 protesters have been arrested in the US - dozens on Tuesday night, after police raided a Columbia building occupied by students for almost two weeks. \nOrganisers of the Warwick protest said they had begun the occupation because the university had \"ignored\" previous demonstrations.\n\"After countless demonstrations, sit-ins, open letters and even a motion through our students union, the university hasn't even engaged with us, let alone met our demands,\" they said on a fundraising page.\nWarwick University said it was \"working to begin discussions\" with the protesters about their demands.\n\"We recognise our students and staff have a right to voice their opinions, as freedom of speech is a vital component of university life,\" it said.\n\"We are continuing to urge everyone to respect the views of others even when they are different to their own.\"\nProtesters want their universities to divest from Israel in response to its deadly military operation in the Gaza Strip.\nDivestment means selling off stock in Israeli companies or otherwise dropping financial ties. \nLewi, who asked for his surname be withheld, told BBC News he had been at the Newcastle encampment since it had begun, at about 08:00 on Wednesday, and students across the country had coordinated their protests for roughly the same time. \nAbout 60 students and staff members were there, with more expected to join for a rally later in the day, he said.\n\"We've tried to be democratic since 10 October, when activism on campus began,\" Lewi said. \n\"And since then, we've had no luck. \n\"So now, we've resorted to an indefinite encampment until the university will enter negotiations with us.\" \nNorthumbria Police told BBC News there was \"a proportionate policing presence\" at the protest. \nLewi said the UK protests, while influenced by the Columbia occupation, were distinct.\n\"What's happened at Columbia has obviously inspired us to a degree but we have been thinking about this for a while,\" he said, adding the police response to student protests in the UK was \"less heavy-handed generally than the US\". \n\"Thankfully we're able to have our free speech on campus to a degree.\n\"And we're able to have freedom of assembly. \n\"So while the thing in Columbia has inspired us, I think there is a slight difference in what we're both wanting.\"\nAre you affected by the issues raised in this story?

    "I'm in Victory Park, Moscow's giant memorial complex dedicated to the Soviet Union's defeat of Nazi Germany. A new open-air exhibition has just opened.\nBut it has nothing to do with World War Two.\nOn display is Western military hardware captured by the Russian army in Ukraine.\nThey are war trophies and Russia has decided to flaunt them.\nAmong the armour here is a British Army Husky tactical support vehicle which had been donated to Ukraine. Its windscreen is covered in bullet-holes.\nOpposite the Husky I can see Western tanks that had been transferred to the Ukrainian military. There's an American Abrams which had been damaged on the battlefield. A German Leopard tank, too. \nIn fact, there's a long line of German armour. And above it a sign: \"History is repeating itself.\"\nThe Russian authorities want the public to think that the war in Ukraine and World War Two have a common denominator: Russia as the victim, under attack from enemies abroad.\nIn reality, the two wars are very different. In 1941 Germany invaded Russia. In 2022 Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nThe war trophy exhibition is packed out.\nIn bright sunshine Russians are crowding round the military hardware, posing for photographs in front of tank gun barrels and, from the sounds of it, thoroughly enjoying the display.\n\"It's incredible. Jaw-dropping,\" says Natalya, who's here with her husband and small daughter.\n\"It's amazing to think that our guys managed to get these trophies.\"\nMore than 30 armoured vehicles have been put on display.\nBut why?\nThe Russians have not invented the wheel here. In the past Ukraine has displayed Russian military hardware that had been captured by the Ukrainian army.\nBut for the Russian authorities, this exhibition has, I believe, several key objectives.\nThe first is to reinforce the Kremlin's narrative that, in Ukraine, Nato - and the West as a whole - are waging war on Russia. The aim here is to demonise the West yet further in the minds of Russians.\nIn reality, it was Russia that invaded Ukraine: something Western leaders had urged Moscow not to do. It was President Vladimir Putin's personal decision to launch what Russia still refers to as the \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. \nWith supplies of arms and ammunition, the West came to Kyiv's defence. It does not seek to destroy Russia, despite what Russian officials may claim.\nThen there's the historical symbolism.\nRight now Victory Park is ablaze with red flags commemorating the upcoming Victory Day, the 9 May national holiday which marks Hitler's defeat. \nThe venue for this exhibition (a World War Two memorial) and the timing (ahead of Victory Day) feed that other official narrative I mentioned earlier: the one claiming a link between World War Two and the war in Ukraine.\nBut there's also a large element of gloating about this exhibition. Regarding the war in Ukraine, the Russians appear increasingly confident, despite the recent $61bn (\u00a349bn) package of US assistance to Kyiv. Moscow believes it now has the initiative on the battlefield.\nRussia's main message is written on a big sign beside the war trophies. \nIt reads: \"Our victory is inevitable.\" ",
    "The mother of an Israeli-American man being held in Gaza has told the BBC that Israel and Hamas must urgently agree a new ceasefire and hostage release deal.\nRachel Goldberg-Polin's son Hersh, who turned 23 four days before he was kidnapped from the Nova festival on 7 October, was seen in captivity in a new video released last week.\nShe described how she felt when she first watched it.\n\"As soon as I heard his voice I started to cry, because I haven't heard his voice in half a year. \n\"To see him moving, and to see that he is clearly medically compromised, and that he's fragile. His father Jon and I were both just crying, and I was holding my heart.\"\n\"I don't even know what I was saying. I was just making noises and crying, and Jon was crying\".\nHersh Goldberg-Polin was at the Nova music festival in a forested area close to the Gaza Strip when Hamas-led gunmen stormed Israel's border fence, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. \nMore than 360 of those killed were attending the festival event.\nHersh managed to get several kilometres away from the festival site in a car, before seeking refuge in a roadside bomb shelter with several dozen others. But outside, Hamas gunmen gathered and began throwing in grenades.\nBefore Wednesday, the last time he had been seen alive was in a Hamas video that showed him being loaded on to a pick-up truck, with part of his left arm missing.\nIn the new video, posted to Hamas's Telegram account, Hersh lifts his arm to the camera to show a healed stump where his hand should be. He criticises Israel's military campaign in Gaza before speaking directly to his parents and two sisters, urging them to keep campaigning for his release.\n\"We're clearly very concerned about the injury,\" Mrs Goldberg-Polin told me. \n\"We've had several surgeons who have seen the video that say he needs another surgery immediately. If he was treated, it was an emergency treatment. He needs a second surgery at least.\" \n\"He is considered in a fragile and compromised medical state, and so we're concerned about that.\"\nAs a 23-year-old man, Hersh would not be expected to be included in the next batch of hostages whose release is being discussed, which includes woman and the elderly. \nBut those with medical conditions also fall into the category to be freed, and so the family hope that he will be included - although they have not had any confirmation.\nMrs Goldberg-Polin says she is scheduled to meet the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, on his latest visit to Israel, which it is hoped will give further impetus to the negotiations. \nShe had a clear message for all of the parties involved.\n\"I think that everyone here has leverage. Everyone is using their leverage. But are they using it to the maximum? The answer is clearly no. Because we still have 133 people there in Gaza. \n\"I am hopeful and optimistic. I'm really praying that all the parties, everyone decides that they're going to be courageous, be daring, and put an end to all the suffering in this region\".\nIt is expected that Hamas will respond to the latest Israeli proposal in the next 24 hours. The hope is that it can provide a foundation to negotiate a concrete deal, and not be rejected outright. \nThe details are yet to be officially confirmed but are believed to involve the release of 33 hostages during a five to six week ceasefire. An as-yet-unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners would be released from Israeli jails. There is also believed to be a commitment to discuss a future end point for the war.\nBut even as those discussions continue, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he is planning a ground offensive in Rafah regardless of the outcome. Around 1.4 million displaced Palestinians are sheltering there after fleeing their homes during the heavy fighting in northern and central parts of Gaza.\nMore than 34,500 people have been killed in Gaza since 7 October, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has been conducting a military campaign to destroy Hamas and free the hostages.\nA deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 hostages - most of them women and children - in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.",
    "The UK will not accept the return of asylum seekers from Ireland, the prime minister has told MPs.\nThe Irish government has complained of a significant spike in the number of asylum seekers arriving in Ireland from Northern Ireland, and argued the UK has a duty to take them back. \nBut Rishi Sunak told the Commons the UK had no legal obligation to do so. \nHe also urged the Irish government to honour its pledges to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland. \nOn Tuesday, Irish Justice Minister Helen McEntee announced she was releasing 100 police officers from desktop duties to work on frontline immigration enforcement, in response to a rising number of asylum seekers who, she claimed, were coming from Northern Ireland because they feared being sent to Rwanda.\nDuring Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Sunak said Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris was \"seeking urgent clarification\" from Dublin that \"there will be no disruption or police checkpoints at or near the border\". \n\"I can confirm that the United Kingdom has no legal obligation to accept returns of illegal migrants from Ireland,\" he added. \nDowning Street has repeatedly argued that the UK is under no obligation to take asylum seekers back from Ireland, and will not do so while France continues to refuse to accept returns from the UK.\nFollowing Brexit, the 310-mile frontier between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic is the only land border between the UK and the EU. \nBut both governments have agreed that a return to security posts here could jeopardise the Good Friday Agreement, which helped to end nearly 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland. \nIn the Commons, Democratic Unionist MP Carla Lockhart dismissed Dublin's claim that 80% of asylum seekers were entering Ireland from Northern Ireland as \"unsubstantiated\", suggesting \"the reverse is true\".  \nShe also accused the Irish government of \"hypocrisy\" given its previous statements about the border.\nMr Sunak said the UK had \"made commitments to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland\" and the \"Irish government must uphold its promises too\".\n\"We can't have cherry-picking of important international agreements,\" he added. \nThe prime minister said it was \"no surprise that our robust approach to illegal migration is providing a deterrent, but the answer is not sending police to villages in Donegal\".\n\"It's to work with us in partnership to strengthen our external borders all around the Common Travel Area [an open borders area including the UK, Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands] that we share.\" \nThe UK has an operational agreement with Ireland on the Common Travel Area which Dublin says provides for returning asylum seekers, but No 10 has said this is not legally binding and that no one has been returned to the UK under its terms.\nLabour said it agreed the UK should not accept returns from Ireland \"while Britain is not able to return people who arrive here from the EU\".\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris has said his country will not \"provide a loophole\" for others' migration \"challenges\".\nBut he added that there would be no police checkpoints on the border.\nThe Safety of Rwanda Act, which became law last week, aims to deter migrants from crossing the Channel in small boats by deporting some asylum seekers to the east African country. \nThe Home Office has announced that migrants identified for deportation to Rwanda have begun being detained. \nIt said more operations would be carried out in the coming weeks.",
    "On a day off from his criminal trial in a Manhattan court, Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail with back-to-back rallies in two battleground states. \nThe Republican presidential candidate has appeared at times irritated or lethargic in court while facing charges of falsifying business records - even at one point allegedly dozing off. \nBut on Wednesday at a rally outside of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he seemed fired up as he spoke to a crowd of enthusiastic supporters for about an hour and a half.\nHe hit on most of his campaign's major themes - immigration, the economy, foreign policy and his opposition to President Joe Biden. \nAs he usually does on the campaign trail, he frequently ad-libbed his remarks - \"I'm 92% off teleprompter,\" he said in an implicit gibe at his Democratic rival, who he often accuses of being overly reliant on scripted remarks.\nThe former president was fined $9,000 (\u00a37,180) this week for making derogatory public statements about people involved in the case, which revolves around a hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels, a pornographic actress who says she had an affair with Mr Trump. \nIn Wisconsin, he briefly addressed his legal troubles. \n\"I got indicted - think of it - for nothing,\" he claimed.\n\"I have a crooked judge, he's a totally conflicted judge,\" said Mr Trump, who is still free to criticise Justice Juan Merchan under the terms of his gag order. \"Unfortunately it's a 95% or so Democrat area.\" \nHe went on to criticise the other criminal indictments against him and said \"my poll numbers are higher than they've ever been\". Most recent polls show him in a very tight race with Mr Biden.  \nA new Emerson College Polling/The Hill swing state survey finds Mr Biden slightly trailing Mr Trump in Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. \nMany of Mr Trump's fans here said they believed he was being unfairly prosecuted and, echoing the candidate himself, that his criminal trial would eventually boost his standing at the polls. \n\"The trial is definitely going to increase his popularity,\" said Nancy Ridge, a supporter from nearby Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, who was wearing a jacket printed with Mr Trump's mugshot on the back and the words \"Wanted: for president\". \n\"Especially among lower-class people who have been convicted of crimes or even falsely accused. \n\"They understand the justice system and how corrupt it can be,\" she said.\n\"It's free publicity,\" said Jerry Cleppe, another Trump fan waiting in a queue outside the event. \n\"It doesn't matter if it's good or bad, it's attention. The trial is a good thing.\"\nMr Trump also addressed the pro-Palestinian student protests at US colleges and said the New York Police Department \"did an incredible job\" clearing an occupied building on the campus of Columbia University on Tuesday night. \n\"To every college president I say remove the encampments immediately, vanquish the radicals and take back our campuses for all of the normal students who want a safe place from which to learn,\" he said.\nHe also touched on abortion, in a week in which an interview with Time Magazine was seized upon by the Biden campaign as being anti-abortion rights. \nMr Trump insisted that leaving the legality of abortion up to individual states was the right thing to do and that he thought \"people are absolutely thrilled\" with a state-by-state patchwork of laws on the issue.\nAfter his rally in Wisconsin, the former president hosted another event in Michigan. He is due back in court in Manhattan on Thursday.",
    "New rules that tighten Chinese government restrictions on the country's internet companies have come into effect today, raising concerns about how they will be applied.\nThe expanded State Secrets Law compels firms - including social media giants Tencent, ByteDance and Weibo - to take action if users post sensitive information.\nIt requires \"network operators\" to monitor information being shared by users. The rules also describe how posts should be removed, records saved and reported to authorities.\nThis is the law's first update in more than a decade and is in line with President Xi Jinping's focus on national security as the government cracks down on China's vast technology industry.\nWhen the new rules were first announced in February, a National Administration of State Secrets Protection official told the state news agency Xinhua that they were necessary as \"the guarding of state secrets faces new problems and challenges in the new era\".\nWhile internet companies in China are already subject to strict rules, the changes \"set a new standard for active self-monitoring and rapid cooperation\", said Hong Kong-based law professor, Ryan Mitchell.\nThe revised rules also broaden the definition of what may be deemed as sensitive information to include \"work secrets\", or information about the decision-making of state agencies, which could be particularly problematic for journalists, including foreign correspondents.\n\"A main concern for us is the uncertainty as to what really constitutes a 'state secret',\" Jens Eskelund, President of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China told the BBC.\n\"Clear demarcations and definitions would be helpful,\" he added.\nTaiwan has also voiced concerns about the new rules and said they could place visitors from the island to China at risk.\nTaipei\u2019s Mainland Affairs Council said the legislation is \u201chighly vague and may cause people to break the law at any time\".\nThe international law firm Baker McKenzie FenXun said that while the definition of what are considered to be state secrets is \"broad and vague\" it should not have a substantial impact on multi-national companies operating in China.\nThe new regulations come as the social media giant TikTok, and its Chinese parent company ByteDance, are facing increased scrutiny in the US and other Western countries.\nHowever, the new rules \u201cdo not seem to be mainly geared towards regulating the overseas operations of Chinese firms\u201d, Mr Mitchell said.",
    "The former boss of Camelot has been confirmed as interim chairman of the Post Office after its last leader was sacked.\nNigel Railton has been appointed by Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch after Henry Staunton departed in January.\nHe takes on the role as hundreds of sub-postmasters are still waiting for compensation over the Horizon scandal.\nMr Railton spent 24 years at former National Lottery operator Camelot UK before stepping down last year.\nHe also worked for car manufacturer Daewoo and the former British Rail.\nMr Railton has agreed to a 12-month stint as Post Office chairman, the BBC understands.\nMs Badenoch said she wanted to thank Mr Railton for \"stepping up to public service at a time of need\".\n\"I know he can help fix the issues of the past whilst transforming the company for the future,\" she added.\nThe Department for Business and Trade appointing Mr Railton signals a new beginning in its relationship with the troubled Post Office, which is owned by the government.\nThe organisation is currently the subject of a long-running inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal, where hundreds of sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted after faulty software made it appear money was missing from their accounts.\nIn a statement following his appointment, Mr Railton said: \"This is an incredibly challenging time for the Post Office as it works to address historic failures while also striving to transform its business.\"\nMr Railton left the former National Lottery operator during a shake-up around the time Allwyn Entertainment acquired Camelot UK.\nCamelot had run the lottery since the game's launch in 1994, but it faced tough competition and its licence ended in February, with a new one for 10 years being given to Allwyn instead.\nThe new Post Office chairman also chairs Argentex Group, a London-listed provider of currency management services, and is a trustee of the Social Mobility Foundation, according to his profile on the social platform LinkedIn.\nFormer chairman Henry Staunton was sacked by Ms Badenoch in January after little more than a year in the role - leading to a bitter public row between the two.\nAfter his exit, Mr Staunton claimed in an interview with the Sunday Times that he had been advised by a civil servant to stall compensation payments to allow the government to \"limp into the election\" without the impact of a large pay-out.\nThe government strongly denied the allegation and Ms Badenoch claimed Mr Staunton was under a \"formal investigation\" for \"serious matters such as bullying\".\nMr Staunton refuted this. He then disclosed in February that it was actually current chief executive Nick Read who was under investigation after a Speak Up complaint was made against him.\nThe Post Office confirmed at the time there were complaints against Mr Read and other staff, however he has since been cleared of all misconduct allegations following an investigation carried out by an external barrister.\nThe row has been criticised by former sub-postmasters, including campaigner Alan Bates, who described it as a \"sideshow\" to the inquiry.",
    "A former Metropolitan Police officer has received a minimum jail sentence of more than 13 years after being convicted of 10 counts of rape, including three of raping a child under the age of 13.\nHis two victims described Cliff Mitchell, aged 24, as \"the devil\" and \"a pathetic excuse of a man\". \nMitchell, of Wandsworth, south-west London, was a PC in the Met when several of the offences happened.\nHe was sacked by the force in 2023.\nWarning: this article includes distressing details\nThe court heard during his trial how Mitchell had kidnapped and raped one of his two victims while armed with a knife in September 2023, telling her to put her arms behind her back, before tying her up with cable ties and putting tape over her mouth.\nThe jury was told he laughed at her as she cried, told her she was a slut and that no-one would believe her if she said anything because he was a police officer.\nFollowing a trial at Croydon Crown Court, he was found guilty of 10 counts of rape, three counts of rape of a child under 13, one count of kidnap and a breach of a non-molestation order.\nHe received a life term, and must serve a minimum sentence of 13 years and 225 days for his crimes, which took place between 2014 and 2023.\nMitchell had previously been the subject of a rape investigation in 2017, which resulted in no further action, the Met Police has said.\nFollowing his arrest in 2023, that case was reinvestigated, which resulted in Mitchell being charged with an additional three counts of rape of a child under 13 and three counts of rape.\nSentencing Mitchell, Mrs Justice May said his crimes were so serious \"a sentence of life imprisonment is required\".\nShe said: \"Cliff Mitchell is clearly a deeply troubled young man... (his) serious offending appears to have arisen for desire for control.\n\"The fact he was a police officer, albeit for a short time, will make imprisonment a harsher experience for him.\"\nAt the sentencing hearing, one victim's statement addressing Mitchell read: \"You have shown no remorse for what you did to us.\n\"You deserve to spend the rest of your life in a cell because you are a serious danger to every woman walking the streets.\n\"You are the devil. You disgust me. I hope you suffer for the rest of your life.\"\nThe other victim, who said she lived in constant fear, said to Mitchell in court: \"I'm holding you to account for your actions; you took away my self-worth.\n\"You are a pathetic excuse of a man.\"\nThe court heard how the two women suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.\nMitchell was a PC in the Met's West Area Basic Command Unit and was serving in Hounslow when a number of the offences were committed, the Met Police has said.\nHe was suspended from the force after the later allegations came to light and was dismissed in December 2023.\nShadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the case raised questions as to how Mitchell was able to obtain a job in the Met, having previously been investigated for rape.\n\"The fact that the police did not know Mitchell had a non-molestation order out against him whilst he was a serving officer shows total system failure in tackling violence against women and girls,\" she said.\nShe called for \"wholesale changes to vetting procedures\".\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Cundy said: \"The fact (Mitchell) abused his power as an officer as part of his attempt to manipulate (the victims) is even more abhorrent.\n\"We understand the concerns around Mitchell being cleared to join the Met after an initial report of rape was made in 2017, and the questions this inevitably raises.\n\"Under our reformed vetting approach, Mitchell would not be granted vetting clearance and be able to join the Met.\n\"We continue to reform and invest in our vetting unit, which today is larger, better equipped and staffed by people who are showing greater professional curiosity, diligence and determination than ever before.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The family of a British worker who died on a gas rig are appealing his killer's \"woeful\" sentence.\nRobbie Robson died in 2022 after being beaten with a 10kg (22lb) iron weight by roommate Scott Forrest.\nForrest, who worked with Mr Robson on a rig off the coast of Qatar, was convicted of manslaughter by Qatari courts in December and sentenced to 10 years in jail.\nMr Robson's partner Kristie Graham, from Cleadon in Tyne and Wear, said the family's appeal was their \"only hope\" of ensuring true justice was served.\nThe family were initially told the 38-year-old's killer could face the death penalty if found guilty of murder, and were devastated to learn he had instead been sentenced for manslaughter.\nAn appeal against the sentence is currently under way, after a previous appeal was rejected in January.\nMr Robson's loved ones were told the second proceedings represented their final opportunity to appeal.\n\"Our lives have been devastated and the fact that the perpetrator has got away with such a light sentence makes it all the more unbearable,\" Ms Graham, mother of Mr Robson's two-year-old son, said.\n\"As a family we have had to read all the detailed reports into what happened that evening and it is something we would wish on no other family.\n\"We place great faith that the Qatari justice system will agree, following this final appeal, that the woeful sentence imposed needs to be reconsidered, not only to get true justice for Robbie, but to send a message to the world.\"\nMs Graham is calling for the initial charge of murder to be upheld. \n\"We were told to prepare for the death penalty to be handed down, so to receive the news of a 10-year sentence was incomprehensible,\" she said.\n\"A more severe punishment should be imposed to reflect the gravity of the crime and the loss our family endures.\"\nMr Robson was bludgeoned to death in December 2022 while working on the Seafox Burj for Film-Ocean, an Aberdeenshire-based underwater inspection company. \nForrest, who also attacked another co-worker, is said to have been suffering from stress and anxiety over cramped living conditions when he killed Mr Robson in their shared accommodation.\nThe 43-year-old, from Maud in Aberdeenshire, hit Mr Robson 20 times with a weight used in submarines, according to the victim's family, who are also pursuing a civil claim against Film-Ocean.\nThe loss has devastated the rigger's loved ones, who described him as a \"beautiful soul\".\n\"He was a loving partner, dad, son, brother and uncle whose life was taken too soon,\" Ms Graham said.\n\"Robbie was irreplaceable and he is sorely missed by everyone that knew him.\"\nA spokesman for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said it was supporting the family of a British man who died in Qatar.\nFilm-Ocean has been approached for comment.\nAdditional reporting by PA Media.\nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa will be the newest addition to famous waxwork museum Madame Tussauds.\nThe Edinburgh actor said it was \"amazing to witness\" the creation of his doppelganger, captured in character as the 15th Doctor, alongside a Whoniverse-themed set.\nGatwa worked with the attraction's studio team to get his body measurements, head mould, and eye colours correct for his likeness.\nThe popular sci-fi series will return to screens in May, with the new waxwork to be put on display from July, after the final episode of the new series airs.\nRwandan-Scottish actor Gatwa, 31, said: \"I'm very excited to be joining the iconic lineup at Madame Tussauds London. \n\"The process was amazing to witness, I can't wait to see the final result.\"\nOther incarnations of the time-travelling alien including the fourth Time Lord, played by Tom Baker, and Jodie Whittaker's 13th Doctor, have also been turned into wax for the London attraction.\nIronically,  the Doctor's recurring enemies on the programme include the Autons - plastic dummies who used the waxwork museum as a base of operations in one story. \nThe new waxwork is the first to be announced for the museum's new film and TV-themed zone, which will feature on-screen characters including James Bond and ET.\nSteve Blackburn,  general manager at Madame Tussauds London, said the museum was \"beyond thrilled\" to have secured Gatwa. \nJeff Parker, creative producer, BBC Studios, added: \"It feels fitting that the longest-running sci-fi show in the world should have a place at one of London's oldest and most iconic visitor attractions where we can be sure to give our global fanbase a chance to get up close to the Doctor.\"\nGatwa was born in Rwanda where he lived with his parents until 1994 when the family moved to Scotland due to the civil war in his homeland.\nThe Sex Education star first appeared on screen as the Time Lord during the last instalment of three 60th anniversary episodes which saw David Tennant return to play the 14th Doctor.\nGatwa's Doctor then met his companion Ruby Sunday, played by Millie Gibson, during Christmas Day special The Church On Ruby Road. \nThe new series will launch with a double bill on Saturday 11 May.",
    "US secretary of state Antony Blinken has told Israel and Hamas that \"the time is now\" for a deal to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza and free the remaining hostages held there.\nMr Blinken said a deal was on the table and Hamas should agree to it.\nMediators are awaiting a response from Hamas to the latest proposal. \nIt reportedly involves a 40-day ceasefire and the release of more than 30 Israeli hostages in exchange for many more Palestinian prisoners.\n\"We are determined to get a ceasefire that brings the hostages home and to get it now, and the only reason that that wouldn't be achieved is because of Hamas,\" Mr Blinken said as he met Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv.\n\"There is a proposal on the table, and as we've said, no delays, no excuses. The time is now.\"\nA senior Hamas official has denied the group is to blame for delays on reaching a new deal.\nFamilies of the hostages were demonstrating outside and Mr Blinken greeted them, saying setting their loved ones free was \"at the heart of everything we're trying to do\".\nAbout 130 hostages from among 253 kidnapped by Hamas during its unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October remain unaccounted for. At least 34 of them are presumed dead. The rest have been released or rescued.\nThe top US diplomat later visited the Israeli port of Ashdod, about 30km (20 miles) north of Gaza, where he insisted that Israel had made meaningful concessions to reach a hostage and ceasefire deal.\nMr Blinken said Israel had made progress on getting more aid into Gaza but this needed to be accelerated given the immense scale of need.\nAshdod was recently opened to aid shipments destined for Gaza, where the UN has warned of severe food shortages and looming famine.\nOn Wednesday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said 30 trucks of humanitarian supplies from Jordan had for the first time entered northern Gaza via the Erez crossing.\nMr Blinken also repeated the US position that Israel should not launch a military incursion into the overcrowded southern city of Rafah without a clear plan to protect more than a million Palestinians who have been sheltering from the war there in dire humanitarian conditions. \n\"On Rafah itself - our position is clear, it has not changed, it won't change. We cannot, will not support a major military operation in Rafah absent an effective plan making sure that civilians are not harmed. We have not seen such a plan,\" he said.\nRafah is the only major city in Gaza that IDF ground forces have not taken control of during half a year of war. However the city has been repeatedly hit by deadly Israeli air strikes.\nOn Tuesday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - who also met Mr Blinken on Wednesday - said Israel would launch an invasion of Rafah regardless of truce talks with Hamas.\n\"We will enter Rafah and we will eliminate the Hamas battalions there with or without a deal, in order to achieve the total victory,\" he said.\nMembers of Mr Netanyahu's governing coalition are divided on the issue. Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Israeli TV a Rafah operation would be suspended if there was a deal. But far-right ministers have said if that happens they will bring down the government.\nThe UN, Western allies of Israel and humanitarian agencies have all warned that an assault on Rafah risks a humanitarian disaster.\nWest Bank-based Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said it would be the \"biggest catastrophe in the Palestinian people's history\" because, he said, it would trigger large-scale displacement of Palestinians out of Gaza entirely.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 253 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 34,500 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",
    "Kenyans living in areas at risk of flooding or landslides will be asked to evacuate on Wednesday, the country's president has said.\nWilliam Ruto was speaking in Mai Mahiu, north of Nairobi, where an overflowing reservoir has wiped out a swathe of houses and swept dozens of people to their death.\nThis is \"not a time for guesswork\" he said, noting the forecast for more heavy rain. \n\"The likelihood of flooding and people losing [their] lives is real\", he added.\nAlthough no definitive number was given, an evacuation order of this scale is likely to target many thousands of people. \nThe government has told people it will help resettle them in approved areas and warned those who refuse to leave could be removed by force.\nHowever, ministers have not yet released any detail on the evacuation plans, and it is unclear how many might have to move, and in what form they will be notified.\nA government spokesman told local media there were 52 centres, including social halls, set aside to host the affected people, and more could be added if needed.\nThe weather agency has said heavy rains will continue until Monday in many regions of the country.\nThe rainy season has been extra punishing this year, and weeks of flooding have killed at least 170 people.\nBut the disaster at Mai Mahiu has been the most catastrophic so far.\nThe reality is still sinking in for those who had hoped their missing loved ones had survived.\n\"My brother was in his 70s when he died after being washed away,\" 62-year-old Nancy Wanjiku told the BBC. \nShe spoke to us sitting on the wreckage of what was once her parents' home.\n\"My mum and dad are safe but we have lost everything,\" she added.\nElsewhere, we saw a woman on the side of the road bent over double crying, losing herself in the news that the body of her child had been found.\nRescue workers continued the search for more of the dead. \nWe followed them down along the blasted banks of the Ngeya River - mostly members of the National Youth Services in bright yellow vests carrying shovels, rakes and sticks to poke through the branches of uprooted trees.\nSome stopped at an enormous heap of broken branches that covered a crushed house. A family of six had lived there and the workers suspected they might be buried under the mound.\nThey called in a bulldozer to clear out the debris, but it did not find evidence of a watery death.\nNot far from here we met Stephen Kamau, 31, helping a neighbour to sift through what is left of their home.\n\"I'm trying to salvage things that were carried away by water and look for missing people as well,\" he explained.\n\"I woke up in a different world. Everything had been swept by water.... We are in fear. My heart is heavy.\"\nFurther downstream, a rescue team found the body of a woman tucked away in logs at the top of a bridge. Onlookers recognised her as someone who had worked at a local 24-hour car wash.\nAnother woman, who did not identify herself, trekked to the site to see if her three missing sisters had washed up there. \nHer brother had searched for them in a nearby hospital, but came back empty-handed, she said. \nShe had stayed awake all night, worried that another tide of water would crash down on her while she was sleeping.\nThe terror of that flash-flood on Sunday night - triggered when water built up in a gully because a tunnel was blocked - is still vivid.\nDavid Karanja has just returned from the morgue to view the body of his 9-year-old son Paul.\nHe stands with his eyes downcast and his arm in a sling, next to corrugated-iron roof panels lurching over the shell of his still-standing home, while he and his 17-year-old daughter Veronica told their story.\nLike others that lived in the river valley, they were awakened by the roar of water at 03:00 local time (00:00 GMT) on Monday.\nThey rushed to switch off the power to avoid electric shock, but when David opened the door, Veronica was swept away. She says she clung to a tree branch until the water subsided.\nWhen she made it back to the house, she couldn't find her father right away - until she heard people calling her name.\n\"He was hit by a stone,\" she told the BBC. \"When he was trying to rescue my brother, a stone from the upper side of the wall hit his hand, and he let [Paul] go, and that's why [Paul] drowned.\"\nThe family lived off their livestock - all gone now. Their 900 hens perished. And of 21 pigs, only five are left. \"We have totally nothing right now,\" Veronica said.\nThey are appealing for help, and President Ruto promised government support when he stopped at a local school sheltering survivors.\nThose gathered were told they would get help rebuilding their houses, but not next to the river if experts deemed it possible they could once again be in the pathway of such destruction.\nMr Ruto said the authorities had mapped all fragile places in the country prone to floods and landslides, and that the army had been mobilised to help the evacuations.\nHe did not say where they would go, nor exactly from where the resourc",
    "Arizona's Senate has voted to repeal a 1864 law banning abortion, the last major push in the Democrat-led effort to erase the law from state books. \nTwo Republicans joined Senate Democrats to support the repeal bill, which narrowly passed the House last week. \nGovernor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, hailed the result and is due to formalise the removal of the law.\nThe pre-statehood law bars abortion from the moment of conception, with no exceptions for rape or incest. \nIt was revived last month after Arizona's top court ruled the ban could be enforced following the US Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v Wade in June 2022, a landmark ruling which rescinded the nationwide right to abortion. \nThe decision unleashed an uproar across the country, where voters broadly support abortion access and galvanised efforts to put an abortion question on the ballot in November, which would expand rights in the state. \nAnd for Republicans staring down autumn elections, the ban posed a major political dilemma, with legislators caught between the party's conservative base and more moderate swing voters who decried the Civil War-era bill as draconian.\nSome leading Republicans including former President Donald Trump and former Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, distanced themselves from the law, suggesting it was out of step with the state's voters. \nThe repeal bill was passed 16-14 on Wednesday after two Republicans, Shawnna Bolick and TJ Shope broke ranks with their party, voting yes on the one-line repeal bill. \nBoth were criticised by their colleagues, who described their votes as a betrayal of \"pro-life\" values. \n\"The epitome of delusion is saying I am pro-life yet voting to repeal an abortion ban,\" said Senator Anthony Kern, who called the 1864 law \"the best abortion ban in the nation\". \nVoting to repeal is \"voting for death\", he said. Mr Kern was one of the fake electors indicted last week for his role in an alleged scheme to overturn the 2020 election in favour of Donald Trump. \nExplaining her vote, Ms Bolick recounted her experience receiving an abortion during an unviable pregnancy - an option, she said, that may have been unavailable under the 1864 law, which includes exceptions for the life of the mother.  \nThe abortion \"was very tough\", she said. \"Would Arizona's pre-Roe law have allowed me to have this medical procedure, even though at the time my life wasn't in danger?\" \nNational anti-abortion activists, too, condemned the two politicians, criticising what they described as political cynicism. \n\"This blueprint of irresponsibility and cowardice will be emulated across the nation by other opportunistic Republicans who gladly wear the pro-life cape for donor dollars but stab the movement in the back when it's time to act,\" said Chanel Prunier, vice-president of political affairs for anti-abortion group Students for Life Action. \nIf the repeal is signed by Governor Hobbs, abortions in Arizona will be governed by 2022 law, which prohibits abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy with exceptions only in cases of medical emergency. There are no exceptions for rape or incest. \nHowever, that could change in November when Arizonans are expected to vote on a ballot question that would protect abortion access until 24 weeks of pregnancy. \nSimilar ballot initiatives in Republican-controlled states since Roe was overturned have all delivered wins for the pro-choice movement.

    "The wife of a man who drowned attempting to help his family escape their home during Storm Babet has told an inquest she believes he went back into flood water to rescue their dog.\nCompany director Trevor Furniss's body was found in the Mad Brook near the Shropshire-Worcestershire border on 20 October last year. The inquest ruled his death was an accident.\nHis wife Deborah told the inquest that they and their nine-year-old son had tried to leave their house at Furnace Mill, near Cleobury Mortimer, as flood water rose.\nAfter failing to get away by car, Mr Furniss then carried them back to their house before setting out again and being seen by neighbours getting into difficulty in the water.\nMrs Furniss said there had been torrential rain on the day and her husband had attempted to take their son to primary school, but came back home after finding it shut.\nShe said her husband then told her they all needed to leave their home because of the flooding.\nThey planned to leave with their dog for Droitwich, where they had family, and set off in two cars.\nBut they had to return to the house where Mrs Furniss said \u201cthe water was so high it was coming through the ground floor windows\".\nMrs Furniss said she did not ask where her husband was going as he set off on foot again, but presumed he was going to take one of the cars to get the family dog.\nKatie Arnold, who runs a nearby livery yard, told the inquest she \u201csaw a man in the flood, walking upstream against the current, in water up to his waist\".\nShe called 999, as she saw the water rise up to his chest and he struggled against the current.\nMs Arnold said she also phoned neighbour Ed Brown who told her it was Mr Furniss \u201clooking for his dog\u201d.\nMs Arnold then saw him \u201cgo under for a second or two\u201d. She said she believed his coat had got caught on something and he had been trying to take it off.\nShe explained she then saw him \u201cholding on to a branch and was asking us to get help\" before he \u201cwent under and didn\u2019t get back up\u201d.\nMr Brown said he saw Mr Furniss multiple times as he attempted to get back to his 4x4, despite Mr Brown warning him of the dangers.\nIn delivering his ruling, deputy coroner Heath Westerman said: \"Mr Furniss was determined he wanted to cross Baveney Brook to get his car or to get his dog.\"\n\"He chose to walk back to the vehicle to stay with the dog or to drive somewhere else. \n\"He knew the risks and he decided to take these risks,\" he added.\n\"His death was not preventable.\"\nThe dog, a German shepherd, was later found alive and well in the back of the Land Rover.\nA search was carried out and 90 minutes later Mr Furniss was found just 20 metres from where he was last seen and confirmed dead by paramedics.\nMrs Furniss said when she saw blue flashing lights and fire officers running down her drive, she \u201cknew it was bad news\u201d.\nShe described her husband, who ran a medical business, as very caring and someone who always put his family first.\nShe also suggested a damaged bridge in Kinlet Road had caused more water to back up on their drive, forcing the family to attempt an escape.\nBut Worcestershire County Council, which is responsible for the maintenance of the bridge, told the inquest it \u201cwouldn\u2019t agree that the bridge made the flooding worse\u201d.\nIn a statement following the inquest, the council said: \"The concerns raised regarding debris in the water course were dealt with promptly by our highways team and the debris was removed before Storm Babet hit the county and caused the flooding.\n\"The repairs to the bridge were carried out by the County Council as soon as was practical to do so and the coroner confirmed during the inquest that the bridge was not a factor in this tragic accident.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Fans have reacted with shock and confusion as Manchester's troubled new Co-op Live arena called off its opening concert at the last minute.\nThousands were queueing to see rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie at the \u00a3365m venue when his show was cancelled.\nOne fan told the BBC it was \"very unprofessional\", while another criticised the \"bad organisation\".\nThe arena has had a series of problems, and later said Olivia Rodrigo's shows this weekend would also not go ahead.\nSome fans outside the venue were handed a sheet of paper saying A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie's gig had been cancelled for \"technical reasons\".\nYasin, 20, told BBC Newsbeat he paid \u00a325 for parking and arrived at the venue to be handed one of the pieces of paper.\nHe said: \"I'm thinking, is this real? Why isn't it online? It was very unprofessional, I couldn't believe it almost, like is this the way we're finding out that it's been cancelled?\"\nYasin said he had been looking forward to attending the show and had been listening to the rapper's music \"on repeat\" for two weeks.\n\"It makes me question future events, if they're going to be planned properly or if it's going to be organised enough\", he added.\nThe venue later put the cancellation down to a part of the heating and ventilation system coming loose during the soundcheck before Wednesday's show. \nFan Katie Barnsley, who travelled up from Kent for the gig, found out it had been cancelled just as she was about to get a tram from Manchester city centre to the arena in the Etihad Campus.\nThe 28-year-old insurance broker had travelled up from near Dover with her partner and his sister, and estimated they had spent around \u00a3600 on tickets, accommodation and petrol.\nShe said: \"We were going on the tram and were asking the attendant how we got to the campus and he said, 'Don't bother, it's been cancelled'. \n\"Then I went on Twitter and saw the tweet from the arena.\" \nMs Barnsley said she had been apprehensive about travelling to Manchester because of the cancellation of earlier gigs at the venue but had been reassured by recent tweets from Co-op Live saying other shows would be going ahead.\nComedian Peter Kay had been due to open the venue last week but his shows have now been postponed twice, while a concert by US rock band The Black Keys has also already been scrapped.\nSome fans found out about Wednesday's cancellation on social media. The venue posted at 18:40 that the show would no longer go ahead - which was 10 minutes after doors had been due to open.\nOthers heard when the news spread by word of mouth outside.\n\"We found out from other members of the public telling us, to save us from queuing up - not that there were any actual management telling us,\" said Radhika, 17, from Manchester.\n\"I just think personally it's bad management, bad organisation.\"\nZack, also 17, had come from Blackpool for the show. \"I'm on crutches and we queued up for about two hours, wasting our time,\" he said. \n\"They came out with these sheets of paper saying 'we're sorry about this', but we'd found out already from people shouting, people running around shouting that it's cancelled before they [the staff] even came out themselves.\"\nTeoni Kirkham, 21, said: \"We literally hopped out of our Uber and just saw everybody turning around and walking the opposite way. We found out literally when we got here.\n\"It's just messy, really. It seems like there's no organisation. With Ticketmaster on my phone, I thought, surely if it's been cancelled I would have got notification. They've not done a good job I don't think.\"\n\"We knew that the other ones had been cancelled last week,\" added Lucas Sheriff, who had travelled from Sheffield. \"So we were a bit unsure whether this was going to get cancelled.\" The eventual announcement was \"very last minute\", he said.\n\"If we'd found out at least in the afternoon, we would have been a bit less disappointed.\"\nJamie Cornwall, 21, had come from Lincoln, and also found out on the way to the venue. \"I got sent away by the security and told to go back home,\" he said.\n\"Technical issues? You'd think they would have solved that. I know a few events have already been cancelled. So it's not great. You see all these sad faces everywhere.\"\nA Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, real name Julius Dubose, wrote on social media: \"Something happened with the venue while I was at soundcheck today that caused cancellation of the show.\n\"We are working on rescheduling in the next few days.\n\"I'm heated about the situation too, but safety first Manchester, I got you, just stay tuned for further info.\"\nA spokesman for the venue said: \"We appreciate the inconvenience this will cause for many, and are deeply sorry for all those impacted.\"",
    "Wednesday marks a significant moment for the UK government's Legacy Act - with an end to historical inquests and the transferring of Troubles-era cases to a new body.\nThe controversial act has been opposed by victims' groups and all the main political parties in Northern Ireland - while the UK government maintains the law is human rights compliant and draws a line under the past.\nThe act was passed by Parliament in September despite opposition from Labour, all Northern Ireland parties, several victims' groups and the Irish government. \nIt created a new legacy body known as the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) to take over all Troubles-era cases from May 1, including those on the desk of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). \nThe act shuts down all historical inquests from 1 May and has already prevented new civil cases from being lodged in court. \nThe act's most controversial element, the offer of conditional immunity to suspects, has been disapplied following legal action by bereaved families. \nThe court ruled this part of the act was incompatible with human rights' legislation and the Windsor Framework. \nThe UK government has lodged an appeal which is due to be heard in June.\nThe ICRIR is headed by Sir Declan Morgan, a former lord chief justice of Northern Ireland. \nFrom 1 May, and for a period of five years, it will accept requests for investigations into UK-wide incidents in which people were killed or seriously injured between 1 January 1966 and 10 April 1998. \nThese can be lodged by bereaved families or victims themselves. Cases can also be referred to it by the Northern Ireland attorney general and the Northern Ireland secretary, among others. \nIn consultation with those who come forward, the ICRIR, which has police powers, will decide on the type of investigation to be carried out. \nIn theory there still can be, perhaps more so now that the immunity clause has been struck from the act. \nThis removed the possibility of suspects applying for immunity from the ICRIR in return for information to be provided to victims' families. \nHowever, based on recent precedent, the number of prosecutions is unlikely to be significant, given a good many suspects and witnesses have died since the events of 30 to 50 years ago. \nThe Public Prosecution Service considered 53 legacy cases presented to it following Police Service of Northern Ireland investigations between 2012 and the start of April 2024 and it brought charges in about half of them. \nOnly a small minority led to convictions. The expectation of bereaved families and victims is not high. \nProsecutions which began before 1 May , such as Soldier F in relation to Bloody Sunday, will continue to a conclusion.\nThe most dramatic impact of the act is the halting of all Troubles-related inquests. \nThis applies to inquests which have not opened, or which have not reached the findings stage. \nBefore the act was conceived, there was a five-year programme of Troubles-era inquests, but this was disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. \nMany cases also faced delays over the provision of evidence by the Ministry of Defence, and others, and then applications by the Northern Ireland secretary to have intelligence information withheld on the grounds of national security. \nMany of the inquests which have fallen involve multiple killings, including the shooting dead of eight IRA men by the Army at Loughgall in County Armagh in 1987. \nUnder the act, inquests which have not been dealt with can transfer to the ICRIR. \nThey will become what's known as Enhanced Inquisitorial Proceedings (EIP), with findings produced by Sir Declan Morgan. \nMany families, who question whether EIPs will be a like-for-like replacement, hope that should Labour win the next election, inquests will be reinstated under its pledge to repeal the act.\nIt has no idea what its workload will be - there were more than 3,500 Troubles-era killings (about 1,000 remain unsolved) and up to 40,000 people were injured. \nOn 1 May, the ICRIR will open phone lines and begin receiving emails from people who want it to look at their cases. Face-to-face meetings will then be arranged. \nThe ICRIR has offices in Belfast and London and may recruit up to 300 staff in coming months.\nIt could end up being operational until 2030 or beyond and cost in the region of \u00a3250m, but this is entirely dependent on numbers coming forward and the type of investigation agreed in each case. \nThe ICRIR has said case numbers are impossible to predict at this stage.",
    "A regulator has frozen the bank accounts of a charity that provides aid for refugees over undisclosed \"substantial payments\".\nThe Charity Commission said it has concerns over trustees at We Care Foundation making payments from the charity to companies for which they are directors.\nThe commission added that \"substantial payments\" were not disclosed in the charity's accounts, and were not \"adequately explained\".\nWe Care Foundation, which was founded in Bristol and is now located in Coventry, said it is \"fully committed to resolving matters swiftly\".\nThe commission said it has concerns over \"significant decisions\" about the charity's finances and management during a period when there were only two trustees, who were married at the time.\nThe regulator announced the inquiry on Wednesday into the charity, which also provides financial and other aid to victims of war or natural disaster overseas, after it opened in January.\nThe opening of the inquiry is not a finding of wrongdoing, the commission said, adding that it has not made any conclusions.\nA spokesperson for We Care Foundation said: \"We have provided substantial evidence to support the investigation, demonstrating our commitment.\n\"We are fully cooperating with the commission and are dedicated to resolving this matter as quickly as possible. \n\"We Care remains committed to transparency and accountability in all its operations and looks forward to a swift resolution of the inquiry with the commission's support.\"\nThe inquiry will look into whether the trustees are complying with the law, whether they provided true and accurate information to the regulator at all time and it will examine if any failings or weaknesses were a result of misconduct or mismanagement by the trustees.\nThe commission began engaging with the charity in June 2022, and its bank accounts were frozen in March 2024.\nWe Care Foundation operates with councils across the country including Bristol and Bath and North East Somerset.\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A group of award-winning students have created their own interactive app to help children avoid being exploited.\nThe Gang Awareness app has been put together at Northampton School for Girls and has the full backing of Northamptonshire Police.\nIt is designed to equip youngsters with the ability to make the right decisions in difficult situations.\nAbout 46,000 children across the UK are thought to be involved in gangs.\nThe students won a County Schools Challenge with their idea and developed the storylines during PHSE (personal, social, health and economic) lessons.\nElla, one of the team of seven that put the storyline feature together, said: \"We had a lot of input on how it was going to be.\n\"When you play it, you start by making a character and you can change its clothes and things like that to make it more suitable to you.\"\nThe app then follows the character through a storyline about \"kids in secondary school making a decision\" - whether it is good or bad - and the consequences of it.\nDet Insp Andy Blaize, lead on child safeguarding at Northamptonshire Police, said: \"I've seen child exploitation increase over the years. The situation's probably never been as bad as it is now.\n\"I think it's really important that children get involved in creating this app, otherwise the message is often coming from adults and it can be a bit patronising, a bit preachy.\"\nHeadteacher Cristina Taboada-Naya said the app was important because her staff could not keep an eye on the children when they were not in school.\n\"Whilst they're here, they're safe and we know how to keep them safe, we can give them constant reminders and prompts,\" she said. \n\"In the electronic age, it is outside of that time that we are less able to protect them - so we have to arm them with the knowledge and tools and resources to keep themselves safe and the app allows them to do that.\"\nFollow Northamptonshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The BBC has been told Birmingham Airport needs at least 100 more security agents as delays for passengers enter a third day. \nTravellers hoping to get away ahead of the long weekend have been stuck in queues and missed flights. \nMultiple holidaymakers said they had spent hours waiting for a lift to the airport's security area. \nThe airport said it had an active year-round recruitment campaign for security officers and recent problems were down to a technical issue. \nA source told the BBC that the number of vacant positions meant security staff felt overstretched, making it harder to recruit and retain staff.\nIt comes as the airport has been undergoing improvements for more than a year, with multi million-pound upgrades to its security hall nearing completion. \nBut it has meant delays for passengers at busy periods, and issues began again ahead of the May bank holiday. \nThe airport said it could not confirm how many people had been unable to board flights in the past 72 hours, directing questions to individual airlines. \nLisa Ruston, who was flying from Birmingham Airport to Cape Verde on Wednesday, said staff were helpful but it took her almost two hours to even get to security. \n\"Only three of the lifts are working and one is used for fast track,\" she said. \n\"They definitely need more staff around to help people, it's all very confusing.\"\nRoger Burton, who missed his flight from Birmingham to Alicante on Monday, previously said he spent about \u00a3165 on a new flight and would also have to cover taxi costs to the airport again.\n\u201cIt was absolutely disgusting the way we were treated,\u201d Mr Burton said. \nHe added passengers were \"herded like cattle\u201d through the airport and described a  \u201ccrush of people\u201d waiting for elevators. \nBirmingham Airport said on Monday that a technical problem had compounded its peak departure period. \nIn a statement, a spokesperson said: \"We realise that the building works are extensive and have impacted the terminal, and at times our customer service level, and for this we apologise.\" \nBosses directed people to the airport's website for the latest information and advice on speeding up search times. \nWhen asked about staffing, a spokesperson added: \"Birmingham Airport has an active year-round recruitment campaign for its security officers.  \n\"Both classroom and on the job training takes months to complete, hence our continual recruitment.\u201d \nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X, and Instagram, Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk",
    "Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia announced on Wednesday that she will force a vote to remove Mike Johnson as speaker of the House.\nThe conservative firebrand filed the motion last month but held off on formally introducing it, which would require a vote on Mr Johnson's fate within two legislative days.\nAt the time, she described her action as a warning to the Republican leader. \nNow she has followed through on that threat.\nSpeaker Johnson put out a statement that her motion \"is wrong for the Republican conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country\".\nMr Johnson's support for a $61bn military aid package to Ukraine, approved by the House on 20 April, is partially responsible for Ms Greene forcing the vote.\n\"Mike Johnson is not capable of that job,\" Ms Greene said on Wednesday. \"He has proven it over and over again.\"\nOn Tuesday, Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives pledged to support Mr Johnson if his leadership was threatened - a show of gratitude for the speaker's co-operation on Ukraine aid, which was a priority for Democrats and President Joe Biden.\nMs Greene called the Democratic pledge \"a warm hug and a big wet sloppy kiss\" for the speaker.\nRepublican leaders, including former president Donald Trump, had reportedly pressured the Georgia congresswoman to back down from attempting to remove Mr Johnson, concerned that a Republican power struggle would harm the party's prospects in November's general election.\nLast October, Democrats voted with a handful of Republicans to remove Speaker Kevin McCarthy, setting off three weeks of Republican discord as several top candidates failed to win the near-unanimous party support needed to secure the gavel.\nMr Johnson ultimately prevailed -  in part because he was relatively unknown and had few connections to party leadership. But some Republicans, including Ms Greene, soured on him after he worked with Democrats to pass government funding legislation earlier this year.\n\"I voted for Mike Johnson because his voting record before he became speaker was conservative,\" Ms Greene said on Wednesday. \"Once he became speaker, he has become a man that none of us recognise.\"\nTwo other Republicans in the House have said they will back Ms Greene's effort, which would be enough in the narrowly divided chamber to remove the speaker with Democratic help. Instead, the Democrats have said they will vote with pro-Johnson Republicans to \"table\" the motion, effectively killing.\nMs Greene said she will introduce her motion to remove Mr Johnson next week.

    "Gordon Brown has called for police to investigate whether the publisher of the Sun and News of the World covered up phone hacking evidence.\nThe former prime minister told the BBC that civil court documents show News UK deleted emails to stop police seeing them.\nHe also believes his phone may have been hacked while in No 10 and could now take legal action.\nNews UK said Mr Brown's allegations were \"unfounded and wrong\". \nIn 2015, prosecutors said there was no evidence of corporate wrongdoing.\nHowever, Mr Brown said that decision was based on an \"incomplete picture\" of the case against News UK, previously known as News Group Newspapers.\nHe said: \"What we have is new evidence. What we now know was not available at the time, perhaps not even available to the police.\n\"What is coming out is the extent of the interference in people's civil liberties, the extent to which the organisation tried to cover up.\" \nHe said he was speaking out on behalf of \"ordinary families\" targeted by newspapers \"at the moment of greatest difficulty for them - grief, tragedy, accidents, murders\".\nVictims of phone hacking include the murdered teenager Milly Dowler and families bereaved by the 7 July 2005 terror attacks in London.\nMr Brown continued: \"The intrusion into their private lives at the time of grief was so extensive, whether it be by phone hacking, or by using private investigators or by investigating their family life and the relatives of people around them.\"\nThe police investigation into the company was brought to a halt in 2015 after the convictions of senior journalists including Andy Coulson, a former editor of the News of the World.\nThe company had accepted journalists at the tabloid were involved in wrong-doing and closed it down in 2011.\nIt has paid damages to hundreds of News of the World phone hacking victims, and has also settled cases brought by those targeted by the Sun, without admitting any liability.\nMore than 40 people are currently suing News UK for hacking their phones or unlawfully obtaining their private information.\nThe complex case is likely to go to trial next year but evidence is already being disclosed to the claimants' lawyers.\nA key question in the trial is likely to be why the company deleted more than 30 million emails in 2010 and 2011, when it knew it faced a police investigation over phone hacking.\nNine million emails, detailing important periods during the phone hacking saga, were \"irretrievably lost\", according to court documents.\nThe reasons for the email deletion policy are at the centre of claims the firm was involved in a corporate cover-up which went beyond the wrong-doing of individual reporters and private investigators.\nNews UK has always insisted it was clearing out old computer servers, but claimants say it was deleting evidence at the time the police investigation was expanding. \nThey have accused the company in court filings of inventing a false \"security threat\" to provide another reason why emails needed to be deleted.\nCourt documents filed by the claimants suggest senior figures at the News UK believed an insider sympathetic to the Labour Party had leaked emails belonging to chief executive Rebekah Brooks.\nThey believed these had been passed to a third party, who had then met and discussed them with Gordon Brown.\nThe court documents suggest the company decided to delete Mrs Brooks's emails to prevent further leaks.\nOn Wednesday, Mr Brown discussed this claim for the first time, describing it as an \"an attempt to blame someone else... when, of course, they themselves were guilty of destroying evidence\".\nHe denied ever being passed information relating to Mrs Brooks, adding: \"The police should never have accepted their explanation.\"\nMr Brown has never taken legal action against News UK but revealed he is now considering it.\nHe said it was possible that his phone was hacked between 2005 and 2007 when he was chancellor, and for the three years he was prime minister, before losing the 2010 election.\nMr Brown said he had a personal mobile phone at the time, and believes his voicemail messages may have been accessed.\nHe continued: \"If a prime minister was having his phone hacked by News Group, then that is a very serious matter.\n\"And we need to get all the evidence about what happened, what didn't happen, what was happening at their headquarters.\n\"I think that is all still to come out. And that's why although time has passed, we must not allow this to happen again because of a failure to investigate what happened in the past.\"\nIn response, News UK said Mr Brown's allegations related to events from over a decade ago which are the subject of current legal proceedings in the civil courts. \nA spokesperson added: \"There is absolutely no evidence to support the assertion that Mr Brown's voicemails were intercepted and this is denied.\" \nThe company has also denied in court documents it deleted millions of emails because they were \"potentially incriminating\", pointing out that many had been back",
    "The number of BBC World Service journalists working in exile is estimated to have nearly doubled, to 310, since 2020.\nThe figures, released for the first time ahead of World Press Freedom Day, reflect press crackdowns in Russia, Afghanistan, and Ethiopia.\nJournalists from other countries, including Iran, have lived abroad for more than a decade. \nMany face jail sentences, death threats and harassment, both on and offline. \n\"The only way they can carry on reporting is to be forced out of their homes,\" says the director of the BBC World Service, Liliane Landor. \"The increase we're seeing in the numbers of journalists in exile is extremely concerning for press freedom.\"\nWhen the Taliban took control in Afghanistan in August 2021, the BBC pulled most of its team out of the country. Female staff were no longer allowed to work, while their male colleagues also faced threats.\nIn 2022, after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia introduced a new censorship law, meaning anyone criticising the war could be prosecuted. \"I'm calling a war, a war, and for that I could be easily jailed,\" says Nina Nazarova, a correspondent for BBC Russian, which has moved its Moscow team to Latvia. \nIn April this year, Nina's colleague, BBC Russian correspondent Ilya Barabanov, was labelled a \"foreign agent\", accused of \"spreading false information\" and opposing the war. He and the BBC reject this and are disputing it in court. \nJournalists in Myanmar and Ethiopia have also seen increased pressure, which has left them unable to report freely.\nJodie Ginsberg, from the Committee to Protect Journalists, says the number of exiled journalists it offers financial and legal support to has increased by 225% in the past three years.\n\"We've got near record number of journalists in jail, the killing of journalists has reached a high not seen since 2015,\" she adds. \nRegimes - such as Russia, Iran and Saud Arabia - are becoming increasingly desperate to control the narrative inside and outside their countries, she says.\n\"I watch my back,\" says BBC Persian correspondent Jiyar Gol. When he enters a room now, he says he looks for an escape route. \"I have a lot of security cameras in my house. I was warned it would be smart to change my daughter's school.\"\nJiyar hasn't been to Iran since 2007. When his mother died he couldn't go to her funeral. He has managed to cross the border to visit her grave.\nBut since his wife died of cancer four years ago, he has become more cautious. \"If something happened to me, what will happen to my daughter? That's something that's really in the back of my mind all the time,\" he says.\n\"The Iranian regime has grown bolder,\" he adds. \"They are under strict sanctions, they don't care about what the international community thinks about them because they are isolated.\"\nIn March, a presenter for the independent broadcaster Iran International was stabbed in the leg outside his London home, and recently British counter-terrorism police warned of an increased threat to BBC Persian staff living in the UK. \nTen BBC Persian staff recently learned they had been sentenced to a year in prison in their absence. They found out after hackers leaked information from the Iranian judiciary.\nPreviously, the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has accused BBC Persian staff of inciting violence, hate speech and human rights abuses.\nOne World Service journalist in Africa, who spoke anonymously for fear of aggravating leaders in his home country, says his biggest fear is becoming stateless if his government refuses to renew his passport.\nFor Shazia Haya, from BBC Pashto, life in exile is laced with guilt. She was evacuated to the UK alone in 2022 when the Taliban took control in Afghanistan, leaving her parents and brother in Kabul. \n\"The night I left home, at around 02:00, I don't know why but I couldn't hug my younger brother. And I'm regretting that,\" she says. \"I'm free here, but they're in a kind of prison.\"",
    "A law that has now shut down some Troubles-era inquests is a setback to reconciliation, a victim's son has said.\nThe legacy bill ends 38 inquests which had not reached their final stages by 1 May.\nIt also introduces a new legacy body to take over all Troubles cases spanning the 30-year conflict.\nThe law has been opposed by all Northern Ireland politicians at Stormont and Westminster.\nIt was also rejected by Troubles victims' groups, with some relatives holding a protest at the Northern Ireland Office headquarters in Belfast on Wednesday.\nHowever, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris welcomed the implementation of the bill.\nHe said the new Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) would deliver \"robust and effective mechanisms for addressing the legacy of the past\".\nSean Slane, whose father Gerard, 27, was shot dead by loyalists in 1988, said he had been put through \"turmoil\" year-after-year.\nHe said his family had hoped an inquest could help as they \"need closure\" on what happened.\nThe ICRIR, headed up by former Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, has the power to run replacement inquests.\nIt will also investigate any Troubles-related incidents in the UK where people were killed or seriously injured.\nBut its main task will be to provide new information to relatives and survivors.\nThe Lady Chief Justice's Office said 14 of the inquests affected by the 1 May deadline had not reached a findings stage, while 24 others had not been assigned a coroner to begin.\nSome of the inquests cover multiple killings.\nGerard Slane's murder by the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) in west Belfast involved an Army agent, Brian Nelson.\nA new inquest was ordered in 2011, but it was hit by multiple delays, including over the disclosure of security force documents.\n\"It was just delaying tactics the whole way through,\" his son said.\nSean Slane added: \"Personally, the only way there is going to be true peace and reconciliation is for the truth to come out across the board.\"\nRather than go to the ICRIR, he said he would campaign for an inquest, noting Labour had pledged to repeal the law if it won the next general election.\nSpeaking on Good Morning Ulster on Wednesday, Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn said for many bereaved families the May deadline felt like a door being slammed shut in their face.\nHe said that Labour would remove immunity from the act \"because it's already been struck down by the High Court in Belfast, though the issue is being appealed\".\nMr Benn said his party would also restore civil cases and inquests.\nSpeaking about the ICRIR, he said: \"I would not scrap it, I will see how it goes. In the end the test for this is will it work for families.\n\"In the end if families find that ICRIR works for them - and there are some reforms that we could make to boost confidence in it - then that will put us in a much, much better place than where we are at the moment.\"\nRev David Clements' father Billy was a reserve police officer who was murdered by the IRA in December 1985.\nOf the ICRIR, he said: \"I think we have to be to some degree pragmatic and say this is the only game in town at the moment. \n\"If we can find a way to engage constructively with it and give it a fair wind as best we can, my own personal view is that's the approach we should take.\"\nThe ICRIR, established by the act, will take on cases referred to it or brought by bereaved families and survivors, and has police powers to investigate and bring prosecutions, where possible.\nThe act's immunity clause has been disapplied by legal action.\nFrom Wednesday, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) will no longer investigate Troubles cases and will \"cooperate fully\" with ICRIR requests for information.\nThe ICRIR's commissioner for investigations, Peter Sheridan, said he hoped the new body would be supported over time.\nThe act has been criticised by Northern Ireland political parties and victims' groups.\nThe Irish government is also bringing an inter-state case against the UK at the European Court of Human Rights.\n\"I understand the contested nature of this,\" said Mr Sheridan.\n\"At some stage if we are all serious about wanting to help victims and survivors then everybody has to contribute into this, otherwise we are going to leave this for another generation to do.\"\nHe explained how the body would work with families: \"If it is a case with the possibility of evidence, then it will be a criminal justice investigation.\n\"If it is one we don't think is going to meet that standard, it could be a culpability, in other words, on the balance of probabilities, Sir Declan Morgan will write a report on who was to blame.\n\"And in a family focused investigation, answering questions that families have wanted for 40 or 50 years.\"\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said he welcomed the ICRIR becoming operational.\n\"In establishing the independent commission, we are doing something that has eluded successive government",
    "A woman whose dogs were left to suffer without the veterinary care they needed has been banned from owning animals for 20 years.\nKasandra Benton, of Talke Road in Walsall, was sentenced to 26 weeks in custody, suspended for two years, following an investigation and prosecution by the RSPCA.\nThe 37-year-old admitted to two animal welfare offences at Birmingham Magistrates' Court.\nTwo dogs, a chihuahua named Eddie and an Akita named Delta, were rescued from Benton\u2019s home by the RSPCA after concerns were raised about their welfare, but Eddie had to be put down due to the severity of his condition.\nThe animal welfare charity said the pair had untreated injuries that were ignored by their owner, with neither receiving vet care.\nEddie had a large 8-10cm untreated ulcerated mass in his groin, while Delta was left to suffer with injuries after a fight with another dog.\nRSPCA animal rescue officer Graeme Brookes, who visited Ms Benton's home, said Eddie's growth was \"very large\", which subsequently affected his ability to walk.\nHe also had a large open wound on top of the growth.\nMr Brookes said the lack of treatment had \"led to unnecessary suffering\".\nDelta had been kept locked in the kitchen with a large amount of faeces and urine.\n\"I could see she couldn't place her paw on the floor, hobbling significantly - also her hair was matted on the back,\" Mr Brookes said.\n\"I then noticed puncture marks on both her legs and the one she couldn't put down was significantly swollen.\n\"Many puncture wounds are often like the tip of the iceberg for dog bite injuries as the grip of the dog is maintained and they tear and rip the muscle and tissues below.\"\nThe RSPCA officer said a reasonable owner would have sought vet care for Delta's injuries after the fight.\nBoth dogs were taken to a vet who examined them and concluded they were suffering.\nEddie had to be put to sleep because of the severity of his condition, while Delta was placed in RSPCA care. She is now available to be rehomed.\nAs well as her 20-year animal ban and suspended prison sentence, Benton was ordered to carry out a maximum of 15 rehabilitation requirement activity days and pay \u00a3600 in costs and a \u00a3187 surcharge, when she was sentenced on 19 April.\nMr Brookes concluded: \"Our plea to all animal owners is to make sure they always receive care and treatment when they need it.\n\"Pets are completely reliant on their owners to ensure their needs are met and they are kept safe and healthy. \n\"Ensuring appropriate veterinary care is a key part of the responsibility we have towards them.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The prime minister is backing calls for an independent investigation into Vaughan Gething's Welsh Labour leadership campaign donations.\nThe first minister accepted \u00a3200,000 for his leadership campaign from recycling firm Dauson Environmental Group, which is owned by a man who has been prosecuted for illegally dumping waste.\nRishi Sunak said the situation is \"not at all transparent and answers are needed\".\nMr Gething has said he always followed the rules and has refused to hand the money back.\nMeanwhile Vaughan Gething's former rival Jeremy Miles has asked a Welsh government-owned bank to reflect on its due diligence, amid controversy over a \u00a3400,000 loan to a Dauson subsidiary.\nSenedd members voted on the donations issue on Wednesday afternoon, as a former Labour minister called on Mr Gething to hand the donations back.\nMr Gething played down public concern about the donations in the Senedd on Tuesday.\nThe Welsh Conservatives are critical of Mr Gething receiving the donation from a company that has a subsidiary which has taken a \u00a3400,000 loan from the Development Bank of Wales (DBW).\nMr Gething has insisted throughout that he cannot and will not take any decision related to Dauson Environmental Group. DBW has said it is independent of minsters.\nThe company is owned by David John Neal who was given a suspended sentence in 2013 for illegally dumping waste, and one in 2017 for not clearing it up.\nOne of Dauson Environmental Group's businesses is a landfill site in Pembrokeshire which is the subject of an ongoing row about its smell.\nOn Tuesday Natural Resources Wales said there were \"several serious permit breaches\" and \"poor management\" at Withyhedge in Pembrokeshire.\nIn Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Conservative MP Stephen Crabb, whose constituency covers the site, said: \"For six months, thousands of my constituents have lived with foul-polluted air from the Withyhedge landfill site.\"\nRaising the donation and the DBW loan, he said: \"Does the prime minister agree with me that this serious matter demands an independent investigation? It is not some internal Labour Party matter and, ultimately, that company needs to get out of my constituency so that the people of Pembrokeshire can have their quality of life back.\u201d\nMr Sunak replied saying Mr Crabb \"brings up an incredibly important issue and I know that people in Wales are concerned about the relationship he mentions\".\nHe added: \"I also agree with him on the need for transparency and an investigation regarding the Welsh Labour leader because it is very clear that the situation is not at all transparent and answers are needed.\"\nJeremy Miles told the Commons' Welsh Affairs Select Committee that he would ask DBW \"to reflect on whether any recent experience causes them to look again at their diligence processes\", amid the row over the loan to Dauson.\nThe \u00a3400,000 was given to Neal Soil Suppliers for the purpose of buying a solar farm.\nThe economy minister is responsible for DBW, although the organisation is effectively run independently of government ministers.\nStephen Crabb, chair of the committee, asked if \"the case of a company receiving loans from the Development Bank of Wales, owned by somebody who has criminal convictions for environmental offences, do you think that would have been a case that should have raised red flags around reputational concerns and therefore been communicated to the minister\u2019s office?\"\nMr Miles said there was a \"good reason why decisions are made at arm\u2019s length from ministers\".\nHe added: \"What I have asked, in discussions with the Development Bank, is for them to reflect on whether any recent experience causes them to look again at their diligence processes but those are matters for the Bank to consider and they are, properly, matters which are at arm\u2019s length from the government.\u201d\nThe Conservatives and Plaid Cymru will force two sets of votes on Wednesday afternoon on the Vaughan Gething donations - calling for an independent investigation and a cap on donations respectively.\nLabour - which has exactly half of the Senedd's 60 politicians - has enough votes to win with opposition MS Rhys ab Owen currently suspended, and should win the votes.\nThe Welsh government is asking Labour MSs to vote down the motions from the two parties.\nThey would not be binding on Vaughan Gething if the votes were to pass, but it would be embarrassing for his government if they somehow did.\nDespite criticism of the donation among some in the Labour group, sources told BBC Wales they expected party members to follow a whip as normal, where MSs are instructed how to vote by their party.\nThe Welsh Conservatives have tabled a motion recognising \"public concern regarding a potential breach of the Welsh government's ministerial code\", and have called for an independent advisor to investigate any conflict of interest.\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said: \u201cVaughan Gething\u2019s government has stalled before it could get going, with a senior",
    "On the banks of the Dee Estuary, separating Wales and England, scientists are concerned about what at first glance appear to be ordinary sand dunes.\nBut, as environmental scientist Dr Alex Riley scratches carefully away at their surface, an \u201cunnatural\u201d grey powder begins to appear.\n\u201cYou can see over the years this has oxidised and looks natural,\u201d he explains.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s reading on the meter that it has the same pH as household bleach.\u201d \nThe dog walkers and bird watchers who pass by the estuary either side of Flintshire and Merseyside appear unaware they are walking on chemical waste.\nThis site is one of hundreds of landfills that scientists fear are now leaking onto beaches and into the sea.\nThousands of rubbish dumps span the UK\u2019s coastline, many containing materials that were buried long before records needed to be kept.\nAccording to Dr Riley, it is only in the past few years that scientists have started to record where they are and what might be in them.\nIn Wales alone, a recent report found there were more than 260 coastal landfill sites currently at risk of leaking into the marine environment, as a result of coastal erosion, flooding and climate change.\nWhat we do not know yet is much about the effect these coastal landfills are having on wildlife with which they have contact. \n\u201cIt's unknown,\u201d said Dr Riley, from the University of Hull.\n\u201cThere are a lot of waste types around [and] different landfill sites. Sometimes these wastes are mixed together. It's a very complex picture and it's difficult to know exactly what the issues and impacts will be from those sites.\u201d\nThese dunes, made from the grey chemical power, have stood on the estuary for more than 100 years.\nLike many early landfills, there is little record-keeping, but the powder is understood to be waste product from a Victorian factory that once stood nearby.\nFlintshire council, which monitors the site, said it had raised the idea with Natural Resources Wales of coastal defences to \u201cprevent further damage\u201d.\nDr Riley said researchers like him were now hoping to raise awareness of legacy waste and its potential impact.\n\u201cThinking about sewage discharges into waterways for example, that's something that's quite high on the public radar at the moment,\u201d explained Dr Riley.\n\u201cIt's a problem that's affecting the environment right now - and will continue to do so, specifically with climate change.\u201d\nDr Riley said household landfill could be quite obvious when it began to erode, with plastic bottles and jars from the 1950s and 1960s easily noticed by people.\nHowever, he said the majority of chemical and industrial waste would not be so clear and urged people to keep a distance and wash their hands if they were ever unsure.\nAt the more severe end, Dr Riley said compounds like arsenic and lead had \u201cthe potential to leech out of these wastes and into the environment\u201d.\nNatural Resources Wales has been working to estimate how many sites already pose a risk to the environment.\nLast year, NRW engineers found 89% of Welsh landfill sites had the potential to release chemical waste.\nEstuaries and reefs were deemed to be most at risk from landfill waste leakage. Caves, mudflats and sandbanks were also deemed higher risk areas.\nNow the scale of the problem is beginning to be uncovered, one problem is establishing who is responsible for it.\n\u201cThere are over 1,500 landfill sites in Wales, a very small number are still active, and a few are permitted. Most of those 1,500 landfill sites are not permitted at all,\u201d said Mary Lewis, who leads an NRW advisory team on the issue.\n\u201cPrior to the 1970s, no records had to be kept. So there was no permitting on landfill sites and no requirement to keep records.\u201d\nShe that by default, responsibility now fell to the current landowner, no matter how long ago the waste was dumped, but there was little in the way of legislation.\n\u201cThe stage we\u2019re at is understanding the scale of the problem - and the risk it poses,\u201d she said.\n\u201cClimate change really is a very significant factor in the threat posed. We are already seeing increasing extremes weather events, extreme rainfall events - we also know sea level is gradually rising - which means we are seeing an increase in coastal flooding.\n\u201cAll of that makes the landfill potentially more unstable.\u201d\nMs Lewis's team plan to carry out more research into these sites, if they can secure funding.\nIn Cardiff, one litter picking group said it had already started to notice signs of Victorian era dumps re-emerging.\n\u201cWe have found things like old bottles, boots and gin bottles,\u201d said Dave King, who helps coordinate hundreds of volunteers for Cardiff Rivers Group.\n\u201cWe have a couple of spots like that which we regularly clean up,\u201d he said.\nMr King said at one site his volunteers regularly unearth material failing to degrade, such as \u201cTip Top ice lolly wrappers that are pre-decimalisation\u201d. \n\u201cSo that's [buried] before 1971 and it's still in perfect condition,\u201d he said.\nDr Riley said trying to move any of the waste ",

    "Kirklees Council has been urged by a think tank to reconsider plans to demolish the Piazza area of Huddersfield town centre.\nSame Skies has published research saying the Piazza Arts Centre generates at least \u00a3400k a year for the town. \nThe council's \u00a3210m Our Cultural Heart project would see the area replaced with a new venue, a multi-storey car park, a food hall, a museum and a gallery.\nDavid Shepherd, strategic director for growth and regeneration at Kirklees Council, said the new offer would \"boost the local economy and attract visitors from near and far\".\nHowever, Same Skies has claimed that instead of going ahead with the planned demolition, renovating the remaining Piazza buildings as a venue for the arts, community groups and new business start-ups could prove a more cost effective option.\nAndrew Wilson, co-director of Same Skies, said: \u201cOur latest figures show how the Piazza Arts Centre could be a national success story for Huddersfield. \n\u201cIts success is down to the architecture of the Piazza which has proved to be a revolutionary design for an arts, culture and business start-up venue.\"\nHe told the Local Democracy Reporting Service, the Our Cultural Heart project had already been scaled back and phase two faced \"years of delays and uncertainty\"\n\"Our continuing research demonstrates there is a viable, cost effective alternative.\"\nHowever, Mr Shepherd said the development would create \"a vibrant culture, art, leisure and nightlife offer to boost the local economy and attract visitors from near and far\".\n\"In order to bring this vision to life, the existing piazza will be demolished to make way for the area\u2019s new offering, which will include a food hall, museum and art gallery, and a modern, community library, events square and urban park,\" he added.\nOver the past four years, the centre has been home to numerous activities including Worst Album Covers, the town\u2019s most successful art exhibition which gained national media coverage and has gone on to tour venues around Britain.\nIt has also housed Dark Horse theatre, a theatre company for adults with learning disabilities and the Ame music venue which has attracted performers from all over the world.\nSince the initial plans were announced, Kirklees Council's plans for the Cultural Heart have changed due to financial constraints.\nIn June last year, it was announced that the museum and gallery would be housed together in the former library building at Princess Alexandra Walk, instead of separately, as was originally envisaged.\nThe art gallery and museum are expected to be delivered in later phases of the plan, between 2026 and 2030, along with an urban park, live entertainment venue, car park and a Queen Street development whose use remains uncertain.\nPhase one is expected to be completed by Winter 2025.",
    "Four presenters have begun legal action against the BBC on grounds of sex and age discrimination and equal pay.\nMartine Croxall, Annita McVeigh, Karin Giannone and Kasia Madera are attending a two-day hearing for an employment tribunal against the corporation in central London.\nThey claim they lost their roles on the BBC News Channel following a \"rigged\" recruitment exercise.\nThe BBC insists its application process was \"rigorous and fair\".\nThe corporation also rejects the claim on equal pay, insisting there is no claim to answer.\nIn court documents, it said: \"It is denied that [the BBC] has subjected [the presenters] to age or sex discrimination, harassment or victimisation, or has breached the sex equality clause.\"\nThe two-day preliminary hearing, which started on Wednesday, is laying out the groundwork for a full tribunal against the corporation.\nThe four newsreaders have all been presenters on the BBC's TV channels.\nIn July 2022, the BBC announced proposals to merge its domestic and international news channels.\nThe presenters claim that ahead of the announcement of the merger, the BBC's Channels' manager Jess Brammar privately assured four other chief presenters - two men and two younger women - their jobs were safe.\n\"We were put through a pre-determined job application process in February 2023,\" the presenters said in court documents.\nAs a result, they said they were not recruited as chief presenters and were instead offered roles as correspondents, which was in effect a demotion and a reduction in pay.\nThe presenters called the recruitment process \"a sham\" exercise, \"where our jobs were closed even though the redundancies were not genuine as the work still exists\".\nAll four presenters also allege they have not been paid equally compared with an equivalent male presenter since February 2020.\nThey have filed past equal pay claims, which they say is part of the reason the BBC treated them the way it did.\n\"The BBC grinds you down on pay,\" Croxall told the hearing.\nThe BBC denied the pay complaints and said all candidates for the chief presenter role were subject to the same fair and objective application process, which involved an application interview then practical assessments.\nIt said at least five other applicants scored more highly than the four women in the recruitment exercise and were appointed, based on what it called an \"objective assessment\".\nThe case comes four years after a high-profile equal pay dispute between the BBC and presenter Samira Ahmed.\nIn 2020, Ahmed won the employment tribunal she had brought against the corporation. She had claimed she was underpaid by \u00a3700,000 for hosting audience feedback show Newswatch, compared with Jeremy Vine's salary for Points of View.\nThe BBC argued the two performed \"very different roles\".\nBut the unanimous judgement said Ahmed's work was like that done by Vine, and that the BBC had failed to prove the pay gap wasn't because of sex discrimination.\nIn 2021, the BBC revealed it had spent more than \u00a31m on legal fees to fight equal pay and race discrimination cases brought by staff.",
    "A couple in their 80s who have fostered more than 150 children say they have no plans to retire.\nMargaret Isdale and her husband Robert, from Grantham, Lincolnshire, took in their first child in 1978.\nThey have been given a lifetime achievement award to mark their decades of dedication to families.\nAsked how they continue to care for newborns, Mrs Isdale laughed: \"I don't know! We just enjoy doing it, and I can't imagine not doing it now.\"\nThe couple, who have been married for 58 years and have two children of their own, are currently caring for an eight-month-old baby. \nMr Isdale, 81, said of their award: \"It's really quite humbling. It's not about us, it's about the kids we look after - they're the important ones.\"\nPaying tribute to them, Michelle Sawmynaden, from Lincolnshire Fostering Service, said she was \"in awe of them both\".\nShe added: \"Their dedication to the fostering service over 46 years has been absolutely incredible. \n\"The difference they've made to the children's lives has been fantastic. Lots of those children have either gone back to their birth families or gone on to be adopted.\"\nExplaining their decision to foster, Mr Isdale said: \"You're there to give them an interim period of safety, to allow them to experience being part of a family.\"\nThe couple can still remember the first child they cared for - a 14-year-old girl.\nShe stayed with them for just a week before being returned to her birth parents, they recalled.\nOver the years, they have looked after children with a range of needs, including a boy who underwent a kidney transplant. Mr and Mrs Isdale spent weeks in hospital by his bedside.\nThey said one child came to them with just a single set of pyjamas.    \nThe husband and wife team agreed the most rewarding part of fostering was reuniting families.\nMr Isdale said: \"People say, how can you hand them over? Well, that's part of what we do, and sometimes when you hand [a child] over the adoptive parents or birth parents keep in touch and they say how appreciative they are. That in itself is a reward.\"\nRecently, the couple were asked to be the godparents of a girl they had cared for.\nIn 1987, the Isdales adopted a girl after three years caring for her as foster parents.\n\"She just grew on us,\" said Mrs Isdale, 80.\nKim was born with Down's syndrome and a complex heart condition.\nWhen she was born doctors said she would not live beyond nine months. She died in 2005, aged 21. The family travelled all over the world with her. \nMr Isdale said: \"She taught us a lot. She was lovely, she had a good sense of humour, and she went everywhere with us.\"\nBoth said they had no plans to retire from fostering, insisting they would continue caring for children as long as their health allowed them to.\nAccording to Lincolnshire Fostering Service, there are 213 approved fostering households and 768 children in the county's care system.\nFurther details about becoming a foster carer can be found here. \nFollow BBC Lincolnshire onFacebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

    "Talk about an upgrade. When Dua Lipa headlines Glastonbury this June, it will be her first appearance at Worthy Farm since playing the cramped John Peel stage in 2017.\nAt the time, it was the biggest crowd she'd ever played to. People spilled out of the tent into the surrounding fields. \nStraight after the performance, she bounced off the stage into an interview with the BBC. \nBut as she sat down, she winced.\n\u201cI\u2019ve done myself an injury,\" she confessed. \"I mashed my tailbone.\u201d\nIt was an aggravation of an old injury, caused by the whiplash intensity of her dancing.\n\u201cI was doing all sorts of crazy stuff and when I got off stage, I could barely walk,\u201d she admitted.\nDespite the pain, she was ecstatic. The gig felt like \"a massive step up\u201d.\n\n\nAt that point, Dua Lipa was not yet Dua Lipa: The globe-conquering, Brit Award-winning, pandemic-soundtracking, Barbie-starring purveyor of glossy disco pop.\nBut one month later, she released the pastel-hued video for New Rules, and her career changed overnight.\nA number one in the UK, and her first hit in the US, the song's message of female solidarity propelled her into main pop-girl territory, after years of hustling behind the scenes.\nThe song clocked up its three-billionth play on YouTube this January \u2013 just as Dua started ramping up the campaign for her highly anticipated third album, Radical Optimism.\nIt\u2019s a record that sees her navigating life after a major break-up, and establishing new New Rules to break a pattern of dating wrong \u2018uns.\n\u201cBefore, I would see a red flag and be like, \u2018Oh, how beautiful\u2019,\u201d she laughs.\n\u201cIt could be anything: One sly, demeaning comment that you brush off\u2026 and then you realise it's a pattern.\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned to not kid myself.\u201d\nThose lessons permeate the album\u2019s punchy, keyed-up dance anthems. On the singles Training Season and Houdini, she vets prospective partners, and shows the door to anyone who falls below her standards.\nThe lyrics were inspired by a string of bad dates she endured after coming out of a two-year relationship with Anwar Hadid (brother of Bella and Gigi Hadid).\nBut how does dating work for someone at Dua Lipa\u2019s level of fame? Are people intimidated to ask her out?\n\u201cI don't know if people feel free to approach me,\u201d Dua muses. \u201cMaybe?\n\u201cDating apps, for me, I don't think would work. They might think they\u2019re being catfished.\n\u201cI like to go on a friend\u2019s recommendation. It makes it easier when they're vetted.\"\n\n\nWhen a match is made, her expectations for a first date are charmingly unstarry.\n\u201cI like a walk in the park,\" she says. \n\"You can chat and walk and get to know someone. No frills. It doesn\u2019t have to be anything fancy.\n\u201cHaving a good conversation is the best thing. That's how you see if you gel, if there's a spark.\u201d\nFor now, at least, that's not a concern. Dua has been in a relationship with British actor Callum Turner since the beginning of the year.\nAnd her personal life will have to take a back seat as she gears up for a busy summer.\n\nRadical Optimism is released on Friday, with Dua hosting and singing on Saturday Night Live a day later (the last British artist invited to do that was Harry Styles).\nIn addition, she\u2019s got her podcast series, the weekly arts and culture newsletter Service95, and an upcoming Disney+ documentary series about Camden\u2019s music scene, which she executive produced.\nBut looming over everything is Dua\u2019s return to Glastonbury. This time on the Pyramid Stage.\n\u201cI think about it all the time,\u201d she says.\n\u201cFifty per cent of my thoughts go to Glastonbury, then the rest are for everyday tasks.\u201d\nHer journey to the top of the bill is a story of aspiration, setbacks and tenacity that goes right back to childhood.\n\nDua was born in London in 1995, about three years after her parents, Dukagjin and Anesa, emigrated from Kosovo, having witnessed the beginnings of what would become the Balkan wars.\nA natural performer, Dua\u2019s enthusiasm was thwarted by her primary school music teacher, who put her through a humiliating public audition in front of the whole school.\n\u201cHe started playing the piano and I\u2019m trying to hit this high note, and nothing comes out. Literally just air,\u201d she recalls.\n\u201cEveryone in assembly laughed. I was so embarrassed. It was a big moment for me in my life.\u201d\n\nSalvation came at the Sylvia Young Theatre School, where the young Dua Lipa enrolled as a weekend student.\nThere, she was taken under the wing of singing tutor Ray Lamb. Recognising that her voice skewed towards the lower end of the mezzo-soprano range, he instantly removed her from the junior choir and put her in with the teens.\nShe was \u201cmortified\u201d to be singing next to children who were twice her height, but says Ray \u201chelped me build my confidence\u201d.\n\u201cHe was the toughest one, the scariest one, but really soft, deep down. And when he told you that you were good, you had a real sense of validation. He was the teacher that really made me feel I had something.\u201d\nDua Lipa: Headlining Glastonbury\nWatch the extended interview with Dua Lipa on BB",

    "An academy trust revealed plans to cut all its teaching assistant posts as it struggled to cope with rising costs.\nThe Wensum Trust said it wanted to scrap 78 full-time equivalent roles and introduce 48 pastoral and learning positions across eight primary schools.\nChief executive Daniel Thrower said: \"We really value our staff - this is a really hard decision for us to make.\"\nAshley Foster, from the GMB Union, said its members had been \"shocked\" by the move.\nMr Thrower said the trust - which runs primary schools in Hellesdon on the outskirts of Norwich, Wells-next-the-Sea and Burnham Market, as well as three secondary schools - saw its heating bill rise by \u00a3500,000 a year, while pay increases had hiked the wage bill by \u00a3360,000 last year - and pension pay by \u00a321,400.\nHe said the trust had not been given any extra money by central government, leaving it looking for more ways to save.\nIt was a position shared by schools across the country, he added.\n\"Head teachers have to address their budget deficits and in order to get them back to a surplus position we try to scrimp and save where we can,\" said Mr Thrower. \n\"Staffing levels are higher than the benchmarks, so we need to look at that in order to reduce staff to get budgets back to where they should be.\n\"We are not devaluing the role because we're still going to have teaching and learning support going into our classrooms.\"\nMr Thrower added that staff in the new roles would benefit from \"better professional development\", making it easier for them to switch salary scales, while still being able to \"connect with each and every child\".\nPlans about the consultation to scrap the teaching assistant (TA) roles in favour of new Pastoral and Learning Support (PALS) jobs were shared with staff last week.\nGMB Union's local organiser Mr Foster represented some workers facing job cuts and said it would like them to be offered voluntary redundancy.\n\"We expected that they might have been making some reductions, but the risk level to effectively make the teaching assistant role redundant shocked and scared everyone,\" he said.\n\"I've never seen a PALS role used in another school before and it feels like they are taking a gamble on the children's education.\n\"They are looking at a 35% reduction in staffing levels.\" \nFamilies with children at one of the schools were concerned.\nWendy Marrison has three grandchildren at Firside Junior school in Hellesdon.\nShe said the move was worrying and would be \"detrimental to the children's education.\"\nShe added: \"They need these teaching assistants. They're not overly paid. If anything they're underpaid for the work that they do, and they desperately need to keep them in the schools.\"\nPaul Groom said his daughter was supported by a teaching assistant with one-on-one help. \n\"It is a concern. TAs are important in the school because they help with more coverage.\"\nTony Brown said he understood budgets at schools were stretched. \n\"It's really difficult, and with the lack of funding coming centrally something needs to be done,\" he said. \nHe wanted to find out more about the proposed changes but added: \"Teaching assistants play a really valuable role and it would be sad to see them go.\"\nCharlotte Humber, who has one child at the school, said: \"I have tremendous concerns about it.\n\"My daughter has a one-to-one teaching assistant to manage her needs in a mainstream setting, and we've been told by the local authority because of this, her needs are met and therefore she isn't entitled to an EHCP (educational health care plan).\n\"Obviously if they're thinking about reducing staff members by a significant number, removing those teaching assistants, they're then looking at increased numbers applying to go to a specialist setting.\"\nAnother parent, Emma Gardiner said teaching assistants had helped her child, but hoped the pastoral staff could offer similar support to children. \nGot a story?

Judge Stephen Earl said Burgo was a \"significant\" dealer.\nThe judge said Burgo was caught after the French authorities cracked an EncroChat drugs network and gave his details to the UK's National Crime Agency.\nProsecutor Felicity Hemlin said detectives matched the movements of the drugs phone with those of Burgo and his car.\nMs Hemlin said there was also a \"significant amount of cash and credit entering his account which weren't consistent with his declared income\".\nShe said messages showed him ordering \"adulterated and unadulterated\" cocaine in 250g amounts, known as \"corners\", and \"half bars\" which were 125g, from wholesalers which he would then subdivide with other dealers to sell.\nIn mitigation for Burgo, his barrister Steven Reed said he was a \"middle man\" who was driven by his own addiction to drugs, which he had since overcome.\nHe said Burgo, a father of two, had been on remand in HMP Leeds since 2021 where he had \"spent his time productively\".\nMr Reed said while inside Burgo had seen \"first hand\" the effects of drugs on other inmates and \"understands clearly now that supplying cocaine is not victimless\".\nHe said he was \"genuinely remorseful\" and drug dealing was \"not a path he would return to\".\nJudge Earl said Burgo was involved in a \"significant supply\" of cocaine through \"family connections\", principally through a man named in court as Thomas Dunwoodie who was said to be Burgo's aunt's partner.\nThe judge said Mr Dunwoodie is believed to be in Spain where he is allegedly a \"significant player close to the source if not the source\" of drugs.\nJudge Earl warned Burgo that being involved in such a high level of the illegal drugs trade brought \"dangers\" of violence towards his family as well as being a \"scourge on society\".\nBurgo was jailed for seven years and three months.\nFollow BBC North East  on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

    "Just as the Tuesday morning rush hour and school run got under way, the quiet residential streets of a north-east London suburb were overtaken by panic and screams.\nIn the space of less than half an hour in Hainault, schoolboy Daniel Anjorin and four other people were attacked. \nA few hours later, police confirmed the 14-year-old had died of his injuries.\nWitnesses captured footage of a man prowling the streets brandishing a samurai-style sword, as residents were warned to lock their doors.\nOn Wednesday evening, police named Marcus Aurelio Arduini Monzo as the suspect and charged him with murder.\nPolice have described the incident as \"truly horrific\" and are still piecing together how and why this attack unfolded.\nShortly before 07:00 BST on Tuesday morning, police received reports of a car being driven into a house near Hainault's Underground rail station.\nOne witness told PA news agency he heard shrieking and police officers confronting the suspect.\nHe continued: \"I looked out the back window because the noise was coming from back there, I saw a bloke dressed in yellow jumping over some fences... I saw a policeman and policewoman - normal coppers with the short-sleeved shirts - who chased after him and they were shouting for him to put it down.\"\nManpreet Singh told the BBC he saw a \"group of people, five or six of them, trying to fight off a guy - he had a sword in his hand\".\nHe told Radio 5 Live he saw the man running towards Hainault's nearby Underground station and entering a road opposite, before trying to get into a house.\nMr Singh said the man was trying to fight police officers off and was Tasered.\nEyewitness James Fernando said a grey transit van pulled up and a \"man a got out with a samurai sword\". The man tried to talk to one female resident who ran away from him, he continued.\nHe said that as the man pulled the sword into the air, the woman tried to warn another neighbour who turned around, only to be \"struck in the head\".\nThe man \"was running around, still after the police officers came, with the sword in his hand\", Mr Fernando added.\nIn one video, the suspect can be seen looking in houses along Laing Close, near where a motionless person was also seen lying in the road.\nOne member of the public appears to have had a lucky escape. Footage captured the moment they emerged from a house into which the man had been looking moments before.\nThey can be seen poking their head out the door and seeing the attacker, before quickly disappearing back inside.\nAnother member of the public captured footage of the man being pursued by police as he climbed over fences and garages and into gardens.\nA man can be heard warning residents by screaming \"everybody lock your doors\".\nPolice say they arrested a suspect 22 minutes after they received the first 999 call from a member of the public.\nThere were five victims in total, one of whom - 14-year-old Daniel Anjorin - died of his wounds. Two of those injured were police officers.\nDaniel was a pupil at Bancroft's school, in Woodford Green, east London. The school was also attended by Grace O'Malley-Kumar, who died in a knife attack in Nottingham - where she was studying at university - in June 2023.\nA tribute to Daniel posted on the school's website read: \"He was a true scholar, demonstrating commendable dedication to his academic pursuits. \n\"His positive nature and gentle character will leave a lasting impact on us.

Then her tag suddenly stopped transmitting, indicating \u201cno malfunction\u201d, and strongly suggesting human interference.\nEagle Officer, John Wright, inspected the bird's last known roosting spot and noticed a small golden oval-shaped head feather, two small wing covert feathers and some white under-down on the moss directly below the tree. \nHe said: \"I saw a film of blood stretched across the grass stems. It subsequently turned out that a considerable amount of blood was present in and below the moss layer. \n\"I could see small downy feathers scattered in the dense spruce foliage below the roosting branches.\n\u201cMerrick had been roosting (sleeping perched) in a tree when her tag stopped transmitting. Golden eagles, as apex predator, have very few natural predators.\"\nThe bird had been part of an ongoing major conservation project in the south of Scotland to boost golden eagle numbers.\nLast year it was reported that the population had reached record levels.\nDee Ward, chairman of Scottish Land & Estates (SLE) and estate owner, donated Merrick to the project, and has \"condemned raptor persecution in the strongest possible terms\".\nHe said: \"This incident makes us all the more passionate about continuing that support and we will do all we can to prevent, detect and condemn anyone who thinks this kind of abhorrent behaviour is acceptable.\"\nThe Scottish Gamekeepers Association (SGA) have issued a statement saying they \"share the project\u2019s anger at this awful news\".\nIt added: \"The SGA and its membership have been active partners in the success of this project to date, supplying donor eaglets and helping with provision of food for the young birds.\n\u201cWe will continue to do so, to help bring about the recovery of the species in the South of Scotland.\u201d\nFollow the BBC for the South of Scotland on X. \nListen to news for the Scottish Borders on BBC Sounds.

    "Guernsey Ports said its \u00a31.4m pontoon replacement project at the Queen Elizabeth II Marina has reached a \"major milestone\". \nIt said its new D and E pontoons had been installed and the remaining boats were back in the water.\nThe company said the project had reached its \"final stages\" as the remaining leisure boats on the East Arm were hoisted back in the marina using a crane on Wednesday.\nIt said this would allow \"more than half of the East Arm to be returned to public parking\". \nKieran Higgs, Assistant Harbourmaster, said replacing the pontoons was part of a long-term investment programme. \nHe said the programme was designed to modernise and upgrade facilities for its mooring holders. \n\u201cThe location of D and E pontoons, closest to the marina gates, boasts the deepest water across all four of our marinas,\" he said. \n\"This makes it perfectly suited to larger vessels, particularly sailboats with deeper drafts, which are currently in high demand.\"\nMr Higgs added: \u201cThe project has not only enhanced our facilities, it has allowed us to optimise this area's layout to specifically address the demand for larger vessels and better serve our customers' needs.\"\nHe also thanked its mooring holders for their patience and cooperation while undertaking the upgrades. \n\"We have been able to welcome most of our berth holders onto their new moorings and look forward to having the last few back shortly in time for the start of the boating season,\" he said. \nGuernsey Ports said over half of the East Arm is due to be re-opened imminently for parking. \nIt said the far end of the East Arm would remain closed to compete power upgrades to the E pontoon, which requires landside trenching and cable installations. \nThe old pontoons also need to be removed and stripped by the Ports Maintenance Teams so that individual parts such as the aluminium frame can be shipped off for recycling, said Guernsey Ports. \nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "\"We're up for the challenge,\" said the boss of the company building Britain's biggest electric car battery plant.\n\"There hasn't been a project of this scale delivered on time in any recent history,\" added Tom Flack, CEO of Agratas, Tata Group's global battery business.\nThe company is working towards 2026 as an opening date for the \u00a34bn factory.\nBut meeting that deadline \"in the UK construction environment is quite a challenge,\" he told BBC Radio Somerset.\nThe American, who spent 14 years at Ford, said Agratas is \"doing some cool things to try and overcome those challenges, with government and private sector construction [companies].\"\nBut he admitted constructing the huge buildings, on the site of a former munitions factory near Bridgwater, Somerset, is \"going to be a wild ride\".\nMr Flack said the site has already been \"transformed\" in the last year.\nThey have started putting down the foundations of the buildings -12,000 large concrete pillars go below each one - and expect to go into the main construction phase \"in the next few months\".\nOnce they are built he said they will be \"some of the cleanest buildings you'll ever be in\" due to the demands of the batteries they will produce, initially for Tata's Jaguar Land Rover electric cars but also for other brands in future.\nFor local people, while the 4,000 jobs being promised at the factory are appealing, some are worried about the disruption their new neighbour might bring.\nTom Flack said they will be \"collaborating\" with the community in terms of \"add-ons\", \"so there is a little bit of a gain with any pain that comes in the construction phase\".\nSo how did they come to choose this brownfield site, surrounded by fields, a stone's throw from the M5?\n\"We had kept Somerset as our leading best location for about 18 months,\" Mr Flack said.\n\"It was really a question of: Can we make a factory in the UK work?\"\n\"As you can imagine, bringing manufacturing back to the UK is a daunting challenge, something that's very important,\" he said.\nThe government confirmed last year Tata had been offered a \"large\" incentive to site the plant in the UK. \nIt is understood that the government is providing subsidies worth hundreds of millions of pounds.\nThey are likely to be in the form of cash grants, discounts on the cost of energy, and training and research funding.\nThe site is sandwiched between two small villages: Puriton and Woolavington.\nThe vice-chair of Puriton parish council, Judith Fletcher, said most local people are \"positive\" particularly at the prospect of good, local jobs, but there are some who are \"less enthusiastic\".\n\"If they [Agratas] can carry on engaging with the local community and taking on any issues that might arise: noise, traffic, that sort of thing, that would be a good thing,\" she said.\nOn the jobs to come, and the people they will be looking to hire once the plant is up and running Mr Flack said it is \"not really like a traditional factory.\"\n\"This is very advanced manufacturing so there are few traditional jobs; it's a lot more biased towards people with engineering [experience] or college degrees.\"\nHe said they are already working with the local college to develop relevant courses.\n\"We're going to show people this is potentially you: 'Laura mother of two' who's had some experience and is looking to do something different.\n\"These businesses live and die on their people.\"\nFollow BBC Somerset on \u00a0Facebook\u00a0 and \u00a0X\u00a0.

    "The town of Ipswich is abuzz with energy after Kieran McKenna's team took a big step closer to the Premier League on Tuesday, thanks to a 2-1 win at Coventry.\nIpswich Town have one game left of the season and the team need just one point to be automatically promoted, without having to go through the play-offs.\nFans from across the town and beyond are nervously waiting ahead of Saturday's home game at Portman Road against Huddersfield Town, who are all but condemned to relegation to League One. \nBut are match tickets still available? Where can you watch the game if you don't have a ticket? And are any events planned for Saturday or beyond?\nNon-season ticket holders were able to buy tickets for Saturday's game back in April, on a priority basis depending on how many games supporters had been to previously.\nThese sold out quickly and those hunting for a ticket will be unable to get hold of any through the Ipswich Town website.\nThe BBC has heard from many fans who are desperately trying to source tickets ahead of the game.\nBBC Radio Suffolk spoke to Simon Nolloth, whose son Ed Nolloth has planned to fly back from New Zealand where he lives just for the match - but he needs a ticket.\nMr Nolloth Snr said they had been watching Tuesday's game together via WhatsApp when his son decided to book a flight to come over.\n\"He's a big Town fan,\" Mr Nolloth Snr added.\n\"We're hoping someone will take pity on us hopefully, we'll give it a good go.\"\nBBC Radio Suffolk's build up to the match starts at 11:00 BST and will be followed by full commentary.\nKick-off is at 12:30.\nSky Sports will be broadcasting live from Portman Road, with their coverage starting at 11:30.\nA number of pubs across the town will be broadcasting the game live, including The Thomas Wolsey on St Peter's Street, The Brewers Arms on Orford Street and The Curve Bar on Princes Street. \nIsaacs on the Quay has shared on social media that it will be showing the game \"across all areas of the venue with full sound\".\nHowever, a family zone will be set up for those who want to enjoy the game \"in a slightly calmer environment\", the pub has said. \nFan group Blue Action is encouraging supporters to gather ahead of the game to welcome the players' coach to Portman Road.\nPosting on Facebook, the group asked people to 'roar them on to the Premier League'.\nThe message says to meet at Sir Alf Ramsey Way at 11:00.\nBlue Action provided a raucous welcome to the players ahead of the final home game of last season's campaign, and also before the derby with Norwich in December.\nIpswich need just one point against Huddersfield in order to secure automatic promotion to the Premier League for next season. \nThey currently sit in second place, three points clear of Leeds, but with a worse goal difference. \nIf Ipswich achieve their goal it will be back-to-back promotions for McKenna's side.\nIf they lose on Saturday and Leeds win against Southampton, Town will finish the season in third place and head into the play-offs.\nHuddersfield, meanwhile, travel to Portman Road second from the bottom of the league, on 45 points.\nThey are two points behind Birmingham and three points off Plymouth, who will start the weekend above the relegation zone.\nHowever, Huddersfield's inferior goal difference (11 worse than Birmingham and 15 behind Plymouth) means the Terriers would have to beat Ipswich by several goals, and hope the two teams above them lose, to earn themselves a miraculous reprieve from relegation.\nIpswich Central has called on businesses in the town centre to \"turn Ipswich blue and white\".\nChair of the group and Town supporter, Terry Baxter, said the gesture would \"show the team we're behind them\".\n\"Let\u2019s show the team we are behind them by dressing shop windows and shop fronts blue and white, waving flags in support, put up bunting and balloons and of course urging staff to wear the club colours on Saturday,\" he said. \nMr Baxter added the potential promotion could \"be a massive boost\" for the town and its town centre businesses. \n\"Ipswich Central is fully backing the Blues and their bid for promotion to the Premier League as the icing on the cake for a fantastic season - Come on You Blues,\" he added.\nAt the moment, no news on promotion celebrations have been shared.\nLast year's promotion to the Championship saw a large celebration event in Christchurch Park.\nIt is more bad news if you are looking to get season tickets for the 2024-25 campaign.\nLast Friday the club announced that the full allocation of season tickets had been snapped up by existing holders, with 20,000 renewals.\nChief executive Mark Ashton said the support had been \"incredible\".\n\"Season ticket holders are incredibly important and for such a high number to have renewed for the new campaign is another example highlighting the loyal support the club is fortunate to have,\" he said.\nThe club has previously said it wants to keep some tickets available for supporters who cannot commit to every match.\nIt also has plans to develop",

    "A Belarusian company has been accused of bypassing UK sanctions and damaging British businesses.\nLabour MP Dame Siobhain McDonagh said Alutech, which makes metal parts for garage doors, is \"continuing to import banned products into the UK\".\nThe MP is calling on the UK's tax authorities to take action against Alutech and other firms suspected of getting round sanctions.\nAlutech declined to comment on the allegations.\nBelarus was included in the UK's sanctions against Russia, as the country has allowed its territory to be used by Russia's army to launch attacks into northern Ukraine.\nBut MPs on the Treasury select committee are concerned that the sanctions regime is not working and have launched an investigation into it.\nOn Tuesday, committee member Dame Siobhain accused Alutech of \"undercutting\" a group of British companies by \"supplying at a lower rate\".\nThe British companies had been the sole distributors of Alutech's steel and aluminium products in the UK.\nBut when the companies ended the deal over sanctions in 2022, Alutech set up its own showroom, in the West Midlands, and, according to Dame Siobhain, began \"stealing\" their UK customers.\nShe told the committee the British companies \"have lost roughly \u00a310m and they've had to make redundancies to cope with their losses\".\nThe MP said the issue had been reported to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), but the British companies had been told the onus was on them \"to provide the evidence, even though the information required is only available to the HMRC\".\nA spokesperson for HMRC said \"we can neither confirm nor deny investigations\" into Alutech.\nThe British companies allegedly affected are Alunet Systems and JD UK, two Yorkshire-based firms that work in the supply chain for garage doors, the BBC can reveal.\nSteve Hudson, who is the chief executive of both companies, told the BBC it had been a \"struggle to survive\".\nOn 25 March 2022, four weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, the UK introduced additional duties of 35% to certain goods originating in Russia and Belarus.\nMr Hudson said his companies stopped dealing with Alutech at that point and began seeking alternative suppliers in Europe.\nBut he said revenue had \"dropped by about 40%,\" and \"from being a good, profit-making business contributing reasonable taxes to HMRC, we're now in a loss-making position\".\nMr Hudson met Foreign Office officials last year to discuss the issue, but it's understood no minister was present.\nIn March this year, the BBC used a Freedom of Information request to ask for further details about that meeting.\nThe Foreign Office has delayed making a decision on whether to disclose that information, in order to conduct a test to decide where the public interest lies.\nOne Westminster source familiar with those discussions previously told the BBC that there had been confusion over whether the Foreign Office or HMRC was the correct body to intervene.\nMr Hudson said that talking to the government about the issue had been like \"going through treacle\".\n\"Maybe just completely naively, I thought that it would be much more straightforward and you'd be able to present some reasonable evidence because it's pretty clear what's happened to us\u2026 and somebody would be able to jump on it and then do something quite quickly,\" he added.\nSiobhain McDonagh wants the UK government to explore whether it could place a specific sanction on Alutech, rather than relying on the existing sanctions regime.\nExplaining one way that she believed the Belarusian company had been avoiding sanctions, she told MPs: \"There is a list of sanction product codes for Russia and one from Belarus and in some instances the two lists do not match up, so a product can be sanctioned in Belarus, but not sanctioned if it comes from Russia.\n\"The company has been shipping the goods through Russia and avoiding the sanctions altogether.\"\nNatalia Kubesch, a legal officer and sanctions expert at the human rights organisation Redress, told the Treasury committee that she believes there are other examples of Russian and Belarusian companies managing to bypass UK sanctions.\n\"I think it's probably unlikely this was an isolated incident and sanction evasion is continuing,\" she added.\nAlutech was previously 75% owned by German company Hormann.

    "US singer Olivia Rodrigo has expressed her disappointment after becoming the latest act to fall foul of a crisis at Manchester's troubled Co-op Live arena.\nShe was due to launch her UK tour with two sold-out gigs at the new venue this weekend, but they have been called off.\nThe decision came after the arena's opening was postponed for a third time on Wednesday when a fault scuppered a gig by rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie.\nRodrigo told fans she was \"sooooo disappointed\" not to perform her shows.\n\"I'm so bummed and I really hope to see you all soon,\" the chart-topping pop star wrote on Instagram, saying she and her team were \"doing our best\" to reschedule the concerts.\nRodrigo's fans have also had their plans wrecked, with many left out of pocket. Scott Tostevin, from Guernsey, had booked flights and a hotel for himself and two friends to see her on Friday night.\nHe told the BBC the group had spent several hundred pounds on the trip.\n\"I can either use my flights and hotel to now sit and watch a film in Manchester or lose the money and just cancel it all with no refunds,\" he said.\nThe decision to postpone major shows by one of the world's biggest artists is another big embarrassment for the Manchester arena after a series of delays.\nThe \u00a3365m venue, the UK's largest indoor arena with space for 23,500 people, was due to be opened by comedian Peter Kay last week, but his shows have been postponed twice.\nBosses decided Rodrigo's shows could not go ahead after A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie's concert was cancelled at the last minute on Wednesday.\nThousands of his fans were waiting outside the venue when they were informed about the announcement, which came 10 minutes after doors had been due to open.\nThe arena's operators blamed an incident during the soundcheck, when \"a component of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system, used to direct air, separated from the ductwork\".\nThey said no-one had been injured and that they were \"deeply sorry\", but the whole system would need to be tested for further defects.\nTicket-holders, many of whom had travelled for miles, were left disappointed, and the rapper wrote on social media: \"I'm heated about the situation too, but safety first Manchester, I got you, just stay tuned for further info.\"\nOne fan told the BBC it was \"very unprofessional\", while another criticised the \"bad organisation\".\nThe venue's operators, Oak View Group, said they appreciated \"the inconvenience\" this would cause for \"many\". The fault had been caused by a \"factory defect\" with a nozzle used to direct air, they added.\nHowever, staff were unable to verify that other such nozzles were free of similar problems.\nFan Katie Barnsley, who travelled up from Kent for the gig, found out it had been cancelled just as she was about to get a tram from Manchester city centre to the arena in the Etihad Campus.\nThe 28-year-old insurance broker had travelled up from near Dover with her partner and his sister, and estimated they had spent around \u00a3600 on tickets, accommodation and petrol.\nShe said: \"We were going on the tram and were asking the attendant how we got to the campus and he said, 'Don't bother, it's been cancelled'.\n\"Then I went on Twitter and saw the tweet from the arena.\"\nMs Barnsley said she had been apprehensive about travelling to Manchester because of the cancellation of earlier gigs at the venue but had been reassured by recent tweets from Co-op Live saying other shows would be going ahead.\nSome fans outside the venue were handed a sheet of paper saying A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie's gig had been cancelled for \"technical reasons\".\nZack, also 17, had come from Blackpool for the show. \"I'm on crutches and we queued up for about two hours, wasting our time,\" he said.\n\"They came out with these sheets of paper saying 'we're sorry about this', but we'd found out already from people shouting, people running around shouting that it's cancelled before they [the staff] even came out themselves.\"\nTeoni Kirkham, 21, said: \"We literally hopped out of our Uber and just saw everybody turning around and walking the opposite way. We found out literally when we got here.\n\"It's just messy, really. It seems like there's no organisation. With Ticketmaster on my phone, I thought, surely if it's been cancelled I would have got notification. They've not done a good job I don't think.\"\nThe next show in the schedule is Keane on Sunday, followed by a five-night residency by Take That next week.\nThe venue said it understood \"the need to reassure fans over future shows\", but did not rule out further postponements.\n\"We are working with artist management and promoters to limit the impact on the opening season schedule,\" its statement said.\n\"Where necessary, we will identify alternate dates, and will continually reassess to provide fans with sufficient notice regarding imminent shows.\n\"Should shows be cancelled or rescheduled, fans will be contacted by their point of purchase and offered a full refund where preferred.\"\nOak View Group chi",
    "A mother has spoken for the first time about the death of her five-year-old daughter who was knocked down and killed by an uninsured food delivery driver.\nMinaal Salam was killed on 1 April 2022, as she crossed the road with her father outside her primary school, Newstead academy in Blurton, Stoke-on-Trent.\nThe driver, who had no business insurance, carried the little girl on the bonnet of his car but then went on to drop off a takeaway before coming back to the scene.\nMinaal's mum, Alia Anum, 33, from Stoke-on-Trent, said her daughter was the \"centre\" of the family and described losing her as a \"nightmare\".\n\"She was my world,\" said Ms Anum, who added: \"To me, she was a sister, a friend, a companion.\n\"She was a lovely girl with big dreams; she loved to be called a princess.\"\nOn 1 April Minaal was picked up from the after-school club by her father.\nAs they were waiting to cross Waterside Drive, she stepped out and was struck by a car driven by 63-year-old delivery driver Istvan Zarka.\nAn inquest last year was told the girl was carried on the bonnet of the vehicle before falling onto the pavement.\nThe driver stopped briefly, drove on to deliver the takeaway and then came back to the scene of the accident.\nMinaal's father, a neurosurgeon, administered CPR, but could not save his daughter's life.\nThe coroner decided her death was a \"tragic accident\".\nZarka received eight penalty points on his licence for driving without valid business insurance.\nThe food he was delivering was ordered on an app run by Stoke-on-Trent company FoodHub.\nThe mother said the company never contacted her.\n\"I think they have huge responsibility to their drivers, they have never been in touch.\n\"They don't employ their drivers, but the food is being ordered to them, and they take money out of it. And it's a very profitable business.\"\nFoodhub does not employ any drivers. It relies on individual takeaways to organise their own deliveries.\nAfter the BBC made contact, FoodHub promised to get in touch with Alia. \nIt said: \"We were deeply saddened to be informed of the tragic death of Minaal Salam and offer our sincerest condolences to her family.\n\"We advocate responsible and legal operations across the industry and would de-list any business where complaints were upheld.\"\nMs Anum is also concerned about what she sees as a lack of safety improvements outside the school.\nNew warning signs have been installed and double yellow lines painted on areas where cars used to be parked restricting drivers' views. But she does not think that is enough.\n\"There are four hundred plus kids there and every morning and at home time they cross the road there is no proper place to cross the road.\n\"There should be a zebra crossing with a light.\"\nShe has one piece of advice for drivers.\n\"Make sure if you're in a school area, slow your speed and try to be kind to each other.\n\"I don't want anyone else to go through this pain.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X, and Instagram, Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk",
    "A man has been acquitted of terrorism charges linked to bugged Continuity IRA meetings.\nThe 41-year-old had been on trial at Belfast Crown Court facing eight charges arising out of two meetings secretly recorded by MI5.\nThe meetings were held at a County Down house almost a decade ago.\nDarren James Gleeson, originally from Dublin but with an address at Cable Street in Derry, was acquitted of all charges against him.\nIt was the prosecution case that Mr Gleeson travelled from his home in Dublin to Newry to attend the meetings with fellow dissidents at a house in Ardcarn Park in August and October 2014.\nSeven other men who attended the meetings later admitted their presence at the bugged property, and in November 2020 all seven were sentenced to a total of 33 years on a range of terrorist offences.\nMr Gleeson denied all the charges against him, including IRA membership, conspiring to possess explosives with intent to endanger life, and the preparation of terrorist acts.\nThe non-jury trial started at Belfast Crown Court in October 2022, where it was alleged that Mr Gleeson attended the two Continuity IRA meetings.\nThose present were recorded discussing topics such as the purchase of firearms, the best way to make bombs, earmarking potential targets and links with other dissident groups.\nCrown barrister Ciaran Murphy KC told Mr Justice Colton the two meetings allegedly attended by Mr Gleeson in August and October 2014 were meetings of \"like-minded individuals to discuss terrorism and moving their terrorist aspirations forward\".\nThe prosecutor said it was the Crown's case that during the August 2014 meeting, Mr Gleeson and others were recorded discussing the IRA on both sides of the border.\nOther topics discussed by the group and caught on the covert recording included discussing potential robberies to raise funds and the need for explosives training.\nDublin is discussed in one conversation, with a man the Crown say was Mr Gleeson being recorded as saying: \"I will do whatever is necessary\".\nThe man is told to try and locate a matchbox factory in Dublin as the group are interested in the sulphur used due to its explosive properties.\nThe man the Crown said was Mr Gleeson replied \"I will do my best\" and when he's also told to \"try and recruit younger boys\" in Dublin \"before they get into drugs or the gangster scene\", the man said said: \"I will try.\"\nThe Crown alleged that Mr Gleeson attended a second meeting in October 2014, and again the occupants in Ardcarn Park were recorded discussing terrorist activity.\nAs well as talking about the best ways to transport bombs and attacking the PSNI, the men discussed planting an IED on the Belfast to Bangor railway line as it was \"mainly Protestants''.\nThe prosecution said the evidence against Mr Gleeson was circumstantial but when all the strands of evidence were taken together, the court would be in no doubt that the defendant was present at Ardcarn Park on the relevant dates.\nIn his ruling on Wednesday Mr Justice Colton said: \"The prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was present in Ardcarn Park on 12 August 2014 and 3 October 2014.\n\"The case against the defendant is a circumstantial one. That does not mean that it is a weak one.\n\"Self-evidently, the individual pieces of evidence identified do not establish the defendant was present at Ardcarn Park on the relevant dates so counts one to seven are not proven by direct evidence. I acquit the defendant on count eight (possessing records likely to be useful to committing an act of terrorism).\n\"I am not satisfied that the prosecution has proven to the requisite standard that the defendant was present at Ardcarn Park.\n\"I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty....the evidence in its totality leaves me with a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.\n\"The individual strands of evidence which I have analysed undoubtedly give rise to a high suspicion that the defendant was present, but they do not cross the line to establish guilt to the criminal standard.\n\"Accordingly, I acquit the defendant on all eight counts,'' added Mr Justice Colton.\nFollowing the judgement, defence solicitor Mark Austin said outside court: \"Mr Gleeson welcomes the judge's decision to acquit him on all counts.''",
    "When Tracy McCulloch's cat, Pepe, went missing from his East Kilbride home, she was puzzled to find him miles away in Motherwell.\nAfter discovering that other cats from the area had also been found there and close by, she was convinced something suspicious was going on.\nThe missing cats were found up to 10 miles away, in and around areas such as Newarthill, Holytown and Motherwell.\nWith at least nine cats disappearing from East Kilbride, her daughter Sam set up a Facebook page to help solve the mystery.\nPepe's disappearance was out of character.\nTracy went to the vet with her other cat but when there was still no sign of Pepe on her return she grew worried.\nSpeaking to the BBC Radio's Mornings programme, she said: \"We started looking round the area, shaking biscuits, checking sheds, garages and still nothing. So we started looking through social media.\"\nPepe was found in Motherwell after 16 days and Tracy's daughter, Sam, said he was \"nervous for a while but just really underweight\".\nAfter setting up the Facebook page, Sam felt the situation could not be a coincidence.\nSince then, even more cats have been reported missing.\n\"We have spoken to a lot of the owners individually and to be honest, I mean you can\u2019t really accuse anybody,\" she said.\n\"There isn\u2019t any evidence other than they all went missing from the same area and have all been found within the same area. None of them have had any injuries apart from being absolutely starving.\"\nShe says some people have contacted the police regarding their missing cat, but because there is no evidence of people picking up the cats, there is nothing that can be done.\nRoger Tabor is a naturalist, an expert on cats and former BBC Animal Magic presenter from Essex.\nSpeaking to the programme he said it would be almost \"impossible\" for a group of cats to all appear in the same area, having crossed the River Clyde.\n\"With Tracy's case, it\u2019s particularly very unambiguous because her cat was blind in one eye I understand.\"\nHe added that the cats wouldn't all be going in the same direction on their own.\n\"These things, if they\u2019re real, it points to somebody living in the place where they\u2019re ending up and working in East Kilbride and going backwards and forwards.\n\"You get the odd one who will roam but, realistically, this is not the standard by any means, so yeah I think somebody\u2019s up to no good.\n\"If I lived in East Kilbride I would make damn sure I had my cat chipped,\" he said.",

A contest will be held if more than one candidate gets sufficient support.\nNews of the meeting emerged on Wednesday as the Scottish government survived a motion of no confidence that could have forced all SNP ministers to resign. \n\"We can confirm Kate spoke to John yesterday,\" a spokesperson for Ms Forbes, the former finance secretary, said.\n\"It was a purely informal meeting. Kate is continuing to weigh up whether to run and is grateful for the growing outpouring of support.\"\nSpeaking earlier, Ms Forbes said she \"fundamentally disagreed\" with any suggestion she would not have enough parliamentary party support to become SNP leader, having narrowly lost out to Mr Yousaf in last year's contest to replace Nicola Sturgeon. \nMs Forbes said she was \"listening just now and not ruling anything out\".\nMr Swinney, the former deputy first minister, told reporters at Holyrood: \"I will not be rushed into making decisions that affect my loved ones.\"\nHe denied there was a stand off between potential leadership candidates. \n\"It's about people taking the time to make the right decisions for those they love,\" he said. \nMr Swinney has been backed by a number of senior party figures, including Westminster leader Stephen Flynn, deputy leader Keith Brown and cabinet ministers Neil Gray, Shirley-Anne Somerville and Mairi McAllan.\nMs Forbes has been publicly supported by ex-ministers Fergus Ewing and Ivan McKee, as well as backbench MP Joanna Cherry.\nAllies of Ms Forbes told BBC Scotland News she had made progress planning a potential leadership bid, including on policy positions and resources, in case she decided to stand.\nHer supporters said she was not expected to make an announcement on Wednesday as it had only been 48 hours since Mr Yousaf announced his resignation.\nMs Sturgeon, speaking to journalists at Holyrood, said: \"I'll make up my own mind, I'm not going to tell other members how to vote.\n\"What I would say is that I hope the contest is positive, I hope it is forward-looking, and I hope it focuses on the things the SNP needs to do to continue it's very strong election-winning streak.\"\nMs Forbes, who narrowly lost out to Mr Yousaf in the 2023 leadership contest, was criticised during the campaign for revealing she would have voted against gay marriage legislation had she been an MSP at the time due to her religious beliefs as a member of the Free Church of Scotland.\nAt the time, Mr Swinney, also a Christian, questioned whether it would be \"appropriate\" for someone with such views to become SNP leader.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme, Mr Ewing urged Mr Swinney to retract those comments.\nNominations for the SNP leadership opened on Monday and close one week later. If more than one candidate receives 100 nominations from at least 20 local party branches, a ballot will be held among members to choose a new leader.\nMr Yousaf has said he will resign as first minister once a new leader is chosen. At that point, parliament will have 28 days to nominate a new first minister to be appointed by the King.\nIf MSPs cannot reach an agreement after 28 days, a snap election would be called.\nSpeaking for the first time since announcing his resignation, Mr Yousaf said he had \"paid the price\" for the way he ended the SNP's power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens.\nHe told BBC News ending the Bute House Agreement was the \"right decision\".\n\"But I have to acknowledge the manner in which I did it caused great upset and that's on me,\" he said. \nA motion of no confidence in his government, which would have forced all SNP ministers to resign, was defeated by 70 votes 58 in the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday. \nThe result was in little doubt after the Greens, whose votes would be required to give the opposition a majority, called for it to be withdrawn following the first minister's resignation announcement.\nIf it had passed, the motion would have compelled the entire government to resign, with parliament given 28 days to nominate a new first minister. Failing that, a snap election would have been called.",

The report said the impact on employment in the local area \u201ccould range from 5,700 jobs to 6,800 jobs\u201d.\nThe report's authors stressed that the figures are based on a scenario \u201cwithout any intervention\u201d- the transition board\u2019s purpose is to help to mitigate the impact of Tata Steel\u2019s decision.\nResponding to the report, Mr Davies said: \u201cNone of us wanted to see this happen.\"\n\"When Tata came to us and said \u2018we are looking to close the blast furnaces and pull out,\u2019 we wanted to do absolutely everything possible to save jobs and support those who may be losing their jobs.\u201d\nHe appealed to private companies \u201cto realise Port Talbot\u2019s potential, to come in and invest.\u201d\n\"I understand what Tata\u2019s decision means for the community in Port Talbot, and that is why I wanted to fight in cabinet for the UK government to put money into a transition fund to support the people and the area.\u201d\nTata Steel will build a state-of-the-art electric arc furnace, which melts scrap steel, on its Port Talbot site. The UK government is contributing \u00a3500m of the \u00a31.25bn cost, with construction expected to begin in the summer of 2025.\nThe Transition Board\u2019s funding includes \u00a380m from UK Government and \u00a320m from Tata Steel UK. The Board\u2019s membership includes representatives from Welsh government, the local authority and unions.\nThe economic assessment said short-term objectives for the Board should include mitigating the \u201cmost severe and direct impacts\u201d at the Tata Steel works and its closest supply chain.\nIn the medium term, over the next two to five years, the report authors said \u201chigh quality and well-advanced projects\u201d were required to replace the work lost at Tata Steel. This includes securing work on the decommissioning of the blast furnaces and the building of the new electric furnace.\nIn five to ten years, new technology such as floating offshore wind and the benefits of the Celtic Freeport should be harnessed, the report said.\nIt warned that, without a plan to support workers, the restructure at Tata Steel \u201cwould accentuate and accelerate the \u2018brain drain\u2019 of younger, more highly skilled workers from the area\u201d.\nWhile there were opportunities from new technologies such as wind power and hydrogen generation, the report said that the Welsh government and the UK government would need to support large-scale projects.\nTata Steel said it was investing \u00a31.25bn over the next four years in the UK steel industry, aiming to secure 5,000 jobs to \u201ccreate a sustainable future with green steelmaking at the heart of an industrial ecosystem\u201d.\n\u201cWe are very aware of the impact such decisions have on the people and businesses in the region, and we are working hard to ensure a just transition through our own initiatives,\u201d the company said.\n\u201cIt is crucial that the decisions being made to support people, businesses and groups within the Port Talbot community are based on timely and accurate information.\u201d",
    "The owner of a dental practice has warned that current funding means it cannot treat NHS patients beyond the autumn.\nDr Nilesh Parmar, who is based in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, said surgeries were given a quota of how much NHS work they could do each year.\nThe dentist said it had created a \"crazy situation\" where he had enough staff to tackle Essex's dental waiting list - but was not allowed the funding.\nA Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said work was ongoing to reform dental contracts.\nDr Parmar said he was given a set sum of money to fund how much NHS work his three full-time dentists could undertake.\nDespite a \"ridiculous\" amount of demand in Essex, his staff would have to stop the work once the money ran out, he said.\n\"It just seems like a crazy situation where you've got a clinic which is ready to do more treatment and do more NHS work, but we're going to have to stop because we just don't have the funding to do it,\" Dr Parmar added.\n\"It's almost like saying to a hospital 'you can see 300 patients this year, and once you see 300 patients you have to send them away' - and that's exactly what we're having to do.\"\nDr Parmar, who qualified as a dentist in 2004, estimated that he would have run out of his NHS quota by the end of the summer.\nHe said efforts to appeal for more funding were unsuccessful.\n\"We know that Essex has a really high need for NHS treatments at the moment,\" he continued.\n\"When it's healthcare you can't put quotas on it - it just doesn't work.\"\nThe government announced in March that dental practices would benefit from extra cash for taking on new NHS patients as part of a Patient Premium scheme.\nIt came as part of a dental recovery plan that would create up to 2.5 million more appointments in 2024, the DHSC spokesperson said.\n\"As a result, more dental practices are already accepting new adult and child patients across England,\" they added.\n\"We are also continuing our work on reforming the dental contract so that dentists are paid properly for more complex work.\"\nFollow Essex news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The US is still engaged with Niger and Chad, despite withdrawing troops from the countries, the head of the US Africa Command has told the BBC.\nOn Wednesday, dozens of US troops left Chad after the country's military leaders raised concerns over their presence ahead of the 6 May elections.\nGen Michael Langley told the BBC it was a \"temporary repositioning\" of troops.\nLast month, US troops left neighbouring Niger after being ordered out by the country's junta.\nRussian military instructors have arrived in Niger as part of a new agreement with the military leaders.\nSeveral other military-led countries in the Sahel region have also recently strengthened ties with Russia and cut them with France, the former colonial power, as they try to fight an Islamist insurgency in the region.\nThe Sahel region is considered the new global epicentre of the Islamic State group.\nGen Langley said that violent extremist organisations were the biggest threat to Africa's stability.\nLast year, Niger and Burkina Faso both announced they were following Mali in withdrawing from the G5 international force set up to fight Islamists in the region. The three military-run countries have instead set up their own grouping - the Alliance of Sahel States.\nThe US set up a drone base in the central Niger city of Agadez, 750km (460 miles) north-east of the capital, Niamey, in 2016 to help monitor regional jihadist activity. \nBut in March after Niger ordered US troops to leave. Military spokesperson Col Amadou Abdramane accused the US of raising objections about the allies that Niger had chosen. \nCol Abdramane condemned the US for its \"condescending attitude\" and \"threat of reprisals\".\nBut Gen Langley said that the \"ultimate goal\" of the US was to continue a dialogue with those countries that have been taken over by juntas.\nHe told the BBC the US hopes to get the juntas \"on a roadmap back to democracy\".\n\"That's the ultimate goal of the US government - of our continued engagement with these countries that have been taken over by juntas.\nHe said that he had spoken several Chadian leaders. \"They are still inviting us in for continued relations because we've enjoyed a lot of success in helping Chad fight terrorism,\" he said.\n\"In Niger, our talks are still ongoing, whether we reset or reposition will just really be based on the threat, but also - every country we engage with is at the request of that country.\"",
    "Good morning. First things first, it's early days. \nWhen there's a general election, we are used to waking up on Friday morning and knowing the result. \nThat's far from the case in this patchwork of local and regional elections. \nThere are shedloads of results still to come later today, throughout tomorrow and beyond.\nBut here's what we can tease out so far.\nThe Conservatives are having a very, very rough time. They have lost around half of the seats they are defending.\nIf this rate of loss continues across all the seats being fought, it would be in line with their worst performance in a set of local elections when looked at as a proportion of their seats lost - which was back in 1995.\nAnd we know what happened two years later in 1997 - they lost the general election by a landslide. \nThese are the kind of numbers that will well and truly give Conservative MPs the heebie-jeebies. \nLabour are talking up the importance of geography as well as numbers in terms of their gains.\nOn the excitement-ometer, Labour folk got particularly excited at about 3am when they took control of Rushmoor Council in Hampshire.\nWhy the excitement about this one? Well, it's a council they have never held before and it includes the military town of Aldershot.\nSir Keir Starmer has tried to convince voters his party can be trusted over defence and Labour sources point to this result as evidence that it's working. \n\"I can't think of a bigger example of voters seeing us as a changed party,\" a senior Labour source texted me. \nAnd Labour smiles broadened further when the result of the Blackpool South by-election was announced just before 5am.\nThe turnout was limited, but the swing to Labour was whopping. \nLittle wonder a quote from Sir Keir appeared within seconds - describing it as \"seismic\" and \"the most important result today\".\nReform UK came within a whisker of beating the Conservatives on the Lancashire coast, and have performed strongly where they have put up candidates in local and police and crime commissioner contests - albeit in areas where they would expect to do well.\nA couple of other early observations:\nLabour are taking a hit in places with a significant proportion of Muslim voters, where there appears to be evidence of a negative reaction to Labour's approach to the Israel-Gaza conflict. \nThe Liberal Democrats reckon they are gaining sufficient ground to be able to be confident of making gains at the Conservatives' expense at the general election.\nAnd the Green Party are doing well again. Their vote share has been growing in local elections for the last decade and appears to be growing further. \nSo, in summary, so far it's looking bleak for the Conservatives and buoyant for Labour.\nBut remember: two thirds of the councils with elections yesterday have not yet started counting. \nNor have the mayoral contests or many of the police and crime commissioner races.\nIt's going to be a long weekend. And not just because there's a bank holiday on Monday.",
    "A teenager has been sentenced to life for murdering another teen over a drug debt.\nArmin Mehdikhani-Sarvejahani will serve a minimum of 17 years for stabbing Mustafa Momand in Brighton in October 2023.\nThe trial at Lewes Crown Court had heard the killing happened over a \u00a320,000 drug debt.\nMehdikhani-Sarvejahani can be named for the first time after media organisations, including the BBC, made an application to get an anonymity order lifted.\nThe court heard how Mr Momand spent his dying moments running away in fear after he was knifed through the breast bone on Queens Road.\nThe A-level business and law student ran for 150m before he staggered and collapsed while his attacker yelled after him.\nJudge Mr Justice Constable KC said Mustafa was trying to turn his life around from being a \"minor pawn in the terrible drug business which destroys so many lives\".\nThe trial heard how Mr Momand had racked up a \u00a320,000 shared drug debt and that his parents had tried to save him from drug dealing and debts, and even begged the police to send him to prison.\nSentencing Mehdikhani-Sarvejahani, Mr Justice Constable said: \"He was a brave young man who took the decision to try and leave the drug world behind him with his parents' support, but this meant leaving this so-called unpaid debt.\n\"I have no doubt that you were tasked, as an expendable foot soldier, with inflicting lethal punishment on Mustafa.\"\nHe added: \"This tragic case serves as a stark reminder of the very real dangers that await young people who get involved in dealing drugs, of the appalling way in which young lives spiral quickly into effective servitude for the financial benefit of others and become treated as expendable, and most clearly, of the devastating consequences of ever more frequent knife crime.\"\nSpeaking after the sentencing, Det Ch Insp Alex Campbell described the murder as a \"senseless tragedy\".\n\"Time and again across the country, we see the heartbreaking consequences of carrying a knife. Mustafa Momand, a child, has tragically lost his life. His family and loved ones must live with his loss for the rest of theirs.\n\"His killer will enter adulthood inside a prison cell.

    "US President Joe Biden has called Japan and India \"xenophobic\", grouping them together with Russia and China as countries that \"don't want immigrants\". \nHis criticism of Japan comes just weeks after he called the US-Japan alliance \"unbreakable\" during a state visit from Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\nIndia is also a key US partner, despite US concerns about human rights and religious freedoms there.\nThe White House says that Mr Biden meant no offence to either country.\nSpeaking to a predominantly Asian-American audience at a campaign fundraising event on Wednesday evening, Mr Biden said that the US election this November was about \"freedom, America and democracy\".\n\"Why? Because we welcome immigrants,\" he added. \"Think about it. Why is China stalling so badly economically? Why is Japan having trouble. Why is Russia? Why is India? Because they're xenophobic. They don't want immigrants.\" \nThe BBC contacted the US embassies of Japan, India, China and Russia for comment, but did not receive an immediate reply.\nThe comments, however, have drawn criticism from US commentators. \nOn X, formerly Twitter, Elbridge Colby, a former US deputy assistant secretary of defence in the Trump administration, wrote that Japan and India \"are two of our very stoutest and important allies\".\n\"We should speak to them with respect, which they command and deserve,\" he added. \"Applying parochial progressive views to our allies is patronising and foolish.\" \nAlthough Japan, India and China have relatively few foreign-born workers, Russia is heavily reliant on migrant labour, much of it drawn from Central Asia.\nWhile economic growth has been sluggish in Japan and China, Russia's militarised economy rebounded slightly last year as its war with Ukraine continues, despite international sanctions. \nIndia, meanwhile, has experienced steady growth and surpassed the UK in 2023 to become the world's fifth-largest economy.\nThe White House denied that Mr Biden's comments were meant in a derogatory sense, with national security spokesman John Kirby saying he was making a wider point on US immigration policy. \n\"Our allies and partners know well in tangible ways how President Biden values them, their friendship, their co-operation\" Mr Kirby said. \"They understand how much he completely and utterly values the idea of alliances and partnerships.\" \nSadanand Dhume, a South Asia expert at the Washington DC-based American Enterprise Institute, told the BBC that Mr Biden's comments would probably be received poorly in India as it experiences a \"nationalist upsurge\".  \n\"It will confirm the idea among a section of Indians that Mr Biden is not friendly to India,\" he said. \"They will not take kindly to having been clubbed along with authoritarian countries like China.\" \nIn late April, a US Department of State report found \"significant\" human rights abuses in India, which its government said \"is deeply biased and reflects a very poor understanding of India.\"\nIn the longer term, however, Mr Dhume said that remarks are a \"tempest in a teacup\" and \"unlikely to significantly affect US-Indian relations.\" \nWhile Japan has for decades had some of the world's most restrictive immigration policies, it has recently sought to address a steadily shrinking population by facilitating the entry of foreign workers. \nMr Biden, who repeatedly characterised former US President Donald Trump as xenophobic during his 2020 campaign, has taken an increasingly restrictive approach to immigration amid widespread anger - from both sides of the political spectrum - over his handling of the US-Mexico border.

    "\"Most organs come from patients who have had quite a sudden and tragic event... something like a very large stroke, or a big heart attack, or a traumatic event.\"\nFormer intensive care nurse Matt Collis specialises in talking to the families of such patients, delicately broaching the subject of whether they want their loved ones' organs to be given to others.\nThe stark reality is that less than 1% of people who die in the UK do so in circumstances which allow them to donate their organs.\nA long illness means the whole body is weakened, and a death outside of hospital means organs quickly deteriorate.\nVirtually all donors end their lives in intensive care units.\nI ask Matt how potential donors' families first react when he approaches them.\n\"Normally it\u2019s shock and it\u2019s not something they\u2019ve considered,\" he says, \"but most of the time once we sit down and explain the benefits of organ donation... most agree.\"\nIn the UK there are strict ethical guidelines on donation.\nThe patient will be treated by their own medical team until their death. Only then will the retrieval team, which saves their organs, see them.\nConsultant Vipin Mehta heads the retrieval team at the Wythenshawe Transplant Centre in Manchester, one of only six such units in the country.\n\"It\u2019s very emotionally draining in the beginning, especially when you start doing the retrieval process and you see what the donor has gone through,\" says Mr Mehta.\n\"So now we always have a moment of silence before we start the retrieval process.\"\nEvery transplant patient is acutely aware that their chance of survival is dependent on someone else\u2019s life ending.\nWythenshawe has a team of psychologists who help recipients come to terms with this.\n\"A big one is thinking about 'survivor guilt' for example, and I think that can be a real pressure for people after transplant,\" says consultant clinical psychologist Dr Zoey Malpas.\n\"They feel this overwhelming urge that they should be doing something amazing with their life. Actually people are really fearful that they\u2019ve got this precious organ and they don't want to do anything that\u2019ll risk it.\"\nThe centre also runs a monthly group, the Transplant Caf\u00e9,  for pre- and post-transplant patients to talk about any issues. \nPatients are also encouraged to write an anonymous letter of thanks, which is given to the donor\u2019s family by the centre.\nGary Lee received a heart transplant five years ago.\n\"I was literally dying\" he remembers. \"My organs kept shutting down.\"\nGary, like everyone I speak to, says he often thinks about the person who allowed him to live.\nAs a way of expressing his gratitude he says whenever he and his wife go abroad or away anywhere, \"we always look for a church and we always light candles for our donors and donor families everywhere we go\".\nDeborah Horrocks had a heart transplant in 2020.\n\"I\u2019m just so grateful that it happened - it gave me a second chance,\" she says.\n\"Both of my children got married last year and I\u2019ve got a grandson, and all this I wouldn\u2019t have been able to see...\"\nDeborah pauses, temporarily unable to speak, before continuing: \"Because I wouldn\u2019t have been here.\"\nIn the eyes of the law, every patient is a potential organ donor, unless they\u2019ve opted out.\nIn practice, though, families have to give their consent.\nAnd many just don\u2019t know what their relative would have wanted.\nMatt Collis says the situation is made far easier when someone has registered a decision to donate on the organ register, even though it is no longer a requirement.\n\"In my experience, that makes it very clear for families to understand that this is what their loved one wanted, and that I am there to help them with that,\" he says.\nMatt keeps in touch with donor families for several months afterwards, sometimes even longer.  \nOnce a year a special ceremony is held for every family to celebrate their loved one\u2019s life.\n\"These patients are so special and they have such an impact on transplant recipients,\" Matt says.\n\"I find that the families that I still speak to a year, two years down the line, they say that organ donation has really helped them. Because the death wasn\u2019t for nothing.\u201d\nI say to Matt that he obviously finds his job very rewarding.\nHe smiles and says: \"The families that donate are just wonderful.\n\"I find it amazing that in their time of grief and a time when their world has ended that they are willing and able to help other people.\"",

You can use ID which has expired as long as you still look like the photo.\nAnyone registered to vote without the correct ID - or who no longer looks like their photo - can apply for a free document known as a Voter Authority Certificate.\nIt is too late to get one to use in the May elections. \nHowever, if you do not have valid photo ID or it has been lost, stolen or damaged you can still apply for an emergency proxy vote via the electoral services team at your local council before 17:00 BST on polling day.\nLocal councils are responsible for many public services, including: \nMost of these council seats were last contested in May 2021, after the 2020 elections were postponed because of the pandemic. \nVoting took place alongside other elections which were already scheduled. \nThe Conservatives made significant gains and ended 235 seats up, with Labour 327 seats down.\nOn the same day, the Tories took Hartlepool from Labour in a parliamentary by-election.  \nThe London Mayor represents the 8.9 million people living across the city and has a budget of \u00a320.4bn. \nThe mayor is responsible for Transport for London (TfL) and has some control over roads, policing and housing in the capital.\nOutside London, mayoral elections are also taking place in nine \"metro\" areas across England.\nThe West Midlands, Greater Manchester, Liverpool City, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and Tees Valley already have mayors. \nFor the first time, mayors will also be chosen in the East Midlands, the North East, and York and North Yorkshire.\nMetro mayors set out plans to boost their local economy, and have some powers over housing and transport. \nIf you include the London mayor, they control about \u00a325bn, covering 44% of the population in England.  \nVoters will also choose the mayor of Salford, the directly-elected leader of the city council.\nElections for 37 PCCs are taking place across England and Wales - although not in London, Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and York and North Yorkshire where the mayor performs this role. \nPCCs were introduced in 2012 to replace police authorities. They were intended to make police forces more accountable and responsive to their local community.\nThey help ensure that police forces function effectively, but do not directly run them. PCCs appoint chief constables and can dismiss them, if required.\nSome PCCs also oversee local fire services.\nMany local election results will be announced overnight into Friday 3 May, with more expected to follow throughout the day.\nA few will be announced over the weekend.\nMayoral results will be declared on Friday and Saturday 4 May. \nThe London Assembly elections will also be declared on Saturday.",
    "Former Nickelodeon producer and writer Dan Schneider has filed a defamation legal case against the producers of a TV documentary series, claiming it has \"irreparably harmed\" his reputation.\n\nThe five-part docuseries, released in March, alleged years of abuse and inappropriate behaviour at shows including iCarly and Drake & Josh.\n\nSchneider said Quiet On Set: The Dark Side Of Kids TV falsely implied he \"sexually abused the children who worked on his television shows\".\n\nThe lawsuit was filed on Wednesday in the Los Angeles Superior Court.\nThe Press Association said the documents name producers Maxine Productions, Sony Pictures Television and Warner Brothers Discovery as defendants.\n\nThe BBC has contacted the defendants for comment.\n\nNickelodeon, which is not involved in the case, told the Associated Press in a statement on the series that it cannot \u201ccorroborate or negate\u201d allegations from decades ago, but it investigates all formal complaints and has rigorous protocols for working minors.\n\n\u201cOur highest priorities are the wellbeing and best interests not just of our employees, casts and crew, but of all children and we have adopted numerous safeguards over the years to help ensure we are living up to our own high standards and the expectations of our audience.\u201d\n\nThe docuseries, which was originally broadcast on US streaming platform Max, includes several allegations of Mr Schneider making inappropriate and sexual jokes on-set.\n\nSchneider created hit shows including iCarly, Victorious, Drake & Josh, Zoey 101 and The Amanda Show.\nHe apologised in March for his \"embarrassing\" on-set behaviour at the children's channel and left it in 2018 after an investigation found that he was verbally abusive to staff members.\n\nThe court documents said that although two people who worked on Nickelodeon shows were later convicted of sexual offences, Schneider \"had no knowledge of their abuse, was not complicit in the abuse, condemned the abuse once it was discovered and, critically, was not a child sexual abuser himself\".\n\n\"But for the sake of clickbait, ratings, and views - or put differently, money - defendants have destroyed Schneider's reputation and legacy through the false statements and implications that Schneider is exactly that,\" the case said.\n\n\"Schneider never sexually abused a child, nor has he been charged or convicted with sexually abusing a child.\n\n\"The trailer and Quiet On Set's statements and implications to the contrary are both false and made with reckless and malicious disregard for the truth.\"\nSchneider told the Press Association: \"Recently the docuseries Quiet On Set highlighted mistakes I made and poor judgement I exhibited during my time at Nickelodeon, most of which happened decades ago during my early career as a producer.\n\n\"There is no doubt that I was sometimes a bad leader.\n\n\"I am sincerely apologetic and regretful for that behaviour, and I will continue to take accountability for it.\n\n\"However, after seeing Quiet On Set and its trailer, and the reactions to them, I sadly have no choice but to take legal action against the people behind it.\n\n\"In their successful attempt to mislead viewers and increase ratings, they went beyond reporting the truth and falsely implied that I was involved in or facilitated horrific crimes for which actual child predators have been prosecuted and convicted.\n\n\"I have no objection to anyone highlighting my failures as a boss, but it is wrong to mislead millions of people to the false conclusion that I was in any way involved in heinous acts like those committed by child predators.\n\n\"I owe it to myself, my family, and the many wonderful people involved in making these shows to set the record straight.\"",

    "A senior Fujitsu engineer made a false statement to court about the flawed Post Office IT system, contradicting a report he had written days earlier.\nThe BBC has obtained Gareth Jenkins' 2010 statement, which helped wrongly jail pregnant postmistress Seema Misra.\nIt said there were \"no cases\" where branch accounts could be altered without postmasters' knowledge.\nBut he had just produced a Post Office report which proposed remotely altering data in branches to fix a bug.\nMr Jenkins, Fujitsu's former chief IT architect, is currently being investigated by the Metropolitan Police for potential perjury, the BBC understands.\nAt least three Post Office lawyers were told about the internal report which contradicted Mr Jenkins' statement to court, but his report was not disclosed at the trial of Mrs Misra - who had been running a branch at West Byfleet in Surrey.  \nThe Post Office said it was \"deeply sorry\" for the suffering caused to victims and it \"remained focused\" on supporting the ongoing inquiry.\nMr Jenkins' report and an accompanying memo provide the clearest evidence yet that as early as autumn 2010 the Post Office and Fujitsu, which built the Horizon IT system, were aware of details about the software which could cast doubt on prosecutions, and were keeping them hidden.\nThe memo, which summarised a series of meetings about the report, said that if the bug was widely known, it could cause a \"loss of confidence in the Horizon system\", provide branches with \"ammunition to blame Horizon for future discrepancies\" and have \"potential impact upon ongoing legal cases\".\nThe Horizon bug, known internally as the \"receipts/payments mismatch\" issue, was causing discrepancies between the accounts postmasters saw and those on the Post Office main servers. According to the memo, it was known to be affecting 40 branches.\nIn his report on 29 September 2010, Gareth Jenkins suggested remotely altering data to resolve the bug.\nHe met other Fujitsu and Post Office representatives a few days later to discuss the possible solutions.\nThe memo says Mr Jenkins' proposal to remotely access sub-postmasters' accounts had raised \"significant data integrity concerns\", could lead to questions of \"tampering\" and could prompt \"moral implications\" of the Post Office \"changing branch data without informing the branch\". \nIn the end, the group chose a different solution - using debt recovery or refunds to make the balances match. The memo acknowledged this could \"potentially highlight to branches that Horizon can lose data\".\nNine days after delivering his report, Mr Jenkins submitted his final expert witness testimony, which was used by the prosecution in Mrs Misra's trial. In the months leading up to it, he had been drafting his statement for the court, with input from Post Office lawyers.\nMr Jenkins' testimony was also later used in the prosecution of many other sub-postmasters, where details of his report on the bug were again not disclosed. \nThe BBC has obtained his 2010 testimony, which states there are \"no cases where external systems can manipulate the branch's accounts without the users in the branch being aware and authorising the transactions\".\nOn the same day, 8 October, internal documents show that a number of Post Office lawyers had copies of both Mr Jenkins' contradictory claims - his witness statement, and the report about the bug in which he proposed remotely altering branch data.\nA member of the Post Office security team had attended the meeting that discussed Mr Jenkins' report and had emailed Rob Wilson, then head of the PO's criminal law team, expressing \"concern\" about the proposed solutions. He wrote that they \"may have repercussions in any future prosecution cases and on the integrity of the Horizon Online system\". \nAttached to his email were the meeting's memo and Mr Jenkins' report.\nMr Wilson then forwarded this email - and the attachments - to Jarnail Singh and Juliet McFarlane, senior lawyers who dealt with Post Office prosecutions.\nMr Singh was specifically assigned to Seema Misra's case and was responsible for disclosure - the duty to share information that might help the opposing side's case.\nIn a written statement to the public inquiry into the Horizon scandal last year, he said: \"I do not recall having seen this document.\"\nBut Post Office records reveal that just minutes after receiving the email in 2010, he had printed off Mr Jenkins' report.\nThe BBC showed Mr Jenkins' report and the meeting memo to Prof Charles McLachlan, an expert witness for Mrs Misra's defence team.\nProf McLachlan said they were \"completely incompatible\" with Mr Jenkins' witness statement at her trial.\n\"There's absolutely no question that he not only knew, but was recommending remote access at a point when his witness statement was claiming there was no remote access,\" he said.\nMr Jenkins' witness statement was made in response to technical issues originally raised by Prof McLachlan.\nSeema Misra said seeing the documents from 2010 made her \"e",

The officers then chased him.\nThe court was told that he jumped out at a female officer and attacked her with the sword while she was on the ground, leaving her with arm wounds described by police as \"horrifically serious\".\nHe is also accused of injuring a male officer, who has a serious hand injury.\nSpeaking to the Press Association (PA), Aiste Dabasinskaite, Daniel's neighbour, said: \"We were shouting and waving towards Daniel as he came out.

It just happened right before our eyes, it was horrible.\"\nAnother neighbour said she could no longer sleep at night \"because all I can see is him standing there with the sword\".\nDaniel's school, Bancroft's, in Woodford Green, said he was a \"true scholar\" who had a \"positive nature and gentle character\".\nIn a statement, it described him as a \"core member\" of the community, adding: \"Losing such a young pupil is something we will always struggle to come to terms with.\"\nA fundraising page, set up by a friend of Daniel's brother on Wednesday, has already raised \u00a335,000.\nMeanwhile, the sister of a man wounded in the sword attack has described her brother as a \"hero\" for protecting his family.\nHenry De Los Rios Polania, 35, an IT engineer from Hainault, is in hospital after being stabbed in his home.\nHis sister, Jessica De Los Rios, 31, said her brother had been left \"traumatised\" by the event, adding: \"To us, he's our hero.

    "Riot police in Georgia fired tear gas and water cannon to disperse crowds for a second night, as protests continued against a proposed law denounced by opponents as Russian-inspired.\nA number of people were hurt during the protests after parliament approved the second reading of the controversial \"foreign agent\" bill on Wednesday.\nThe EU warns it could harm Tbilisi's ambitions of joining the bloc.\nOn Thursday, the US said the bill threatened free speech.\n\"The Georgian people want a European future for their country,\" Ursula von der Leyen posted on X. \"Georgia is at a crossroads. It should stay the course on the road to Europe.\"\nUS National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the White House was \"deeply concerned\" by the bill because of \"what it could do in terms of stifling dissent and free speech\".\nThe governing Georgian Dream party argues the bill will \"boost transparency\" of foreign funding, but protesters fear it could be used to crush critical voices ahead of parliamentary elections later this year.\nOpponents say the measures are inspired by authoritarian legislation that neighbouring Russia uses to crush dissent. \nRussia's 2012 law has since been used to marginalise voices challenging the Kremlin - including prominent cultural figures, media organisations and civil society groups.\nThe billionaire founder of Georgian Dream, Bidzina Ivanishvili, claimed this week that a Western \"global war\" party was using the country as part of its confrontation with Russia. He said Georgia had been set against Russia in 2008, when Russian forces invaded the country, again in 2014 when Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine, and then two years ago when Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine began.\nThe bill cleared its second reading with a vote of 83 to 23. After a third reading it has to be signed off by President Salome Zurabishvili, who has vowed to veto the bill, although Georgian Dream has sufficient numbers in parliament to overrule her.\nGeorgian Dream wants the law enacted by the end of the month. Once that happens, organisations would be required to state whether they are funded from abroad.\nGeorgia has been rocked by weeks of protests over the issue. On Tuesday night, clashes erupted between police and protesters on Rustaveli Avenue, outside parliament.\nSeveral people were injured, including Levan Khabeishvili, chairman of the main opposition party United National Movement (UNM). He posted a picture of his bruised face on social media and later appeared in parliament, his face heavily bandaged.\nEyewitnesses accused some police officers of physically attacking protesters and EU foreign-policy chief Josep Borrell said he strongly condemned violence against Georgians \"who were peacefully demonstrating against the law on foreign influence\".\nDeputy interior minister Aleksandre Darakhvelidze said six officers were hurt and 63 people arrested and he complained that \"the rally turned completely violent\". He said Mr Khabeishvili had been hurt while trying to break through a police cordon, although his party said he had been beaten by police.\nGeorgia was granted EU candidate status last December and polls suggest about 80% of the population is in favour of joining. \nProtests against the bill began in mid-April, with many Georgians fearing the government's measures would derail Georgia from its path towards membership, says the BBC's South Caucasus correspondent, Rayhan Demytrie.\nUnder the proposals, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and independent media would be required to register as organisations \"bearing the interests of a foreign power\", if they receive more than 20% of their funding from foreign donors.\nThey would also be monitored by Georgia's justice ministry and could be forced to share sensitive information - or face hefty fines of up to 25,000 Georgian lari ($9,400; \u00a37,500).\nA number of European leaders have warned the proposed bill is \"incompatible\" with European norms and values.\nBut the government of Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze is standing firm. \nMr Kobakhidze has accused NGOs of attempting to stage revolutions in Georgia twice, of promoting \"gay propaganda\" and of attacking the Georgian Orthodox Church. \nThe government insists the bill is about ensuring transparency and rejects the notion that it is against European values - or that Russia is behind the legislation. \nOn Monday, Bidzina Ivanishvili told a rally of Georgian Dream supporters that foreign-funded NGOs threatened Georgian sovereignty and that the opposition UNM would be punished for crimes against the state after this year's elections.\nPresident Zourabichvili, whose role is largely ceremonial, described the pro-government rally as a \"Putin-type\" event.\nMs Zourabichvili, who is strongly opposed to the foreign influence bill, has appealed to the interior ministry to stop using \"disproportionate force\" against protesters.",

Dublin blamed the plan to send some migrants to Rwanda for a surge in asylum seekers crossing its border with Northern Ireland from the UK. \nThe Daily Express quotes Home Secretary James Cleverly saying \"migrant protests won't stop us doing what is right\". It's in reference to Thursday's demonstration in London, where 45 people were arrested for trying to stop a coach taking asylum seekers to the Bibby Stockholm barge off the coast of Dorset. \nAlso leading on yesterday's protest, The Daily Mail asks \"whose side is Labour really on?\" The paper says Rishi Sunak has accused Keir Starmer of being \"soft\" on migrants.\nThe Times headline reads \"wrecking ball hits housing plans\". The paper says it has seen figures showing that a number of local authorities are taking advantage of Conservative planning changes to slash targets for building new homes, in anticipation of a Labour government which might try to stop them. \nThe Guardian says the government will today announce that fossil fuel companies will be allowed to explore for oil and gas at sites intended for offshore wind. The paper has been told that 30 licenses will be granted to companies. The story features a quote from Rishi Sunak's former net zero tsar, Chris Skidmore, who quit the Conservative party in protest at the government's climate policies.

    "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has banned lab-grown meat, saying he will \"save our beef\" from the \"global elite\" and its \"authoritarian plans\". \n\"Florida is fighting back against the global elite's plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs,\" Mr DeSantis said in a statement. \nThe first-in-the-nation law prohibits anyone from selling or distributing lab-grown meat in Florida.\nSimilar efforts are under way in Alabama, Arizona and Tennessee. \nLab-grown or \"cultivated\" meat was first cleared for consumption in the US in 2022.\nThe process of making cultivated meat involves extracting cells from an animal, which are then fed with nutrients such as proteins, sugars and fats. The end product is genetically indistinguishable from traditionally produced meat. \nStudies have suggested that eating cultivated meat can cut carbon emissions and water usage, and free up land for nature, compared to eating traditionally produced meat. \nThe World Economic Forum, an international non-governmental organisation in Switzerland, has for years touted lab-grown meat as an efficient and environmentally-friendly way to produce food, and feed a rapidly growing global population. It has also promoted insect farming as a \"credible and alternative protein source\". \nLobbyists for edible insects have launched a campaign asking the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to add mealworms, crickets protein powder and other insect products to the agency's database of safe ingredients. \nThese unconventional food sources have become fodder for the US culture wars. Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene made headlines two years ago after she insinuated the government was monitoring whether Americans were eating fake meat grown in a petri dish. \nAt an event on Wednesday announcing the new law, Mr DeSantis said he was \"fighting against an ideology that ultimately wants to eliminate meat production in the US and around the globe\".  \n\"In the state of Florida we've put down the marker very clearly; we stand with agriculture. We stand with the cattle ranchers,\" he said. \nFlorida's commissioner of agriculture Wilton Simpson applauded the legislation as a \"tremendous step in the right direction\". \n\"Florida is taking a tremendous step in the right direction by signing first-in-the-nation legislation banning lab-grown meat,\" Mr Simpson said. \nBut the move was also supported by an unlikely supporter of Mr DeSantis, Senator John Fetterman, a Democrat from Pennsylvania. It \"pains me deeply\" to agree with Mr DeSantis, Mr Fetterman wrote on X, \"but I co-sign this\". \nGood Meat, a cultivated meat company which says it is the first in the world to sell lab-grown meat, wrote on X it was \"disappointed\" by the new Florida law. \n\"In a state that purportedly prides itself on being a land of freedom and individual liberty, its government is now telling consumers what meat they can or cannot purchase,\" it said.

    "The small town of North Bend in Washington is famous for its mountain wildlife. Cougar and elk are often seen - bigfoot \"sightings\" are frequent.\nNow something wilder has moved in - a zebra that escaped with three others earlier this week on the way to a zoo.\nWhile locals quickly \"wrangled\" three, catching the fourth has proven to be anything but black and white.\nOfficials say the animal has moved into the Cascade Mountains - and efforts to catch it could take days.\nThe animals escaped from a trailer on Sunday while they were being moved to Montana.\nCurious bystanders, including brunch-goers and a professional rodeo clown passing through town, managed to corner three of the zebras within hours after they wandered into a horse paddock.\nBut one remains on the loose five days later, leading to a large response by local volunteers and officials, and an outpouring of memes and silly adverts by Seattle-area businesses.\nDallas Clark, a professional tow company owner and horse trainer in his spare time, has been helping lead the volunteer effort to track down the missing zebra.\nHe's part of a group that normally helps rescue stray animals loose in the mountains - often hikers' dogs, but also the occasional farm animal.\nThe female zebra who was initially incorrectly reported to be a male \"stallion\", has been spotted by dozens of people throughout the week, and was last seen on Thursday morning.\nIt has been returning to a feeding station that his group erected to try to lure in the runaway, but lately the presence of curious Pacific Northwest safari-goers has been scaring the zebra farther into the national forest, he says.\nTrail cameras confirm that it is eating and drinking and is generally healthy, despite temperatures that have dropped down to near-freezing at night, and the confirmed presence of a mountain lion in the area.\n\"We have been out in rain, shine, snow, thunder, lightning just to make sure we know how it's doing,\" says Mr Dallas, 28, adding that much of the search is being done on horseback in thick steep vegetation. \n\"None of us has ever done a zebra before so this is all new. But we're trying to treat it no different than we would any other animal that's lost in the woods,\" he says.\nMeanwhile, locals have gone wild with zebra jokes online, posting photos of chefs wearing zebra-print aprons, AI images of a Bigfoot riding zebra, and pictures of the town's local elk with fake zebra stripes.\nMr Glass is critical of the official response so far, and calls for government officials to close trails in the area to keep people from spooking the animal.\nResidents of the town where the 1990s cult classic Twin Peaks was filmed are now glued to Facebook for updates on the elusive creature.\nMr Glass says he's confident the zebra will eventually be caught, but only after rescuers can build up \"trust with it\" and after the public has given it time to \"mellow\".",
    "Israeli officials are increasingly concerned that the International Criminal Court (ICC) is planning to seek arrest warrants for their military and political leaders on suspicion of war crimes. \nReports suggest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be among them.\nThe ICC, based in The Hague, has been investigating Israel's actions in the occupied territories for the past three years - and more recently the actions of Hamas as well. It has the power to charge and try individuals for the most serious crimes under international law.\nIt has previously issued arrest warrants for leaders including Russia's Vladimir Putin, Muammar Gaddafi of Libya, and Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony.\nMr Netanyahu has called the prospect of senior Israel figures joining the wanted list \"an outrage of historic proportions\", accusing the ICC of attempting to paralyse Israel's ability to defend itself.\nBut the fact that he's chosen to make such strident public comments suggests that, behind the scenes, such a scenario is being actively discussed. \nWhile the ICC has not confirmed the Israeli claims, when Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan KC visited Israel and the occupied West Bank last December his message was a clear one. \nThe British barrister toured the sites of Hamas' attacks in Israeli villages close to the Gaza fence, which Hamas-led gunmen burst through on 7 October.\nHe also met political leaders, and travelled to Ramallah to speak to the families of Palestinian victims about their experiences in Gaza and the West Bank. He condemned the violence suffered by civilians on both sides, and promised to investigate. \n\"All actors must comply with international humanitarian law,\" he clarified in a statement at the time. \"If you do not do so, do not complain when my office is required to act.\"\nMr Khan said the 7 October attacks - in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies - represented \"some of the most serious international crimes that shock the conscience of humanity, crimes which the ICC was established to address\".\nIn Israel's case, his concerns were twofold. He stressed the obligation to conduct its military operation in Gaza according to \"clear legal parameters that govern armed conflict\". \nIsrael has been accused of failing to sufficiently protect civilians during its months-long bombardment, although it insists it takes all necessary measures to avoid casualties. The Hamas-run health ministry in the territory says more than 34,500 people have been killed there since the war began, and that many of that number are children.\nMr Khan also underlined the need for humanitarian aid to get into Gaza, with access to food, water and medical supplies a basic right for civilians \"without further delay, and at pace and at scale\". He also urged Hamas not to divert or misuse the supplies when they did arrive, after accusations by Israel that its members were looting trucks and stealing aid, stopping it from reaching the wider population.\nIsrael isn't a member of the ICC and it says the court has no jurisdiction over it. But the court has ruled that since 2015 it does in fact have jurisdiction over the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza after the Palestinians ratified its founding treaty, the Rome Statute, as the State of Palestine. \nNo Western-style democracy has had an ICC arrest warrant issued for its leader before. If it happens to Mr Netanyahu, he'll be the first. Israelis have particular concerns about the stigma and potential isolation that would come with it.\nMichael Oren was Israel's ambassador to the United States between 2009 and 2013. He points to the recent case brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which accused Israel of genocide against the Palestinian population in Gaza - an accusation Israel vehemently rejects.\nIn January, the court issued an interim ruling that ordered Israel to take steps to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza, but stopped short of telling it to stop its military offensive.\n\"Israel emerged from those proceedings relatively unscathed, but the fact that the proceedings were held at all meant that Israel had lost the battle,\" he told the BBC.\n\"They should not have been held at all, and certainly it's a blow to our international standing and our security. Because a country whose leaders are accused of presiding over war crimes, that country is more vulnerable than a country that isn't.\"\nSir Geoffrey Nice KC, another British barrister, led the prosecution of the former Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic for war crimes at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).\nHe points out that the actions of both sides in this conflict are within the ICC's focus. \n\"Any investigation will not just be the Israeli Defense Forces and political and military leadership but also Hamas,\" he told the BBC. \n\"It's to be hoped that alleged Hamas fighters and leaders are not all shot on sight, that they are d",
    "Andrew Maximov has been working in the computer games industry for 12 years, but despite all that experience he still marvels at the amount of money spent on building the biggest titles.\n\"I used to work for PlayStation and the last game that I worked on, just production alone cost us $220 [\u00a3176m], and then you double that for marketing, and you are in half a billion dollars for every game that you put out there, which is a bit unsustainable for most companies.\"\nHe believes that artificial intelligence (AI) will play a crucial role in keeping the soaring costs of game production down, and save video game designers vital time by automating repetitive tasks. \nHis company, Promethean AI offers developers a set of tools to craft their own virtual worlds. Mr Maximov hopes to disrupt the way games are currently produced.\n\"What we're trying to do is replace that with a system that can learn directly from artists, so that artists can be the authors of their own automation.\"\nHumans will still play a key role in the production process. AI will work hand in hand with the human and enable them to be more creative.\n\"We can create a vision for a game and then the artist can click a button and ask an AI to give them feedback. Then they will get examples from their library of concept art and digital ideas that are relevant to their project,\" Mr Maximov says.\nSometimes the AI comes up with surprising ideas.\n\"I remember once we were trying to build a police station and we asked the AI to populate it, and it came back with a doughnut on every desk.\n\"Another time, we were building an apartment and it kept consistently putting a sock under the coffee table. We wondered if it was a bug but it turned out we had labelled it a bachelor apartment so I guess that it was logical to some extent,\" he says.\nCalifornian software firm Inworld is also employing AI to build elements of computer games.\nIt has created an engine that allows developers to add realism to game worlds and emotional depth to characters. The firm is also working on what it calls a narrative graph, developed in partnership with Xbox, which will use AI to help create storylines.\nChief executive Kylan Gibbs tells the BBC that he believes AI will allow developers to \"dream bigger than ever before\".\n\"The engine allows developers to add AI agents that can see, sense, and perceive the world around them, while also interacting with players and taking in-game actions. When you can imbue virtual characters with advanced cognitive capabilities, it unlocks a completely new paradigm for storytelling and gameplay,\" he says.\nNick Walton is the chief executive of gaming firm Latitude.io, and he believes AI has the power to personalise the gaming experience.\n\"We are at the start with AI and as it advances we will see very dynamic, adaptive worlds with characters that feel alive, with story arcs where you as the hero are doing unique things and having a very unique impact on the world.\n\"You could play a game where you find a town that no-one else cares about and no other player has spent time in, and you can get really invested in it and develop relationships with all the characters in it,\" he tells the BBC.\nHis firm developed AI Dungeon, a game that allows players to choose from a variety of worlds and create their own stories within it.\n\"It's kind of like those old text adventures where you type an action and then the game determines what happens next.\n\"But the key difference is that instead of having a developer pre-imagine everything they might do, the AI can dynamically decide what happens next. So any action is possible.\" \nHe said that he was surprised by the success of Dungeon, the first version of which was launched in 2019.\n\"It was started as a side project that I just put on the internet and within a week 100,000 people had played it,\" he says.\n\"I think there's just a lot of replayability because the story is different every time and you can take it in any direction. And there's this ability to have true choice which has always been a goal for many games.\"\nMore technology of business\nGreater reliance on AI could have a knock-on effect to the humans in the industry.\nThe chief executive of computer games giant EA, Andrew Wilson, recently told delegates at a conference that around 60% of the game publisher's development processes could be affected by AI tools. The firm recently laid off 5% of its staff, around 670 jobs.\nMr Maximov does not necessarily see AI replacing humans but rather allowing humans more \"creative dignity\", something that has been lost at some of the big games publishing houses where developers are given very repetitive tasks to do.\n\"There are a lot of developers that had watched Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings and were inspired to go and do something great but are now spending their days placing rocks outside a castle for a year,\" he said.\n\"There's a lot to be said for reclaiming the true purpose and value of these jobs, giving every artist the opportunity",
    "Scandal, hush-money payments, secret recordings and Donald Trump's alleged gag order violations took centre stage during his tenth day in court.\nThe court heard testimony from Keith Davidson, a lawyer who brokered porn star Stormy Daniels' hush-money deal.\nQuestioning of Mr Davidson grew hostile, as the defence tried to paint him as a sleazy Hollywood profiteer.\nHe pushed back, alleging the defence had wrongly used words like \"extortion\" to describe valid legal settlements.\n\"We're both lawyers. I'm not here to play lawyer games with you,\" the ex-president's lawyer Emil Bove said on Thursday in a particularly heated moment during cross-examination. \nMr Bove unearthed several celebrity scandals that Mr Davidson allegedly was involved in keeping quiet, apparently in an effort to shake the witness' credibility. \nMr Trump's lawyer asked whether Mr Davidson had \"extracted sums of money\" from actor Charlie Sheen and if he worked with a \"sex-tape broker\" on the behalf of reality star Tila Tequila. There were also stories about actress Lindsay Lohan's visit to a rehabilitation facility and professional wrestler Hulk Hogan's sex tape.\nMr Davidson repeatedly maintained that the settlements he was involved in were fair and legitimate. He also regularly cited attorney-client privilege. \nProsecutors, meanwhile, had called Mr Davidson to connect Mr Trump, his ex-lawyer Michael Cohen, and the $130,000 hush-money payment he paid to Ms Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election. \nThe former president pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal the payment. He also has denied any sexual encounter with Ms Daniels.\nMr Davidson detailed how the payout to Ms Daniels was shaped. He was also involved in an earlier deal with the National Enquirer magazine to conceal Playboy model Karen McDougal's claim that she had a romantic affair with Mr Trump.\nBBC News reporters are in the Manhattan courtroom covering the historic first criminal trial of a former US president. You'll find their updates and analysis on the BBC news website and app, and across TV, radio and podcasts.\nThe lawyer, who is based in Beverly Hills, California, emphasised that he assumed Mr Trump was behind keeping Ms Daniels quiet in October 2016. Emails and text messages indicated that he and others believed the hush-money agreement with his former client helped Mr Trump win the presidency just a month later.\n\"What have we done?\" Mr Davidson texted National Enquirer editor-in-chief Dylan Howard as the results rolled in on election night. \nAsked to explain the message, Mr Davidson told the court: \"There was an understanding that our efforts may have in some way\u2026 our activities may have in some way assisted the presidential campaign of Donald Trump.\"\nDuring a second set of questions, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass played recordings of Mr Davidson and Cohen on the phone, \"surreptitiously recorded\" by Cohen.\nIn one recording, Cohen says that Mr Trump told him several times that he \"hate[s] the fact that we did it\". Mr Davidson testified that he was referencing Stormy Daniels' hush-money deal.\n\"But my comment to him is, 'but every person that we've spoken to told you it was the right move',\" Mr Cohen adds in the recording.\nProsecutors called Douglas Daus, who works in the high-tech analysis unit at the New York County District Attorney's Office, toward the end of the day.\nMr Daus told the court he analysed two phones owned by Mr Cohen, extracting the data and 39,745 contacts - more than 10 pages included various contact details for Mr Trump alone. \nMr Cohen is expected to testify soon, but it is unclear exactly when. \nJustice Juan Merchan's ruling also is expected after prosecutors and the defence debated on Thursday whether Mr Trump violated his gag order again. He has been fined $9,000 for previous infractions. ",

Different things like that.\"\nHe and other inmates have carried out many duties ahead of this year's event.\nSoon, the road-turned-racetrack will be ready for action.\nThe partnership between the event and Magilligan Prison began in the mid-2000s. \nThe inmates taking part are serving sentences for a range of crimes, including grievous bodily harm and drugs offences.\nMalcolm McClenaghan - the activities director at the prison - came up with the idea. \nOver the years about 150 risk-assessed inmates have worked on the North West 200 scheme, he says.\nThe prison, he adds, is very focused on pre-release and the rehabilitation of inmates.\n\"We have numerous, probably in the region of 50 or 60, partners, on the north coast.\"\nAsked about people who may think inmates should remain locked up and not involved in projects such as this, he replied: \"Everyone is entitled to that thought. This is preparing prisoners for release.\" \nHe said it puts good work back into the community that the prisoners have offended against.\nLike Malcolm, Mervyn White, chief organiser of the race and the man considered 'Mr North West 200', has been involved in the prisoner project from day one.\n\"Over the years we have never had any issues whatsoever, so the support is just essential to the running of the North West,\" he said.\n\"They come here, they enjoy the work, they enjoy the friendship. \n\"We get a cup of tea together. We sit down and discuss various things and it's an essential part of them moving on to life after serving their time in prison.\"\nOthers might be quick to point out that Mervyn's event also benefits significantly from a free workforce.\nHe said the project is \"free labour\" but the North West 200 has no paid employees and there is a huge voluntary effort required for the event to happen.\nAcross the road next to the media compound, another prisoner, Ommy, is helping to secure some metal fencing.\n\"Prison has changed me.

    "A rare dye made from snails for the robes of the Roman elite almost 2,000 years ago has been unearthed at a cricket club. \nThe chunk of Tyrian purple, roughly the size of a ping pong ball, was dug up at Carlisle Cricket Club as part of ongoing yearly excavations.\nA Roman bathhouse was discovered at the site in 2017 and in the last three years 2,000 items including pottery, weapons, coins and semi-precious stones have been found. \nLead archaeologist Frank Giecco said the find was of \"international significance\" and the first time the precious pigment had been discovered in the UK.\nMr Giecco said the pigment was worth more than gold and would have been used to dye the clothes of figures in the imperial court and the \"highest echelons\" of society. \nHe said it was made from the glands of marine snail and about 12,000 were needed to obtain less than 2g of pigment.\n\"The collection of the snails and processing of the glands would have been very time-consuming, \" Mr Giecco said, adding: \"Hence the reason it is so expensive. \n\"It was used in ancient Greek and Roman wall paintings, as well as used as a dye in textiles.\"\nThe dye, which was mixed with beeswax to preserve it, was discovered at the site in October.\nHowever, it has taken several months of chemical analysis to verify that it is purple Tyrian. \nOther finds uncovered at the site have also been described as being of international significance, including a pair of Roman god sculptures discovered in May last year and thought to date back as far as AD200.\nThe sandstone heads once formed part of sculptures standing 12 to 15 ft (3.5 to 4.5m) high.\nIn 2021, tiles with a Roman imperial stamp were uncovered indicating a link to third century Emperor Septimius Severus.\nMr Giecco said that it could not be proved that the emperor visited the Carlisle building, but that there was \"compelling evidence\" to suggest it was linked to his imperial court. \n\"The building is actually dedicated to his wife and uses a north African style of bathhouse construction - the emperor was from Libya,\" he added. \nThis year's dig, carried out by volunteers, begins on 7 May and runs until 17 June.\nThere are still a few places left for volunteers to sign up. \nFollow BBC Cumbria on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "The former head of Scotland\u2019s prosecution service has said \u201cwe\u2019re all sorry\u201d over miscarriages of justice in relation to the Post Office Horizon scandal.\nLord Mulholland was lord advocate when the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) became aware of potential problems with the software.\nHe told BBC Scotland News \u201cany miscarriage of justice is a bad thing\u201d when asked about postmasters being convicted due to faults with the Fujitsu-designed system.\nCOPFS said there was no record of Lord Mulholland taking any decisions in relation to cases that involved Horizon evidence.\nMore than 900 sub-postmasters across the UK were prosecuted for crimes such as theft because of incorrect information from the software.\nThe scandal has been described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in the UK in recent times.\nLord Mulholland served as lord advocate between 2011 and 2016.\nBBC News revealed the Crown Office was made aware of potential problems with Horizon in 2013, but prosecutors did not officially  stop pursuing cases until 2015.\nIn England the Post Office prosecuted its own cases but in Scotland COPFS had sole responsibility for taking people to court.\nThe last prosecution in Scotland took place in 2014.\nBBC News approached Lord Mulholland - who is now a judge - on Thursday, after he had given evidence at the Sheku Bayoh public inquiry in Edinburgh.\nWhen asked whether he had anything to say to the victims, he said: \u201cAny miscarriage of justice is a bad thing so if you were subject to a miscarriage of justice then we\u2019re all sorry about it, but that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got to say.\u201d\nThere were up to 60 prosecutions in Scotland between 1999 and 2015 involving Horizon evidence.\nA total of 19 people have asked for their convictions to be overturned.\nSix have been cleared so far.\nThe Scottish government is hopeful of bringing forward legislation to clear those wrongly prosecuted before the summer.\nSome of the victims\u2019 solicitors have questioned why their previously convicted clients were not told by the Crown Office about concerns with the computer system in 2015.\nLord Mulholland said BBC News \u201cwould have to ask the Crown Office about that.\u201d\nThe current Lord Advocate, Dorothy Bain KC, has previously apologised for the way those who were wrongly convicted were \u201cfailed by trusted institutions and the criminal justice system\u201d.\nShe said the COPFS was \u201crepeatedly\u201d misled by the Post Office.\nThe Crown Office has said it is determined to ensure that all miscarriages of justice resulting from unreliable Horizon evidence are identified and overturned.\nA spokesperson said: \u201cIt was not until the decisions by the courts in England and Wales in 2019 and 2021 that the full extent of the bugs and errors in Horizon became known. Until that point, Post Office maintained that the Horizon system was reliable and safe.\u201d\nThey added: \u201cThe Post Office told COPFS in 2013 that its external lawyers had reviewed all potentially impacted Scottish cases and had found no issues.\n\u201cAs at 2015 COPFS was not provided with further evidence which was promised by Post Office to demonstrate that Horizon was as robust as they suggested.\u202fCOPFS therefore decided to no longer rely on Horizon until such time as that further evidence was provided by Post Office.\u201d\nIn relation to the role of Lord Mulholland as former head of the service, the spokesperson said:\n\"In her statement to the Scottish Parliament in January, Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain KC confirmed that there is no record of Lord Mulholland taking any decisions in relation to cases that involved Horizon evidence.\"\nA Post Office spokesperson previously said: \u201cWe are deeply sorry for past wrongs and are doing all we can to put these right, including extensive work to support overturning wrongful convictions. \n\"This work includes assisting the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.\u201d",

    "They have never played at the national stadium, but Solihull Moors are preparing to visit Wembley twice in six days. With the prospect of silverware, promotion or potentially both on the horizon, the BBC caught up with supporters and locals. \nLast month, football fan Dean Smith used the word \"dreamland\" to describe the prospect of Solihull Moors reaching Wembley Stadium for the first time.\nThe Moors season ticket holder spoke as his beloved non-league side booked their spot in the FA Trophy final against Gateshead on 11 May. \nBut despite what he dubbed an incredible season, even he didn't expect what happened next.\nAgainst the odds Moors - founded in 2007 - produced two outstanding results in what were supposed to be tricky games just three days apart. \nEight goals against Halifax Town and Barnet saw the fifth-ranked National League club clinch a place in Sunday's play-off final. \nIt means Mr Smith will be visiting Wembley twice in the space of a week.\nHe could even be watching his side compete in the English Football League next season if they can edge past Bromley in the battle for promotion. \n\"It's beyond our wildest dreams,\" he said. \"It feels like once in a lifetime. \n\"This will never happen again. Success can be short and you've got to enjoy it while you can.\"\nThe 44-year-old, who also has a Birmingham City season ticket, once saw Moors as his second team. \nBut he fell in love with the non-league outfit about three years ago and believes it will soon be a League Two club. \n\"We've flown under the radar all season,\" Mr Smith added. \n\"I think teams underestimate us. We've proven we can beat the best in the league.\" \nThe club was formed when Moor Green merged with Solihull Borough in July 2007 and has punched above its weight for a number of years. \nAfter making it to the fifth tier in 2016, there was pride and heartbreak two years ago as Moors suffered a play-off final defeat to Grimsby Town at West Ham's London Stadium.\nBut as the club grows, so to will questions over how bosses can keep locals on side.\nOne resident, who lives near Moors' ARMCO Arena but didn't want to give his name, said the club's ascent was \"the worst thing that had happened\", because his road becomes a car park on match days. \nLeanne Hughes, 50, who works as a hairdresser about 10 minutes away, said she had also heard people vent over traffic, parking and how busy the area can get. \nShe urged the club to \"go and smash it\", but agreed it needed to keep its neighbours in mind. \n\"I see a lot of people on match days walking past in crowds,\" Ms Hughes said. \n\"It's a nice community feeling when something is doing well in your area.\"\nAlex Manners, a Moors fan since the club was established, explained he thought the infrastructure was in place for it to take the next step. \n\"To go to Wembley once is amazing enough, but to go twice in the space of a week is just unbelievable,\" he said. \n\"Two years ago, I wouldn't have said the ground is ready but now I think it's definitely ready for League Two football.\" \nThe 27-year-old said the area would be proud of the club and players regardless of results in London. \n\"It means so much to the fans,\" he said. \"We know whatever happens they have tried their hardest.\" \nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X, and Instagram, Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk",

about 21:50 BST, police said.\nIn a statement, Mr Gaitatzis described Mr Moore, who was 19, as \"a pleasant young man\", who \"always tried to help the pupils and staff around him\".\n\"He showed genuine kindness to others and he engaged positively with many school events offering his time to give a helping hand to the school community and beyond,\" he said.\nMr Moore joined Omagh High School in 2016 and completed his GCSE's, leaving school in 2021.\nMr Gaitatzis said he was \"a great athlete and he demonstrated his athletic skills very well in our sports days\". \nHe was also described as a \"good footballer\" who \"helped the school to win in the football pitch\".\nMr Gaitatzis added that the school community was \"devastated with the news\".\n\"We want to extend our thoughts and prayers to Jamie's family for their loss such a kind young man.\n\"He will be remembered fondly for his kindness and pleasant manner.\"\nThe other victim, Kamile Vaicikonyte, was a pupil at St Ciaran's College in County Tyrone.\n\"Kamile was a lovely girl, she had a lovely smile,\" her principal, Paul Lavery told BBC News NI. \"There's a big cloud over the school today.\"\nThe headmaster added that on the day before the fatal crash, Kamile had taken part in demonstration at her school to remember people who have died on the A5.\nSt Ciaran's College in Ballygawley was supporting a campaign calling for safety upgrades to the route. \n\"It's just awful to think that 24 hours later she has lost her life on the same road,\" Mr Lavery said, adding that had \"heightened the tragedy\". \nStormont's Infrastructure Minister John O'Dowd has offered his \"heartfelt condolences\" to the families.\nHe is to meet police to discuss \"serious road safety concerns\" on the A5.\nThe principal also offered his \"heartfelt sympathy\" to Kamile's family and friends, saying people connected to the Ballygawley school were \"really distraught about what has happened\". \n\"Of course we're all extremely shocked and continue to be shocked and saddened,\" Mr Lavery said.\n\"There's a big cloud over the school today, but I would like to thank the community for all their support, and everyone who has tried to help us in this very, very difficult time.\"\nHe described Kamile as a quiet pupil but added that \"once the teachers got to know her she was very bubbly and just loved having fun and particularly enjoyed having fun with her friends\". \n\"She was a very important part of our school community, someone who had talked about her hopes and dreams for the future, which included going to university.\n\"I know she had done a placement in one of our local primary schools, so she may have been considering doing teaching in the future as well.\"\nThe principal also thanked the Education Authority's critical team \"who have come out very quickly and helped to support our pupils\". \nMr Lavery said his school has been \"very much impacted by road traffic accidents\" and the latest deaths had brought back memories for many people in the area.\n\"You can't get to St Ciaran's really without using the A5,\" he explained, adding it was a source of ongoing

Policing Board meeting on Thursday, Chief Constable Jon Boutcher said officers would be meeting Mr O'Dowd in June to \"discuss all proactive measures possible\" regarding the A5.\n\"We will very much meet the infrastructure minister and we will do anything and everything within our power to make sure, whether it's speed reduction or increased visibility, that we do our part in preventing these tragedies from occurring again,\" he said. \nMr Boutcher said a pressing issue in tackling the high number of road deaths was that they are working with fewer officers. \nHe said that 21 officers had been cut from the road safety team and they needed to be \"creative\" and work collaboratively with partner agencies in order to effectively tackle this. \n\"Nothing is off the table to address this epidemic on our roads,\" Jon Boutcher said. \nMore than 50 people have been killed on the road since 2006 with upgrade work hit by a series of delays and legal challenges.\nThe demonstration at St

    "Italy\u2019s Ministry of Health has banned \u201cpuppy yoga\u201d classes, saying only adult dogs should take part in order to protect the health of animals as well as the safety of attendees. \nIn a note circulated on 29 April, the ministry said it was aware that organisers often \"borrow\" puppies from breeders. \nBut because puppy yoga \"improves wellbeing\" it should be considered as a kind of \"animal assisted therapy\" - which by law can only be carried out by fully grown animals. \nPuppy yoga typically involves puppies roaming freely around a yoga class and sometimes being incorporated in yoga poses, or a yoga class followed by playtime with the puppies.\nThe ministry asked regional authorities to carry out checks to ensure puppy yoga classes do not take place.\nIn a statement, Italy's National Board for Animal Protection welcomed the decision.\nIt quoted dog expert Giusy D'Angelo as saying that puppy yoga was a \"physically and mentally stressful experience\" for the animals.\nShe also said that attendees risked getting carried away and adopting the animals.\n\"People are overtaken by a wave of emotion after experiencing sensations of well-being from the close proximity to the puppies,\" Ms D'Angelo said. \n\"This can lead them to make a decision without really thinking through the implications and the consequences.\"\nShe also warned the puppies used in the yoga classes are often not transported in a safe manner. Organisers sometimes do not give them enough water to drink, she said.\n\"This type of activity is detrimental to the dogs' wellbeing and only brings financial advantages to those who run the classes,\" Ms D'Angelo added.\nLast July, the UK's Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) urged people to consider alternative activities to puppy yoga.\nWhile organisers claim the puppies enjoy the socialising involved in the ancient Indian art, \"there is nothing in the environment which we would consider to be beneficial to... these animals.\"\nPuppy yoga classes are popular across Europe and the US.

To see him captain Ipswich and getting on so well is great. I like to see people do well who deserve to. \n\"I hope everything goes well for Sammy. I didn't really want him to leave. Sam wasn't sure about going to Ipswich, but I told him it's a good club, and he'll enjoy living there.\n\"It's worked out really well, he's a top player and top person.\"\nWarnock said it had been a high quality Championship this season and predicted it would not be plain sailing for Ipswich against Huddersfield.\nThe league table means a single point against Huddersfield at Portman Road would make the Tractor Boys uncatchable by their closest rivals Leeds United, who host fourth placed Southampton at Elland Road. \n\"There's no easy games,\" he said. \"It's not a formality, and you can expect things to go smoothly but it never does in the Championship.\n\"Ipswich should win, but Huddersfield could beat anyone on their day. \n\"It won't be straight forward, nothing ever is.

    "The investment bank Goldman Sachs has become the first to remove its cap on bankers' bonuses following changes to UK laws introduced last year.\nThe bank said this would give \"greater flexibility\" and was closer to what happens in other big financial centres such as Singapore and New York.\nBonuses were limited to twice basic pay in a move introduced by the EU in 2014. \nOther big banks are thought to be considering a similar moves.\nThe limit on bankers' bonuses was introduced by the EU in 2014 despite British opposition, to try to discourage the kind of excessive risk-taking that contributed to the 2008 great financial crisis. \nCritics argued that banks were able to get round it by simply increasing base salaries. This then made it harder to reduce salaries when bankers performed badly, or claw back pay if misconduct came to light. \nWhen it brought in the changes, the Financial Conduct Authority said the change should remove these \"unintended consequences\". \nThe decision was first announced by Kwasi Kwarteng during his brief stint as chancellor in 2022, in a bid to boost the competitiveness of London as a financial centre.\nBanks have argued that the bonus cap makes it harder to attract talent from the US and Asia to the UK. \nGoldman Sachs said in a statement: \"This approach gives us greater flexibility to manage fixed costs through the cycle and pay for performance. It brings the UK closer to the practice in other global financial centres, to support the UK as an attractive venue for talent.\"\nA number of other banks have reportedly been reviewing their pay policies in the light of the changes. \nWhen the decision to remove the bonus cap was announced last year, the Trades Union Congress general secretary Paul Nowak called it an \"insult to working people\" when \"millions up and down the country are struggling to make ends meet.\"\nThe change will not be universally welcomed by bankers, some of whom prefer to receive more of their income as guaranteed basic pay rather than bonuses which depend on their performance.

    "The UK economy will see the slowest growth of the largest developed nations next year, according to forecasts. \nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) predicted that UK gross domestic product - a key measure of economic health - will rise by 1% in 2025.\nThis is below the rest of the G7 nations, which include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US.\nThe OECD, which is a globally recognised think tank, said the UK economy would be \u201csluggish\u201d this year.\nThe organisation blamed the after-effects of a succession of interest rate rises in the UK for the lethargic performance.   \nIt also warned that some elements of inflation remained high and that uncertainty over when the Bank of England might change interest rates might put people off investing.\nThe UK economy is now forecast to expand by 0.4% this year, a downgrade from the OECD's previous projection for 0.7% growth.\nIt means that for this year only Germany will see slower growth, it said.\n\nThe OECD predicted that tax receipts in the UK would \"keep rising to historic highs\" of about 37% of GDP\". \nThe government has cut National Insurance twice since last year, totalling a 4% reduction. But the OECD said this \"only partially offsets the ongoing fiscal drag from frozen personal income tax thresholds\".\nFiscal drag means that as a person's salary rises, they can move into a higher income tax bracket.\nThe organisation also said that a government scheme to allow businesses to deduct the full cost of investing in machinery and equipment from their tax bill does \"less than fully compensate\" for an increase in corporation tax which rose from 19% to 25% this time last year. \nBut the OECD said that in the long-run these measures, as well as the government's free childcare scheme, \"could help to lower fiscal pressure\".\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt said the OECD's forecast showed the UK was \"winning the war\" against inflation.\n\"This forecast is not particularly surprising given our priority for the last year has been to tackle inflation with higher interest rates\", he wrote, adding that  \"growth matters\".\nBut Darren Jones, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"Today\u2019s news that growth has been downgraded again reminds the British people what they already know: after 14 years of failure, the Conservatives cannot fix the economy because they are the reason it is broken.\"\nMeanwhile, the Liberal Democrats accused the government of being \"economically illiterate\".\n\"Their no-growth policies have left the public enduring sky-high mortgage rates, the price of a weekly shop going through the roof, and stealth taxes hammering both pensioners and working people,\" said Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, Sarah Olney.\nThe Bank of England, which is independent from the government, sets interest rates and has a target to keep inflation at or close to 2%. \nInflation - which measures the pace of price rises - has slowed significantly from a 40-year high it reached in October 2022 to 3.2% in April. \nInterest rates have been held at 5.25% since last September. The OECD expects the Bank to start cutting borrowing costs from this autumn. \nThe think tank predicted that interest rates could fall to 3.75% by the end of next year.\nThe forecasts aim to give a guide to what is most likely to happen in the future, but can be incorrect and do change.\nThey are used by businesses to help plan investments, and by governments to guide policy decisions.\n",
    "Post Office investigators saw sub-postmasters as \"enemies\", according to a 2014 draft report by forensic accountants.\nThis was part of an \"adversarial\" approach by the company at the time, a former top Post Office lawyer has conceded at an inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal.\nThe Post Office security team also failed to link various reports by sub-postmasters of faults in accounting software, the report said.\nChris Aujard, a former top lawyer at the group, was quizzed about why he did not take action on the findings. \nBetween 1999 and 2015 hundreds of sub-postmasters were prosecuted by the Post Office for offences including theft and false accounting on the strength of the faulty Horizon software.\nOn Thursday, the long running inquiry into the scandal was shown the draft report by Ron Warmington of accountancy firm Second Sight which raised serious concerns about Post Office investigations into sub-postmasters.\nIt said that investigators \"often appear to have paid scant attention\" to sub-postmasters who told them that they were innocent of fraud, or pointed out anomalies in transactions.\n\"They [investigators] seem to have shown little or no willingness to establish the underlying root cause of any given shortfall,\" the report said.\nThis seemed to stem from a desire to \"get the money back\" from the sub-postmasters, \"knowing that a false accounting convictions will provide a relatively inexpensive pathway to that goal\", it said.\n\"The overwhelming impression gained from reviewing the transcripts of investigative interviews is that the sub-postmaster was viewed as an enemy of the business,\" the report added.\nThe investigations team seemed to presume that sub-postmasters were automatically guilty, rather than \"seeking the truth\", the report said.\nBy failing to investigate what the sub-postmasters had been saying, or even to take proper notice of them, \"the investigators have alienated all of them\", it said.\n\"It is that group (the sub-postmasters who evidently still believe themselves not only to be innocent but also to have been cheated by the Post Office) who really have become enemies of the business,\" the report added.\nMr Aujard, who was general counsel at the Post Office from 2013 to 2015, said that \"this is a specific case of a specific team allegedly behaving in a certain way... and I do agree, this reads as though that team is adopting an adversarial approach to their investigation\".\nBut he said a caveat was that the accountants writing the report had not interviewed the investigators themselves, but had written the report based on transcripts of sub-postmaster interviews by the investigators.\nFlora Page, a lawyer acting for Horizon victims, said the 2014 draft report had raised \"serious concerns over past prosecutions\" and had \"demanded immediate action to make sure it was properly understood\".\nShe asked whether immediate action had been taken.\nMr Aujard said: \"My view at the time was that given it was marked as a draft document, and heavily caveated, it was something that would have required investigation in due course, had I been at the Post Office for longer.\"\nThe chair of the inquiry, Sir Wyn Williams, asked what had happened with the document.\nMr Aujard replied: \u201cMy recollection is that I would have read it at the time and put it to one side and that would have informed my thinking more fully about the organisation that I\u2019d just joined. Beyond that, I can\u2019t say I took any further action, or I can\u2019t recollect taking any further action, in relation to this document.\u201d\nSeparately, inquiry counsel Julian Blake questioned lawyer Martin Smith, who used to work for Post Office advisers Cartwright King, about disclosure of Horizon bugs.\nMr Smith gave evidence that he had alerted Cartwright King in 2013 to alleged instructions from Post Office head of security John Scott to shred documents relating to the scandal to prevent disclosure in court \u2013 allegations that Mr Scott has refuted.\nQuestioning then turned to a request by the then-Post Office general counsel Rodric Williams in May 2016 for there to be \u201cno email traffic\u201d in discussions about a Horizon bug that affected the Wimbledon branch and could have been more than a decade old at that point.\nAt the time, sub-postmasters were taking the Post Office to court in a no-win, no-fee class action.\nMr Williams was concerned that \u201cthis matter is subject to the group action and data could be disclosable\u201d.\nMr Smith said he understood that this was to prevent \u201cincorrect information entering the public domain\u201d if there were a trawl of emails that contained speculation.\nTowards the end of the session Sam Stein KC who represents former sub-postmasters asked Mr Smith why he did not inform police when he witnessed former Fujitsu employee Gareth Jenkins failing to disclose material to the courts.\nAfter a long pause Mr Smith said: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nGareth Jenkins was the former chief IT architect of the Horizon system.

    "Sign-ups for weight loss drug Wegovy jumped five-fold in the US in the first three months of the year, reaching a rate of more than 25,000 a week, maker Novo Nordisk has said. \nThe surge reflects scorching demand for the medicine which, alongside sister diabetes drug Ozempic, has been hailed as revolutionary and helped to transform Novo Nordisk into one of Europe's most valuable companies.\nBut the drugs giant is facing new pressures, as the high price of such medicines comes under scrutiny in the US and rival offerings emerge from competitor Eli Lilly.\nIn a quarterly update for investors, the firm said it had cut prices in the US in the first three months of the year.\nIt said prices for Wegovy and Ozempic would continue to fall in the months ahead.\nBut overall sales are still expected to grow by as much as 27% this year, up slightly from earlier forecasts, despite the price cuts and other supply constraints. \n\"With the volume opportunity we have at hand, that significantly outweighs what we see in terms of lower price points,\" chief executive Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen said. \nHe attributed the price fall in part to the firm pushing to reach more \"vulnerable\" corners of the market. \nIn all, Novo Nordisk said its diabetes and weight loss drugs served almost 42 million patients globally at the end of March. \nThe US, where about 40% of adults are obese and more than 10% are estimated to have diabetes, represents by far the biggest market for the company. \nBut the high price of the drugs has prompted many health insurance plans in the US - including Medicare, the government plan for seniors - to restrict access.\nLast month, Senator Bernie Sanders launched an investigation into the issue, noting that Novo Nordisk lists a monthly price of $1,349 (\u00a31,078) for Wegovy in the US, whilst in the UK it can be purchased privately from around \u00a3140, and less for medical professionals.\nMr Jorgenson acknowledged that demand for the treatments was \"putting strains on health care systems\".\nBut he said he expected the firm would be able to convince regulators of the benefits of the drugs, which was also recently approved to treat heart disease.\n\"I'm optimistic about how we can communicate the value to health care systems of these interventions. I'm very optimistic about the underlying willingness among both patients and physicians to use these medicines,\" he said. \nSo far, the biggest struggle Novo Nordisk has faced is keeping up with demand. \nIt has spent recent years scrambling to try to expand its manufacturing capacity, investing in new factories.\nThe five-fold jump in Wegovy prescriptions in the US since December is a sign that those issues are easing, said chief financial officer Karsten Munk Knudsen.\n\"Clearly that is a sign of supply chains operating and running and building inventories and supplying the market,\" he said. \"You should see that as confidence in scaling.\" \nOzempic was approved for sale in the US in 2017, and in 2018 in the EU. Wegovy followed in the US in 2021, and in the European Union in 2022.\n",
    "John Cleese has said catering for \"literal-minded\" audience members is \"always a problem\" with comedy.\nThe writer and actor was speaking at the launch of a stage adaptation of Fawlty Towers, which is about to open in London. \nCleese acknowledged that some lines of dialogue have been removed due to changing societal expectations.\nBut he said comedy writing is generally more difficult because of viewers who \"don't understand metaphor, irony, or comic exaggeration\".\nCleese has merged three of the most popular episodes of Fawlty Towers into one over-arching narrative for the two-hour play.\nThey are Communication Problems, The Hotel Inspectors and the more controversial episode The Germans.\n\"There was a scene where the major used a couple of words you can't use now, racial slurs, so we took that out,\" Cleese told journalists on Thursday.\nBut he added that writers are also \"up against\" people who interpret jokes literally, sometimes not allowing for a scene's tone or set-up.\n\"You see, there's always a problem with comedy that you deal with the literal-minded,\" Cleese said.\n\"I remind you of Till Death Us Do Part,\" Cleese said, referring to the Alf Garnett, the lead character of the1960s sitcom who would regularly make highly offensive comments.\n\"People were roaring with laughter at him, not with him. But there were also people saying ' thank God these things are being said at last'.\n\"So whenever you're doing comedy, you're up against the literal-minded. And the literal-minded don't understand irony, so that means if you take them seriously, you get rid of a lot of comedy, because the literal-minded don't understand metaphor, irony, comic exaggeration. \n\"And the result is, if you listen to them, these are people who are not, so far as understanding what human beings are saying and doing, they're not playing with a full deck. \n\"Literal-minded people can only have one interpretation of what's being said. People who are not literal-minded can see there are different interpretations depending on different contexts.\"\nHis comments come four years after The Germans was temporarily removed from some streaming services and reinstated with a warning about \"offensive content and language\".\nThe cast of the stage adaptation of Fawlty Towers performed two scenes for journalists at Thursday's press launch. \nBoth extracts were almost entirely faithful to their original TV scripts, with few changes made or new jokes added.\nAsked by BBC News if he was worried that some of the jokes have become so famous that they might lose some of their comedic impact, Cleese noted that the stage show would evolve and change as the cast began to understand the theatre audiences and improvise new sections.\n\"We kept the best stuff, the best scenes, and the more [the actors] play it, the more they will invent new stuff,\" Cleese said.\n\"And when people see the show when it opens, if they came eight weeks later, they'd be very surprised at how different it is, because people react and start playing with it.\"\nHe added: \"I think it will be tremendous, but it'll be tremendous in June, once [the cast] have figured out where the laughs are and exactly how to play them.\"\nAlthough some of the more contentious language has been removed, the principal characters and the physical violence Cleese sometimes directs towards them remain intact. \nIn the stage show, Basil (played by Adam Jackson-Fox) is seen trying to restrain a guest who starts complaining about the service in front of someone Basil suspects is a hotel inspector.\nHe is also seen slapping Manuel and hitting him on the head with a hard spoon, but it's clear a lot of thought has gone into staging such moves safely.\nIn contrast, the late Andrew Sachs, who originally played Manuel, previously recalled being physically injured by some of Basil's actions.\nWriting in the Telegraph last week, Cleese defended the character of Manuel against suggestions that a useless Spanish waiter (who was being played by an English actor) was an offensive 1970s stereotype.\nCleese said: \"Manuel was simply a character with whom there could be constant misunderstandings and I\u2019ve always found misunderstandings to be very funny.\"\nThe two-hour play was previously staged in Australia, but this is the first time it has come to the West End.\nSet in a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, Fawlty Towers followed an irritable hotel owner who was frequently rude to demanding guests.\nIn the play, Basil will be seen attempting to be unusually courteous to guests following a tip-off that inspectors may be visiting hotels in the area.\nBut his plans are disrupted by a party of German guests and a particularly challenging customer, Mrs Richards.\nAsked how he had gone about merging the three episodes, which will bring together all three endings, Cleese said: \"It's what I call carpentry. \n\"We chose Mrs Richards because everyone loves that, it's a wonderful character. And we chose [The Hotel Inspectors] and then of course we had to do the",
    "A blue plaque has been unveiled to commemorate the 18th Century engraver and cartographer Thomas Kitchin.\nIt has been mounted on the wall of 7, Fishpool Street, St Albans, where he spent his retirement and died in 1784.\nIt was presented by Blue Plaques St Albans (BPSA), which honours notable people who lived and worked in the city.\nProfessor Tim Boatswain, BPSA chairman, said Kitchin was \"a prolific and exceptionally talented engraver, who produced hundreds of maps during his lifetime\".\nBorn in Southwark, London, in 1717, Kitchin was apprenticed to map engraver Emanuel Bowen before working independently.\nKitchin's firm produced engraved materials, including portraits and caricatures, but he is best known for engravings of maps, which were used to make prints.\nHe produced the first pocket atlas of Scotland in about 1748. The Large English Atlas, which he worked on with his old master Bowen, was finished in 1760.\nIt was thought to be \"the first real attempt to cover the whole country on a large scale\", Prof Boatswain said.\n\n\"He was very prolific. He produced more than 170 maps,\" he added.\n\"His real ability was the engraving. He had that technical facility to do good etching and lettering and was sought after by the people who did the leg work.\n\"His real skill was actually to be able to convert that [information] and engrave it to publish proper maps.\"\nKitchin, who is buried in the city's cathedral, engraved one of the earliest maps of America. In 1773 he became royal mapmaker to King George III.\nOf Kitchin's time in St Albans, Prof Boatswain said: \"I guess it was a nice little place to come and retire.\"\nLittle is known about his life in the city, but his will, which requested burial \"with as little expense as may be\", revealed his modesty.\nKitchin's was the 12th plaque put up by BPSA, a voluntary organisation.

    "The US has accused Russia of deploying chemical weapons as a \"method of warfare\" in Ukraine, in violation of international laws banning their use.\nState department officials said Russia used the choking agent chloropicrin to win \"battlefield gains\" over Ukraine. \nThe allegations, which US officials said were not an \"isolated\" incident, would contravene the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which Russia signed.\nThe Kremlin rejected the accusations, calling them \"baseless\". \nSpokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow that Russia stood by its obligations under the CWC, which prohibits states from developing or acquiring new weapons. Some 193 states have ratified the convention. \nThe Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), a global watchdog that oversees implementation of the CWC, says a chemical weapon is a substance used to cause intentional death or harm through its toxic properties.\nChloropicrin - which the US says Russia has used to \"dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions\" - is an oily substance which was widely used during World War One. It causes irritation of the lungs, eyes and skin and can cause vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea, according to the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC). \nThe chemical's use in war is expressly banned under the CWC, and is listed as a choking agent by the OPCW. \nThe state department also said Moscow had regularly used \"riot control agents,\" or tear gas, during the war. \nPresident Joe Biden has previously warned Russia against deploying chemical weapons in Ukraine. In March 2022, weeks after Moscow launched its invasion, Mr Biden vowed that President Vladimir Putin would pay a \"severe price\" if he did authorise the use of chemical weapons. \n\"We would respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use,\" Mr Biden said.\nBut there have been consistent reports that Moscow has ignored that warning. US Assistant Secretary for Arms Control Mallory Stewart has previously said Russia was using riot control agents in the conflict.\nAnd Ukraine says its troops have faced mounting chemical attacks in recent months. The Reuters news agency reported earlier this year that Russian forces had used grenades loaded with CS and CN tear gases. \nThe report added that at least 500 Ukrainian soldiers have been treated for exposure to toxic gases, and that one had died after suffocating on tear gas. \nThree Russian bodies linked to the country's biological and chemical weapons programme were sanctioned by the state department for their links to the production of chemical agents. Other firms that contributed to the government entities were also sanctioned. \nIn 2017, the OPCW said Russia had destroyed the last of its Cold War-era stockpile of the weapons, as required under the CWC. \nBut Moscow has since been accused of making incomplete declarations of its stockpile, according to the UK's House of Commons library.\nSince 2017, Russia has been accused of at least two chemical attacks - the Salisbury attack on a former Soviet intelligence officer and the 2020 poisoning of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. \nThe allegations come as part of a broader tranche of US sanctions which targeted 30 individuals, including three people officials say were involved in Navalny's death.\nThe men are all officials at the Siberian prison colony where the opposition activist died earlier this year. Russia denies involvement in the opposition leader's death. Navalny's widow has accused President Putin of killing him.\nMeanwhile, Russian forces in eastern Ukraine have continued their steady advance ahead of Victory Day celebrations on 9 May - the holiday commemorating Soviet victory in World War Two. \nMuch of the fighting has been taking place around Chasiv Yar, a Kyiv-controlled stronghold which Russia has been trying to reach after seizing the city of Avdiivka. It is thought Moscow wants to seize the town ahead of next week's celebrations. \nIt comes as President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed the head of Ukraine's Security Service's (SBU) cyber-security department, Illya Vityuk, amid allegations that he tried to use his position to punish a Ukrainian journalist who had reported on allegations of corruption against him. \nThe reporter was subsequently summoned to a military recruitment centre, prompting military chief Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi to launch an investigation. \nElsewhere, Human Rights Watch - a non-governmental organisation - has called for a war crimes investigation after it unearthed evidence that Russian forces executed over a dozen surrendering Ukrainian troops. The events allegedly occurred between December 2023 and February 2024, the body said in a statement. ",

    "Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie wants to meet the head of the NI Civil Service to discuss revelations about a \"radical\" idea to replace Robin Swann during the Covid crisis.\nThe detail was contained in documents published by the UK Covid Inquiry which is currently sitting in Belfast.\nIt was suggested that Mr Swann could be moved to give the larger Stormont parties control over the health brief.\nDoug Beattie described the idea as \"incredibly bizarre\".\nHe also said it called into question the impartiality of the civil service.\nThe civil servant who floated the idea was Hugh Widdis who at the time was senior legal advisor to the Executive. He is now permanent secretary at the Department of Justice.\nThe idea - which he recognised was \"radical\" and may not be \"palatable\" - was to ask Mr Swann to take on a different ministry during the pandemic to allow a DUP or Sinn F\u00e9in politician to take on the key role in health.\nThe context was an email exchange between civil servants in the early days of the pandemic, at the end of March 2020, when ministers were working out how best to deal with the developing public health crisis.\nAn email from the then head of the civil service, David Sterling, to fellow officials quoted the then deputy first minister Michelle O'Neill telling him \"we need to be driving this crisis, we need to be in control\".\nDoug Beattie told BBC News: \"The fact it was even considered. The fact it was even talked about is quite bizarre.\n\"But it tells you what is the mentality. And remember this as well, the same senior civil servant was part of the workstreams for getting government up and running again. The same civil servant is part of the budget negotiations that are going through now. They can all be linked so for us to get confidence in where we are with the civil service it is really important I speak to the head of the civil service.\"\nAt the time Mr Sterling wrote: \"She [Michelle O'Neill] is clearly frustrated with being a first minister but actually having little power or influence over the health service.\n\"FM [Arlene Foster] is more circumspect, recognising the 'operational independence' of the health minister.\n\"Though she too is frustrated at the lack of information coming out of DoH (Department of Health) coupled with frequent surprises eg today's announcement that hospital visits are to end.\"\nIt was in response to this email that Mr Widdis, made his reshuffle suggestion, amid a range of different proposals.\nHe wrote: \"There would be more radical options but I presume that they aren't palatable eg: asking Robin to take a different portfolio for the duration (they would have to make a tempting offer) and putting a SF or DUP Minister in?\n\"Or causing dHondt to be run again.\"\nThe Executive Office has been approached for comment.\nMr Widdis also had other less radical suggestions, like developing an emergency programme for government, or creating \"an all-Exec overarching Covid strategy\" which the first and deputy first ministers \"can lead and own\".\nMr Swann remained as health minister during the pandemic, and recently returned to the job when devolution was restored earlier this year.\nAs part of the same exchange of emails between civil servants, Karen Pearson, from the Executive Office, pointed out that ministers were still finding their feet after the recent resumption of devolution.\nAmong her observations were that \"ministers are just back\u2026 a new ministerial team\u2026 a real crisis which they can not control and it is scaring them\".\nIn his email at the end of March, Sir David raised another issue.\nHe said the deputy first minister \"revealed what has been increasingly clear with Sinn F\u00e9in ministers in recent days is a growing fear of being held corporately responsible, or liable, if things go badly wrong\".\nHe added: \"We need to find a way to get them off this hook.\n\"If it becomes clear that their main priority is to lay out an audit trail and avoid any future blame then everyone else will do the same thing.\n\"And we'll be paralysed.\"\nThe email was sent just after 21:00 on Thursday, 26 March, 2020.\nHe ended the note saying: \"Need to sleep on these two challenges.\"",

    "Why a man died hours after being released from police custody remains unknown after the jury in his inquest delivered an open conclusion.\nMohamud Hassan, 24, died in a flat on Newport Road, Cardiff in January 2021.\nHe had been arrested the previous night on suspicion of an alleged breach of the peace.\nBut an inquest held in Pontypridd heard no medical cause of death could be established, and no \"acts or omissions\u201d by police contributed to it.\nAn Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation into the actions of South Wales Police during the arrest and detention of Mr Hassan also found no evidence that officers caused or contributed to his death.\nDuring the inquest, the jury was told Mr Hassan spent much of the day after his arrest \u201cchilling and smoking cannabis\u201d before going to bed feeling unwell at 17:00 GMT.\nA friend went to wake him at 22:00 and found him unresponsive.\nParamedics were unable to revive him and concluded he had been dead for some time.\nBodycam footage showed him shouting \u201cI cannot breathe\u201d, whilst officers replied that he could and that no pressure had been applied to his neck.\nThe court heard he spat at officers and was uncooperative during his arrest.\nA sergeant in the custody unit was later cleared of gross misconduct over an allegation of unnecessary use of force.\nMr Hassan\u2019s aunt and uncle told the inquest they saw him after he had been released from custody and urged him to get medical help, saying he \u201chad significant injuries\u201d and it \u201clooked like he had been beaten with a belt\u201d.  \nIn the weeks after his death, hundreds of people attended protests, claiming he was assaulted in custody.\nThey marched to the station in Cardiff Bay holding placards, and faced warnings regarding gatherings during lockdown restrictions.\nThe inquest jury was told Mr Hassan had struggled during his arrest, but Coroner Graeme Hughes said there was no evidence injury played a part in his death. \nMr Hughes instructed the jury at Pontypridd to reach an open conclusion - meaning there was insufficient evidence to decide how Mr Hassan died.\nMr Hughes said \u201con the balance of probabilities, the evidence does not reveal how the death arose\u201d.\nHe also told the jury that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d to support a finding that any \u201cacts or omissions\u201d of the police or medical professionals contributed to Mr Hassan\u2019s death.\nThe jury concluded the \u201ccircumstances were due to an unknown medical event\u201d.\nSpeaking after the inquest, Mr Hassan's family said in a statement \"our hearts remain broken\".\nThey said they understood than an open conclusion was the only option for the jury, but added it \"does not help us heal\".\n\"We miss Mohamud every day, our family is missing a bright light and the hole his death leaves in our family can never be filled.\"\nAn investigation by the IOPC found that \"the evidence did not support the assertion that Mr Hassan was treated less favourably by officers because of his race, or that he had been assaulted by officers\".\nIt added there was no evidence police actions contributed to Mr Hassan's death.\nBut some areas of learning were identified for South Wales Police, which the IOPC said had been accepted by the force.\nThey included that there was an \"overall lack of respect and care in the way some officers treated Mr Hassan during his arrest, transport and detention\".\nAssistant Chief Constable Joanna Maal said: \u201cWe can only imagine how difficult this period of time has been for Mohamud Hassan\u2019s family and the pain and grief that they have endured since his death.\n\u201cThis case has been the subject of much independent and public scrutiny.\n\"Now that the facts have been published and heard during the inquest proceedings we hope that answers have been provided to the many questions raised.\u201d",

    "The SDLP is set to change how it appoints \"civil leadership\" positions after two councillors resigned over a mayoral selection process.\nThe Derry City and Strabane District Council representatives quit the party after Lilian Seenoi-Barr was selected as its next mayor.\nIn an internal email, seen by BBC News NI, the SDLP said it will propose an amendment at its next annual general meeting (AGM) to \"regularise the process\".\nMs Seenoi-Barr is set to make history as the first black mayor in Northern Ireland.\nBut the process surrounding her selection was criticised by some party members at the time as \"undemocratic\".\nIt resulted in councillors Jason Barr, the current deputy mayor, and Shauna Cusack, who both put themselves forward for the role, resigning from the party.\nThey will both continue as independents.\nMs Seenoi-Barr defended her selection for the role by saying it was \"an open process\".\n\"I was selected after a very robust interview that all three candidates went through,\" she said.\nIn an email sent to all party members on Thursday from SDLP headquarters, a party spokesperson said: \"We are so proud that councillor Seenoi-Barr will be the next mayor of Derry and Strabane.\"\nThe email goes on to say the party recognises there had been \"some confusion, annoyance and, unfortunately, misinformation about the process\".\nThe party said it apologised for the \"failures in communicating the process to members, the upset this has caused and that it has reflected poorly on a positive selection\".\nThe email said that the SDLP's constitution contains \"no specific guidance\" on mayoral appointments and these decisions are often made within council groups.\n\"Following feedback from members, the management committee will propose an amendment to the party constitution to regularise the process for the appointment of representatives to positions of civil leadership across the party at the next AGM,\" it added.\nThe party said \"we deeply regret that this selection has been associated with negativity, apologise sincerely for shortcomings in communication and hope that all members will support the incoming mayor going forward\".\nThe SDLP has been contacted by BBC News NI for comment.\nMeanwhile, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said Ms Seenoi-Barr has in recent days \u201cfaced an enormous deluge of abuse from around the world\u201d including \"some very serious death threats\".\nSeveral Stormont politicians had already condemned online racist abuse she had received following the mayoral announcement.\nSpeaking on Friday, Mr Eastwood, who is also the Foyle MP, added: \u201cThis kind of stuff is allowed to happen actually because politicians do not mind their language.\n\u201cI think all of us have to be very careful about that, whether it\u2019s on this island or whether it is in the government in London\u201d.\nHe said it was important to stand united against racism.\n\u201cWe will not be led into the gutter by far right activists whether they are coming from America, Dublin or Derry online,\u201d he said.\nMs Seenoi-Barr, who will succeed Sinn F\u00e9in's Patricia Logue as mayor, has said she is focused on the positives and hoped her role as mayor will show others \"nothing is impossible\".\nShe has been a councillor since 2021, when she was co-opted by the SDLP to the Derry and Strabane District Council's Foyleside ward before she retained her seat in last year's local elections.",
    "Humans may have caught leprosy from squirrels in medieval times, researchers say.\nThey studied human and red squirrel bones from archaeological sites in Winchester, southern England, and found they had closely related strains of the bacteria that causes it.\nLeprosy is a chronic disease infectious between humans that attacks the skin, nerves and mucous membranes. No-one is thought to have caught it inside the UK for 70 years but it's still endemic in many parts of the world.\nArmadillos carry it and are suspected of passing it on to humans. Some modern red squirrels in the UK also have it, but there has never been a reported case of transmission to humans and experts say the risk is very low.\nIt\u2019s the first time a medieval animal has been identified as a host for the disease.\n\n\"The finding of leprosy in modern squirrels was surprising and then it's incredible that we found it in the medieval period,\" said study co-author Dr Sarah Inskip of the University of Leicester.\n\n\"It really goes against the narrative that it was a human disease specifically,\" she said.\n\nIt's not clear whether squirrels in medieval times gave humans leprosy or the other way around.\n\nBut the shared strain suggests it was circulating between people and animals in the Middle Ages in a way that hadn\u2019t been detected before, the researchers say.\n\nBack then, squirrel fur was used as a fine lining for clothes and some people also had pet squirrels. They were particularly popular with women. \nThe researchers studied 25 human and 12 squirrel samples.\n\nThe human remains came from a Winchester leprosarium (hospital for people with leprosy) and the squirrel remains from a nearby pit used by furriers.\n\nPrevious studies found that modern red squirrels from Scotland and Brownsea Island off the coast of southern England carry leprosy. \n\nPublic health England says the probability of humans catching it from squirrels is very low and there has never been a reported transmission.\n\n\nLeprosy is one of the oldest recorded diseases in human history and is still present  in Asia, Africa, and South America.\n\nThere are more than 200,000 new cases reported every year.\n\nIt's not known exactly how it spreads between people but prolonged, close contact with someone untreated, over many months, is needed to catch the disease.\n\n\u201cThe history of leprosy is far more complex than previously thought,\u201d said senior author of the study, Prof Verena Sch\u00fcnemann of the University of Basel in Switzerland.\n\n\u201cThere has been no consideration of the role that animals might have played in the transmission and spread of the disease in the past, and as such, our understanding of leprosy\u2019s history is incomplete until these hosts are considered.\" \n\nDr Stephen Walker, Associate Professor at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said: \"There's no doubt that in certain circumstances animals do appear to play a role, but the size of that role in global terms of leprosy hasn't been delineated and I would agree, does need more work.\n\"I think it highlights that we still have a lot of work to do to understand the transmission of this ancient disease better, in our efforts to try and reduce the impact globally.\"\n\nThe study is published in the journal, Current Biology.",
    "Lae arrived on time for her job interview at a lawyer's office in Bristol.\nBut after 20 minutes, it had been cancelled and she was asked to come back the next day.\nShe left upset, only to receive a message later saying the \"cancellation\" had actually been a test, which she had failed. \nShe did not get the job.\nShe says the experience was \u201ctotally bizarre\u201d and that it spurred her to start her own business, where she makes sure to stick to a much more straightforward hiring style.\nLae is not alone. According to recruitment agency Hays, over half of people have had a negative experience during the interview process for a new job.\nThe BBC has heard stories from dozens of people who went through odd, offensive, and off-putting interviews.\nThey got in touch following the news that John Lewis is changing its recruitment process by allowing applicants to see interview questions in advance, in an attempt to make the process fairer.\nSo what can bad interviews teach us? And what can interviewees and interviewers do to make the experience less questionable?\nAixin Fu also had a bizarre experience when she applied for a student ambassador job for minimum wage at a university.\nDuring a group interview, everyone was asked to crawl around on their hands and knees and \u201cmoo like a cow\u201d.\n\u201cWe did that for about three to four minutes,\u201d she recalls.\n\"At the time, I was quite annoyed. It was highly inappropriate.\n\"But there was a bit of peer pressure because everyone else was doing it.\"\nThe interviewer said they were trying to see if the candidates were \"fun\", though Ms Fu suspects that \"maybe someone just had a bit of a power trip\".\nJulie from Missouri in the US says she learnt that interviewers can sometimes be \u201creally isolated\u201d from what it\u2019s like to be an interviewee.\nThis was her takeaway from a video interview she did in 2022 to be a part-time copywriter. \nAt first, she felt it was going well. \u201cI was ticking all the boxes,\u201d she says.\nBut towards the end, the interviewer asked: \u201cSo how many years do you think you've got left in you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m in my early 60s,\u201d Julie says. \u201cI\u2019m not going to retire for quite a while.\u201d\nAgeism is not the only prejudice people may experience during interviews.\nPearl Kasirye, a content marketing manager, says she was asked about her heritage during a second interview for a partially remote PR role at a fashion brand in Milan.\nMs Kasirye lives in London and left Uganda to live and study in Europe as a child.\nShe says the employer was insistent on paying her a Ugandan wage rather than a London wage for the remote work because of her background.\nShe chose to withdraw her application.\n\u201cWhere you\u2019re from, you have no control over,\u201d she says, adding that she has interviewed people herself since and is \u201cso much more mindful\u201d about her questions.\nSometimes prejudice can be accidental \u2014 or at least less explicit \u2014 but still just as difficult for the interviewee.\nTom (not his real name) is an IT engineer who was once asked to film answers to questions for a warehouse assistant job, rather than talking to someone in a formal interview.\nTom describes himself as on the autistic spectrum, though it is not something he likes to share with people.\nHe says he needs clear instructions during an interview process and much prefers talking face-to-face, describing the filming process as \u201cdetached - like you\u2019re talking to a computer\".\nMany people also told the BBC they had been discriminated against during hiring based on their gender.\nAccording to data from hiring platform Applied, nearly one in five women have been asked whether they have children, or plan to have children, during hiring processes.\nOne of those is Applied\u2019s chief executive Khyati Sundaram, who says she has been asked \u201cmore times than I can count\u201d.\nIt is illegal for employers to ask candidates about their marital status, whether they have children, or whether they plan to have children.\nDespite this, Applied found the problem is even worse for women applying for senior roles, where two-fifths of women had been asked the same question.\nMs Sundaram says one of the reasons for this is the perceived \u201ceconomic lability\u201d of pregnancy. \u201cThe higher the pay, the more maternity you have to pay while finding a cover, and they don\u2019t want the hassle.\"\nSometimes the hiring process is bad not because of prejudice but because, as Ms Sundaram puts it: \u201cThere is no benchmark for what good looks like on the interviewer side.\"\nHer top tips for interviewers are to ask the same questions to every candidate and to design those questions with \u201cmarginalised groups\u201d in mind.\nAs for Aixin Fu, she says her experience taught her to assert herself more in future interviews, especially if asked to do something \u201cbizarre, unreasonable, or not a requirement for the job\u201d \u2014 such as moo like a cow.",
    "UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron has said it is up to Ukraine to decide how to use British weapons and insisted it has the right to strike targets on Russian territory.\nDuring a visit to Kyiv, he said the UK would provide \u00a33bn ($3.75bn) per year for as long as necessary.\n\"Just as Russia is striking inside Ukraine, you can quite understand why Ukraine feels the need to make sure it's defending itself,\" Lord Cameron said.\nRussia condemned what it called \"another very dangerous statement\".\n\"This is a direct escalation of tension around the Ukrainian conflict, which would potentially pose a threat to European security,\" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.\nLord Cameron did not directly endorse the idea of British weapons being used to strike targets inside Russia. \nBut until now, the UK has generally let it be understood - without spelling it out - that weapons such as the long range Storm Shadow missile should only be used inside sovereign Ukrainian territory. There have been several examples of its successful use in Russian-occupied Crimea, including against elements of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet.\nHowever, coming on the heels of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s pledge to give Ukraine \u00a33bn ($3.76bn) in military assistance every year for the foreseeable future, it seems Lord Cameron wanted to emphasise that it is up to Ukraine to decide what it does with it.\nThe US has reportedly urged Ukraine to halt its strikes on oil refineries in Russia, fearing it could provoke an escalation in the conflict. \nMr Peskov also took aim at French President Emmanuel Macron, who said this week that the West would \"legitimately\" have to consider whether to send ground troops to Ukraine \"if the Russians were to break through the front lines, if there were a Ukrainian request\".\nMr Macron's remarks to The Economist were a \"very dangerous trend\", said the Kremlin spokesman. However, the French leader made clear in his interview that if Russia won in Ukraine, there would be no security in Europe.\nRussian forces have seized several villages in eastern Ukraine during recent advances, taking advantage of Ukraine's shortages of weapons and manpower.\nUkrainian intelligence officials also believe Russia is gearing up for a summer offensive in the north-eastern regions of Kharkiv and Sumy. \nThe commander of the national guard, Oleksandr Pivnenko, warned recently that Russia was preparing \"unpleasant surprises\" and quietly recruiting 30,000 people a month.\nA Russian strike on Kharkiv on Friday killed an elderly woman in her home, and a tram carrying passengers also came under fire, according to Mayor Ihor Terekhov.\n\nUkraine's military says Russia's immediate target is the strategic hilltop town of Chasiv Yar, 15km (9 miles) west of the devastated city of Bakhmut. \nOfficials believe the eastern town could enable Russian forces to attack major eastern cities such as Kramatorsk and Slovyansk. The military has suggested Moscow is keen to seize Chasiv Yar before Russians mark victory in World War Two on 9 May.\nHowever, a Ukrainian military spokesman has denied that Russian troops have broken through to the Siverskyi Donetsk-Donbas canal on the outskirts of the town.\nRussia claimed on Friday that its forces had captured three villages in Ukraine's east in the past two weeks. Military spokesman Lt Col Nazar Voloshyn said the invading force had gained a foothold in the village of Ocheretyne but Ukrainian soldiers were working to drive them out.\nLord Cameron, who met President Volodymr Zelensky in Kyiv, said it was Russia that had launched an attack into Ukraine and Ukraine \"absolutely has the right to strike back at Russia\".\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said his remarks were tantamount to admitting the West was involved in a \"hybrid war\" against Moscow.\nThe UK has provided billions of pounds in military support for Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, ranging from tanks and precision-guided missiles to air-defence systems.\nA year ago the UK confirmed it had begun supplying long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles with a range of more than 250km (155 miles).\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said he had appealed to Lord Cameron to help restore the country's energy infrastructure which has been badly damaged by repeated Russian missile strikes.\n\n\n",
    "The announcement \"mind the gap\" is almost as much a part of travelling in London as the Tube sign or a red bus. But when is the gap between the train and the platform too far and too dangerous?\nEric Leach thinks he has the answer to that, and it is 30cm, or 12 inches. He knows this because while lying on the platform in agony having fallen over while getting off a train, he had time to look at the vertical drop between the train and the platform.\nIn February, at Ealing Broadway station in west London, he stepped off an Elizabeth line train onto the platform. Such was the force from the drop, that he broke a bone in his foot. He collapsed on the platform.\nEric, who also suffered bruising to his right knee, says the gap is not acceptable: \"It's a 12-inch gap. Mums with buggies, people with heavy luggage, elderly people, of course it's not acceptable. \n\"It's a scandal, someone will be seriously injured or die. It's a death trap.\"  \nThe fall happened in rush hour: \"It was very, very painful. \n\"I was trying to get off. Other people were trying to force their way on. I was terrified looking at the gap, lost my balance and came down and fell and broke a bone in my left foot. And mashed up my right knee. \n\"I was on the ground for about 20 minutes. I was taken home in a taxi and a couple of days later I realised I was bad so I went to Ealing hospital. \"\nSince his fall, he has heard of others who have fallen at the same station and has complained to Transport for London (TfL).\nTfL says safety is its \"number one priority\" but it recognises gaps can be \"larger at some older stations\".\nWhat particularly annoys Eric is he thinks that for a new railway, this is a missed opportunity. The Elizabeth line was opened in May 2022, a cost of \u00a319bn.\nAs a train comes in to Ealing Broadway, Eric points out where it happened. \"Look at this gap, it's ridiculous,\" he says.\n\"This is a modern, \u00a319bn railway system, and we have that. \n\"It's a brand new line and a brand new station. It's difficult enough getting on but getting off is even more dangerous. \n\"Somebody is going to fall there, bang their head and die. They either have to raise the platform or lower the track.\"\nSo is there a legal safety limit to what the gap should be between trains and platforms? \nCertainly some gaps at platforms in London are big. Bank station and Clapham Junction spring to mind. \nAnd the central section of the Elizabeth line is blessed with flat boarding between the platform and the train. So why not in the west? \nThe platforms at Ealing Broadway are actually owned by Network Rail and aren't new. Before the introduction of Elizabeth line services, they were used by GWR trains out of London Paddington. \nSafety guidance says new platforms should not have a horizontal gap larger than 27.5cm (10.8in) or a vertical gap of more than 23cm (9in). \nHowever, Rail Safety and Standards Board rules only apply to new stations, so Ealing Broadway as an older platform doesn't fall under the regulations. \nThe rules don't apply.\nThe government's Office for Road and Rail says: \"Under current health and safety law, railway operators should reduce the risk from gaps as far as is reasonably practicable. \n\"For existing station platforms, a judgement has to be made as to whether it would be reasonably practicable to reduce the gaps or whether the cost would be disproportionate to the level of risk.\"\nThere are also injuries due to the gap on the London Underground, with hundreds being affected every year. \nA Freedom of Information request shows more than 300 passengers were involved in gap incidents in 2015 for example.\nTfL said at the time: \"Incidents of our customers being injured getting on and off Tube trains are rare, with fewer than one incident in every four million journeys last year. \n\"The majority of incidents result in either no injury (approximately 50%) or where only a minor injury was caused. Major injuries are very rare and account for fewer than 2% of all incidents.\"\nBut in May 2020, a man died after being hit by the Tube train he had been on after falling through the gap on the Bakerloo line at Waterloo station.  \nThe curve of the track meant the passenger was difficult to detect on the drivers' CCTV, the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) found.\nThe RAIB found London Underground's risk assessments did not identify extra risks caused by curved platforms at certain stops. \nIt made a number of recommendations. Among them, London Underground was told to recognise and assess location-specific risks so they could be properly managed. \nTfL says that so far there have been three incidents involving gaps since the opening of the Elizabeth line.\nWith regard to the injury to Eric Leach, a TfL spokesperson said: \u201cWe are sorry that one of our customers sustained an injury at Ealing Broadway station in February and we wish him a full and speedy recovery. \n\n\"Safety is our number one priority and, while the gap between the platform complies with the required safety standar",

Rate cuts will move back up the agenda as a result and there is little doubt that markets will take this as good news,\" said Neil Birrell, Chief Investment Officer at Premier Miton Investors.\n\"While we shouldn\u2019t make too much of single data prints, this could be the start of a positive trend for the Fed,\u201d he added.\nThe Federal Reserve sharply increased interest rates starting in 2022, hoping to cool the economy and ease the pressures that were pushing up prices at the fatest  pace in decades.\nAnalysts had been expecting the US central bank to cut rates this year, as inflation, which measures the pace of price rises, cooled. \nBut at 3.5% in March, it has remained above the bank's 2% target, raising doubts about the timing of such moves.\nAn unexpectedly robust jobs market, which has bolstered consumer spending - and the wider economy - has added to those questions.\nAt the same time, it has raised hopes that the US will be able to avoid a painful economic downturn of the kind that has often historically accompanied a spike in borrowing costs. \nShares in the US opened higher after the latest jobs figures from the Labor Department.\nSatyam Panday, chief US economist at the credit rating agency S&P Global Ratings, said the signs of a hiring slowdown were expected and should help cool inflation, without being so severe as to raise concerns about a recession. \n\"I would call it a decent jobs report but not too hot, so the Federal Reserve really likes this,\" he said, adding that he expected the Fed would be ready to cut rates by \"perhaps by sometime in the fall or maybe December.\"\nThe pace of job growth in April remained relatively resilient, if slower than previous months. \nEmployers added 315,000 positions in March and 236,000 in February. That was about 22,000 fewer than previously estimated, the Labor Department said.\nIn April, most sectors added workers, with health care firms driving the gains, according to the report. \nAverage hourly earnings rose 3.9% over the 12 months to April, a slower pace from the previous month, the Labor Department said.

    "Security is being tightened for the Eurovision Song Contest in Sweden's third city Malmo, with large demonstrations planned to coincide with the event and the country already on high alert.\nPolice and organisers say they're well-prepared and hoping for a \"joyful\" event. \nThe annual feel-good celebration of pop and showbiz is this year shrouded by complaints from some quarters over Israel's participation amid the war in Gaza. Sweden was already facing heightened security challenges, and Malmo is expecting one of the country's biggest ever policing efforts.\nAs many as 100,000 visitors are set to descend on this city on Sweden's south-west coast for the world's largest live music contest.\nColourful Eurovision banners decorate many of the city's streets, and it's the third time that Malmo is playing host, after Swedish artist Loreen won last year's competition in Liverpool, with her hit song Tattoo. \nA programme of festivities kicks off on Saturday, with semi-finals next Tuesday and Thursday, culminating in the grand final on 11 May. An estimated 200 million viewers worldwide are expected to tune in for the four-hour spectacle.\nForces have been drafted in from across Sweden, with reinforcements from neighbouring Denmark and Norway. Swedish police are usually armed, but some officers will carry larger weapons as a precautionary measure.\nMalmo police chief Petra Stenkula said the whole country was already \"on a terror level of four out of five\".\n\"I think it's obvious that the world's insecurity has also affected Eurovision,\" she told the BBC. \"In Sweden, and Malmo in particular, there have been protests against Israel taking part in the competition.\"\nThe police chief said there were no specific threats to the event, but the alert level was raised last August, following a spate of Quran-burnings that angered the Muslim world. \nAn internal police report, highlighted by Sweden's public broadcaster SVT, described Sweden as a \"priority target\" for violent jihadist groups. The 23-page threat assessment for Eurovision also cited unrest, cyber attacks and disruption of the broadcast as other potential risks.\n\"In Sweden, police are used to working with very complex issues, and we think we have good planning,\" said Petra Stenkula.\nCameras have also been set up and drones are being used for surveillance. Guests will also have to pass through airport-style security controls including scanners and searches, when entering venues and no bags are allowed.\n\"It's a huge thing for the city of Malmo. So, of course, it's important that everything works smoothly,\" said Per-Erik Ebbestahl, Malmo's security director. \"We feel very well prepared.\"\nAuthorities have been planning for months and also working with their counterparts in Liverpool, which hosted last year's competition. \"It's been very, very, helpful for us,\" he told the BBC.\nMalmo has hosted the Pope and also a Holocaust Remembrance conference two years ago. But the city's security director says what is new is the general threat towards Sweden and large gatherings.\n\"It's not aimed at Eurovision per se,\" he said, pointing out that similar security had been in place for recent ice hockey playoffs, and was also planned for this month's Taylor Swift concerts in Stockholm.\nFencing had been erected and additional cameras were being mounted when the BBC visited the Malmo Arena on Thursday. Inside the venue, rehearsals were already under way for a show featuring 37 acts.\n\"We have really exciting shows coming up,\" said Ebba Adielsson, SVT's executive Eurovision producer. \n\"We know the debate out there, we know about the demonstrations and we are well prepared. We hear it and we respect it,\" she said. \"But I sincerely hope that it doesn't overshadow it that much.\nIsraeli contestant Eden Golan, 20, and her song Hurricane will undoubtedly be in the spotlight. \nOriginally titled October Rain, the song had alluded to the Hamas attacks on southern Israel last 7 October.

We do not believe a court case about process represents the best way of driving progress towards our shared goal of reaching net zero.\"\nThe legal challenge was brought by environmental groups Friends of the Earth, ClientEarth and The Good Law Project.\nTony Bosworth, lead campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said it was \"an embarrassing day for the government\".\nSpeaking outside the court to BBC News he said: \"What we now need to see is a climate plan which is robust, which is comprehensive and which is fair, which makes sure we meet all our climate targets, and which does that in a way which doesn't leave anybody behind.\"\nThe three groups had previously won a case against the government back in 2022 arguing that its Net Zero Plan was not detailed enough to explain how the UK would cut its emissions - as required by the Climate Change Act.\nIn response the government produced a plan which laid out how each of its policies would cut emissions. \nBut the campaigners said the former Energy Secretary Grant Shapps did not consider the risks to deliver the plan and signed it off assuming all the policies would be achieved. \nIn his judgement, Mr Justice Sheldon said: \"It is not possible to ascertain from the materials presented to the Secretary of State which of the proposals and policies would not be delivered at all, or in full.\"\nLater on Friday, the judge is expected to provide a deadline for reviewing the plan.\nAsked about the judgement, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he had not seen the ruling in detail but was \"proud of our track record\" on climate change.\nEd Miliband, Labour's shadow secretary of state for climate change and net zero, reacted to the High Court's ruling saying it signified a new low even for what he said was \"a government that has totally failed on energy and climate for fourteen years\".\nThe government had previously been warned that the plan was not sufficient by its own climate watchdog. \nWhen the new plan was published in March 2023 the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC) said it was even less confident that the government could achieve its climate goals than before it published the plan.\nThe UK has a target to reduce its emissions by 78% by 2035 against 1990 levels. But the UKCCC estimated the government plan would only deliver a fifth of the emissions cuts needed in the coming decade.\nIt said of the plan published in 2023: \"Despite over 3,000 pages of new detail, [our] confidence in the UK meeting its goals from 2030 onwards is now markedly less than it was in our previous assessment a year ago.\"\nIn particular the committee criticised the government's failure to support clean energy and its support for new fossil fuel projects.\nIn July 2023 Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced 100 new North Sea oil and gas licences - on the basis this would secure jobs and energy security for the UK.\nThe International Energy Agency has previously said there is no need for investment in new oil and gas projects to meet global energy demand.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every Tuesday.

    " Thousands of students, at more than 130 colleges and universities across the US, have demonstrated in opposition to the ongoing war in Gaza with protests and encampments. \nMore than 2,000 demonstrators have been arrested, but the protests continue as universities prepare for graduation ceremonies in coming days.\nSince the 7 October attack by Hamas and Israel's retaliatory assault, students have launched rallies, sit-ins, fasts and, most recently, encampments against the war.\nThey are demanding that their schools, many with massive endowments, financially divest from Israel. \nDivestment, for many of the protesters, means cutting those endowments' ties to Israeli companies or ones that do business with Israel. Many also want their universities to end academic relationships with Israeli institutions.\nStudent activists say that companies doing business in Israel, or with Israeli organisations, are complicit in its ongoing war in Gaza - as are colleges investing in those companies.\nUniversity endowments fund everything from research labs to scholarship funds, mostly using returns from millions - and billions - of dollars in investments. \nThe encampments began last month, with dozens of students at Columbia University pitching tents on a campus lawn while the president of the New York City university testified before Congress about antisemitism. \nThe police moved in a day later and detained the protesters, sparking a wave of action at other colleges across the US. \nActivists quickly set up camp again at Columbia and eventually moved into an academic building.\nThe police were called in again due to vandalism and risks to public safety, the university said. \nMore than 100 arrests were made as both the building and encampment were cleared.\nThe escalating crisis at Columbia inspired similar protests and encampments across the country, including:\nThe BBC has counted more than 130 colleges and universities in the US where protests or encampments have arisen in the past few weeks. Protests have occurred in 45 states and Washington D.C. \nPro-Palestinian protesters have also gathered over the past week on university campuses in Australia, Canada, France, Italy and the UK.\nSome are negotiating with student activists while others are issuing ultimatums that have led to police being called in.\nAn agreement was reached between Northwestern University near Chicago and protesters that limits the size of the encampment.\nAnother deal was reached at Brown University where school officials agreed to hold a vote on divestment in October in exchange for students removing the encampment. \nNational politicians have called on colleges to do more, highlighting antisemitic incidents at some protests.\nJewish students at several campuses have told the BBC about incidents that made them feel uncomfortable or fearful.\nThese ranged from chants and signs supporting Hamas, a proscribed terror group, to physical altercations and perceived threats.\nMore than 2,000 people have been arrested at the demonstrations across the US, according to a tally compiled by the Associated Press. \nIn just the first two days of May alone, hundreds of arrests were made at campuses around the country, including Yale, Dartmouth, Stony Brook, Portland State, the University of Wisconsin and the University of Texas at Dallas. \nAt UCLA, 210 people were taken into custody after police moved in on a pro-Palestinian encampment. \nIn New York, 282 were arrested earlier this week after police cleared Columbia's Hamilton Hall - which had been occupied by protesters - as well as the encampment on campus. The figure includes detentions made at the nearby City College of New York. \nPro-Palestinian campus groups have for years called on their institutions to support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, as a means of pushing back against Israel.\nNo US university has ever committed to the BDS framework, although some have cut specific financial ties in the past.\nWhile divestment would have a negligible impact, if any, on the war in Gaza, protesters say it would shed light on those who profit from war and help build awareness of their issue.\nIn response, Israel has banned some BDS groups from entering the country. \nActivists at Columbia and elsewhere have highlighted the protests at the end of the 1960s against US involvement in the Vietnam War.\nThousands were arrested and there were violent clashes with police. \nFour students in Ohio were killed in 1970 when the National Guard opened fire. The National Guard is not being deployed to the Gaza campus protests.\nTheir deaths triggered a nationwide student strike and hundreds of universities closed.\nGraduation ceremonies across the US are kicking off this weekend and some protests are expected including at Indiana University and the University of Michigan. It remains to be seen exactly what demonstrations at commencements will look like. \nAt the University of Southern California, the commencement ceremony was cancelled al",
    "There was a time when it seemed Tesla could do no wrong. \nIn little more than a decade, it went from technology upstart to mass-market carmaker, invested billions in its clean energy business, and saw its value rocket.\nBut now the company is struggling with falling car sales and intense competition from Chinese brands, as well as problems with its much-hyped Cybertruck.\nLower sales have hit its revenues, and hurt its profits. Its share price has fallen by more than a quarter since the start of the year. \nIt has cut prices in major markets, and is in the process of laying off some 14,000 employees - 10% of its global workforce. Those affected include senior executives and the entire team responsible for its much-admired supercharger network. \nSo is all of this just a bump in the road, or are the wheels coming off the Tesla bandwagon?\n\"It's about breaking a spell,\" explained Elon Musk to a specially invited audience at Tesla's California factory back in June 2012.\n\"The world has been under the illusion that electric cars can't be as good as gasoline cars,\" he said.\nMusk was speaking at the launch of the new Tesla Model S, a car he insisted would shatter that illusion. It was no empty promise. \nAt the time electric cars had a long-standing reputation for being slow, uninspiring and impractical, with very limited range.\nAlthough new models such as the Nissan Leaf were starting to develop a niche following, they had yet to make much of an impact on the wider market.\nThe Model S was powerful, had sportscar performance, and could travel up to 265 miles on a single charge. It wasn't cheap, starting at $57,000 (\u00a347,000) in the US for the lowest performance version, but it certainly made a point.\nSince then, Tesla has launched four more models, including the Model X SUV, the \"affordable\" Model 3 and Model Y, and the Cybertruck. \nIt now has huge, so-called gigafactories building cars in Shanghai and Berlin, in addition to its original facility in Fremont, California, and a number of other US sites. Last year, it delivered 1.8 million cars, suggesting it has established itself firmly as a mass-market manufacturer. \nBut according to Professor Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University's Centre for Automotive Industry Research, that is part of the problem. \"When Tesla first emerged, it had an exciting new product, a charismatic CEO, and it came across as really pioneering,\" he explains.\nNow though, the company \"is no longer the entrepreneurial new entrant and upstart disrupter, but increasingly an industry incumbent with all the challenges this brings when faced with a growing array of competitors in the same market space\".\nOther companies, like China's Nio, are offering more exciting products, says Prof Wells, while fellow Chinese firm BYD offers good performance at lower prices. \"Basically, the world has caught up with Tesla,\" he says.\nThere is no doubt that there is a lot more competition than there used to be. Following the diesel emissions scandal that engulfed it in 2015, Volkswagen began ploughing money into electric vehicles. \nAnd as governments around the world began looking seriously at eventual bans on the sale of new petrol and diesel models, other established manufacturers soon followed. Customers looking for an electric car with decent range and performance now have plenty of options to choose from. \nIn China, meanwhile, policymakers have for years seen the development of electric vehicles (EVs) as an opportunity to take a significant share of the global market, and promoted their development. The result has been the rapid growth of brands such as BYD. It overtook Tesla to become the world's biggest manufacturer of electric cars at the end of 2023, although a subsequent drop in sales allowed Tesla to regain its crown in the first three months of this year.\nAt the same time, as the EV market has become more established, in many parts of the world subsidies to help consumers buy them have been reined in. That may be one reason why the rampant growth in EV sales in recent years has eased off - and why the manufacturers themselves are having to drop their prices.\nAccording to independent auto analyst Matthias Schmidt, this has certainly had an impact on Tesla.\n\"Finance ministers who were previously happy to offer attractive incentives for the purchase of a battery electric vehicle in a market environment that appeared bare-shelved, with essentially a Tesla or a Tesla on offer, are now slamming their purses shut,\" he says. \nOne market in which this appears to have had a profound effect is Germany. A subsidy scheme offering thousands of euros off the cost of a new electric vehicle was abruptly ended in December. \nEV sales there fell sharply in the first three months of this year, with Tesla suffering a 36% drop compared to the same period in 2023.\nThe question now is whether Tesla can regain lost momentum. Its maverick chief executive, Elon Musk appears to be pinning his hopes on the company becoming a leader in",
    "The Conservatives have endured one of their worst local election results in a decade in the last big test of public opinion before a general election.\nThe Tories lost nearly half the seats they contested, with only a handful of council and mayoral results pending.\nIn contrast, Labour won key councils, regional mayors and a decisive victory in the Blackpool South by-election. \nThe PM called the results \"disappointing\" but denied Labour was on track for a general election win.\nIn a rare bright spot for the Tories, Ben Houchen was elected for a third term in Tees Valley, with a much reduced majority.\nSpeaking at Teesside International Airport, Mr Sunak said the results showed at the general election election voters \"are going to stick with us\".\nMr Sunak said Labour \"knew they have to win here in order to win a general election\", but said voters know \"the Conservatives are building a brighter future for Teesside and a brighter future of Britain\".\nIn total, the Conservatives lost 10 councils and more than 400 councillors in England.\nLabour emerged as the main beneficiary, gaining 169 new councillors and making advances in areas the party claim point toward a general election victory.\nThe party also won all three of the newly created regional mayors in the East Midlands, North East and York and North Yorkshire.\nSpeaking at Northallerton Town Football Club in North Yorkshire, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the result was a \"historic victory\" for Labour in \"the heart of Tory territory\".\nThe newly created York and North Yorkshire mayoralty includes Mr Sunak's Richmond constituency.\nHe said: \"We've had a positive campaign here and I am very, very proud to stand here as leader of the Labour Party to celebrate this historic victory.\n\"And it is a historic victory - these are places where we would not have usually had a Labour Party success but we've been able to create that success and persuade people to vote for us.\"\nThe local election results so far yielded a wealth of results for the parties to pore over with around 2,600 seats contested across 107 councils, 37 police and crime commissioners, and 11 local mayors.\nResults will continue to come in on Saturday and Sunday.\nResearch by Sir John Curtice for the BBC estimates that, if the whole country had had an election on Thursday and behaved in a similar manner to those places that did, the outcome would be Labour on 34% and the Conservatives on 25%.\nMeanwhile, national polling puts Labour on as much as 20 points ahead of the Conservatives in general election intentions.\nBoth Labour and the Liberal Democrats are now calling for Mr Sunak to call for a general election. \nGaining nearly 100 new councillors, the Liberal Democrats said they have proved they can benefit from Conservative difficulties.\nThe Green Party just missed out on its target of taking over Bristol Council, but continued to gain ground winning 66 new seats.\nMeanwhile, Reform are averaging 12% of the vote in wards where they are standing, and came third in the Blackpool by-election, 117 votes behind the Tories.\nDespite the poor results, there is no sign of an internal revolt against the prime minister's leadership. There are only two MPs who have publicly called for a change of leader - and no-one new voices joining that band in response to these results.\nHolding on to the Tees Valley mayoralty may have provided Mr Sunak with a lifeline. \nBut as leading elections expert Sir John pointed out, Lord Houchen's success was \"heavily personal\" and the results unreliable indicators of Conservative prospects in a general election.\nMPs have reported to the BBC's chief political correspondent Henry Zeffman that seeing a popular independent-minded local incumbent defy a national trend is compelling. Many MPs believe they have strong personal votes  - even if there is little academic evidence for that.\nThe results from the remaining votes could still prove to be pivotal to the two leading parties.\nSir John said the Tories could be on course to lose 500 councillors - making it \"one of the worst, if not the worst\" performances by the party in 40 years.\nFive council elections are still to come in, with but all eyes will be on the remaining seven mayoral races due to be announced by the end of Saturday - they include London, Greater Manchester, Liverpool City Region, Salford, West Yorkshire, West Midlands and South Yorkshire.\nThe outcomes in London and Greater Manchester - currently held by two of Labour's biggest national figures in Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham - will be crucial for gauging the party's public support.",
    "Notes of the first Executive meeting after a controversial funeral, which were thought to have been missing, have been submitted to the Covid Inquiry.\nCounsel for the UK Covid-19 Inquiry, sitting in Belfast, said seven attempts were made to source the minutes from 2 July 2020.\nThe meeting followed the large-scale funeral of republican Bobby Storey.\nThen-deputy first minister Michelle O'Neill and other Sinn F\u00e9in ministers had attended the funeral. \nThey faced criticism from other parties who said the gathering was in breach of Covid lockdown restrictions.\nDespite being told that handwritten notes of this meeting were missing and had not been provided, at the start of Friday's hearing Clair Dobbin KC said the minutes had been found.\nMs Dobbin said that shortly after the opening of Module 2C of the inquiry, the inquiry team had been approached by The Executive Office to say they had the minutes of the 2 July meeting. \nA letter sent to the inquiry on behalf of The Executive Office was shown saying: \"It is correct that those notes were submitted to the inquiry following counsel to the inquiry's comment in her opening submission on the inability of TEO [the Executive Office] to find them\". \nThe email said that comment had come as a surprise to members of the TEO Covid Inquiry Team as they believed notes had been provided to the inquiry.\nMs Dobbin said she wanted to put the suggestion that it came as a surprise into some context for the inquiry and detailed all of the requests that were made of The Executive Office for the missing notes. \nThe counsel to the inquiry said there had been repeated requests for these notes and accepted in a letter dated 31 July 2023 that it was the inquiry's understanding that the notes of 2 July 2020 were not held. \nThe inquiry again set out that this set of notes covered \"a period of significant interest\" and that it was \"of concern\" if they were missing.\nIt asked for confirmation that these handwritten notes were missing and that there were no copies.\nIt also asked for an explanation about the circumstance in which they had gone missing and whether there was an investigation into this.\nThe inquiry heard there were investigations around this time around the missing notes.\nOn Friday, an email dated 3 August 2023 was shown to the inquiry which confirmed that the handwritten notes for 2 July 2020 had been found.\nMs Dobbin said that \"despite those notes having been found and despite the sheer number of requests having been made, despite the fact that TEO told the inquiry that those notes weren't held and despite the very specific questions that the inquiry asked about the precise circumstance in which notes like this could go missing, they weren't provided until after the opening had been given\". \nBaroness Heather Hallett, who is chairing the inquiry, said she was \"very concerned\" about what she had just been told and said she would consider with the inquiry team whether she wished to pursue the matter further.\n\"It's not a very happy picture,\" she concluded.\nOn Friday afternoon, the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service said it was \"regretful\" information that is of importance to bereaved families was deleted.\nJayne Brady was answering questions about information being deleted from ministers' devices including WhatsApp's on mobile phones.\nShe told the inquiry the issue had \"shone a light on the vulnerabilities of the system\" that is 20 years old.\nMs Brady said it was \"a matter of deep regret\" that the same issues had been raised during the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) inquiry.\nShe said she welcomed that \"we're hearing it now because it shows the journey that we still need to travel\".\nThe inquiry also heard that it was not until 17 March that a strategic plan was drawn up which brought together cross-departmental strategies to aid decision making.\nKaren Pearson, who had moved from working on project Yellow Hammer, related to Brexit, to preparing for the pandemic, said she accepted she had little experience in the area of health. \nThe UK Covid Inquiry heard that in early March 2020, senior Northern Ireland civil servants conveyed their concerns over a lack of response structure and staff and that the Northern Ireland contingency hub should be \"established as a matter of priority\". \nAsked by counsel to the inquiry about the apparent lack of urgency among some people in early March, Ms Pearson said she was aware of the concern but the hub had been set up a few days later. \nAt that point, counsel to the inquiry, Clair Dobbin, KC, reminded Ms Pearson that it took several more days before the Covid hub was activated.   \nMs Pearson was also asked if the cross-community veto in the assembly was ever intended to be used in a public health arena, to which she replied: \"I doubt it was.\"",
    "Former Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson was turned away from his local polling station after forgetting to bring acceptable photo ID. \nAs first reported by Sky News, he returned later with the necessary ID and was able to vote. \nHe cast his ballot in South Oxfordshire, where voters are choosing a police and crime commissioner.\nNew rules requiring photo ID to vote were introduced by Mr Johnson's government in the Elections Act 2022. \nThe change was rolled out last year, with local elections in May 2023 the first time voters needed to show ID. \nAccording to the Electoral Commission, about 14,000 people were unable to vote in last year's local elections in England as a result of the new rules.\nThere are 22 acceptable forms of ID, including passports, driving licences, older or Disabled Person's bus passes and Oyster 60+ cards.\nPeople who are registered to vote can also apply for a free document known as a Voter Authority Certificate. \nThe government has also said it intends to make veterans' ID cards a valid form of voter identification after some former service personnel were turned away from polling stations. \nArmy veteran Adam Diver, 48, said he felt \"gutted\" when he was turned away from a polling station in Fleetwood, Lancashire, after presenting his veterans' ID card. \nMr Diver, who served in the Army for 27 years, said he felt as if his service was \"invalidated\" when his card was rejected. \n\"I thought you could use it as an ID card. It's like a driving licence, you can't get any more official,\" he said.\nVeterans minister Johnny Mercer apologised to Mr Diver on social media.\n\"The legislation on acceptable forms of ID came out before the veterans ID cards started coming out in January this year,\" he wrote.\n\"I will do all I can to change it before the next one.\"\nA No 10 spokeswoman said: \"It is our intention for the new Veteran Card, which was rolled out in January, to be added to the official list.\"\nVeteran Cards have been issued to people leaving the army since 2018. They were rolled out more widely to all veterans in January this year. \nThe government is consulting on adding the card to the list of acceptable voter ID, which already includes armed forces identity cards.\nMeanwhile, Conservative MP Tom Hunt said his dyspraxia caused him to lose his passport and he had to arrange an emergency proxy vote. \nMr Hunt, who represents Ipswich, said he does not want to \"blame everything on my dyspraxia\", but it is \"well known that sadly we are slightly more prone to lose things\". \nHe warned people \"persecuting\" him online to be \"very careful with their words\". \nPeople can apply for an emergency proxy vote until 5pm on polling day if their ID has been lost, stolen or damaged.\nAsked about problems reported over voter ID, Transport Secretary Mark Harper said there were \"bound to be, when you have millions of people voting, a small number of issues\". \nHowever, he said he thought \"most voters have actually found it perfectly straightforward to vote with the necessary ID across the country\". \nAsked about Mr Johnson being turned away, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris, who served as his chief whip, told BBC Radio: \"As someone who knows Boris well, I can't say it completely surprises me... I do know that he then simply went home, got some ID, went back to the polling station and voted Conservative.\"  \nThe Electoral Commission said \"most voters who wanted to vote were able to do so\", despite voter ID requirements. \n\"We will now begin to collect evidence from voters, electoral administrators, partner organisations, and campaigners to understand their experiences of the elections and identify any potential obstacles to participation,\" a spokesman said.\nElectoral Commission chief executive Vijay Rangarajan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that large-scale campaigns to raise awareness of the rules appear to have been successful.\nAsked about issues some voters faced, he said: \"It looks as if these are teething problems at the moment but we're going to evaluate this really carefully.\"",
    "\"All of Kashmir was, is and will remain a part of India,\" says actor Kiran Karmarkar in a recent hit film on the government's 2019 decision to revoke Indian-administered Kashmir's autonomy.\nA stocky man dressed in a starched white kurta, Karmarkar looks the part as Indian Home Minister Amit Shah in Article 370 - the film named after the constitutional provision that conferred special privileges on the Himalayan region, which is claimed by both India and Pakistan.\nThe scene is a real-to-reel depiction of Mr Shah's speech in the parliament moments after his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government announced it was doing away with the law.\nWhen the film released in February, some critics called it \"thinly veiled\" propaganda which \"justified many questionable actions\" of the government.\nBut the film was endorsed by top BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. \nMade on a budget of approximately 200m rupees ($2.39m, \u00a31.9m), the film eventually grossed over 1.1bn rupees worldwide.\nSince Mr Modi first came to power in 2014, the Hindi film industry has produced several films referencing government policies. But in the past four years, experts say a lot them have begun to explicitly steer towards propaganda - in 2019, a biopic of Mr Modi released just as polls closed.\nFive years on, as the country heads to another election, a clutch of films - all centred around the BJP's Hindu nationalist ideology - are in the pipeline or have been released.\nTwo of them - Accident or Conspiracy: Godhra and The Sabarmati Report - are based on the deadly anti-Muslim riots that broke out in Gujarat in 2002. Veer Savarkar, a biopic celebrating the legacy of the controversial 20th-Century Hindu nationalist leader, includes a dialogue that claims India would have been free of British rule much earlier if it wasn't for independence leader Mahatma Gandhi. \nFilm critics say the slew of releases points to the solidifying of a new genre of films that plainly aligns with the ruling party's ideology. They add that not all of them work at the box-office, but the stories with their outright fabrications of key events play a part in shaping public perception.\n\"Cinema has been weaponised for ideology on a scale not seen before,\" says Nandini Ramnath, film critic at Scroll.in. \"These films seek to challenge what we think we know about historical personages or important historical incidents. They are out to create a new alt-history.\"\nThis has also sparked concerns about the future of Bollywood, one of India's few cultural spaces whose appeal cuts across religious and political divisions, making it a unique binding force.\nFilmmakers behind these projects, however, reject the claim. \"My films are not political, they are of human interest,\" says Sudipto Sen, director of The Kerala Story - the 2023 film which claimed to tell the \"true story\" of Hindu and Christian women lured into converting to Islam and joining the Islamic State (IS) group. \nSen says his views don't reflect that of any political party and claims that his film angered many because of its \"exposition of the truth\". But when the film released, the Supreme Court ordered the makers to add a disclaimer that it was a fictionalised account and did not have \"authentic data\" to back its claim of 32,000 such conversions.\nOf course, this is not the first time Bollywood has tapped into nationalism and sold it to a willing audience. The industry has a history of high-octane patriotic, sometimes jingoistic, films. These films dramatise stories of heroes fighting a cast of villains - ranging from malevolent terrorists and corrupt politicians to tyrant colonisers.\nIndians also love to watch hyper-fictionalised films based on military victories, many of which show Pakistan as the \"enemy\" in what's supposed to be a reflection of real-life fault lines. \n\"Bollywood does not always get the facts right - in fact, it almost never does,\" says Ruchika Sharma, who teaches history at Delhi University. \"The industry has always taken liberties with storytelling to create the perfect legend.\" \nBut filmmakers, she adds, are now coming up with their own parallel versions of history that are not rooted in facts and amount to \"a destruction of the historical genre\".\n\"There is also a deliberate creation of binaries and the depictions have become dangerously sectarian.\"\nShe is particularly critical of Samrat Prithviraj, a 2022 film about a 12th-Century Hindu king who was killed in a battle against Muhammad of Ghor, a ruler from a region now in Afghanistan. \nMs Sharma says the film's constant reference to him as a Muslim invader was \"jarring and completely ahistorical\" because early Sanskrit texts describe him in \"deeply casteist terms\" and not on the basis of his religion.\n\"Every century of India's history is capable of giving us a drama as epic as the Game of Thrones,\" she adds. \"Yet we want to be stuck in this Hindu-Muslim divide.\"\nPrithviraj didn't do well, but box-office",
    "There has been lots of noise and lots of numbers.\nAnd, for plenty of us, not a lot of sleep.\nAnd there are still more results to come this weekend.\nBut how do things look right now?\nFirstly, dire election results are becoming a dangerous habit for the Conservatives. \nThere were last year's local elections.\nSeveral by-elections since.\nAnd now these elections.\nThe picture for Rishi Sunak has been consistently bleak.\nIf his premiership set out with two aims, steadying the ship of government and reviving Conservative fortunes, it's fair to say he did achieve the first of these.\nGone was the rolling psychodrama of Boris Johnson's last few months and Liz Truss's entire vanishingly brief tenure.\nBut as for the second, making the Tories popular again? The evidence suggests this has been a spectacular failure.\nHe yanks various policy levers. He sets ideas out with passion. And they appear to make barely any difference whatsoever to either his or his party's fortunes.\nIn contrast - and blackening the Tory mood still further - is Labour's relatively newly discovered knack of winning where they need to win in a general election.\nThey used to be rather good at stacking up loads of votes in places where they won already, and nowhere near enough votes in places where they didn't.\nThat appears to be changing.\nStrikingly, though, there is no sign, yet at least of this prompting a Conservative insurrection against the prime minister. \nWhy? Because the results for them are grim but perhaps no more grim than feared.\nOne senior figure suggested Conservative MPs were \"remarkably chilled\".\nA former cabinet minister said the results were \"not catastrophic\" - while also tacitly accepting they pointed to likely general election defeat. \nLabour are confident of exactly that - that these results point to them being on track to winning a majority when the whole country goes to the polls.\nThe Liberal Democrats see evidence of their capacity to capitalise on Conservative woe; Reform UK too. \nAnd the trend of a steady rise for the Green Party in local politics continues. \nIn essence these results cement the status quo - a buoyant Labour Party, the Conservatives morose, the smaller parties chipper.\nThis brings us to the big picture point - yes, the Conservatives are in dire straits and Labour are in a strong place.\nBut, remember, Labour have to do astonishingly well by any historical comparison to win a general election, and that remains the case.\nIt is this central fact - as well as the relative fortunes of the parties - that will shape the conversation between now and the general election.",
    "A Palestinian doctor has died in an Israeli prison after more than four months in detention, Palestinian prisoner associations have said.\nDr Adnan Al-Bursh, 50, was the head of orthopaedics at al-Shifa Hospital.\nThe Israeli prison service confirmed that a statement published on 19 April about a prisoner who was detained for national security reasons and had died in Ofer prison was Dr Al-Bursh.\nNo details were given on the cause of death, and the prison service said the incident was being investigated.\nBut the Palestinian prisoner advocacy groups said in a joint statement on Thursday that Dr Al-Bursh's death was an \"assassination\" and his body still remained in Israeli custody.\nDr Al-Bursh was the head of orthopaedics at Gaza's largest medical facility, al-Shifa hospital, which has been raided several times by Israeli armed forces.\nHe was temporarily working at Al-Awada hospital in north Gaza when he was detained by Israeli forces.\nColleagues have paid tribute to the late surgeon, describing him as \"compassionate\" and \"heroic\".\nAl-Shifa's director, Dr Marwan Abu Saada, said the news of his death was difficult for the human soul to bear.\nAnother colleague, Dr Suhail Matar, called Dr Al-Bursh \u201cthe safety valve\u201d for every orthopaedic department in all of Gaza\u2019s hospitals.\n\"It is rare that you meet a person like him in your life, because this doctor worked all his life with dedication and used to make tremendous efforts at the expense of himself,\" Dr Matar told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme. \nHe described his late colleague as someone who was never tired of working, and who was \"loved by everyone and his smile never went away\".\nFrancesca Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in the West Bank and Gaza, said she was \"extremely alarmed\" by news of Dr Al-Bursh's death and called on the diplomatic community to take concrete measures to protect Palestinians.\nMeanwhile White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden has discussed with Israel the importance of protecting humanitarian workers in Gaza.\n\"The president has said very clearly that when it comes to people who are... in Gaza providing that all-important care, humanitarian aid, humanitarian care, they need to be protected. They should be protected. And so certainly those conversations are going to continue,\" she said.\n\"We believe that certainly... the Israeli government has taken efforts to do just that and has taken into account our concerns and so we're going to continue to have those conversations but it is heartbreaking to hear.\"\nGaza's Hamas-run health ministry said in a statement that Dr Al-Bursh\u2019s death meant that the total number of medical workers who had been killed by Israel since the 7 October attack now stands at 496.\nIt added that 1,500 others had been wounded while 309 had been arrested.\nMedical facilities are protected under international law, but Israel says Hamas uses them as cover for military operations - something Hamas denies. \nThe BBC has approached the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment.",

    "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has called the overnight local elections results \"disappointing\" despite his party retaining the Tees Valley mayoralty.\nThe Conservatives have lost over 400 council seats, while Labour won the Blackpool South by-election.\nLabour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said voters showed Mr Sunak they wanted a change in the last big test of public opinion before a general election.\nNearly 90% of the 107 councils up for election have declared so far. \nSir Keir said the Blackpool result - a massive 26% swing to Labour - was a message to the Tory leader that it was time to move on and call a general election.\n\"That wasn't just a little message, that wasn't just a murmur, that was a shout from Blackpool - we want change,\" he said.\n\"And Blackpool speaks for the whole country - it's saying that we've had enough now.\"\nIn a rare bright spot for the Tories, Ben Houchen was elected for a third term in Tees Valley, with a much reduced majority.\nSpeaking at a press event in Teesside International Airport, Mr Sunak said the results showed at the general election election voters \"are going to stick with us\".\nMr Sunak said Labour \"knew they have to win here in order to win a general election\". But voters know \"the Conservatives are building a brighter future for Teesside and a brighter future of Britain,\" he added.\nLeading pollster Sir John Curtice said Lord Houchen's success was \"heavily personal\" and the results are not \"particularly reliable\" for an indication of Conservative fortunes in a general election.\nLord Houchen denied allegations he shied away from campaigning as a Conservative or the prime minister in his campaign literature.\nWhen asked whether the Conservatives could win another term in government, he told the BBC: \"There's always a chance but the government needs to do a lot better at delivering for people... We need to give them the excuse to vote for us.\"\nFormer vice-chair of the Conservative party Ben Bradley lost his bid to become the first mayor of the East Midlands. Labour's Claire Ward, the former MP for Watford, won the election with a 52,000 vote majority.\nLabour's Kim McGuinness had a comfortable win in the race to become the first mayor of the North East.\nAnd Labour's David Skaith won the new York and North Yorkshire mayoral election - which includes Mr Sunak's Richmond constituency - with a majority of almost 15,000 over the Conservatives.\nMost other mayoral results - including London, where Labour's Sadiq Khan is aiming to win a third term - will come on Saturday.\nConservative MP Dame Andrea Jenkyns, a longstanding critic of Mr Sunak, urged him to listen to the electorate and change course, saying the party needed to \"wake up, be conservative, or we lose\".\nBut fellow Tory MP for Cleethorpes, Martin Vickers, backed Mr Sunak's leadership and called the idea of changing leader \"complete madness\" just months away from a general election.\nLabour will be particularly pleased to have regained control of key council targets Hartlepool, Thurrock, Rushmoor and Redditch - areas where they are aiming to win at the general election later this year.  \nBut, there is evidence that Labour's stance on Gaza is hurting the party in areas with a significant Muslim population.\nIn Oldham, where two Labour councillors quit the party over Gaza earlier this year, Labour lost control of the council. \nLabour MP Pat McFadden, the party's national campaign coordinator, admitted \"strong feelings\" around the Middle East were \"a factor\" in the losses, adding: \"I don't think there's any point denying that  - it does get raised\".\nThe Workers Party of Britain, which has fiercely attacked Labour over its Gaza position, won four council seats including in Manchester where it defeated Labour's deputy leader of the council. \nReform UK is doing well in the areas where it has fielded candidates - and nearly beat the Tories into second place in Blackpool South. \nReform leader Richard Tice said the results showed his party \"is rapidly becoming the real opposition to Labour\". \nThe Green Party is also performing well and heading for a record number of councillors. \nThe Liberal Democrats won Tunbridge Wells, but failed to take one of its other key target areas of Wokingham.\nLib Dem Leader Sir Ed Davey said his party's \"general election campaign starts today\".\nSpeaking in Winchester, Sir Ed said: \"The votes are still being counted, but the message from across the country is loud and clear: people from around our great country have had enough of this out of touch Conservative government.\"\nVoters are switching to the Liberal Democrats because they \"have had enough of being taken for granted and being let down\", he added.\nThe by-election in Blackpool South was triggered by the resignation of former Conservative MP Scott Benton, who was suspended from the party after being caught in a lobbying sting.\nLabour candidate Chris Webb overturned a majority of 3,690 to defeat Conservative David Jones in the constituency, which was previously h",
    "Ever felt your contribution at work goes unnoticed? Try being a stunt actor.\nThey're some of the unsung heroes of the film industry, regularly risking their bodies and even their lives to thrill audiences.\nAnd when it all goes according to plan, you're not supposed to notice them.\n\"The better they are at their job, the more they disappear,\" Ryan Gosling told the BBC earlier this week.\nThe Canadian actor plays title character Colt Seavers in new blockbuster The Fall Guy - the story of a stuntman who gets seriously hurt on a film set.\nWith some exceptions such as Tom Cruise, who famously insists on doing almost all his own stunts, doubles usually take the place of A-list stars in the most nail-biting scenes.\nAnd The Fall Guy was no exception.\nSo both Ryan and and co-star Emily Blunt said they'd back calls for stunt performers to have their own category at the Oscars.\n\"They dress like us, they do the dangerous things for us.

But I cannot and will not take responsibility or apologise to anyone who's made up stuff about me or exaggerated stories about me,\" Mr Spacey told Mr Wootton. \n\"I've never told someone that if they give me sexual favours, then I will help them out with their career, ever,\" he said. \n\"I've clearly hooked up with, you know, some men who thought they might get ahead in their careers by having a relationship with me. But there was no conversation with me, it was all part of their plan, one that was always destined to fail, because I wasn't in on the deal.\"\nSpacey Unmasked, a Channel 4 documentary, is due to be released next week.\nActors Ruari Cannon and Danny De Lillo are among those featured in the documentary. Both have given interviews published today alleging inappropriate behaviour by Mr Spacey. \nMr Cannon alleges that in 2013, Mr Spacey touched him inappropriately in public at a press night for an Old Vic theatre production. Mr Spacey said the allegation was \"ridiculous and it never happened\". \nMr De Lillo alleges the actor thrust his groin towards his face while he was seated at a production at the same theatre. Mr Spacey said he found the accusation \"completely offensive\". \n\"There were certainly times when I was inappropriate and flirty with people I worked with at that theatre, a few I had consensual liaisons with,\" he said.\nA number of other allegations from the documentary were put to Mr Spacey, who denied accusations of illegal behaviour in all cases.\n\"Were there times when I would flirt with some of the people who were involved in those programmes who were in their 20s? Yes. Did I ever hook up with another actor? Yes. Did I make a clumsy pass at someone who wasn't interested as it turned out? Yes.\"\nHe added: \"That may not have been the best decision and it's not one that I would do today. But it happened. It wasn't illegal, and nor has it ever been alleged to have been illegal.\"\nIn a statement released on Friday night, lawyers acting for Mr Spacey said there was no public interest in the public being misinformed with the publication of \"false and unverified allegations\" which were \"largely historic, dating as far back as almost 50 years ago\".\nMr Spacey, the lawyers said, had \"not been provided with anything more than very general, anonymised information\" about the claims and had been left \"with little choice but to make his own public statement\" in the form of his interview with Mr Wootton.\nMr Spacey said accusations against him by Anthony Rapp, who accused him of sexual assault, did not happen. If they did, Mr Spacey said \"when I was in my twenties, it would have been simply embarrassing but not criminal\". \nIn 2022, a New York court dismissed a sexual assault lawsuit against Mr Spacey by Mr Rapp, who alleged the actor inappropriately touched him at a party in 1986 when he was aged 14.\nLast year, in a separate trial in London, Mr Spacey was cleared of nine sexual offence charges relating to four men between 2001 and 2013.\nThe Hollywood star won best actor Oscar in 2000 for American Beauty, and best supporting actor in 1995 for The Usual Suspects.\nHe was also the artistic director at the Old Vic Theatre in London between 2004 and 2015.\nIn a statement, the Old Vic said it had conducted an investigation in 2017 into alleged inappropriate conduct by Kevin Spacey at the theatre between 2005 and 2013. \n\"There were no findings of fact regarding the alleged misconduct and there is no evidence of any formal complaints being made against Kevin Spacey during his tenure,\" the theatre said, adding that it took responsibility for what came to light and publicly apologised. \nMr Spacey's career came to a halt in 2017 after a number of accusations of inappropriate behaviour were made against him.\nAt the time, he had the starring role of Frank Underwood in Netflix political drama House of Cards, which he lost.\nMr Wootton, a former editor of the Sun's Bizarre column, last year admitted making \"errors of judgement\" following reported claims about payments to media colleagues for explicit material, but he strongly denied criminality.",
    "Twisted scraps of metal, large splinters of wood and misplaced mattresses are all that remains of what were once people's homes in Mukuru Wa Reuben slum in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. \nAcross the wider Nairobi County, hundreds of people have also seen their homes knocked down.\nThe demolitions follow a government order for anyone living near rivers to leave their homes and move to higher ground in the wake of heavy rains and flooding, which have ravaged East Africa over numerous weeks.\nSlums make up the majority of neighbourhoods built on marginal land along river valleys. \nThe government has said the demolitions were necessary in order to prevent further deaths. It also argued that living within 40m of the banks of a river is illegal.\nEarlier, authorities gave people in earmarked areas 24 hours to evacuate - a deadline that expired on Friday evening. \nHowever, many residents told the BBC they were caught by surprise and that their homes were demolished before the cut-off point. \nNicholas, a casual labourer, came home from work to find his house decimated.\nVisibly still in shock, he said: \"It's so painful. They should have given us time to get money and figure out how to plan ourselves at the very least. \n\"But to give us short notice, and we are working, it is not fair at all.\"\nLike Nicholas, mother of two Phylis said she was trying to work out where to go and how to transport the belongings she had managed to salvage.\n\"I have children, they haven't eaten anything. I'm a single mother... they've destroyed our way of living,\" she said angrily.\nThose who witnessed the demolitions told the BBC the army was responsible, while footage published by local media appear to show men in military fatigues overseeing the destruction. The army has not commented. \nBut government spokesperson Isaac Mwaura said: \"These are the same people who are dying. These are people who are being affected by these floods.\n\"Sometimes when the water subsides then people go back to their buildings. So as a government we just have to be very clear and very categorical.\"\nAlthough parts of Mukuru Wa Reuben have been razed, and despite the flood warnings, residents like Nicholas said they would camp by their destroyed homes on Friday night as they had nowhere else to go.\nThe government says it has relocated just under 27,600 people forced from their homes by the floods in newly built camps.\nSome 210 people across the country have died as a result of the floods, with a further 90 missing, according to the latest official estimates. Just this week, more than 50 people were killed when a tide of water swept through villages near the capital. \nTorrential rains are forecast to continue throughout the month and 178 dams and water reservoirs pose a high risk of overflowing, the authorities have warned.\nWhat is more, President William Ruto has warned the nation it could be about to experience its first ever cyclone, with Hidaya gaining momentum along the Tanzanian coast on Friday.\nIn a televised address, he ordered that schools be shut indefinitely.\nIn neighbouring Tanzania, government spokesman Mobhare Matinyi told the BBC the authorities were on standby and prepared to evacuate people living in coastal areas at risk from the cyclone, which could hit the biggest city, Dar es Salaam.\nResidents have been urged to exercise caution.\nOther places likely to be affected by the impact of the cyclone include Mtwara, Lindi, Tanga, and  Zanzibar.  \nThe country's meteorological agency, TMA, said on Friday that the cyclone was expected to cause heavy rains and strong winds.

    "Riot police have forcibly removed pro-Palestinian protesters taking part in a sit-in at France's prestigious Sciences Po University in Paris.\nProtesters had occupied some buildings to demand that the university cut ties with Israel over the way it is conducting its war in the Gaza Strip. \nAfter their removal, groups headed to the Panth\u00e9on to continue their action.\nPro-Palestinian protests have been taking part in university campuses in several countries, most notably the US, over the past few days.\n\nIn Paris, dozens of riot police went into the buildings on Friday morning. \nThey came out with defiant protesters.\nOne of them said officials had given them an ultimatum to leave within 20 minutes, but that students had defied the order.\nParis police said  \"91 people were removed without incident\".\nPrime Minister Gabriel Attal's office was equally determined, saying the authorities would deal with such protests firmly.\n\nSciences Po closed its main buildings on Friday in response to the sit-in.\nA spokesperson said some of the Sciences Po campuses in Reims, Le Havre and Poitiers were also affected by protests.\nSimilar protests were held in Lyons and Lille.\nBut the protests in France have been more contained than in the US, a point emphasised by Mr Attal on Thursday.\n\"In contrast to what we see abroad, namely across the Atlantic, no permanent protest camp... has been established in France,\" the prime minister said.\nHe was referring to the days-long camps set up in several American universities, which police have had to dismantle with the arrest of hundreds of people.\nIsrael has come under increasing criticism for conditions in the Gaza Strip. \nA UN-backed assessment said last month that 1.1 million people were facing catastrophic hunger and that famine was imminent in northern Gaza.\nThe UN's most senior human rights official, Volker T\u00fcrk, has told the BBC that there is a \"plausible\" case that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza.\nIsrael denies limiting aid deliveries and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute it to those in need inside Gaza.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 34,600 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nOn Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Israel and Hamas that \"the time is now\" for a deal to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza and free the remaining hostages held there. He said a deal was on the table and Hamas should agree to it.\nMediators are awaiting a response from Hamas to the latest proposal.\nIt reportedly involves a 40-day ceasefire and the release of more than 30 Israeli hostages in exchange for many more Palestinian prisoners.",
    "The labelling of Japan as \"xenophobic\" by Joe Biden was \"unfortunate\" and \"not based on an accurate\" understanding of the country, Japan's US embassy says. \nThe US president said during a campaign fundraising event earlier this week that Japan, India, China and Russia \"don't want immigrants\". \nThe White House has said he meant no offence and was merely highlighting US immigration policies. \nThe comment, however, has drawn scorn from some US and foreign observers.\nSpeaking to a largely Asian-American audience on Wednesday, Mr Biden said: \"Why is China stalling so badly economically? Why is Japan having trouble. Why is Russia? Why is India? Because they're xenophobic. They don't want immigrants.\"\nThe US government later clarified that his comment was meant in the context of explaining \"that the US is a nation of immigrants and that immigrants make the US stronger\", and did not have \"the intent of undermining\" the US-Japan relationship. \nJapan's embassy said on Friday that it was \"aware\" of the clarification. \n\"It is unfortunate that some of the comments were not based on an accurate understanding of Japan's policies,\" the statement added. \nJapan's traditionally strict immigration policies have been loosened in recent years to to address a steadily shrinking population.\nMr Biden's comments came less than a month after he called the US-Japan alliance \"unbreakable\" during a state visit by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to Washington. \nThe embassy said the visit showed that the US-Japan relationship was \"stronger than ever\". \nMr Biden's comments were also criticised by China.\nChen Weihua, a prominent columnist for the state-owned China Daily, said on X, formerly Twitter, that the US president was \"obsessed with smearing China... It's a serious mental disease.\"\nIndia's government has not directly responded to Mr Biden's comments. However, Madhavan Narayanan, an Indian economist and journalist, told the Abu Dhabi-based National newspaper that it was \"incorrect\" to say his country does not want immigrants.\n\"India has been attractive either for the high-end expats or for the extremely low-wage kind of immigrants from Bangladesh and poor countries,\" he said. \nOpinion polls indicate widespread dissatisfaction among US voters over Mr Biden's handling of the US-Mexico border.",
    "Foreign interference is a \"stain\" on Canada's electoral process and undermined the right to a system free from \"coercion or covert influence\", a public inquiry has found. \nIts report also found that China \"stands out as a main perpetrator\" of such interference.\nThe inquiry investigated meddling in Canada's last two general elections, in 2019 and 2021.\nBut it did not find the outcome of the votes had been affected.\n\"Our systems remain sound,\" said Commissioner Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue at a press conference, following the report's release on Friday.\n\"Voters were able to cast their ballots, their votes were duly registered and counted, and there is nothing to suggest that there was any interference whatsoever in this regard.\"\nThe preliminary report is the first of two expected by the commission. \nIt explores foreign meddling in the two elections as well as how information on interference was handled by senior officials during the election period.\nThe report says China \"clandestinely leveraged\" Canadian officials in an effort to help its \"favoured\" candidates win office in 2019. \nChina did so by using Canada-based officials as \"proxy agents\" to exclude \"political candidates perceived as 'anti-China' from attending\" local election-related events, the report says.\nThe report also says intelligence assessments indicated at least two transfers of funds - roughly $250,000 (\u00a3192,000) each - from Chinese officials in Canada, \"possibly for foreign interference-related purposes\".\nAnother of the foreign-meddling tactics mentioned in the report is the targeting of diaspora Canadians by threatening their families in their countries of origin. It accused both China and Russia.\nThe 194-page document is based on the first phase of hearings by the inquiry, which in April heard public testimony by witnesses including members of parliament, national security officials, senior government aides and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\nIn his testimony, Mr Trudeau defended his government's efforts to ensure election integrity and said the 2019 and 2021 federal votes were \"free and fair\" and decided only by Canadians.\nThe commission also held hearings behind closed doors on classified intelligence related to the matter. \nIn the public hearings, Canadians learned some of the ways China and other foreign governments could have attempted to interfere in the last two elections.\nIn one briefing note at the inquiry, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) said the Chinese government \"clandestinely and deceptively\" interfered in both elections.\nThe intelligence service has cautioned that the declassified information could be single-sourced, incomplete and with \"varying degrees of reliability\". \nSome of the allegations heard by the inquiry include: \nChina and India have repeatedly denied any allegations that they are among the countries that have interfered in Canada's affairs.\nThose affected by the alleged meddling efforts have accused officials and CSIS of not doing enough to combat it, or of keeping them in the dark altogether.\nThere will be more hearings this autumn with a final report by the inquiry expected at the end of the year.

The Home Office expects the highest standards from contractors and will not hesitate to take robust action when necessary.\"\nProtesters say that Bibby Stockholm is not a suitable place to house asylum seekers, and those due to be taken there had built relations in the community in Peckham and did not want to be moved.\nThe Home Office abandoned plans to move a group of asylum seekers to the Bibby barge in the wake of protests in Margate last week.",

    "As Ely in Cambridgeshire celebrates its annual Eel Festival this weekend, what is the future of the now critically endangered fish that provided the city with its name? \nEels are not found in Cambridgeshire's River Great Ouse in anything like the numbers they once were.\nHistorically, the fish was a staple of the local diet, as well as providing a valuable source of income for the fishing industry.\nThat was in a large part due to the popularity of jellied eels as a dish, with clients regularly travelling to Ely from around the country to sample it.\nFrom Saturday to Monday, the city will celebrate that heritage at its annual Eel Festival with a series of events, including stalls, re-enactments, singing and dancing.\nBut stocks in the River Great Ouse have now dwindled and the city's last commercial eel catcher retired in 2014.\nPopulations of the European eel, seen as an important indicator of waterways health and freshwater habitats, have been declining for decades and the fish is a classed as a critically endangered species.\nAttempts have been made to boost numbers with conservation plans put in place. by the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs.\nIn 2022, the Environment Agency said it had recorded 74,000 eels passing through a monitoring station on the River Great Ouse.\nScientist David Righton, who studies the fish, said he was hopeful about its future.\nEuropean Union regulations aimed at protecting eel stocks, which have fallen 95% since the 1980s, came into force nearly a decade ago.\nDr Righton works for the Centre for Environmental Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), which has a base in Lowestoft, Suffolk.\nDr Righton said: \"There have been many ecological changes and fluctuations in the course of their evolution.\n\"Over time they have endured a range of very significant ecological changes on a large geographic scale.\n \"They are a very resilient species on a day-to-day level. They can survive a very wide range of conditions and are very tolerant to many different environmental extremes.\"\nDr Righton also said eels could live for a \"very, very long\" time and had a \"complicated\" life cycle.\n\"There are tales of eels that have lived over 100 years,\" he said.\n\"They tend to be very long living as a freshwater fish species in general.\"\nDr Righton said the Defra's eel management plan gave hope for the fish.\n\"The eel management plan is set up to last for decades and the recovery is expected to last for decades, rather than to see an effect very quickly,\" he said.\n\"I still have a sense of optimism. We have got the right plan in place.\n\"We may start to see positive change in the next 20 years.\"\nDan Hayter, an eel specialist at the Environment Agency, outlined some of the difficulties eels faced - and some of the work being done to protect them.\nIn an online blog, he said barriers, weirs and sluices were problematic for eels as they disrupted the natural flow of rivers and could prevent or slow  migration. \nLoss of habitat was another factor.\nHe said there was less wetland and floodplain \"connectivity\". \nEel \"passes\" had been created, he said, to help eels get from the sea into the freshwater habitats and then back again as adults,\nMr Hayter said pumping stations could be very damaging.\n\"The Environment Agency is involved in many natural flood management projects which reduce flooding for people but also improve the habitat for the eels, whilst improving biodiversity,\" he wrote.\nGot a story?

    "A 15-year-old boy has been found guilty of murdering Leeds teenager Alfie Lewis in a fatal stabbing.\nAlfie, also 15, died in hospital after being knifed in the heart in Church Road, Horsforth, last November.\nWitnesses described seeing Alfie being pushed to the ground by the boy before being stabbed twice \"in full view\" of a group of school children.\nThe boy was convicted following a trial at Leeds Crown Court and will be sentenced in June.\nSobs were heard from Alfie's family in the public gallery, who hugged each other as the verdict was announced. \nMost were wearing T-shirts with pictures of Alfie, saying \"Forever 15\".\nThe judge, Mr Justice Cotter, told the defendant: \"You have been found guilty of murder.\n\"There is only one sentence I can pass. What I have to determine is how many years you will be detained before you are able to be released.\"\nThe boy, who had denied murder instead saying it was him who was scared when he pulled the weapon, showed no visible emotion as the verdict was read out. \nHe later held hands with his parents through a gap in the dock glass before being taken away.\nFollowing the verdict a statement from Alfie's family was read outside court by his brother Antony Lewis.\nIn the statement he thanked the police, emergency services, prosecutors and and the wider community of Horsforth for their \"compassion and support\".\n\"Most of all we would like to say 'thank you' to our Alfie, for giving us all your love, joy, and humour and making us smile every day in the 15 years we had to enjoy and love you. \n\"You are always in our hearts and our minds, and until we are all together again keep dancing in the sky our beautiful boy. \n\"We miss you and we love you, always.\"\nDuring the two-week trial, the jury of five men and seven women heard that Alfie was attacked near Horsforth School just before 15:00 GMT on 7 November 2023 while on his way to meet some friends.\nProsecutor Craig Hassall KC said the defendant, who was 14 at the time, had walked \"purposefully\" towards Alfie before stabbing him, using a knife he had taken from a kitchen drawer at home.\nHe said witnesses recalled Alfie looking \"surprised and shocked\" and asking the defendant \"what are you doing?\".\nAlfie was left fatally injured in the road as children from nearby St Margaret's Primary School in Town Street left for the day or waited to be collected.\nA post-mortem examination revealed the fatal stab injury was a 5.5in (14cm) wound to Alfie's chest, which punctured his heart.\nDet Ch Insp Stacey Atkinson said there had been nothing which could have justified the \"murderous violence\" Alfie's attacker used to end his life.\nShe said: \"Alfie was only 15 years old and was not involved in gangs or any other criminality that could have put him at risk of knife crime.\n\"He had simply gone to meet his friends from school and was not looking for a confrontation with anyone.\"\nMs Atkinson said the youth convicted of Alfie's murder had launched \"a deliberate and determined attack, repeatedly stabbing Alfie, who was completely defenceless, leaving him fatally wounded\".\nThe convicted boy will be sentenced on 21 June.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "Hen and stag dos are known for getting out of hand, but it\u2019s not often you expect to be kidnapped, bound and covered in gunk.\nThe pre-wedding tradition in northern Scotland, called a Blackening, is known for taking disgusting behaviour to another level.\nFriends and family seize the engaged couple and gunk them with anything from rotten eggs and fish guts to manure and molasses.\nOrkney Islands Council has now issued a warning to stags and hens leaving public toilets in a mess after the blackenings.\nThe local authority says it is creating extra work for cleaners, and inconveniencing residents and tourists who need to use them.\nHowever, Orkney council says it remains supportive of the tradition, with wedding groups celebrating in its largest town, Kirkwall, most weekends in summer.\nThe tradition originally began as a cleansing ritual among the farming communities of rural Scotland to prepare women for marriage.\nIt involved washing feet after blackening them with soot from the chimney.\nEllie Ordish, who lives near Dingwall, says she hopes the tradition continues for years to come.\nEllie and her partner Gavin Smith marked their upcoming nuptials in June by standing in an old bathtub in a field while their friends tipped manure, eggs and molasses over their heads.\nOriginally from Lincolnshire, Ellie had never heard of a blackening until she moved north in 2023.\nBut the pair were lured in with an invite to Gavin\u2019s family home for his sister\u2019s birthday dinner, which turned out to be a surprise blackening.\n\u201cThey asked us to gather round for a birthday picture,\" she said.\n\u201cI thought it was a bit weird that we were in the middle of the group on Chloe\u2019s birthday and they told us to say 'happy birthday' after the count of three.\n\u201cBut after three, they all shouted \u2018happy blackening\u2019 and grabbed us both.\u201d\nThe couple were separated and given clothes to change into before being bound with cable ties.\nThen they were taken to a field belonging to one of Gavin\u2019s groomsmen and told to stand in a muddy bathtub spray-painted with the words \u2018Gav + Ellie\u2019.\nWith just one drink each to take the edge off, a crowd of their friends started throwing food at them.\n\u201cWe were covered in all sorts of things, I highly suspect blood since they\u2019re farmers,\u201d said Ellie.\n\u201cBut the worst part - amongst all the flour, eggs, food and manure - was the molasses.\n\u201cIt stinks. I still get whiffs of it and I can\u2019t work out if it\u2019s in my mind or not.\u201d\nAfter the ordeal, the pair were hosed down and taken home dressed in bin bags, before being allowed to shower and taken to the pub.\n\u201cIt was hilarious and I had a brilliant time,\u201d she added.\n\u201cMy skin was weirdly glowing for days afterwards so maybe there\u2019s some kind of skin treatment in there.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ll never forget - embedded in my mind along with the smell of molasses.\u201d\nAshley Gormley, from Greenock, moved to Shapinsay in Orkney three years ago with her partner Craig.\nThe pair got engaged and the locals started mentioning the possibility of a whitening - Shapinsay\u2019s version of a blackening.\nThe 33-year-old was certain they wouldn\u2019t get her as her wedding in July 2023 approached.\nBut two weeks before the big day, she spotted a crowd of her friends running towards her when she got off the boat after work.\n\u201cThey grabbed me and gave me a hairnet and gown,\u201d she said. \u201cThen they dragged me to the beach and started throwing flour, porridge and eggs at me.\n\u201cAfterwards someone came with a trailer and we drove about the island hitting pans and making noise.\n\u201cThen we got to the school and they had put up a tent and called it AshleyFest.\u201d\nShe said it was a total surprise but \u201cgreat fun\u201d, with people from across the island coming down to join in.\n\u201cFrom now on in Kirkwall, every weekend you\u2019ll see a group of boys or girls going about in the back of a truck making loads of noise and confusing the tourists,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really good time but it still seems a bit surreal.\u201d\nOrkney Island Council said it is  \"all part and parcel of getting married in the county\".\nIt said in a statement: \"We don\u2019t want to be the party poopers, but the public toilets are being left in an awful mess as a result of the blackening clear-ups.\n\"It creates additional work for our cleaners, not to mention inconveniencing local folk and tourists who need to use them.\"",

    "A company that runs Plymouth's fish market is set to cease trading in three weeks.\nStaff at Plymouth Trawler Agents (PTA) received redundancy letters on Friday morning informing them the business would cease trading on 17 May.\nThe firm was set up in 1994 and has about 100 shareholders, a board of six directors and about 24 employees.\nPTA has been contacted for comment but has yet to reply.

    "People living near the site of a proposed new 5,000-seater sport stadium in Sheffield have said they are worried over the effect it could have on the area.\nSheffield FC announced plans for the stadium complex, at the former Sheffield Transport Sports Club site in Meadowhead, last November.\nHowever, some local residents have since told the BBC of their concerns over extra traffic, noise pollution and possible parking problems if the plans get the go-ahead.\nSheffield FC chairman Richard Tims said there were \"more people supporting the application than are against us\".\nThe world's oldest football club, Sheffield FC was founded in 1857, but currently plays its home games in Dronfield, Derbyshire.\nThe planned new facility would see the club return to its home city and it would be shared with the Sheffield Eagles rugby league team.\nThe club said the new complex would also include a cricket ground, a football museum and an indoor community sports hall.\nAnnouncing the plans last year, Mr Tims said it would \"become an international visitor attraction for football and rugby league fans alike and provide an insight into the history and heritage of both clubs\".\nWhile over 150 comments supporting the application have so far been registered on Sheffield Council's planning portal, over 130 objections have also been raised.\nLocal residents have expressed fears over the possibility of increased traffic to an already busy area.\nWendy Nutbrown, who lives opposite the site, told the BBC that the new proposals \u201cput the fear of God into me\".\n\"Crossing Meadowhead, even in a car, is like taking your life into your  hands. The volume of traffic is at a tipping point. Any more will be absolutely horrendous,\u201d she said.\nMeanwhile, Jillian Wallace, co-owner of Meadowhead Meats, near Meadowhead roundabout, said she was also worried about an increase in traffic the new stadium could bring.\n\"It\u2019s madness with the roundabout and St James' Retail Park, it\u2019s a nightmare,\" she said.\n\"There's loads of accidents already. Lots of customers around here don\u2019t want it. They think house prices are going to go down.\"\nAnother local resident, Andrew Throssell, said while he had fond memories of the Transport ground as a child, the new proposals would deprive people of some important green space.\n \u201cSheffield has a reputation, rightly, for being a beautiful green city,\" he said.\n\"Now, the first thing you're going to see coming in off the A61 is a dirty great big stadium in a residential space.\"\nReg Jones, who lives in Meadowhead, said despite the signage around the site, the focus on Sheffield FC was \"misleading\".\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the home of football at all. The proposal is all to do with Sheffield Eagles. \n\"The average crowd in Super League is 9,000, Sheffield FC are lucky to get 800 fans. This is the wrong place for a stadium of this size.\u201d\nSheffield Eagles director of rugby, Mark Aston, previously said the planned new ground would help with the Rugby Football League's new grading system, which took into account stadium facilities as well as league position.\nSpeaking in November, he said: \"Sheffield Eagles are very excited to be part of this joint venture with Sheffield FC and to be at the heart of this world-class development.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Sheffield on Friday, Mr Tims said: \"I know nobody wants their lives to change but we have spent lots of money doing traffic surveys and reports for the council.\n\"The times we play and the Eagles play will have no impact on Meadowhead roundabout.\n\"The site has been derelict for years.

    "As Donald Trump sat at the defence table in the wood-panelled Manhattan courtroom over the past several weeks, he was joined by a cast of characters who featured in a type of Hollywood blockbuster.\nThere were a slate of intriguing potential witnesses, including an adult film actress, a fixer-turned-star-witness, a loyal money-man convicted of tax fraud and others.\nA white-collar defence lawyer who bet his career on defending Mr Trump was leading the former president's defence team. Meanwhile, Manhattan's first black district attorney assembled a crack team of Manhattan prosecutors who were very familiar with Mr Trump and his organisation.\nAnd the entire case was overseen by a seasoned New York Supreme Court judge who was well aware of Mr Trump's courtroom troubles and behaviour.\nMr Trump faces 34 charges of falsifying business records to disguise a hush-money payment to a woman with whom he allegedly had an affair. He has pleaded not guilty and denies having the affair. Below are the central players to know in the historic case.\nStormy Daniels - the adult film star - says she met Mr Trump in 2006 at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada. Ms Daniels - real name Stephanie Clifford - was 27 at the time, and a rising star in the adult film industry. She claims that Mr Trump propositioned her, and the two had sex soon after their introduction.\nMr Trump denies the encounter happened, but Ms Daniels alleges that a $130,000 (\u00a3105,000) hush-money payment she received from Michael Cohen - a lawyer for the Trump Organization - just before the 2016 election was to keep her silent about the encounter.\nSince her allegations became public, she has become a frequent target of Mr Trump and his allies, but she remained committed to testifying against the former president.\nShe took the stand for two days, sharing a host of lurid details about the alleged sexual encounter, providing context leading up to the hush-money payment. \nMichael Cohen - the fixer -  started working as Mr Trump's personal lawyer in 2006. He pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance crimes in 2018 over making the hush-money payment to Ms Daniels, but he maintains that he sent the money at Mr Trump's direction.\nHe told the court that the former president aimed to conceal the scheme and avoid scandal by reimbursing him via a series of payments that were recorded as legal income. Mr Trump has called his former confidant a liar, and his legal team attempted to attack Cohen's credibility during cross-examination.\nAt one time, Cohen said he would take a bullet for the former president. But he later became a key witness in investigations of Mr Trump - including Robert Mueller's probe into allegations of the Trump campaign colluding with the Kremlin.\nDavid Pecker - the tabloid publisher - is former CEO of American Media Inc (AMI), the parent company of the National Enquirer. When he led that tabloid, he pursued a practice known as \"catch-and-kill\" to support Mr Trump's 2016 presidential run. He did this by buying the rights to stories that cast Mr Trump in a bad light, he told the court. He would then decline to publish them, which effectively suppressed the damaging information. He was the trial's first witness.\nKaren McDougal - the Playboy model - claims to have had an illicit affair with Mr Trump in 2006 and 2007, which the former president also denies. She says she was paid $150,000 by American Media Inc, the parent company of the National Enquirer, for her story. It forced her to keep quiet about the purported tryst.\nHope Hicks - the former White House aide - shed tears during her time on the stand, detailing the behind-the-scenes fallout of the hush-money payment scandal. A former press secretary for Mr Trump's 2016 campaign, Ms Hicks helped corroborate testimony from other witnesses as one of Mr Trump's former close confidantes.\nMs Hicks also was privy to the details of the hush-money payment to Ms McDougal. \nDino Sajudin - the former Trump Tower doorman - did not end up taking the stand. But Mr Trump's team allegedly paid him hush-money as well, after he tried to sell a story to the National Enquirer about an unsubstantiated rumour that Mr Trump once fathered a child out of wedlock.  \nJustice Juan Merchan - the seasoned New York jurist - has previously spent time with Mr Trump in a Manhattan courtroom. He presided over the Trump Organization's tax fraud case that resulted in a hefty fine and jail time for the company's chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg.\nThat means the judge is well acquainted with Mr Trump's orbit and his courtroom tactics to delay, deny and deflect. That behaviour likely will draw Justice Merchan's ire. While he may be soft-spoken, he has earned the reputation of being a no-nonsense jurist. \nHe has issued several warnings to Mr Trump over his behaviour and threatened to kick a Trump ally and witness off the stand for giving him \"side-eye\". \nMeanwhile, Mr Trump has claimed on social media that \"there has virtually never been a ",
    "Political attacks on journalists are increasing across the globe, according to the annual World Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders.\nThese attacks include the detention of journalists, the spreading of misinformation and suppression of independent voices.\nWith more than half of the world\u2019s population going to the polls in 2024, governments are failing to protect journalism, the organisation says.\nThe report comes as the BBC warned that over 300 of its journalists were now working in exile from their home countries, amid increasing attacks on their reporting. \n\"Some political groups fuel hatred and distrust of journalists by insulting them, discrediting them, and threatening them,\" the organisation - known by its French acronym RSF - said.\nRSF\u2019s index ranks 180 countries on the ability for journalists to work without interference or threats.\nNorway retained its spot at the top and \u201cinformation desert\u201d Eritrea came bottom, taking over from last year\u2019s lowest-ranked nation, North Korea. The bottom 10 also includes China, Iran, Afghanistan, and Syria.\nDenmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, Estonia, Portugal, Ireland, Switzerland and Germany rounded out the top 10. \nThe UK rose three places to 23, with RSF criticising the dominant role held by News UK, Reach Plc and Daily Mail and General Trust in the market. \nAuthoritarian regimes across the Middle East have been tightening their grip on news and information with \u201cincreasing vigour\u201d, according to the report.\nFour of the world\u2019s biggest jailers of journalists, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Iran, are in the region and continue to detain newsgatherers, according to the RSF report.\nAt least 100 journalists have been killed in Gaza between 7 October 2023 and 1 May 2024, according to the RSF.\nThe United States (55) has fallen 10 places ahead of elections due to increasing attacks on journalists from political players.\nThe report also criticised the \"highly concentrated\" model of US media ownership, adding that \"many of the companies buying American media outlets appear to prioritize profits over public interest journalism\". \nIn Russia (ranked 162), RSF says the state continues a \u201ccrusade\u201d against journalism with more than 1,500 journalists fleeing abroad since the illegal invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nThe reports comes as the number of BBC World Service journalists forced to work in exile has doubled since 2020, reflecting press crackdowns in Russia, Afghanistan, and Ethiopia.

    "Turkey has suspended all trade with Israel over its offensive in Gaza, citing the \"worsening humanitarian tragedy\" in the strip. \nThe Turkish trade ministry said the measures would be in place until Israel allowed an \"uninterrupted and sufficient flow\" of aid into Gaza. \nTrade between the two countries was worth almost $7bn (\u00a35.6bn) last year.\nIsrael's foreign minister accused Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of acting like a \"dictator\".\nIsrael Katz said on X that Mr Erdogan was \"disregarding the interests of the Turkish people and businessmen and ignoring international trade agreements\".\nHe added that he had instructed the foreign ministry to find alternatives for trade with Turkey, with a focus on local production and imports from other countries.\nThe ministry also says it will also take action to reduce economic connections between Turkey and the Palestinian Authority and Gaza, the BBC understands. \nTurkish Trade Minister Omer Bolat criticised Israel's \"uncompromising attitude\" towards a ceasefire, as well as the humanitarian situation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah: \"Turkey has suspended all export and import with Israel until a permanent ceasefire is established and the aid into the Gaza is allowed without any interruption.\"\nIn 1949, Turkey was the first Muslim-majority country to recognise Israel. But relations have worsened in recent decades. \nIn 2010, Turkey broke off diplomatic ties with Israel after 10 pro-Palestinian Turkish activists were killed in clashes with Israeli commandos who boarded a Turkish-owned ship trying to break Israel's maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip.\nRelations were restored in 2016, but both countries expelled each other's top diplomats two years later in a dispute over Israel's killing of Palestinians amid protests on the Gaza-Israel border.\nMr Erdogan has become increasingly strident in his criticism of Israel since the deadly Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October last year.\nHe has repeatedly criticised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, comparing him to Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini and Joseph Stalin and dubbing him \"the butcher of Gaza\".  \nMr Netanyahu has said Turkey's leader is the last person who can preach morality to Israel. In March he said President Erdogan \"supports the mass murderers and rapists of Hamas, denies the Armenian genocide [and] massacres Kurds in his own country\".\nThe Turkish leader has for months come under domestic political pressure to announce measures against Israel, from both opponents and allies. \nHis ruling AK party suffered its worst defeat in two decades in local elections at the end of March, and many religious voters supported the Islamist New Welfare party, which had called for hardline measures against Israel.\nNot long after the vote, Turkey imposed restrictions on 54 products being exported to Israel, from iron and steel to jet fuel, pesticides and construction equipment. \nThe trade ministry in Ankara said on Thursday that the action was now being extended to all exports and imports. Israel was Turkey's 13th biggest export market in 2023, receiving 2.1% of Turkish exports last year. Turkey was Israel's fifth biggest source of imports last year.\nIsrael has come under increasing criticism for conditions in the Gaza Strip. A UN-backed assessment said last month that 1.1 million people were facing catastrophic hunger and that famine was imminent in northern Gaza by May.\nOn Thursday, the White House said a pier built by the US military to facilitate the flow of aid into the territory would be open within days.\nThe US has published photos showing logistics vessels and personnel assembling the floating pier from steel segments, next to a US Navy ship.\nHowever, the UN says a maritime corridor can never be a substitute for delivery by land, and that land routes are the only way to bring in the bulk of supplies needed.\nEarlier this week, Israel reopened the Erez Crossing into the northern Gaza strip for aid convoys, under pressure from its Western allies and following repeated appeals from international aid organisations.\nHowever, Jordan said some of its aid lorries were attacked by Israeli settlers before reaching the crossing.\nA recent UN-backed report offered hard statistical evidence that the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza was turning into a man-made famine.\nThe UN's most senior human rights official, Volker T\u00fcrk, told the BBC that there was a \"plausible\" case that Israel was using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza.\nIsrael denies limiting aid deliveries and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute it to those in need inside Gaza. \nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 253 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 34,500 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nOn Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Israel and ",
    "The fertility regulator has extended the closure of a London clinic, which is under investigation following the \"tragic loss\" of some embryos. \nHomerton Fertility Centre had its licence suspended in March after some frozen embryos did not survive being thawed or were \"undetectable\".    \nHundreds of patients had their treatment delayed or put on hold. \nThe regulator said it would not let the clinic reopen until it was certain patients could be treated safely.\nThe Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) said it took the rare decision to close the clinic in Hackney on 8 March for an initial period of two months, because of the \"significant concerns\" following \"three serious untoward incidents\".\nThe HFEA said:\nOne patient, Abigail, not her real name, who cannot naturally fall pregnant, had several embryos in storage at the clinic.\nWhen she went to start IVF treatment recently, she was told that the highest quality of them - those most likely to result in a pregnancy - had not survived being thawed.\n\"I just felt so angry and disappointed. It was just really upsetting, we felt like we'd been robbed of time, robbed of our chances,\" she said.\n\"It made us think this was the best chance of having a baby this year and now that's not possible, and it feels like if we had been somewhere else this might not have happened\"\nAbigail said she thought it would be \"worrying\" if the clinic reopened before all the issues had been resolved.\nLike Abigail, another patient Sarah, not her real name, was told some of her embryos had not survived being thawed. \nShe told the BBC: \"We are still waiting for answers and alternatives from Homerton. Since the licence was suspended, their official communication has gone silent. It is very upsetting to think this could be allowed to happen and that patients would be left in the dark, without support or answers.\"\nThe clinic said that while some investigations are complete, the incident in December is still being looked into.\nThe BBC has asked to see the investigation reports.\nHFEA chief executive Peter Thompson has said the clinic's licence should remain suspended until August - longer than initially expected - until all investigations are completed.\n\"Serious incidents in fertility clinics in the UK are rare, but each one is distressing for those patients involved, which is why we take them very seriously,\" he said. \n\"The HFEA investigates what clinics do in response to incidents to make sure that everything is done to understand what went wrong and, crucially, to take steps to ensure it does not happen again.\"\nSince 8 March, the clinic has only been able to treat some patients who had already started cycles of IVF. Many other patients have frozen eggs or embryos in storage there and are waiting for treatment.\nThe clinic has been banned from starting any treatment cycles, and has only been allowed to continue treatment which had already begun.\nHomerton Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust said the incidents had highlighted \"problems in some freezing processes\" and that investigations are continuing.\nIt confirmed that 32 patients had been affected, but that number was \"subject to change as our investigations continue\". \nIn March, the trust told the BBC that as many as 150 embryos may have been affected.\nIts chief executive Bas Sadiq said: \"We want to apologise again for the worry and distress these incidents have caused our patients. \n\"We are focused on continuing our investigations and doing everything we can to learn from and rectify the issues which have caused the loss of embryos in the fertility unit.\" \nThe trust said that since the incidents, staff now have to work in pairs, staff competencies have been checked and security has been increased.\nMetropolitan Police officers visited the clinic on 8 March, after concerns were raised by staff members.\nHowever, there is no police investigation at this time.\nThe trust said all patients have received letters and offered free counselling.\nHomerton Fertility Centre has been under a high level of oversight by the HFEA for several years, because of numerous incidents of \"non-compliance\" identified during inspections.\nPatients also had treatment delayed when the clinic temporarily closed in 2022, because of staff shortages.",

These days, they are a four or five day festivals of debate, socialising and partying - like Glastonbury for political nerds, as someone once said. \nThe guest list features party members, think tanks, trade unions, charities and businesses who come together to share ideas, lobby politicians and debate policies.\nThey also provide fund raising opportunities for the parties - and an invaluable opportunity to get guaranteed media coverage.\nTo make time for conferences in politicians' busy schedules, Parliament usually enters a three week recess in autumn.\nWhat happens at party conferences?\nA lot of talking.\nConferences are jam-packed with speeches and debates. \nBig decisions can be made, particularly for Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who still hold votes on what should be in their election manifestoes.\nThe central event of a party conference is usually the leader's speech.\nHowever, these don't always go to plan\u2026as former PM Theresa May found in 2016 when she struggled with a cough and a protester handing her a redundancy notice, or as Keir Starmer found when he was heckled by protesters.\nWhen and where is the SNP conference?\nThe Scottish National Party conference will be in the Event Complex Aberdeen, from Sunday 15 October to Tuesday 17 October.\nWhen and where was the Labour Party conference?\nThe Labour party conference was in Liverpool from Sunday 8 October to Wednesday 11 October. Last year the conference was in Liverpool as well. \nWhen and where was the Conservative Party conference?\nThe Conservative Party conference was from Sunday 1 October and runs until Wednesday 4 October.\nIt was in Manchester this year, at the Central Convention Complex, which is a conference centre converted from the former Manchester Central railway station.\nYou can see coverage of the Conservative party conference here.\nWhen and where was the Green Party conference?\nThis year's green party conference was held in Brighton from Friday 6 to Sunday 8 October. You can read their conference agenda here.\nWhen and where was the Reform UK conference?\nThe Reform party had their conference on Saturday 7 October for one day in London, Edgware Road.\nWhen and where was the Plaid Cymru party conference?\nPlaid Cymru's party conference was in Aberystwyth on Friday 6 and Saturday 7 October.\nWhen and where was the Liberal Democrat Party conference?\nThe Liberal Democrat conference was held on Saturday 23 September to Tuesday 26 September in the Bournemouth Highcliff Marriott Hotel. \nWhere and how can I watch a party conference?\nThere will be coverage on the BBC News website, including live page coverage.

    "Former White House aide Hope Hicks became emotional towards the end of her testimony Friday afternoon during former US President Donald Trump's hush-money trial. \nMs Hicks served as Mr Trump's campaign spokesperson during 2016 and was a close confidante. \nMr Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal the payment. \nHe has denied all wrongdoing. \nMs Hicks served as the Trump campaign's press secretary and held two stints as the White House communications director. She said after taking the stand in the New York courtroom: \"I'm really nervous.''\nMs Hicks also teared up at one point on the stand after a Trump lawyer asked if a White House position had been created so she could come on board. She returned after taking a short break.  \nHicks testified about her experience working with the former president and learning of the Access Hollywood tape recorded in 2005 that shows Mr Trump saying he could \"grab women\" by their genitals because he was famous. It surfaced weeks before the 2016 presidential election.\nMs Hicks started her testimony by answering questions about the events surrounding the tape's release. \nShe said at the time she was \"a little stunned\" to hear the tape and added she had \"the sense that this was going to be a massive story\".\nThe Washington Post obtained the tape, and the reporter on the story, David Fahrenthold, emailed Ms Hicks asking for comment from Trump's presidential campaign.\nShe testified that his email was her first warning about the tape and reviewed the email on a screen in the courtroom. \nMs. Hicks said she forwarded the email to several top campaign staffers, including Jason Miller, Kellyanne Conway, and Steve Bannon.\nShe said in the email: \"1) Need to hear the tape to be sure. 2) deny, deny, deny\".\nMs Hicks told the court it was a \"reflex\" to write \"deny, deny, deny.''\nCampaign aides then had a meeting, during which they shared the email with Mr Trump, Ms Hicks said.\n\"Everyone was just absorbing the shock of it... He [Trump] said that didn't sound like something he would say,\" Ms Hicks said during her testimony.  \n\"I was concerned, very concerned,\" she told the court.\nBBC News reporters are in the Manhattan courtroom covering the historic first criminal trial of a former US president. You'll find their updates and analysis on the BBC news website and app, and across TV, radio and podcasts.\n\"It complicated where we were trying to go with the campaign. It was pulling us backwards in a way that was going to be hard to overcome.\"\nWhen asked how Donald Trump reacted to the tape, Ms Hicks said she thinks Trump felt the recording was \"pretty standard stuff for two guys chatting with each other\".\nHicks later answered questions about Trump's reaction to a Wall Street Journal story, which alleged affairs with multiple women, including Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Hicks said Trump worried about the story. \"He was concerned how it would be viewed by his wife and he wanted me to make sure that the newspapers weren't delivered to their residence that morning,\" she testified. \nProsecutors asked Ms Hicks about messages she exchanged with Mr Cohen after the Wall Street Journal published the story.  \nMr Cohen wrote to Hicks that the story was \"lots of innuendos with little facts\". Hicks responded: \"I agree with most of that\" but said the article would get traction because \"the media is the worst\".  \nMr Cohen later replied to say the story was getting \"little to no traction\".  \nHicks explained in court that the story attracted a smaller audience than the story about the Access Hollywood tape. \nThroughout her testimony, even when detailing behind-the-scenes responses to damaging news, Ms Hicks often spoke positively about her former boss. She reserved her harshest assessments for Cohen. \nAsked if she would agree that Cohen would protect Mr Trump out of the \"kindness of his heart\", as the former president had claimed, Ms Hicks replied: \"That would be out of character for Michael.'' \nMs Hicks said that while Cohen was not involved in the campaign directly, he frequently tried to inject himself into it. \n\"He liked to call himself 'Fixer' or 'Mr Fix-it',\" Hicks said. \"And it was only because he first broke it.\" \nMs Hicks also testified about David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer magazine. \nShe said she did not recall being at a 2015 meeting between the former president, Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and Mr Pecker, according to her testimony. It was during this meeting that Pecker agreed to suppress negative stories about Trump - including alleged affairs - to help boost his campaign, Pecker testified.\nMr. Pecker was involved in the hush-money payment to Playboy model Karen McDougal to buy her story about an alleged affair with Trump, he testified last week.\nMs Hicks recalled phone calls between Mr Pecker and Trump, including one in which Trump congratulated Pecker on a story about Trump political opponent Dr B",

    "Labour's Kim McGuinness has become the first North East Mayor after winning Thursday's election.\nThe Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner ran against five other candidates for the role.\nCurrent North of Tyne mayor Jamie Driscoll and Conservative Guy Renner-Thompson were among her opponents. \nMs McGuinness will represent two million people living in Northumberland, Tyne and Wear, and County Durham.\nShe won 41.3% of the vote, with Mr Driscoll coming in second with 28.2% and Mr Renner-Thompson finishing third with 11.7%.\nThe turnout was 31%.\nMs McGuinness, a former councillor in Newcastle, said the election marked a \u201creally big moment for the North East\" as it took the \"first step to taking control\" of its own future.\nShe pledged to turn the region into the \u201creal home of opportunity\u201d, with new jobs, green industries and a major transport overhaul, including bringing privatised bus services back under public control.\nMs McGuinness' primary rival for the new mayoral position was Mr Driscoll - the incumbant North of Tyne Mayor.\nHe was elected to the role as a Labour candidate but resigned last year after a spat with the party. He served the rest of his term as an independent.\nHe was reportedly barred from Labour's shortlist of candidates for the North East Mayor over an appearance with film director Ken Loach.\nMr Loach was expelled from Labour in 2021 during what he called a \"purge\" of Jeremy Corbyn allies. The party never confirmed why he was kicked out.\nAfter he resigned, Mr Driscoll said: \"I think there is a bit of a culture in the Labour Party now that is all about coalescing around a certain small clique. \n\"It's not serving people well. It's not serving politics well.\"\nIt was a red-on-red contest that at one stage looked like it might embarrass Labour.\nBut speculation that independent contender Jamie Driscoll might beat his former party\u2019s candidate in the North East mayoral election proved wide of the mark. \nInstead Kim McGuinness, until now Northumbria\u2019s Police and Crime Commissioner, won by a good margin.\nWhen Mr Driscoll, a former Labour North of Tyne mayor, was excluded from the party\u2019s shortlist for the North East role, it sparked widespread sympathy and disquiet. Many believed he was punished for being on the left of the party.  \nA crowdfunding campaign to support his mayoral bid followed, and out on the doorstep his claim that, as an independent, he wasn\u2019t beholden to party bosses in London struck a chord with some voters.\nBut on Friday it was Labour supporters cheering while Mr Driscoll appeared deflated.\nHe did, however, point out that attracting more than 120,000 votes without a party machine was an achievement, and signalled he may launch another mayoral bid in four years.\nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "US congressman Henry Cuellar and his wife have been charged with accepting around $600,000 (\u00a3478,000) in bribes, the justice department says.\nIt is alleged the couple corruptly received money from an Azerbaijani government-owned oil company and a Mexican bank.\nThe Texas Democrat has denied the charges in a statement.\nThe couple were bailed after appearing in court in Houston. If found guilty, they could face decades in prison.\n\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations,\" Mr Cuellar, 68, said on Friday. \nThe couple are each charged with multiple counts of conspiracy, bribery, wire fraud, money laundering and violating a ban on acting as agents of a foreign organisation. \nThe justice department said bribes were laundered from 2014-21 via a series of \"sham consulting contracts\" through middlemen and front companies owned by Imelda Cuellar, 67.\nIn exchange for the money, the indictment alleges Mr Cuellar agreed to influence US foreign policy in favour of Azerbaijan and push measures beneficial to the bank headquartered in Mexico City, including changes to money-laundering laws and attempts to block regulation of the payday lending industry. \nThe Cuellars allegedly used the proceeds from the bribery schemes to pay off a number of debts and make purchases for their family. \nAmong the outgoings were more than $58,000 (\u00a346,000) on credit card payments, some $11,000 in car payments, $18,000 at wholesale stores and $12,000 for a custom gown, according to the indictment. \nSenator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, faces similar charges. He and his wife are accused of taking bribes in exchange for the senator using his influence to benefit the governments of Egypt and Qatar.\nIn the statement released by his office, Mr Cuellar vowed to keep campaigning for re-election in November.\n\"Before I took any action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm,\" he said. \n\"The actions I took in Congress were consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people.\"\nMr Cuellar was a lawyer and former customs broker before entering politics. He was first elected to Congress in 2004 and is a former co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus. \nHakeem Jeffries, Democratic party leader in the House of Representatives, said Mr Cuellar would take a leave of absence from his post on a homeland security subcommittee while the case continues. \nMr Cuellar's home and campaign office in Laredo were raided in January 2022. \nAuthorities said at the time the raid was part of a federal investigation into Azerbaijan and US businessmen who have links to the country.\nMr Cuellar is widely considered a centrist and has been described as the lone anti-abortion House Democrat. \nIn 2022, he narrowly survived a primary challenge from a progressive candidate, Jessica Cisneros, who once worked as an intern in his office.

    "She has a passion for fashion, enjoys outdoor living and has hobbies ranging from broadcasting to BBQ - Sindy has lived a full life as she celebrates her 60th birthday.\nSince her 1960s debut, she has sold more than 150 million dolls worldwide and an exhibition has seen thousands come through its door to see items from two prolific collectors.\nTwo packed rooms in Chippenham Museum are a sea of pink alongside fan merchandise.\nIt has been one of its most successful exhibitions, with visitors from all over the world and there has even been a convention in the town.\nSindy turned out to be a force to be reckoned with, especially in Britain, when she came on to the scene in the swinging sixties.\nShe had a different look to rival Barbie and was meant to look more like a teenager.\nShe even had flatter feet.\nWeekender Sindy was dressed in a jumper and jeans, although she was also a fashion enthusiast.\n\"The clothes were actually designed by 60s designers - her clothes are what teenagers would want to wear. So they're not flash, they're everyday,\" said Melissa Barnett, from Chippenham Museum, which is holding the exhibition until 11 May.\nEven though she likes a casual outfit, there has always been more elaborate clothing to collect, like wedding dresses and even a set of costumes designed by the Emanuels, who were behind Princess Diana's wedding dress.\nHowever, Ms Barnett explained there is more to Sindy than a passion for fashion.\n\"Her whole world is very much more about what she's doing rather than about what she's wearing.\n\"So there's a lot of accessories.\" \n\"If you think about the dolls before then - which were very much babies - this was an iconic doll for teenagers and it did become the bestselling doll by the end of the 60s,\" said Ms Barnett.\nSindy has a lot of stories to go with her, including in books and magazines. Plus, friends and family: \"She came with a little sister a couple of years later called Patch - and even a boyfriend.\n \"Move over Ken [the boyfriend of Barbie], this is Paul, who she met at a local dance,\" Ms Barnett added. \nA friend of Sindy's, Gayle, was introduced at one point, but only in America.\nA later version of Sindy tried to appeal to the American market explained Ms Barnett: \"The face goes thinner with bigger eyes, more like Barbie. Later we go back to the rounder face of the original Sindy.\"\nThe exhibition shows off the accessories of Sindy as much as the dolls, with collectors Karen Colley and Bonita spending hours setting up scenes, dressing dolls and the houses.\nThe original boxes are stacked underneath, with the differences in design, aspiration and style clear throughout the decades.\nSindy was keen on horses too, with the country house having a space to keep her horse and cart underneath.\nThe houses are detailed, with chicken dinners, phones and pets.\nAlways a busy person, other sets include a television studio, hairdressers and camping.\n\"She was not beholden to Paul in any way I don't think - she was doing her own thing,\" said Ms Barnett from the museum.\nThe manufacturer - Pedigree, based in Exeter - has produced a diamond anniversary doll, with a glittery silver dress and heels. She is being sent out to collectors now, but for those still waiting, the museum was sent one early for the exhibition.\nMelissa Barnett explained how successful the exhibition has been: \"It's lovely to have a happy exhibition that people can relate to. \n\"It is one of our most successful exhibitions - over Easter, there were around 150 people a day so for two weeks - that was quite a lot for a small museum.\"\nThe nostalgia has been a real draw, with the museum visitor book full of comments, including from someone from Seattle, USA.\n\"There's people reminiscing - to the point of being quite emotional. Remembering happy times. \n\"I think the adults have enjoyed it more than the children. It's remembering your past in a good way,\" Ms Barnett.\nPlenty of people have been taking the opportunity for a picture in the giant Sindy selfie box too.\nSo - Sindy or Barbie?

    "The second ferry being built in Turkey for Scotland's west coast routes will be launched on 8 June, ferries agency CMAL has announced.\nThe MV Loch Indaal is one of four ferries being built at the Cemre Marin Endustri shipyard in Yalovan.\nThe ferry, which will serve Islay and Jura, is set to be delivered in February 2025.\nIt will then undergo operational trials and crew familiarisation before entering service.\nThe new ferry is the sister of the MV Isle of Islay which was launched in March, ahead of fitting out work. \nBoth vessels will have capacity for up to 450 passengers and 100 cars, or 14 commercial vehicles.\nThey have a more conventional propulsion system than the hybrid LNG ferries being built at Ferguson shipyard, instead using marine diesel engines with some limited battery power for manoeuvring in port. \nCMAL said the two new ferries for the Islay routes would together provide a 40% increase in vehicle and freight capacity as well as improving the resilience of the wider fleet. \nJim Anderson, director of vessels at CMAL said: \"With the launch of Isle of Islay in March, and Glen Rosa in April, Loch Indaal will be the third vessel to launch within three months.\n\"Work is progressing well at Cemre, and we are on schedule and on budget with all four vessels, which will be welcome news for islanders.\nCabinet Secretary for Transport, Fiona Hyslop, added: \u201cI\u2019m delighted that the launch of the MV Loch Indaal has been confirmed for early June. This is another important milestone in the Scottish government\u2019s commitment to delivering six new major vessels into service by 2026.\n\u201cI have no doubt the communities and businesses on Islay and Jura are looking forward to a more resilient and modern ferry service, with further vessels set to bring similar improvements to other parts of the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services network.\u201d\nThe remaining two ferries, the MV Claymore and MV Lochmor are expected to be ready by June and October next year.\nThese will serve communities in Harris and North Uist.\nAs well as the Turkish-built vessels, the MV Glen Rosa and MV Glen Sannox, both built at Fergusons Shipyard in Port Glasgow will also join the CMAL fleet.",
    "About 31,000 properties in St Leonards and parts of Hastings remain without water after Southern Water said a burst main disrupted supplies. \nFive schools and three college sites in East Sussex were closed on Friday due to the outages which started on Thursday.\nThe water company said its teams were working \"around-the-clock\" to fix the issue and bottled water stations have opened in Hastings and St Leonards.\nThe utility company said: \"We are very sorry that our customers in St Leonards-on-Sea and parts of Hastings are experiencing loss of water.

    "Labour has won the first election for mayor of York and North Yorkshire by almost 15,000 votes.\nYork businessman David Skaith won with 66,761 votes.\nOverall, 191, 279 votes, or just under 30% of the total electorate, were cast in the race to be the region's first mayor.\nConservative candidate Keane Duncan placed second with 51,967 votes with Lib Dem candidate Felicity Cunliffe-Lister in third on 30,867.\nTaking the stage at Harrogate's Convention Centre after his victory was announced, Mr Skaith thanked his wife Alice, his two children and staff and supporters.\n\"We've got a great opportunity to bring York and North Yorkshire together and really grow as one collectively.\n\"The message is clear from York and North Yorkshire that we want change.\"\nResponding to his defeat, Mr Duncan said: \"Inevitably, I'm very disappointed, as you can imagine but we fought a fantastic campaign and reached corners of the county I never knew existed.\" \n\nSpeaking to the BBC after his victory, Mr Skaith said: \"I have always been driven by the fact that this is for York and North Yorkshire.\n\"And it is a bit personal as well.\n\"I have a business here, I have a young family here, I grew up here.\"\nHe added: \"I think we do want to see different people in politics, I certainly do. \n\"I've been completely fed up with the last 14 years of where we've been going.\n\"People just saying random things and not sticking to any ideas and just putting soundbites out. \"\nMr Skaith said: \"Coming into this from a different background will be a great positive.\" \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer and Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves met with Mr Skaith in Northallerton after his victory.\nThe Labour leader said: \"People are fed up with a failed government, so they've registered that here in the vote that they've cast today.\"\nHe added: \"It is a historic victory. \n\"These are places that we would not normally have had a Labour Party success, but we've been able to create that success.\"\nThis election result is huge \u2013 and can\u2019t be overstated.\nConservative Prime Minister \u2013 and North Yorkshire MP \u2013 Rishi Sunak is now represented by a Labour mayor.\nAnd to get there, Labour\u2019s David Skaith and his team had to chip away at a Tory majority in North Yorkshire that was, for a long time, baked in to local and national election results.\nNot any more.\nThe signs of this result were first seen in the elections to the new North Yorkshire Council \u2013 when the Conservatives nearly lost a majority they had held for a generation.\nThen, in July 2023, Labour\u2019s Keir Mather overturned a massive Tory majority in the Selby and Ainsty by-election.\nDespite those clues, this is still a huge achievement for

    "Cardiff City\u2019s FA Cup victory in 1927 remains the finest moment in the club\u2019s history, marking the first \u2013 and to date only \u2013 time the trophy has left England.\nBut three years earlier, they came agonisingly close to becoming the first Welsh side to win English football's top prize.\nOn the last day of the 1923/24 season, they needed a win \u2013 but a 0-0 draw, coupled with victory for nearest rivals Huddersfield, meant the Bluebirds lost out by 0.024 of a goal\nMore than that, their all-time top scorer missed a penalty, and they would have clinched the title if modern-day goal difference had been used.\nIt was exactly 100 years ago, on 3 May 1924, when Cardiff had their nearly moment. \n\u201cThey were in the race for the title all season, that season,\u201d said Neil Jensen, author of The Great Uncrowned.\n\u201cThey had a bit of a blip, in that they didn\u2019t have the same dynamism in the closing months, probably down to the fact they had a small squad, and tiredness kicked in.\u201d\nCardiff were competing against Huddersfield Town, managed by Herbert Chapman, whose success with the west Yorkshire side, and later Arsenal, saw him lauded as one of the most influential managers of the time.\nWith one game to play, the Bluebirds led the Terriers by a single point.\n\u201cThe difference was incredibly tight,\u201d he said. \u201cHuddersfield had to win 3-0, and Cardiff had to fail to win \u2013 which was how it turned out.\u201d\nIn a tight, nervous game against Birmingham, Cardiff could have clinched it with a first-half penalty.\nLen Davies, who went on to be the club's record scorer with 128 goals, stepped up\u2026 and hit it right at the keeper.\n\u201cIt was the first time he had taken a penalty in a match,\u201d said Terry Phillips, Cardiff City\u2019s club historian.\n\u201cThere was 70 minutes gone in the game, and Len put the ball down and took it, but, in (captain) Fred Keenor\u2019s words, \u201che muffed his shot\u201d.\nMeanwhile Huddersfield beat Nottingham Forest 3-0 and became champions.\n\u201cIf you settled it on goal difference, as they would now, they would have both been on +27, and Cardiff would have won it on goals scored: 61 goals to Huddersfield\u2019s 60.\u201d\n\u201cThey would have been champions, but for 0.024 of a goal. Incredible.\u201d\nThe result remains the narrowest margin of victory ever recorded in the top tier of English football. It was also the first time the title had been decided by goal average.\nFrom 1888, when the Football League was formed, until 1976, goal average was used to separate teams finishing on the same number of points.\nIt was calculated by taking the number goals scored, and dividing by the number of goals conceded.\nIt helped to encourage teams to play more defensive football, as clean sheets were a significant factor towards getting a higher average.\nIt was abolished in 1976, and replaced with goal difference \u2013 the\u00a0difference between the number of goals scored for and against a team -\u00a0a system that is still used today.\nBut Cardiff were not the only side to miss out like this, with both Arsenal and Manchester United winning league titles thanks to the rule in subsequent decades.\nDespite the loss, Cardiff were amazed by the reception they had back home.\n\u201cThey came back by train from Birmingham, and got back to Cardiff at 10.25 in the evening\u2026 and there were thousands of people there to welcome them home,\u201d said Mr Jensen.\n\u201cLen Davies tried to sneak out and avoid the crowds, but he was picked up and lifted by the crowd out of the station.\u201d\nThree years later Cardiff had revenge - of sorts - when they won the FA Cup against Arsenal, by then managed by Herbert Chapman.\n\u201cHistory, for a club, any club, it is very important\u201d said Erol Bulut, Cardiff\u2019s current manager.\n\u201cI know what a big history Cardiff City have. To be in this history is important, but maybe in another 100 years\u2019 time, they can also talk about our term, what we had.\u201d\n\u201cIt is important though to always have these positive things in our history \u2013 it is good for us, good for the manager, good for the football players.\u201d\nIn the century since, Cardiff have had their fair share of highs and lows.\nBut for one goal in 1924, that history might look a lot different today.",
    "A man convicted of the manslaughter of 39 people in a lorry trailer in Essex in 2019 has been moved from an English prison to a jail in Northern Ireland.\nLorry driver Maurice Robinson, from County Armagh, was part of a people-smuggling operation which caused the suffocation of 39 Vietnamese migrants.\nRobinson discovered the bodies when he opened the door of the sealed container in Grays in Essex in October 2019.\nIt is understood he has been moved to Maghaberry jail in County Antrim.\nA spokesman for the Northern Ireland Prison Service said it cannot comment on individual cases, but explained that prisoners serving sentences in the UK may apply to be transferred from one jurisdiction to another if they meet qualifying criteria.\nRobinson, from Craigavon, was 25 years old when he agreed to pick up the lorry from the docks in Purfleet in Essex on 23 October 2019.\nThe migrants, aged 15 to 44, had already been in the container for at least 12 hours as it was shipped from Belgium to Purfleet.\nRobinson's then boss Ronan Hughes, also from County Armagh, had instructed him to open the container and give them air quickly.\nBut when Robinson opened the door he realised the people travelling in the container were already dead.\nAmong the victims were 10 teenagers, two of them 15-year-old boys.\nSome of them had phoned their families as they struggled to breathe inside the trailer and after their deaths, their voice messages were played in court as part of the prosecution of the people-smuggling gang.\nRobinson pleaded guilty to 39 counts of manslaughter at the Old Bailey in April 2020 and is currently serving a prison term of 13 years and four months.\nHis transfer to Maghaberry, a high-security prison near Lisburn, was first reported by the Press Association news agency.\nIt said it understood the transfer took place in March.\nThe Northern Ireland Prison Service has not confirmed the move.\nHowever, in a statement its spokesman said \"prisoners serving sentences in the UK may apply to be transferred from one jurisdiction to another under Intra-UK prisoner transfer arrangements providing they meet certain qualifying criteria\".  \n\"These include having close family (ie a partner, children, parents, grandparents or a wider supportive family circle) resident in the receiving jurisdiction.  \n\"These arrangements help provide prisoners with easier access to a supportive family environment, which is considered a crucial element of a prisoner's rehabilitation journey.  \n\"Transfers are usually on a restricted basis, meaning that for the purposes of detention, release and licence recall they remain subject to the laws governing the original sentencing jurisdiction. \n\"For these prisoners release dates remain unaltered.\"",

    "King Charles has been presented with a beautifully illustrated record of his Coronation, almost a year after the historic service at Westminster Abbey. \nFor at least 700 years, monarchs have been given a \"Coronation roll\".\nStretching for 21 metres, the hand-stitched manuscript was written by calligrapher Stephanie von Werthern-Gill.\nAnd there are no nightmare spelling mistakes, bar a single dot missing over an 'i'. \n\"Most marvellous illumination work,\" said the King, while Queen Camilla said she would need \"my specs\" to read it.\nFor the first time, the manuscript did not use any animal skin.\nBut spare a thought for the calligrapher who wrote it.\nLike a massive roll of historic wallpaper, the roll includes 11,500 elegantly inscribed words, using specially made ink.\nIn an epic achievement of concentration, Stephanie says she kept going for 56 days, without any weekend breaks, determined to keep her rhythm going, phone switched off, her calm sustained by breathing exercises and classical music. \n\"It was very intense,\" she says, but the outcome \"feels like a piece of art\".\n\"All the right spelling?\" joked the King, when he looked at the huge roll, which he said \"goes on for miles\".\nIn fact, there was only a single dot missing on a letter i in the hand-stitched pages of copperplate writing, which she'd managed to spot.\nThe result was shown to King Charles and Queen Camilla at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday, as the King continues his return to duties after more positive news about his ongoing cancer treatment.\nThis is the official state record of a monarch's accession and Coronation, but it is now as much an artwork as a formal document. \nIt includes intricate illustrations by Tim Noad, who must soon be the country's most widely viewed, but least well-credited, artist. Because as well as illustrating this historic document, he is the designer of the King's cypher, the logo that you will begin to see on new banknotes, public buildings, uniforms and eventually on new post boxes.\nThe roll records the ceremonies, processions and promises of the Coronation service and shows who was there in the Abbey, particularly those with a ceremonial role, as well as the long lists of royal guests, politicians and overseas representatives. \nBut not everyone gets a mention.\nWhen the document is finally lodged in the National Archives, there will be no record of Ant and Dec or Katy Perry having been there. And there is not even a hello for Lionel Richie. They have been reduced to a catch-all heading of \"Other groups\".\nThere is also no mention of the protests by anti-monarchists that day.\nThis Coronation roll, the first for 70 years, is intended to be more accessible than its predecessors, so there will be an online video version at www.coronationroll.gov.uk with recordings of some of those present, such as Leader of the Commons Penny Mordaunt, famous for her sword-carrying skills.\nThe King and Queen watched the video of themselves at their own Coronation. It was like the most upmarket-ever edition of Gogglebox.\nDeputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden, who presented the roll to the King, said: \"For the first time, this Coronation roll will be digitised - bringing the tradition into the 21st Century and giving as many people as possible the opportunity to see it.\"\nAlso for the first time the official signing of the roll was carried out in front of the cameras, at an event in the College of Arms in London, a venue atmospheric enough to have been used as a location in a James Bond film.\nThe finished roll, which travelled in a big covering of unhistoric looking bubble wrap, was carefully signed by the clerk of the crown in chancery, Antonia Romeo.\nThe original documents, signed by the King on the day in Westminster Abbey, in big black ink, are also now stitched into this long scroll.\nThe King, who has an occupational interest in signing things, looked at earlier versions of rolls on shiny parchment and said: \"You'd have frightful difficulty signing on that.\"\nThe oldest surviving roll is from the Coronation of Edward II in 1308. It is in remarkably good condition, considering it had been stashed away in the Tower of London for hundreds of years before later being more carefully protected in the National Archives.\nUntil this latest 2024 roll, all the previous versions had been written on materials made from animal skin. But this time the roll has been recorded on high-quality paper, reflecting other modern changes such as the Coronation oils also being made animal-free.\nDr Sean Cunningham, from the National Archives, said that rolls once had a very practical political purpose. It was documentary proof of the legitimacy of a reign, with evidence to show rebellious nobles about the promises they had made.\n\"In medieval times when the crown was contested a lot more, these were important records of the authority of an incoming monarch. It's about the loyalty and allegiance to that new king,\" says Dr Cunningham.\nThe rolls have also been crib sheets f",
    "A mother and son have been banned from keeping animals after admitting failing to get dental treatment for their dog suffering from \"painful\" disease.\nMichelle and Ethan Lee Farrar also pleaded guilty to failing to provide a suitable environment for their dog, Storm, at a house in Batley.\nStorm had been kept in \"dangerous\" and filthy conditions, the RSPCA said.\nMichelle Farrar was banned from keeping animals for two years, while Ethan Lee Farrar was banned for five years.\nBradford Magistrates Court had earlier heard that in October 2022, RSPCA Animal Rescue Officer Rebecca Goulding had visited a property in Oakhill Road, Batley, to check on the welfare of Storm and a puppy called Rain.\nThe visit was made following complaints that the dogs were living in unsuitable conditions at the house.\nThe animals were found found to be living in a \"faeces-strewn and dangerous\" environment, the RSPCA said.\nMs Goulding said: \"The stench of urine and faeces that could be smelt from outside the property, combined with the filthy windows and stained curtains, suggested conditions inside were not suitable for the dogs. \n\"The living room appeared in complete disarray and all surfaces were covered in faeces.\" \nThe court heard that Ms Goulding advised Michelle and Ethan Lee Farrar that the condition of the house at Oakhill Road was unsuitable for the dogs and that improvements must be made otherwise they would have to be removed from there.\nThe officer made \"many\" unsuccessful attempts to revisit the property, but Michelle Farrar eventually agreed to sign the puppy over to the RSPCA and move Storm to an address in Ealand Road, Dewsbury.\nMichelle Farrar was warned against the dog being returned to Oakhill Road, unless significant improvements were made to that property.\nHowever, a month later Ms Goulding discovered that Storm was once again back at the house in Batley, this time outside in the yard, sparking a renewed warning that the dog could be removed.\nIn February 2023, another RSPCA inspector found Storm, now looking \"very thin\", remained at the house and was seen sitting on a faeces-covered window ledge.\nAs a result, Storm was taken into the care of the RSPCA and was thoroughly examined by a vet and treatment was started.\nVet Dr Sean Taylor, an expert witness for the prosecution, told the court that\u00a0the evidence indicated that Storm had a 1.2in (3cm) lesion on her tongue and was also suffering from dental disease.\nHe added this would likely have caused her to experience pain, adding that the condition had been present for some time.\nStorm was rehomed by the RSPCA, but was later diagnosed with cancer.\nAt Bradford Magistrates' Court on 18 April, Michelle Farrar, of Ealand Road, Dewsbury, was banned from keeping animals for two years and given a 12-month Community Order.\nShe was also ordered to pay costs of \u00a3400 and a Victim Surcharge of \u00a3114.\nMeanwhile, Ethan Lee Farrar was banned from keeping animals for five years and was also given a 12-month Community Order, while also being ordered to pay costs of \u00a3400 and a Victim Surcharge of \u00a3114.\nSpeaking after sentencing, RSPCA Inspector Demi Hodby said: \"This was a sad case and Storm's suffering could have easily been avoided.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "Travel links are key for the Channel Islands, but sometimes things go wrong and disruption - whatever the cause - can be annoying and inconvenient.\nCondor Ferries recently apologised after making a number of changes to its summer schedule.\nWhat are your rights if your ferry journey is disrupted or delayed?\nWe asked Carl Walker, chairman of Jersey's Consumer Council.\nThere is a certain degree of protection, which is similar to when passengers are affected by airlines changing their plans or delays. But it does only seem to cover if you've started your travel and then it's delayed or you can't depart on time and that has a knock-on effect.\nAs long as the travel company has given sufficient notice then what you are entitled to is either a full refund or to be rebooked on an alternative date or time that fits in with your plans.\nThe problem we are seeing with consumers across the Channel Islands after Condor changed their schedule is, because they haven't got a fleet of ships going every single hour, then people are getting that knock-on effect to their hotel bookings, perhaps onward travel or the events that they are going to see.\nOften people make a mistake and book their holiday and their travel and leave the travel insurance until a few days before they go. \nIf a company makes a change to your booking, you're not covered if the travel plans change in the run up to it.\nSo anybody who has an annual travel policy or already has travel insurance or who has booked through a travel agent as part of a travel package should be able to claim for any knock-on costs that moving the shipping time or the sailing time has had on them.\nThey should not be charged a cancellation fee. If they are then that is very questionable.\nThey have caused the problem, they have caused the issue, it is not right for people to have to pay to get out of that contract with them when they have altered the terms of that contract.\nAbsolutely. Any airline, any ferry company is entitled for whatever reason to alter the times of their departures. It happens a lot with airlines.\nFor example, with a leading airline, if your flight is changed by under two hours you have to go with it. You have to roll with it. You don't really have any choice. \nIf it's move by more than two hours then you can change your booking you can get a credit back to your account or you can have a full refund, no questions asked.\nCompensation would only apply if you've started your journey with the company or you're checked in and then there's a delay.\nUnless it's weather of course. Weather impacts ferries tremendously and a lot more than airlines.\nBut when it's actually a decision made by the ferry company and there's been enough notice, no you cannot.\nA Condor spokesperson told the BBC passengers may be entitled to claim under EU regulations 1177/2010 in certain instances if a change is being made for operational reasons. Passengers have two months after the event in which to make a claim.\nIf there is a delay in arrival time, and depending on the length of journey, a 25%/50% refund of the affected leg can be claimed.\n Follow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "Welsh voters have elected the first black female police and crime commissioner (PCC).\nEmma Wools was elected to serve the region of south Wales - holding the role for Labour.\nThe contest also saw the first women PCCs elected in the country, with the Labour leader of Newport council, Jane Mudd, also winning the contest in Gwent.\nLabour held three of the Welsh PCCs, and Plaid Cymru's Dafydd Llywelyn held Dyfed-Powys, but there was a low turnout with only 17% of voters taking part.\nAndy Dunbobbin, who has been PCC since 2021, was re-elected for Labour in North Wales.\nPCCs are some of the best paid politicians in Wales, with the larger the force the higher the salary.\nThe South Wales PCC is paid \u00a386,700 a year. In Gwent the salary is \u00a373,302, while in north Wales it is \u00a373,300.\nIn Dyfed-Powys the salary is \u00a368,200.\nMs Wools and Ms Mudd were selected by Labour to replace Alun Michael in south Wales and Jeff Cuthbert in Gwent, who have both stood down.\nThe newly elected PCC for south Wales said it was an \"enormous privilege and an enormous responsibility\".\n\"It is a powerful opportunity to create change, promote diversity and inclusion, and advocate for underrepresented communities,\" she said.\nPCCs set budgets and priorities for police forces, but do not run them day-to-day.\nThat is the ultimate responsibility of the chief constable, who PCCs can hire and fire.\nThe elections are the first in Wales that required voters to show identification. Voting took place on Thursday with counting on Friday.\nIn South Wales, Ms Wools received 73,128 votes, the Conservatives 43,344, Plaid Cymru 27,410 and the Lib Dems 17,908.\nNewport council leader Jane Mudd has said she would step down from her role at the council if she was successful in Gwent.\nShe admitted there was a low turnout \"but we need to recognise this is a standalone election\".\nShe told BBC Wales: \"There is a job of work on continuing to raise awareness of the role of police and crime commissioner\".\nMs Mudd received 28,476 votes, followed by the Conservatives with 21,919, Plaid Cymru with 9,864 and 8,078 for the Liberal Democrats .\nPlaid Cymru celebrated holding Dyfed-Powys with 31,323, with the Conservatives coming second with 19,134 votes, Labour third with 18,353 and Liberal Democrats fourth with 7,719.\nIt is the first PCC election to use a first past the post voting system. Previous elections allowed voters to express a second preference if their preferred candidate was not elected.\nCelebrating the Dyfed-Powys result, Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"Despite trying to manipulate the result by changing the voting system, the Conservatives have been roundly defeated.\"\nHe claimed the electorate was not \"enthused by Keir Starmer and are increasingly astonished by revelations about Vaughan Gething\u2019s donations\".\nIn North Wales, Mr Dunbobbin took 31,950 votes, the Conservatives 26,281, Plaid Cymru 23,466 and the Liberal Democrats 7,129.\nCardiff University's Ed Gareth Poole said the switch to first past the post in the election \"aided incumbents\".\nHe said there was \"evidence of tactical voting\", and said postal votes were \"likely a majority of the vote\".\nThe academic said on X that in two competitive races there was a large swing from Conservative to Plaid Cymru, and a Conservative to Labour swing in North Wales.\nLow turnout had been expected because, unlike in parts of England, the PCC elections did not take place alongside local council elections.\nThe turnout for Thursday's elections was a slight increase on the worst turnout for a PCC election, when the roles were introduced in November 2012.\nThe first Welsh police elections saw 14.9% taking part. No other election was held that year either.\nThe highest turnout this year was in Dyfed-Powys at 19.2%, while the lowest was 15.63% in Gwent.\nIt stood at 17.19% in North Wales and 16.58% in South Wales.\nEmma Wools, 45, from Cardiff, was a psychology graduate from what is now the University of South Wales.\nMs Wools had a career in the criminal justice system before she joined the south Wales commissioner's office.\nShe began working in the probation service in 2001, working in courts in south Wales.\nBefore becoming deputy police and crime commissioner in 2016, she had been an assistant chief officer within the former National Offender Management Service, which was responsible for prisons and probation.",

The present Queen Camilla, named Queen Victoria in 2007.\nMs McAlister declined to reveal who would name the 249th vessel to fly the Cunard flag at a ceremony in Liverpool on 3 June and said it would only be announced a week beforehand.\n\"Queen Anne is great for Southampton, because she will 'home port' here,\" she said. \nShe added that the vessel will be in Southampton \"year-round\", but would be named in Liverpool because \"that is the spiritual home of Cunard\".\nThe company was founded in Liverpool, but moved its headquarters to Southampton in 1967.\nOn board the ship, Faith Hepburn from Nottingham has been taking part in dress rehearsals in the ship's 850-seat theatre. \nShe joined the ship at the Marghera shipyard near Venice in Italy, where it was built. \nIt's her first professional stage show, as a cast member of \"Brief Encounter,\" adapted from a West End and Broadway production.\n\"This is my first ever cruise ship,\" she said. \"First job, first for everything professionally!\"\n\"I've already learned so much from being here. I'm on board until 8th September, so we've got just over four months.\"\n\"It's insane,\" said Scott Royle, who plays one of the lead roles in the show. \"I've worked on ships for six years.\"\n\"I get paid to see the world. I go to sleep then wake up in a different place.

    "A study has found hospital patients who have better vital signs could be monitored less frequently, without putting them at serious risk.\nResearchers analysed 400,000 anonymous NHS patient records from hospitals in Portsmouth and Oxford.\nVital signs are tracked by measuring heart rate, blood pressure, temperature and pulse, which takes about five minutes.\nIt could mean nurses were freed up to prioritise sicker patients, experts said.\nNursing staff regularly monitor vital signs so that if a patient's condition deteriorates, it can be spotted early.\nThe patient is given a score based on these vital signs.\nBut checking too often can be annoying for patients and interfere with rest and sleep, which are important for recovery, the study said.\nNurses also needed to plan their time well to look after patients who need care, it added.\nLed by the University of Portsmouth and including Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Portsmouth Hospitals University NHS Trust, the study examined patient records from between 2018 and 2021.\nResearchers looked at three of the most serious risks for patients in hospital - dying, needing intensive care and having a cardiac arrest. \nThey also studied how likely it was a patient's condition would significantly deteriorate before their vital signs were checked again.\nThe study found patients with a low overall vital sign score could be monitored \"less often\" without being in danger of serious harm, freeing up nursing time so that patients with a higher score could be monitored \"more often\".\nThis could be achieved without employing more staff, it was concluded.\nProf Jim Briggs, who was in charge of the research, said: \u201cObviously, taking observations more frequently can reduce the risk, but that has to be offset by the extra nursing staff workload incurred and the disturbance to the patient - especially at night.\"\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "In his brief stint as Scotland's first minister, there is one moment for Humza Yousaf I will never forget.\nLast October, Mr Yousaf was embarking on a political ritual - a round of interviews with political editors before his party's conference in Aberdeen.\nBut here was a man pained and exhausted, excusing himself between interviews to take calls from his wife and family.\nHis in-laws were trapped in Gaza. He was struggling to hold it together.\nThankfully, they were to escape safely. The personal anguish would end.\nPolitically though, things were never less than difficult for Humza Yousaf.\nHe assumed power with time bombs ticking everywhere. And loudly.\nFirstly, the unavoidable political logic of the Scottish National Party's mammoth stint in power.\nThey have run the Scottish government since 2007. Ageing is inescapable - and that is no different for political parties.\nThen throw into the mix that avenues towards another independence referendum looked increasingly like dead ends, particularly in the short and medium term.\nThe prospect of indyref2, to use the shorthand, was a glue that helped hold the SNP together. And guess what happens when the glue gets loose.\nThen there was the no small matter of the former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and her husband, the SNP's former chief executive Peter Murrell, finding themselves of interest to the police.\nThat whole affair rumbles on, providing a nightmarish backdrop for Mr Yousaf.\nNext throw in the almightily toxic issue of the trans rights debate. \nAnd then the handling of the collapse in the relationship with the Scottish Greens. \nAnd this is where the crux of this situation comes to a head.\nThe legacy of longevity in office, some relationships among Scottish nationalists smashed.\nHumza Yousaf concluded over the weekend that there was no deal to be done with the Greens - they would vote to get rid of him.\nCrucially, he concluded he was also not willing to do a deal with Alba - the party led by his predecessor bar one, one Alex Salmond.\nNot because the deal on offer was necessarily entirely unpalatable, but because, in the end, it was with him.\nYes, the same Mr Salmond who led the SNP and led Scotland into the independence referendum in 2014, who was cleared, in a hugely high-profile court case of sexually assaulting nine women while he was Scotland's first minister, and who fell out volcanically with Nicola Sturgeon.\nThe depth of those enmities, the reality of that chasm, we see the consequence of today.\nMr Yousaf therefore realised the numbers did not add up. He was done for.\nAnd so, he concluded, better to voluntarily acknowledge that and resign, than be humiliated by arithmetic within days.",

Another boy also faced charges but has not yet entered a plea.\nHusband Lee Lovell, who was also stabbed twice during the incident, told the Supreme Court in Brisbane: \"It would be nice to see justice prevail and see the accused locked up for a life sentence.\"\nThe court heard the couple had been woken up by their dogs before they confronted the teenagers who had been breaking into their house.\nSecurity footage was shown to the court where the two teenagers can be seen entering the house.

    "There were missed opportunities to stop a violent man from murdering his ex-partner and her nine-year-old son, a report has found.\nBethany Vincent, 26, and Darren Henson, known as DJ, were stabbed to death by Daniel Boulton at their home in Louth, Lincolnshire, in May 2021.\nA council review found Boulton's mental health needs were prioritised over the risk he posed to Ms Vincent and DJ.\nThe authority said it had taken action to address issues raised in the report.\nBoulton was jailed for a minimum of 40 years at Lincoln Crown Court in February 2022 after he walked 28 miles (45km) from a homeless hostel in Skegness on 31 May 2021 to Ms Vincent's house on High Holme Road where he stabbed her nine times, before stabbing DJ 14 times in his bedroom.\nThree years after the murders, Lincolnshire County Council has published a combined Child Safeguarding Practice Review and Domestic Homicide Review into their deaths.\nIn the report, author Dr Russell Wate said the level of the killer's risk to Ms Vincent and her family was \"underestimated throughout\", which included signs of coercion and control, given his history of domestic abuse-related offences.\n\"What is unequivocal is that the lines of communication between agencies was not sufficient to fully understand the risks involved. \n\"Opportunities to have addressed a more thorough understanding of the perpetrator's risk towards Bethany and DJ became secondary to the perceptions of the needs of the mental health of the perpetrator and he manipulated this to his advantage.\"\nHe said \"a considerable amount of time and effort\" had gone towards towards supporting Boulton's needs and meant \"Bethany's safeguarding needs became secondary\".\nDr Wate criticised \"a distinct lack of joined-up working in this case\" and said threats and comments made by the perpetrator were \"effectively disregarded\". \n\"The exercise of coercion and control was not identified even though there were indicators of such behaviours. Those signs were missed, even though they were part of the evidence from Bethany in her witness statements.\n\"The fact that the perpetrator was repeatedly returning to Bethany's home was an obvious indicator of the escalation of the risk of harm.

    "Talks over the future of steelmaking in south Wales have broken down as unions have refused to agree to Tata Steel's restructuring plans.\nUnions said the company had disregarded the impact of the changes on workers, their families and communities.\nBoth blast furnaces in Port Talbot are expected to close this year with 2,800 jobs lost across the UK as a result, and all those employed at the blast furnaces leaving their roles by the end of the year. \nA Tata Steel spokesperson said it has put forward an extensive offer that includes an enhanced employee support package and a generous proposal for a skills and retraining scheme.\nTata and the unions have been in consultations for seven months after the company said it wanted to end blast furnace iron production in south Wales this year.\nIt currently employs 4,000 workers at Port Talbot and will begin a voluntary redundancy process in May.\nThe company plans to build a \u00a31.25bn electric arc furnace to produce steel in a way which is less polluting than traditional blast furnaces but requires fewer workers.\nTata said the move would secure the future of steel making at the site and the UK government is contributing \u00a3500m towards the cost of the project.\nIn a joint statement, the Community, GMB and Unite unions said the offer to workers was a \"callous attack\" and \"completely unacceptable\". \nAccording to the unions, Tata had hoped to get workers to agree to the closure of both blast furnaces by September.\nThey also said steelworkers who refused to take voluntary redundancy would be moved to a training programme which pays minimum wage after four months.\nIn addition, they said there was no guarantee on avoiding compulsory redundancies.\nCharlotte Brumpton-Childs, GMB's national officer for steel said: \"The strength of feeling is palpable, members feel they are being disregarded and being abandoned, and they're angry.\"\nRoy Rickhuss, general secretary of Community, said: \"Tata talks the talk and wants to be seen as a caring responsible employer, but the reality is they are determined to cut jobs and punish their most vulnerable employees who want job security.\"\nHe said the union would consult its members on their next steps.\nTata Steel said it had paused discussions with the unions without coming to an agreement.\n\"Following seven months of information sharing and consultation, last week we confirmed that we will be proceeding with our restructuring plans and a \u00a31.25billion investment in green steelmaking to secure over 5000 jobs in Tata Steel UK. This week we have continued our open and constructive discussions with Trades Union partners through the UK Steel Committee.\n\u201cOur focus remains on creating a sustainable steel industry in the UK that supports manufacturing supply chains and steel communities through a just transition to low CO2 steelmaking,\" a company spokesperson added.\n\nThe Welsh government said:  \u201cWe have consistently argued that there is a better deal for the industry and Tata workers that could and should be struck - securing a longer, fairer transition towards the greener production of steel in Wales. \n\"The Welsh government will continue to make the case for that fairer transition and do all we can to support the skilled and loyal workforce and those in the supply chain.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Jeremy Miles said in the Senedd it was \"essential\" that Tata \"does all it can to avoid compulsory redundancies\" and ensures affected employees get \"appropriate help and guidance to reskill or seek employment\".\n",

    "Conservative Ben Houchen has won Thursday's election in what will be his third consecutive term as Tees Valley Mayor.\nLord Houchen has been in the role since its creation in 2017 and was re-elected in 2021.\nHis victory was declared at the count in Thornaby, in Stockton-on-Tees, on Friday.\nLabour's Chris McEwan and Liberal Democrat Simon Thorley also ran for the role.\nLord Houchen won all five council areas, but with a reduced majority over Labour.\nIt has reduced from 73% in 2021 to 53.6% this year.\nLabour received 41.3% of the votes, while the Liberal Democrats got 5%.\nThe turnout was 31%, down by 3.1% in the last election. \nLabour said the result in Tees Valley should be \"a major wake-up call\" for the prime minister.\nLord Houchen attended the count with his wife Rachel and their three-month-old baby, Hannah.\nHe said it was the \"greatest honour anyone could give me\" to be re-elected as mayor in the \"place where I'm going to be for the rest of my life\".\n\"I am absolutely humbled by everybody that voted for me, Teesside is a place where I was born, where I grew up, other than a very short sabbatical to Newcastle for four years and then I came straight back,\" the mayor said.\nLord Houchen acknowledged there was \"still a long way to go\" as he thanked voters for \"backing\" his plan for the \"next four years\", and said he was \"making good progress\".\nA Labour spokesperson said: \"This swing towards Labour in Tees Valley puts Labour on track to win every single seat in the area in a general election.\n\"The Conservatives should be extremely worried that their candidate had to run as an independent to win.\n\"If Rishi Sunak doesn't take this result as a major wake-up call, he is in denial.\"\nBen Houchen\u2019s win will be a relief to him, but also to Rishi Sunak.\nIt proves a Conservative can still win in the areas the prime minister needs to retain to stay in government, even if it was a far tighter result than when the Tory mayor took 73% of the vote in 2021.\nBut perhaps not just any Conservative can win.

    "On a quiet morning outside Newcastle University, a small group of students listen to a lecturer talk about the opening song from Aladdin.\nSpecifically, this line: \u201cIt\u2019s barbaric, but hey! It\u2019s home.\u201d She\u2019s telling the group about Edward Said, and how his work looking at the way Middle Eastern cultures had been depicted in the West could be applied even to Disney films.\nThe talk then turns to how Said's theories could be applied to the portrayal of Palestinians in Western media.\nWhile this scene doesn't sound out of the ordinary, this isn\u2019t your usual university seminar. This lecturer was giving her talk in the middle of an encampment, which university students set up on Wednesday to protest against the war in Gaza.\nHere in Newcastle, about 40 students have set up camp on the university\u2019s quadrangle, with tents for sleeping, a makeshift first-aid centre, and tables for all the snacks donated by supporters - including crisps, water, and a Colin the Caterpillar cake.\nStudents themselves do coursework or exam revision on the grass, or slip off for seminars and lectures, as they would if it were student halls. Several staff members come in to show their support and drop off donations of snacks. All of those I speak to tell me they feel \u201cproud\u201d to see their students taking part.\nRunning along the perimeter are hand-painted signs.\nNaomi, who\u2019s asked that we don\u2019t use her full name, shows me a sign that she\u2019d painted the night before.\n\u201cIt says \u2018Tzedek, Tzedek, Tirdof\u2019,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt means \u2018justice, justice, shall you seek\u2019.\u201d\nNaomi says the sign - written in Hebrew - reflects how her Jewish faith has shaped her view of the conflict in Gaza.\n\u201cI was always raised with a very strong sense of justice, because of my Jewish community,\u201d she explains, adding that the sign \u201cencompasses so much of what my Judaism means to me\u201d.\n\u201cIn many ways, if I hadn\u2019t been Jewish, I wouldn\u2019t feel so firmly in solidarity with Palestine, because of the sense of social justice that my faith gives me.\u201d\nNewcastle students are just one of many student bodies across the country to set up similar occupied protests this week.\nSimilar outdoor camps have been erected on campuses including at Leeds, Manchester and Sheffield, while a camp outside Warwick University has been in place for 10 days. At Goldsmiths, University of London, students have occupied the library, inside the university building.\nEarlier this week the Union of Jewish Students (UJS) released a statement saying campus protests in support of Gaza were creating a \u201chostile and toxic atmosphere for Jewish students\u201d.\nGuy Dabby-Joory, from the UJS, told me they knew there were Jewish supporters of the movement, but that they\u2019d heard a lot of concerns from members.\nThese UK protests have sprung up amid the backdrop of much larger demonstrations and occupations on campuses across the US - most prominently at Columbia University, New York, and at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).\nThose protests have seen more than 2,000 people detained over the past fortnight.\nWhile the calmness of the Newcastle camp feels a million miles away from those scenes, those who are taking part tell me that their counterparts in the US have seen what they\u2019re doing, and have been in touch.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some people from Columbia message us,\u201d Frank, another student protester, tells me. Frank\u2019s pronouns are they/them, and they asked that we not use their real name. \u201cThey just wanted to send us their solidarity - and that is really warming to see.\u201d\nThey say the group behind the occupation - Newcastle Apartheid Off Campus - had been organising in support of Gaza for several months, and that the occupation was planned before the recent disorder kicked off in the US. But the occupation was partly organised now to say to US students: \u201cYou\u2019re not alone.\u201d\nStudents in the UK share some common goals with their US counterparts - in particular, the call for their universities to sever financial and research ties with Israel, a process known as divestment.\nBut as well as this, Frank tells me they feel an emotional connection to students in Gaza - who, in better times, are no different to them.\n\u201cThere are tens of thousands of students in Gaza, and their lives are completely upended. There's no way you can pursue an education when you've got bombs raining down on you,\u201d Frank said. \n\u201cWe\u2019re sat in a peaceful university, studying, and they don\u2019t have that opportunity.\u201d\nAlthough it\u2019s quiet now, rallies that are held at 5pm daily attract hundreds of other students. Frank estimates there were around 200 people at the last one.\nI ask one of the staff members - Dr Jemima Repo, a reader in political and feminist theory - whether she worries at all about the camp becoming disruptive during exam season.\n\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d she says. The camp itself, while on the campus and visible, is set apart from walkways and entrances.\n\u201cAs far as I understand the relationship between campus security and police has been very good,\u201d Dr Repo says",

    "Parkour athletes say the daring discipline has helped to boost their mental health by facing fears, managing setbacks and building confidence.\nThe sport sees participants, called traceurs, attempt to get from point A to point B in the fastest way possible.\nIt is done without equipment and often involves acrobatic flips and jumps.\nProfessional traceur, Danny Pierce, from Bristol, said: \"You realise your potential is so much more than you previously thought.\"\nThough it often carries a reputation of danger and disruption- fuelled by videos of extreme choreography at nauseating heights - some say the sport unlocks feelings of \"hope\" and \"mindfulness\". \nMr Pierce, 33, is a parkour practitioner and coach with an online following of almost 40,000 people.\n\"I was always interested in movement from a young age,\" he said.\n\"Always climbing and finding a thrill from doing something I knew was scary and dangerous, but still within my ability.\"\nDespite its controversy, parkour was officially recognised as a sport in the UK in 2017, by all five of the UK's sports bodies. \nOne explanation for the sport's growing popularity is its accessibility to athletes of all capabilities. \nAs Mr Pierce attests, the aim of the discipline is not to be competitive, but to progress at a personal level.\n\"I love the idea of making myself better at moving and the challenge and fun that comes with pushing yourself. It's a massive confidence builder,\" he said.\nCharlotte Boenigk is the CEO and founder of Esprit Concrete: Free Your Instinct, an organisation in Bristol that delivers parkour for mental health.\nThe sessions focus on supporting the development of psychological strength and resilience by \"bringing the benefits of adventure therapy into the urban environment\".\n\"Parkour allows the person to move more mindfully, connecting their mind, body and environment while reducing feelings of anxiety and overwhelm,\" Ms Boenigk said.\n\"Participants also describe how the feelings of success and achievement triggered in the sessions allow them to gain a sense of hope, and see that there are positive solutions to challenges,\" she added.\nMs Boenigk said the discipline also has the potential to uncover repressed feelings of trauma, anxiety or fear, which can then be managed using \"positive coping strategies\". \nEmma Brech, CEO of mental health support charity, Bristol Mind, says she believes parkour can be used not as an 'escape', but a way of facing your fears head on.\n\"In therapy, we talk a lot about 'turning into difficulty' rather than trying to deny it, avoid it or suppress it,\" she said.\n\"We're constantly having to overcome obstacles in life, so if we've got a physical outlet that lets us practice those skills in a structured and exciting way, it enables us to do things like manage risks, problem solve, and overcome barriers in our own self-concept by showing us what we're capable of.\n\"It's about listening to our body, relating to it and learning from it, rather than pushing it to extremes.\"\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A notorious hacker who was one of Europe\u2019s most wanted criminals has been jailed for blackmailing 33,000 therapy patients with their stolen session notes. \nJulius Kivim\u00e4ki's imprisonment brings to an end an 11-year cyber-crime spree that started when he rose to prominence in a network of anarchic teenage hacking gangs at the age of just 13.\nTiina was cooling off after the customary Finnish Saturday night sauna when her phone pinged.\nIt was an email from an anonymous sender who somehow had her name, social security number and other private details.\n\u201cAt first I was struck by how polite it was and how nice the tone was,\u201d she recalls.\n\u201cDear Mrs Parikka\u201d the sender wrote, before outlining that they had obtained her private information from a psychotherapy centre where she was a patient. Almost apologetically the emailer explained that they were contacting her directly because the company was ignoring the fact that personal data had been stolen.\nTwo years of thorough records taken by her therapist during dozens of intimate sessions were now in the hands of this unknown blackmailer.\nIf she did not pay a ransom within 24 hours they would all be published online.\n\u201cIt was a suffocating feeling,\u201d she says. \u201cI was sat there in my robe feeling like someone had invaded my private world and was trying to make money with my life\u2019s trauma.\u201d\nTiina realised quickly she was not alone.\nA total of 33,000 other therapy patients also had their records stolen and thousands were being blackmailed in what is the largest number of victims in a criminal case in Finland.\nThe stolen database from Vastaamo psychotherapy contained the deepest secrets of a large cross-section of society including children. Sensitive conversations on subjects from extra-marital affairs to confessions of crimes were now a bargaining chip.\nMikko Hypp\u00f6nen, from Finnish cyber-security firm WithSecure, who researched the attack, says the event caused shockwaves in the country and led news bulletins for days. \u201cA hack on this scale is a disaster for Finland - everyone knew someone affected,\" he says.\nThis was all happening in 2020 during the pandemic lockdowns and the case stunned the cyber-security world.\nThe impact of the emails was immediate and devastating. Lawyer Jenni Raiskio represents 2,600 of the victims and, at the trial, said her firm had been contacted by people whose relatives had taken their own lives after the patient records were published online. She led a moment of silence in the court for the victims.\nThe blackmailer, known only as ransom_man by his sign-off online, demanded victims pay him \u20ac200 Euros (\u00a3171) within 24 hours otherwise he would publish their information. If they didn't meet that deadline he increased it to \u20ac500.\nAbout 20 people paid before the victims realised it was already too late. Their information was already published the day before when ransom_man accidentally leaked the entire database to a forum on the darknet.\nIt is all still there today.\nMikko and his team spent time tracking the hack and trying to help police, and theories began to emerge that the hacker was likely to be from Finland.\nOne of the largest police investigations in the country\u2019s history closed in on one young Finn who was already infamous in the cyber-crime world.\nKivim\u00e4ki, who called himself Zeekill as a teenage hacker, did not become the notorious figure he is by being careful.\nAs a teenager he was all about hacking, extorting and bragging as loudly as he could. Alongside hacker teams Lizard Squad and Hack the Planet he revelled in causing chaos in the extremely active teen hacking period of the 2010s.\nKivim\u00e4ki was a key player, carrying out dozens of high-profile attacks until, aged 17, he was arrested in 2014 and subsequently found guilty of 50,700 hacking offences.\nControversially he was not jailed. His two-year suspended prison sentence was criticised by many in the cyber-security world. Even for Finland\u2019s famously lenient sentences, the fear was that Kivim\u00e4ki and his accomplices - mostly other teenagers dispersed around the English-speaking world - would not be deterred.\nLike many of his peers during this tumultuous time, Kivim\u00e4ki did not seem to let police run-ins stop him. After his arrest, and before his sentence, he carried out one of the most audacious attacks of any teenage hacking gang.\nHe and Lizard Squad took the two largest gaming platforms offline on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Playstation Network and Xbox Live went down after the services were hit with an unsophisticated but powerful technique known as a Distributed Denial of Service attack. Tens of millions of gamers were unable to download games, register new consoles or play with their friends online.\nKivim\u00e4ki enjoyed the attention of the world\u2019s media and even accepted a TV interview with me for Sky News, where he showed no remorse for the attack.\nAnother hacker from Zeekill's Lizard Squad gang told the BBC that Kivimaki was a vindictive teen who loved to get revenge on rivals an",
    "The US has blamed the Rwandan army and M23 rebel group for the deadly bombing of a displacement camp in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nAt least nine people, including seven children, were killed in the strike on the Mugunga camp in the eastern city of Goma on Friday.\nThe Congolese army and M23 blamed each other for the attack.\nRwanda, which borders DR Congo, is widely accused of backing the rebel group and called the US accusation \"ridiculous\".\nRwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makalo said the Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) was a professional army that would never attack a camp for Internally Displaced People (IDP).\nThe US State Department said Friday's attack came from positions held by the RDF and the M23 group. \nA spokesperson said the US was \"gravely concerned about the recent RDF and M23 expansion\" in eastern DR Congo and called on both parties to \"respect human rights and adhere to applicable obligations under international humanitarian law\".\n\"It is essential that all states respect each other\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity and hold accountable all actors for human rights abuses in the conflict in eastern DR Congo,\" they added.\nImages circulating on social media showed bodies lying on the ground at the camp on Friday. \nMost residents had fled there to escape fighting in their home towns and villages.\nLt Col Guillaume Njike Kaiko, a spokesman for DR Congo's army in the region, said the strike had come in retaliation for earlier Congolese attacks on Rwandan army positions.\nPresident F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, who has spent several weeks abroad, will be returning to the central African country this weekend following the attack. \nRebel and government troops have both been accused in recent months of abuses against civilians as they vie for territorial control.\nThe latest strike comes days after M23 fighters claimed they had seized the town of Rubaya - an area which is at the heart of mining coltan used for making mobile phones and batteries for electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, a military court in Goma has sentenced eight DR Congo soldiers to death for \"desertion\" and \"cowardice\" when fighting rebel forces.\nM23, formed as an offshoot of another rebel group, began operating in 2012 ostensibly to protect the ethnic Tutsi population in the east of DR Congo, which had long complained of persecution and discrimination. \nUN experts have said that the group is backed by neighbouring Rwanda, which is also led by Tutsis, something that Kigali has consistently denied.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",
    "Police in Australia have launched an investigation following a complaint by Queensland MP Brittany Lauga that she was drugged and sexually assaulted.\nThe assistant minister for health said she was attacked on a night out in her constituency of Yeppoon.\n\"This could have happened to anyone and tragically, it does happen to many of us,\" she said. \nThe incident follows protests that have taken place in response to recent violence against women.\nMs Lauga, 37, went to a police station and then to hospital on 28 April.\n\"Tests at the hospital confirmed the presence of drugs in my body which I did not take,\" she said in a statement posted on social media, adding the substance had impacted her \"significantly\".\nQueensland Police Service (QPS) confirmed officers were investigating a sexual assault complaint regarding an incident in Yeppoon on Sunday.\nMs Lauga was reportedly contacted by other women who said they were drugged on the same evening.\n\"It's not OK. We should be able to enjoy socialising in our town without the risk of being drugged or assaulted,\" she said, adding that she needed time to \"physically and emotionally heal\".\nPolice said no additional reports in the same area have been made, but are asking anyone with information or who has experienced something similar to contact them. \n\"The QPS takes all reports of drink spiking seriously and investigates reports of drink spiking on a case-by-case basis, and often in conjunction with other offences such as sexual assault,\" they said.\nMs Lauga has been in parliament for nearly a decade and was first elected to the seat of Keppel in 2015.\nQueensland Housing Minister Meaghan Scanlon called the allegations \"shocking\" and \"horrifying\", Australian media reported.\n\"Brittany is a colleague, she is a friend, she is a young woman in the Queensland parliament and these are really shocking things to read,\" Ms Scanlon said.\n\"It is unacceptable that women are disproportionately the victims of domestic, family and sexual violence. Our government is going to continue to do everything we can to protect women and stop violence from occurring.\"\nAustralia has witnessed a spate of high-profile gender-based violence in recent weeks.\nIn April, an attacker stabbed six people to death in a Sydney shopping centre. Five of the victims were women, and the New South Wales police commissioner told Australia's ABC News that it was \"obvious\" he focused on harming women.\nA wave of rallies took place in response to the killings, with demonstrators calling for gender-based violence to be declared a national emergency and stricter laws put in place to stop it.\nA woman has been killed on average every four days in the country so far this year. \nIf you have been affected by sexual abuse or violence, help and support is available at the BBC Action Line.",
    "In January 2020, they were seniors in high school. Graduation was just around the corner. But so was a deadly pandemic. \nBy mid-March, Covid had upended daily life and many students were forced to spend their final months of school at home. Proms were cancelled. \nFour years later, those same students are now in college about to graduate. And once again, they face a similar souring of what would normally be a festive occasion. \nPro-Palestinian protests have erupted at over 130 college campuses across the US, as organisers demand their universities cut ties from companies linked to Israel. \nThey've set up vast encampments in the middle of university grounds and defied multiple warnings to disperse, sparking police raids and over 2,000 arrests. \nThree seniors explain how they're dealing with this tumultuous ending of their academic careers - for the second time. \nMadison Morris, 22, University of Texas \nThe day the state troopers came in, that was also the day I had my last final exam. When I got to campus, they were already there and were closing in on students. \nThe tension was super high. I had never been that close to so many police before. It was scary. \nI didn't really study for my exam later that day - I couldn't focus. All I kept thinking about was what I had just seen. I doubt I did as well on the exam as I wanted.\nMy last day of class was the day I saw protesters - my fellow students - who were peacefully gathered on the main lawn, getting dragged away by police and arrested. \nThat's something that's going to be ingrained in my memory forever. Those are going to be the memories of my final moments in college.\nIt's hard to even feel happy right now while seeing all the negative stuff that's happening. I feel like I can't even really celebrate my accomplishments, because I'm just so overwhelmed. \nGraduation is next week. I had been looking forward to it for the last four years, because I didn't get to have a real one in high school. Because of Covid, we had to wear masks and there was social distancing. It wasn't the same. \nI was really hoping for a traditional graduation this year. I have been trying to make the most of my senior year and really just take it all in, but it's hard when stuff like this is going on. Like Covid, honestly, it all feels super dystopian. \nCraig Birckhead-Morton, 21, Yale University\nI was one of the 48 students arrested on 22 April. I woke up in the encampment at 6:30 to warnings from our safety marshals that we're being surrounded by the police. They told us to get up and prepare for arrest. I went to class the same day. It's been a very difficult time - a whole new level of stress. \nI have two final papers due. I have an Arabic project due. And I'm still behind on it because of everything that's going on.\nSenior year is extremely important, considering my family in all of this. They want to see me graduate. It's been a major concern of mine. \nWe still haven't heard how the university plans to respond. And in many ways that's scarier than our actual legal charges. \nWe might not be allowed to walk at graduation. We might not receive our diplomas or final transcripts. For me, the transcript is critical. I need it to matriculate into the master's programme I was accepted into at Columbia.\nPersonally, I feel that all this knowledge I'm acquiring at Yale needs to go to a just cause. That's why I felt it necessary to hold the line on this. The situation in Palestine is unacceptable.\nI remember the first week of March during my senior year of high school. We were sent home and things were made remote. \nWe didn't know that would be the end, but it was. No prom, no graduation. The pandemic was a major disruptor, but so were the Black Lives Matter protests. That was also a crucial part of the end of my high school experience and something that led me into organising and where I am today.\nMelissa Manesh, 21, University of Southern California\nThis is supposed to be a happy time, the last few days on campus we'll ever have as students. And now it's being taken over by protesters. There's so much chaos happening. It's frustrating. \nThe protesters are ruining student life. Libraries aren't being open at a time when most people are trying to study for final exams. \nThere are helicopters flying around. Only two entrances are open to campus, which forces some of us to walk extra-long distances. Protesters are also blocking a huge area on campus and making it feel unsafe to walk through. \nI know for the Jewish students, a lot of us are scared. They'll shout at you. They'll call you a genocide supporter. We don't want to see these protesters and their signs that are extremely offensive. It heightens the stress of having to study. It's hard not to think about this when it's all happening right in front of you. It's extremely distracting. \nIf you had told me that graduation was going to be cancelled, I wouldn't have believed you. When we found out, we were all really distraught and upset. This wa",
    "Just weeks before the first ballot was cast in this year's Indian election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was at an event in Delhi rubbing shoulders with people known by names like BeerBiceps and Curly Tales.\nThe event - an awards show, congratulating some of the country's top social media stars on their work - was an acknowledgement of the power of the influencer which a few years ago may have seemed unimaginable.\nAnd as politicians prepared to battle it out for India's billion votes, these influencers were being lined up to play a crucial role in reaching the young, the disinterested and the disillusioned. \nBut even as some celebrate social media's democratisation of the media - a place where any one can share their views freely - others paint a darker picture, one where threats are rife, and the truth can be set aside for the right pay cheque.\nA decade ago, you would have struggled to find anyone calling themselves an \"influencer\".\nBut now, says Vinay Deshpande, co-founder of Rajneethi, a political management consultant firm, \"it's become a profession\".\n\"I know teenagers who are doing this part-time to earn pocket money.\"\nPocket money underplays the earning potential somewhat, however. At the lower end, people can charge around 2,000 rupees ($24; \u00a319) a day, but top influencers can pull in about 500,000 rupees for a post - equivalent to the monthly salary of someone in top-level management.\nThe creator of the Ranting Gola channel revealed to the BBC that political parties and election management firms have offered as much as \"100,000 to 500,000 rupees for a single campaign\". \nIt is no small amount - but then, it could turn the tide in a candidate's favour.\nMr Deshpande says they have helped an opposition candidate win an assembly election by pushing out content through a curated list of local influencers with a small but active following.\n\"Social media content is powerful and can influence the way a person feels about an issue,\" Mr Deshpande says. \"It gives social currency to a belief or opinion - but this can lead to a lack of critical thinking about an issue,\" he adds.\nPreethi Aggarwal, 25, is one of those who turns to apps like Instagram, YouTube and Twitter to help her understand the news.\nLike thousands of others, Ms Aggarwal follows a bunch of \"political influencers\", or people who talk about politics on social media to \"really understand what's going on\".\n\"News can get boring and complicated sometimes. I think these people [influencers] make it fun and easier to understand,\" she says, adding the context and their own perspective help her form her opinions.\nBut the problem is, whose perspective is she getting?\nYouTuber Samdish Bhatia reveals numerous politicians have reached out to him, especially in the months before this election, offering him millions of rupees to interview them. \n\"But they wanted me to share questions in advance or get the video approved before it's published,\" he says, adding that he declined the offers because he \"likes to maintain editorial control\".\nThe particular trend for longer form, slightly chummy interviews - where politicians get to show off their human side - is particularly vulnerable to management, says Joyojeet Pal, an associate professor at the University of Michigan.\n\"Many of these interviews are carefully managed by politicians,\" Mr Pal says.\nBut even if they aren't, a gentler style of questioning can also blur the line between interview and promotion, says Mr Pal. \n\"If your questions aren't holding power to account, then the interview just becomes a platform for easy publicity.\"\nBut for Mr Pal, this is just one of the problems he sees with politics on social media.\nIn a recent research paper, he examined some of India's top influencers and who they interviewed, finding BJP leaders were featured more often than opposition leaders.\nHis research also found an overall drop in the number of accounts posting content critical of the incumbent government in recent years, while the amount of pro-BJP content had increased.\n\"This hints at a growing hesitancy among people to be openly critical of the  government whereas there seems to be more confidence in putting up polarising content or content that supports the government's ideologies,\" Mr Pal says.\n\"And this is dangerous for democracy,\" he adds. \nInfluencers supporting the opposition certainly suggested they were working in a hostile environment.\nA number who post content that's critical of the government declined to speak to the BBC for this piece citing fear of repercussions by the government. They also run their channels under pseudonyms to keep their identities secret.\nThe Ranting Gola told the BBC that she has often received comments that are abusive or threatening because of the videos she posts and that her Instagram account has been disabled numerous times, even though the platform hasn't given her a clear reason for doing so.\nShe also only spoke to the BBC on the condition that her name not be revealed.\nThe B",
    "Three Indian nationals have been arrested and charged over the killing of a Sikh separatist leader in Canada, which sparked a major diplomatic row between the two countries.\nHardeep Singh Nijjar, 45, was shot dead last June by masked gunmen in a busy car park in a Vancouver suburb.\nThe diplomatic row escalated after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged India's government may have been involved.\nDelhi strongly denied the allegation.\nIn announcing the arrests on Friday, Superintendent Mandeep Mooker said the three suspects were Karan Brar, 22, Kamal Preet Singh, 22, and 28-year-old Karan Preet Singh. \nHe said all three had been living in Edmonton, Alberta where they were arrested. They have been charged with first-degree murder, court records show, as well as conspiracy to commit murder. \nAll had been in Canada for three to five years, police said.\nPolice added that investigations were continuing, including into \"connections to the government of India\".\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters. Certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today,\" Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said.\nInvestigators have been working with counterparts in India but the collaboration has been \"rather difficult and rather challenging\" for several years, they said.\nPolice said there may be others involved in the killing, and there may be further arrests or charges.\nIndia's Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said the country would wait for Canadian police to share information on those arrested, adding the suspects \"apparently are Indians of some kind of gang background\".\nMr Nijjar was a Sikh separatist leader who publicly campaigned for Khalistan - the creation of an independent Sikh homeland in the Punjab region of India.\nIn the 1970s, Sikhs launched a separatist insurgency in India which saw thousands killed before it was quelled the following decade. Since then, the movement has been mostly limited to countries with large Sikh populations.\nIndia has in the past described Mr Nijjar as a terrorist who led a militant separatist group - accusations his supporters say are unfounded. They say he had received threats in the past because of his activism.\nHe was shot dead at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, a city about 30km (18 miles) east of Vancouver on 18 June last year.\nThose close to him have said he was warned by Canadian intelligence services before his death that he was on a \"hit list\" and there had been threats on his life. \nMoninder Singh, a member of the British Columbia Gurdwaras Council who was friends with Mr Nijjar for 15 years, told BBC News that the Sikh community was grateful to see progress in the investigation.\nHowever he said there were still \"public safety concerns\" and \"a lot of tension. There's frustration. And there's a hope, as well.\"\nThree months after Mr Nijjar was killed, Mr Trudeau, standing in the House of Commons, said Canada was looking at \"credible allegations potentially linking\" the Indian state to the killing. \nThe allegation had been strongly denied by Indian officials, who accused Canada of providing shelter to \"Khalistani terrorists and extremists\". \nThe row between the two countries led Delhi to ask Ottawa to reduce the number of envoys it had in India.\nMr Trudeau has also faced pressure to provide evidence for his allegation of Delhi's involvement.",

But, earlier this week Steel was given the all-clear by doctors.\n\"On Tuesday morning in the most mundane fashion someone rang from the hospital - I knew they were going to ring - and they said 'it is all alright'.\n\"But of course - and I don't know why - they don't tell you straight away. So there was about five minutes of 'how are you, how have you been, what have you been up to?'\n\"I just stayed calm and they mundanely said it is good news.\nSteel - who has a new series of Mark Steel's in Town coming up on BBC Radio 4 - had successful rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy to help treat his cancer.\n\"I don't recommend chemotherapy or radiotherapy as recreational drugs. It is quite brutal, but you have to think this is the way they cure it - and it does. \n\"There were several weeks when everything went. I had no voice at one point and I was just coughing up industrial levels of mucus. barrages of it into a little Tupperware salad bowl.\"\nSteel praised the facilities at UCLH which were also visited by King Charles in his first public-facing engagement since his own diagnosis.\nThe comedian said the chemotherapy room is \"one of the most positive places\" he has ever been to.\n\"You just have to get through it,\" Steel added. \"It is an immense relief and it is luck. \n\"It is partially the magnificence of the health service and you have to get yourself in the right frame of mind, mostly it is luck.\"\nIf you have been affected by any of these issues in this story you can visit BBC Action Line.",
    "Panamanians are voting in a general election which has been overshadowed by the disqualification of the man who was leading in the polls.\nEx-President Ricardo Martinelli was the favourite to win until he was banned from running after being found guilty of money laundering.\nHis replacement on the ballot, Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, is leading in the polls. \nWhoever wins most of the votes in this round will be declared president and sworn in on 1 July. \nThere are a total of eight candidates competing for the presidency, and voters will also choose members of Panama's national assembly.\nAs presidents cannot serve two consecutive terms, the incumbent, Laurentino \"Nito\" Cortizo, will not stand for re-election.\nOpinion polls put Mr Mulino in the lead. The 64-year-old lawyer from the Realizando Metas (Achieving Goals) party was Mr Martinelli's running mate. \nBut after Mr Martinelli was sentenced to almost 11 years in prison for money laundering, Mr Mulino joined the race for president. \nHowever, Mr Mulino's candidacy has also faced legal challenges. \nPanama's top court was asked to decide whether the fact that Mr Mulino was not chosen by his party in the customary primary election invalidated his candidacy.\nOn Friday, just two days before the election, the court finally ruled that his candidacy was constitutional.  \nMr Mulino has the backing of his former running mate, Ricardo Martinelli, who has been living in the Nicaraguan embassy in Panama City since February, where he was granted political asylum. \nFrom a small room in the embassy, Martinelli has been publishing video messages in support of Mr Mulino, who served as his interior and security minister. \nMr Mulino has said that if elected, he will \"close down\" the Dari\u00e9n Gap, the dangerous stretch of jungle on Panama's border with Colombia which hundreds of thousands of migrants cross every year on their journey north to the United States. \nHe has not said how he would close the dangerous route but has made stopping migration an important part of his \"law and order\" proposals. \nA number of recent opinion polls have put Mr Mulino in the lead but with around a fifth of registered voters saying they had not yet decided to vote for, his rivals are still very much in with a chance.\nTwo of those hoping to beat Mr Mulino also are very well-known names in Panamanian politics.\nMart\u00edn Torrijos was president from 2004 to 2009 and is the son of Omar Torrijos, the military ruler who signed a treaty with the US to restore the Panama Canal zone to Panamanian sovereignty in 1977.\nThe 60-year-old is campaigning under the slogan \"Safe Change\". He has promised investment in the Panama Canal, one of the main drivers of Panama's economy.  \nHe is standing for the People's Party, which he joined last year after leading the Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD).\nR\u00f3mulo Roux, 59, a former president of the Panama Canal's board of directors is running for the national presidency for the second time, after losing to current President Laurentino Cortizo in 2019.\nThe lawyer, who is standing for the Democratic Change party says that if he is elected, he will implement an \"aggressive\" job creation scheme and improve public services. \nHe has also said that he would not back the reopening of a controversial copper mine, even though he worked for the law firm which represented the mine.\nThe closure of the mine was announced last year after mass protests shook the country. \nAnother candidate who is trying to reach the presidency for a second time is Ricardo Lombana.\nThe 49-year-old lawyer ran as an independent in 2019 and is standing for the Other Way Movement this time. \nMr Lombana has dismissed Mr Mulino's promise to \"close\" the Dari\u00e9n Gap, telling Spanish news agency Efe that \"migration, ever since humankind exists, is not stopped by walls\".\nHe instead is proposing to improve security conditions for the migrants who cross Panama on their way north.\nThe other four candidates, who have been lagging behind the top four in the most resent opinion polls, are Jos\u00e9 Gabriel Carrizo, Zulay Rodr\u00edguez, Melit\u00f3n Arrocha and Maribel Gord\u00f3n.\nPolls will open at 07:00 local time (12:00 GMT) and close nine hours later.

    "When John Jennings' mother started showing signs of Alzheimer's Disease at the age of 50, he and his sister Emily knew they too would also have a 50:50 chance of developing the condition that causes dementia. But a letter their mother wrote almost 40 years ago could hold the key to changing the course of the future for their family and thousands of others.\n\"You know you tend to get older people and they're buying a pair of shoes and they're like, 'Those will see me out'. I've basically always had that attitude,\" says 39-year-old John Jennings. \n\"I'm like, 'Shall I buy a new laptop?' - because I've had Macs that have lasted 10 years in the past.\"\nJohn, who lives in Edinburgh with his husband Matt, is not bothered by material possessions because he doesn't know if he has inherited a faulty gene from his mother that could trigger early-onset Alzheimer's Disease.\n\"I've just found that the thing that makes me happiest is being around people who love me,\" he says. \"So we just spend a lot of time building relationships and that seems to be the most fulfilling part of life.\"\nBut these social connections are the things John is most scared of losing if he does have the gene mutation and goes on to develop the condition in his 50s, like his mother Carol did.\n\"I'm trying to learn loads of languages and I'm obsessively exercising, I know for most people that would dramatically reduce my risk of getting Alzheimer's,\" says John, \"but the fact of the matter is, for me, it doesn't make any difference.\" \nFor the majority of people, advancing age is the biggest risk factor in Alzheimer's. In every 100 people with the condition, less than 1% will have the inherited form.\nIn the 1980s, it was widely thought Alzheimer's Disease had no familial link, but when John's grandfather - Carol's dad - and his four siblings were all diagnosed with the condition in their 50s, Carol knew this couldn't be a coincidence.\nA new documentary for BBC Two tells the story of how Carol, a teacher from Coventry, helped change the face of Alzheimer's Disease research with one handwritten letter. She had always tried to find solutions to problems, says John, it was \"her way of getting some control of the situation\".  \nIn 1986, Carol wrote to a team at University College London (UCL) who were studying the disease. By analysing the genetics of her family, the team identified a gene in 1991 that all her affected family members shared. A mutation to the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene meant too much amyloid protein built up in the brain, which clumps together to form plaques and causes brain cells to die.\nCarol passed down a 50% chance to John and his older sister Emily, 42, of inheriting the gene mutation that triggers early-onset Alzheimer's Disease.\n\"If someone has the gene, they will develop disease at around the same time that their family members did,\" says consultant neurologist, Dr Cath Mummery, head of clinical trials at the Dementia Research Centre, at UCLH. \n\"So they are aware of the ticking time bomb, especially as they near that age.\"\n\"It's tempting to think if I discovered that I had it, that Emily didn't, and vice versa,\" says John. \"But it could be that both of us do. It could be that neither of us do.\"\nFor those at risk of genetic Alzheimer's Disease, a blood test can be taken - after specialist consultation and counselling - to show if the genetic abnormality that causes the disease is present. \nJohn's mother Carol chose not to take the test, as she believed there was no point in worrying, says John, but while he respects his mother's choice, it's not the route he wants to go down. \n\"We could have planned better if we knew that she had,\" says John. \nHe was 21 when his mother first started showing symptoms in the mid-2000s. Her condition slowly deteriorated until she became bedbound and couldn't speak. \nEvery stage of his mother's decline was \"like a new tonne of bricks that you have to deal with\", he says.\nCarol passed away in March this year. She asked for her brain to be donated for scientific research.\nJohn says he will definitely take the blood test at some point - it's just when - and he will decide on the timing with his sister. Now, is not the time. \n\"I think if one of us had the test then the other one would probably follow pretty quickly afterwards,\" says John. \n\"So it almost feels like it's a decision we need to make together.\"\nThe one thing that might bring forward John's decision to take the test would be if he needs to know his gene status to start any medical treatment.\nHe is optimistic about new Alzheimer's drugs that could be licensed this year. They have been engineered to help the immune system clear amyloid from the brain and slow the progress of the disease. There are potentially serious side effects and their effectiveness depends on early diagnosis - so it is still early days in terms of knowing what impact they will have.\nWhile genetic Alzheimer's Disease is rare, it is similar in many ways to more typical Alzh",
    "It may be hard to imagine how an 83-year-old woman could instil such fear into victims of her money lending scheme that they paid her tens of thousand of pounds of interest on top of illegal loans.\nBut loan sharks like Tabitha Richardson - who was told to repay more than \u00a3173,000 to six victims this week - are on the rise due to financial pressure being felt by people across the UK.\nThere are more loan sharks than ever under investigation, according to the agency Stop Loan Sharks Wales which brought Richardson's actions to light.\nMethods of intimidation include threats of violence, stealing goods in lieu of payment and even kidnapping.\nRyan Evans, a client liaison officer with Stop Loan Sharks Wales, said he was seeing more active cases now than in the whole of his 11-year stint with the agency.\nPerpetrators and their victims often belong to the same communities, he said, and recent cases have come from within church groups and the care industry.\nIt was his job, as someone who deals with victim support and safety, to speak to a couple of Richardson's victims after a concerned relative made contact with his team, which is run by the Wales Illegal Money Lending Unit.\nRichardson, from Newport, was a businesswoman who had previously run pubs and had at one time worked for a legitimate lending firm, at which time she would have had a licence.\n\"It seems over time that that firm ceased, but she carried on lending on an ad hoc basis to people who she claims requested it,\" Ryan said.\n\"She would not have been licensed at that point so the criminal offence was lending money without the required licence.\n\"She'd been lending money for a good number of years up until that point and that's how we stumbled upon it, through the investigation.\"\nRyan said the reasons why people were borrowing had changed in recent years. \n\"Prior to the pandemic it was something coming into the household, they didn't legislate for it - your washing machine, fridge-freezer.\n\"We're not seeing that now. [It's] because of everyday bills.\"\nA total of 63% of victims report borrowing from a loan shark for this reason, he said.\nSeemingly respectable people like Richardson can create enough fear in people - particularly those who are already vulnerable - to keep them in financial thrall for years.\n\"So at the lower end of the spectrum, like you've got with Tabitha, there are nasty things like little menacing texts, harassment, that type of level.\n\"The text messages were, 'you don't want me to come looking for you'. 'Don't make me come and find you', things of that nature.\n\"But that can increase. In Richardson's case there were threats to talk to members of the victims' families, to tell them what's been happening.\"\nThe situation for the victim can then worsen. As more of their income goes just to pay even the interest on loans - which was 40% in Richardson's case sometimes but can run to thousands of percent in some cases - other bills such as gas and electric don't get paid either.\nMore serious methods of intimidation can be employed. There have been threats of violence, taking goods in lieu of payment. There was even a kidnapping recorded in one of the cases Ryan said he dealt with.\nFor Richardson's victims, Ryan said they were not necessarily afraid of her directly but of people she knew, and this is a common theme.\n\"We come across that quite a lot with loan sharks. They are not necessarily the people who will be meting out the violence, or the threats of violence. It would be somebody they know, or somebody they are connected to.\n\"When we deal with cases in north Wales, it's normally 'people in Liverpool' - when we investigate, they're not [connected to them].\n\"In south Wales it's a bit more varied who they're 'connected' to. But it's normally somebody with a bit of a reputation. But when you look more into it from an investigative point of view, that's really not the case at all.\"\nRichardson was a good example, which he said was especially common in Wales, of being \"the big fish in a small pond\".\n\"On the face of it, Tabitha was a very successful businesswoman. She's got a bit of money behind her. People know that she's lent money before; people will go to her.\"\nRyan said that for Richardson, the sums involved might not have been a huge amount in the greater scheme of things, but it represented an enormous amount to those paying her.\n\"They were struggling to eat, struggling to heat their homes. One set of victims was trying to live off \u00a3100 a month and they were dropping money to her.\"\nAs in many similar cases, the amount of money people started off borrowing was low, but because they were repaying 40% interest on top of the capital, it snowballed from there.\n\"What happens then is if you're on a low income, you're already struggling. So to service that debt, you need to borrow some more,\" Ryan said.\nThe amounts ranged from \u00a380 to \u00a320,000 over a period of time. One set of victims borrowed \u00a331,000 and had paid back interest in the region of \u00a312,400, w",
    "Hundreds of people have taken part in a march through Glasgow in support of Scottish independence. \nThe procession, organised by All Under One Banner, set off from Kelvin Way in the city's west end at about 11:30.\nIt comes days after Humza Yousaf quit as first minister, saying independence \"feels frustratingly close\" in his resignation speech.\nHis likely successor, John Swinney, told BBC's Newsnight the SNP would have \u201cwin more hearts and minds\u201d on the matter first.\nThe march headed along Sauchiehall Street before making its way to Glasgow Green. \nSpeakers there included SNP MP Alison Thewliss and Alba MP Kenny MacAskill, with Alba leader Alex Salmond also seen in the crowd.\nMany participants carried pro-Palestinian flags and banners which called for a ceasefire in Gaza, amid the ongoing conflict with Israel.\nMr Salmond told BBC Scotland News that the SNP needed to \"re-focus on independence\" once they elect a new leader, and \"move away from the identity agenda and towards the people\u2019s agenda.\"\nHe added: \"The SNP is in trouble because it hasn\u2019t focused on independence \u2013 it should drop all this self-identification stuff, defend the rights of women and children in Scotland and focus on the people\u2019s priorities, such as jobs, health and housing.\"\nMr Salmond declined to confirm whether the Alba Party's sole MSP, Ash Regan, would support the SNP's new first minister, saying it would depend on what they had to say.\nHe also said he was disappointed Humza Yousaf had declined to work with Ms Regan, saying focusing on independence \"should not have been a high bar for Humza to leap over.\"  \nThe march comes at a pivotal time for the independence movement, following the collapse of the SNP's power sharing deal with the Scottish Greens.\nMr Yousaf made the decision to abruptly end the agreement just 48 hours after saying he had no intention of doing so.\nThis angered the Greens and left him struggling to secure enough support in order to lead a minority government.\nFacing two votes of no confidence that he was not certain to win, he then resigned as first minister on Monday - 13 months after stepping into the role.\nFormer Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who led the SNP between 2000 and 2004, is widely expected to win the leadership unopposed after former leadership candidate Kate Forbes confirmed she would not challenge him.\nMr Swinney said the party was not as \"cohesive\" as it should be but he could bring it \"back together\".\nNominations for the SNP leadership close at noon on Monday.",
    "Efforts have intensified to secure a deal for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages, with talks resuming in Cairo on Saturday. \nHamas said its delegation was travelling in a \"positive spirit\" after studying the latest truce proposal.\n\"We are determined to secure an agreement in a way that fulfils Palestinians' demands,\" it said. \nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said \"taking the ceasefire should be a no-brainer\" for the militant group.\nHamas's negotiators have returned to the Egyptian capital to resume long-running talks - brokered by Egypt and Qatar - that would temporarily pause Israel's offensive in Gaza in return for freeing hostages. \nIn a statement released last night, Hamas said it wanted to \"mature\" the agreement on the table, which suggests there are areas where the two sides still disagree. \nThe main issue appears to involve whether the ceasefire deal would be permanent or temporary. \nHamas is insisting any deal makes a specific commitment towards an end to the war, but Israel is reluctant to agree while the group remains active in Gaza. It's thought the wording being discussed involves a 40-day pause in fighting while hostages are released, and the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails.\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted there will be a fresh military ground operation in the southern Gazan city of Rafah, even if a deal is agreed. Israeli media reported on Saturday that his position remained unchanged despite the latest round of talks.\nBut the US - Israel's biggest diplomatic and military ally - is reluctant to back a new offensive that could cause significant civilian casualties, and has insisted on seeing a plan to protect displaced Palestinians first. An estimated 1.4 million people have taken shelter in Rafah after fleeing the fighting in the northern and central areas of the strip.\nAddressing the prospects of a truce on Saturday, minister Benny Gantz, a member of Israel's war cabinet, said: \"An official response to the outline has not yet been received. When accepted - the war management cabinet will meet and discuss it. Until then, I suggest to the 'political sources' and all decision-makers to wait for official updates, to act calmly and not to get into hysteria for political reasons.\"\nThe Director of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Williams Burns, has travelled to Cairo to help broker the latest talks, according to two US officials who spoke to the BBC's US news partner, CBS News.\nMr Blinken has also been a key figure in the negotiations, and visited Israel again this week to meet Mr Netanyahu. Speaking on Friday in Arizona, Mr Blinken said \"the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire was Hamas\".  \nSo far, ceasefire talks have continued for months without a breakthrough. There hasn't been a pause in fighting or a release of hostages since the end of November. There have been moments in that time where a new agreement has seemed imminent, but a deal has fallen apart before it could be signed. \nEven in this latest round of discussions, caution is needed. A source familiar with the talks told the BBC that the negotiations remained complex, and any breakthrough could still take several days. \nA source told the Washington Post that the US had urged Qatar to expel Hamas's political leadership, if the group continued to reject a ceasefire.\nOn Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in Democracy Square in Tel Aviv calling for the release of hostages.\nRelatives of the hostages also gathered at the Kirya military base in Tel Aviv to urge the government to make a deal. Some accused Mr Netanyahu of trying to undermine a proposed truce, and others called for an end to the war.\nAyala Metzger, daughter-in-law of 80-year-old hostage Yoram, said the government must agree to end the war if that is the price for the release of the hostages.\nThe war began after Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups attacked villages and military bases in southern Israel, killing at least 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages.\nDuring the subsequent Israeli military campaign in Gaza, 34,654 Palestinians have been killed and 77,908 wounded, according to figures from the Hamas-run health ministry.",
    "Freddie Mercury adored them and collected them as he travelled across Japan on tour.\nGeorge Lucas put them at the heart of every costume in the Star Wars franchise and they were the favoured backstage dress of Boy George and David Bowie.\nNow, a collection of Kimono owned by some of entertainment\u2019s most influential personalities has gone on display at an exhibition in Dundee.\nKimono: Kyoto to Catwalk charts the history of the traditional Japanese dress from its far east origins to the garment\u2019s place in contemporary fashion.\nMore than 300 artefacts, including a collection of the gowns owned and worn by the Queen front man, are featured in the showcase at the V&A until January.\nThe show, which originally opened in London in January, shines a light on their cultural impact in the West \u2013 including those in a galaxy far, far away.\n\u201cYou see kimono as being distinctly Japanese, but they also have this universal timeless quality,\u201d said Anna Jackson, curator of the exhibition.\n\u201cGeorge Lucas was very much inspired by the films of Kurosawa, and at one point it\u2019s believed he considered offering the role of Obi Wan Kenobi to the veteran actor Toshiro Mifune who appeared in Sanjuro.\n\u201cMifune didn\u2019t speak English and didn\u2019t think it appropriate so the part went to Alec Guinness but the costumes, part Samurai and part Buddhist monk were inspired by the simple shape of the kimono and I believe the actors referred to them as that, so they knew exactly what they were wearing.\u201d\nMifune\u2019s Jedi-inspiring stage costume and Mercury\u2019s favourite cherry blossom gown are among the exhibits on display.\nThe show has been expanded since its London outing for the final stop on its tour.\nOne of the additions is the oldest surviving Japanese robe in the UK.  It belonged to Sir James Dalrymple who added his own family crest to the design, and like many writers and politicians, used his kimono as a house coat or dressing gown when entertaining guests at his home in Newhailes House in Musselburgh in the early 18th century.\n\u201cIt was made in Japan, came to the Netherlands and ended up in Scotland, so it speaks to this amazing cross-cultural connection between Japan and Scotland which stretched back centuries,\u201d said Kirsty Hassard, V&A Dundee curator.\nAnother kimono from the 1920s features a distinctive rose and lattice pattern which echoes the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh.\n\u201cWe know Mackintosh didn\u2019t visit Japan but was hugely inspired by what he saw in books,\u201d says Kirsty.\n\u201cAnd we think these designers were doing the same, on the other side of the world.\u201d\nMs Jackson believes the versatility of kimono is what makes it so enduring. It can be adapted to any shape or size and worn by men or women.\nIn the late 19th century, there was a worldwide craze for Japanese art and design and women started to wear the gowns.\n\u201cKimono were exported in large numbers and although you could see it as a sort of cultural appropriation wearing a garment from a country you didn\u2019t really understand, it was also liberating for women who\u2019d been used to wearing corsets,\u201d she said.\nIt was also associated with Bohemianism. The 19th century actress Ellen Terry wore a kimono backstage, when greeting guests in her dressing room.\nAlexander McQueen helped Bjork create the iconic cover of her 1997 album Homogenic and the film Memoirs of a Geisha fostered even more interest in the garment, while they were also a favourite of the German-American actress and singer Marlene Dietrich.\n\u201cFreddie Mercury had hundreds of kimono, some of which he wore on stage, but some he wore at home like the one we have in the show. For him it was a way of transcending cultural identity but also sexual identity,\u201d Ms Jackson said.\nFar from being a traditional unchanging garment, the kimono has continued to evolve, and is enjoying a revival on the streets of Japan thanks to a new generation of contemporary designers and stylists.\nHere in the UK, it has been a fixture of fashion for more than a century, and the trend continues on the catwalk and at music festivals.\nAlthough the show hasn\u2019t been made in-house, it\u2019s an important one for V&A Dundee, which was designed by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma in 2018.\n\u201cIt\u2019s lovely to be hosting it,\u201d said Leonie Bell, director of V&A Dundee\n\u201cWe feel like we\u2019re a little bit of Japan by the banks of the Tay.\u201d\nV&A Dundee has faced a number of challenges in its short existence, but they\u2019re keen to face them head on, and they believe this ticketed show, on the back of last year\u2019s Tartan exhibition will help enormously.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at a global tour of Tartan. That was game changing for us at the V&A,\u201d said Ms Bell.\n\u201cThe thought of seeing it go round the world, and follow it with Kimono feels good. It feels like a demonstration, not just of what V&A Dundee can do, not just what Dundee can do, but what the whole cultural sector in Scotland can do.\u201d",
    "A water outage affecting 31,000 East Sussex properties will have a \"huge\" impact on businesses already struggling with the cost of living, a county councillor has said.\nWork to remove and replace a broken pipe has continued overnight, as thousands remain without water with families rationing bottled supplies and some collecting rain water.\nA burst pipe in isolated woodland has impacted supplies since Thursday but Southern Water apologised and said it hoped supplies would return by Sunday.\nEast Sussex County Council's Godfrey Daniel said the water company's reputation \"couldn't be much lower\" and called for doorstep deliveries of bottled water.\nThe Labour councillor said one hotel in Hastings had resorted to flushing toilets with sea water.\n\"They should put bottles of water outside everybody's door, we pay enough water rates,\" he said.\n\"The state of our country, where you can't turn on the tap and expect to see water.\"\nMr Daniel called on Southern Water to acknowledge the issue in people's water bills.\n\"The impact on the town will be drastic, a lot of people will lose a lot of money,\" he said. \"These businesses are struggling as it is with the cost of living crisis.\"\nSouthern Water said disruption was expected to continue over the weekend and apologised to customers in St Leonards, Hastings and rural areas around Westfield.\nStuart Ledger, the company's chief financial officer, told BBC Radio Sussex a replaced pipe was now feeding water back to the treatment works.\nThe burst pipe in Keeper's Wood, near the A21, needed to be removed and replaced.\nMr Ledger said work was being done to get water to 6,000 people on a priority service register.\nLesley Arshad, who is disabled, said she had been left off the company's priority list, despite receiving a letter confirming she was on it last year.\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that when she rang to ask for water, she was told she would get some but \"not sure when\". \nSouthern Water said it had been in touch with Ms Arshad and would be delivering water to her on Saturday.\nThe company added: \"We're sorry that some of our customers have found it difficult to access our bottled water stations due to heavy traffic, and that there have been some delays with deliveries of water. Our delivery drivers are stuck in the same traffic jams but are on their way.\"\nOne woman who lives in sheltered housing in St Leonards and uses a Zimmer frame had six bottles of water stolen after 12 were delivered to her flat, her daughter said.\nJakki Blackman, 49, said her mother Christine Lawton, 72, \"couldn\u2019t get to a water station if she needed to\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking because she\u2019s upset and she gets panicked and anxious.\"\nMarketing consultant Rob O'Connor, 47, also in St Leonards, said his family had been collecting rain water to flush the toilet, and his children, who had to deal with Covid restrictions during the pandemic, were facing disruption again.\nAfter queuing at a water collection point for an hour, he said Southern Water's response had been inadequate and they \"could have done a lot more\".\nBottled water stations at Tesco, Asda, Sea Road and Hastings Academy are open.\nHastings resident Jon Smalldon, 46, said his family had 24 two-litre bottles which they had to ration.\nHe said there was frustration across the town and this was \"not the first time Southern Water has caused problems for Hastings\".\nHe said: \"We all just want it to end.\"\nThe bank holiday weekend outage will impact events such as the annual four-day Jack in the Green Festival and May Day Bike Run.\nMr Daniel said the events see an estimated 40,000 visitors.\n\"This weekend is one of the biggest, usually we get 25,000 bikers coming on the same day as the Jack in the Green celebration.\n\"It's always the busiest day for the hotels, pubs, the restaurants, this will have a huge impact.\"\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "Labour's Oliver Coppard has been re-elected as South Yorkshire mayor. \nMr Coppard won the election with 138,611 votes, roughly 51% of all votes cast in the ballot. \nHe was first elected mayor in 2022 and should have served a four-year term, but the election was brought forward after the roles of mayor and Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) were merged.\nMr Coppard will serve until May 2028 and will take over the role of PCC from Dr Alan Billings, who is retiring.\nHowever, it is likely that Mr Coppard will appoint a deputy to be PCC, as other regional mayors have done. \nSpeaking after his victory, he thanked those involved with running the election and the public, saying that with a vote share of 51%, they had given him a \"mandate\".\nHe added: \"Today, you have offered me not just your consent but your blessing to continue on the journey we started to pursue the change we so desperately need across South Yorkshire.\"\nMr Coppard said he wanted everyone in the region to \"be able to stay near and go far\", adding that people had the chance to \"join with people from across the North to call out this government for their failure to level-up our country, to do what is right for the whole of our country\".\nHe said he would \"think first of those, who all too often come last\" and aimed to build the \"pride, purpose and prosperity\" of the region.\nAs mayor, Mr Coppard had already started the process of bus franchising and had said he would take a final decision to bring services back under public control within 12 months.\nHe also pledged to continue with plans to re-open Doncaster Sheffield Airport. \nSouth Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority has already committed \u00a3138m to create an aviation hub, known as South Yorkshire Airport City.\nIn his new role as Police and Crime Commissioner, Mr Coppard has the power to make police forces more accountable and responsive and can appoint or dismiss a chief constable.\nDuring the election, he pledged to establish a Community Confidence Board to help residents shape policing priorities. \nLabour's Oliver Coppard now holds one of the most powerful roles in the region as both mayor and Police and Crime Commissioner.\nIt is likely he will appoint a deputy to be the PCC, but we will need to wait to find out who that is.\nIn a government public consultation, 65% of people said they did not want the roles to be merged. \nObjections included concerns the PCC would no longer be directly elected and would be \"fundamentally undemocratic\" with \"a lack of accountability\".\nThe new PCC will need to understand how history weighs heavily on South Yorkshire Police.\nChief Constable Lauren Poultney told a recent meeting of councillors there were \"unique challenges to trust and confidence\" as a result of the Hillsborough disaster, child sexual exploitation in Rotherham and the policing of the Miners' Strike, particularly at Orgreave.\nSix years ago the force was put into special measures, but is now ranked adequate, good or outstanding in all areas. \nMr Coppard says improving policing and restoring people's confidence will be key.\nWhen asked by the BBC if he would appoint a deputy for the PPC role, Mr Coppard said his priority was understanding the role and making sure \"communities are not just safe but feel safe\".\n\"But in time, we will bring in a Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner who will do that job day to day. But the buck will always start with me,\" he added.\nFriday's victory for David Skaith in North Yorkshire means the White Rose now has three Labour mayors, plus same-party support in mayors in the East Midlands and over the Pennines in Manchester and the Liverpool City Region.\nMr Coppard said he believed strength in numbers could pay dividends. \"We can work together and hopefully that means we can get those transport benefits, public services, money coming into the region - and that really allows us to truly level-up this country.\" \nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "Last summer, I Kissed A Boy made history as the UK's first gay dating show. Now it's the girls' turn.\nI Kissed A Girl - as you might have guessed - puts a cast of lesbian and bisexual women at the centre.\nTen contestants are shacked up in an Italian villa and, as the title suggests, they're introduced with a kiss. \nLike its predecessor it will be hosted by Dannii Minogue, but this time it's TikTokker Charley Marlowe stepping in to the voiceover booth. \nThe contestants on the show come from a range of backgrounds, and BBC Newsbeat spoke to three - Priya, Amy and Demi - about their journeys before the show. \nPriya is a Sikh, and says she's been fortunate to feel embraced by her religion, something she speaks about on the show. \n\"Just because you're queer doesn't mean you can't be religious,\" she says. \n\"I just think your own relationship with God is very personal and you don't have to share that with anyone else.\"\nBy speaking about her own experiences it on the programme, Priya hopes to encourage \"other South Asian and queer women to feel comfortable with who they are\".\n\"It might be different for other people, but I'm a Sikh,\" she explains. \nWhile some Sikhs face homophobia and there are opposing views on same-sex marriage within the religion, Priya says she follows the interpretation of love as something that exists on a spiritual rather than physical level.\n\"Basically, the religion is just like falling in love with a soul,\" she says.\n\"It's not necessarily a gender, or a person, but a soul. \n\"I think that's really beautiful. \n\"And that's why I love the religion so much and I do speak about it on the show.\"\nBut Demi had a more difficult time coming out to her family.\nShe has a Nigerian background, and same-sex activity is illegal in the country. \nWhile she says she was able to casually drop the fact she liked girls in to conversation, Demi says she hasn't spoken to her dad since appearing on the show.\n\"He made suggestions that I'd go back to the villages in Nigeria where they didn't really accept queer people - so that was very hurtful at the time,\" she says.\n\"And then, since I also told him that I was going on the show, we haven't spoken.\n\"So yeah, I think it's difficult. But I'm 24 - it doesn't affect me as much as it would have, like, in my youth. It's fine.\"\nDemi says she has a strong support network thanks to her mum and sister and new friends from the show. \n\"Even when all that happened with my dad, I felt still quite safe, because of my friends,\" she says.\nAmy has two sisters who are gay, and says she's been out to her family for a few years now. \nBut she says being on the show will still be interesting because a lot of people at home don't know about her sexuality. \n\"Growing up, I found it quite difficult,\" she says.\n\"So they're going to see my face and hear my voice, which is going to be quite an experience.\"\nShe says her sisters would have loved to see a show like I Kissed A Girl when they were younger.\n\"If we had that growing up, that would have been such an amazing thing to see,\" she says.\nAmy says she hopes the show will challenge another preconception lots of LGBT females face - how they're expected to look.\n\"I had different kind of levels of what I would consider masculine, feminine, and then going in and meeting all these new people completely changed that,\" she says. \n\"It's really just knocking down that binary.\"\nDemi and Priya say that one of the biggest challenges they face is people assuming they're heterosexual because they present as more feminine. \n\"They assume you're not a lesbian, because of the way you look,\" Priya says. \n\"I feel like we're all femme here,\" Demi says. \"So I think everyone comes to the assumption that we're not looking for other women or non-binary people.\"\nWhether they find love or not will be revealed on the show, but all the contestants say the show has helped them make \"friends for life\".\n\"I had no gay friends, like the only people I knew who were gay were the women I dated,\" Priya says. \n\"And coming into that environment, meeting all these amazing, colourful, beautiful women and building friendships with each and every one of them is so amazing. \n\"And I'm gonna have queer friends for life.\"\nAmy says meeting the other girls on the show, who come from all over the UK, gave her the chance to meet people she never normally would.\n\"So it's just adding just layers and layers and layers to my chosen family,\" she says.\n\"And it's amazing.\"\nI Kissed a Girl will begin on BBC iPlayer on 5 May.

    "Plans to erect bollards and planters to close the road outside the former Harrogate Borough Council offices have been recommended for approval.\nCouncillors are due to meet next week to consider the application by Impala Estates, which bought the building from the council for \u00a34m in 2020.\nThe developer already has permission to convert the site into office and restaurant space.\nSeven objections to the proposals have been received.\nThe Crescent Gardens site was vacated by the council in 2017 when it moved into new headquarters at the Civic Centre on Knapping Mount.\nImpala Estates said it wanted to block traffic from entering to the front of the former offices, running between Swan Road to the west and Montpellier Road to the east.\nThe developer said it would do this by installing five telescopic bollards alongside planters on both sides of the road, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.\nThe area between the planters would be finished in stone block setts, it added.\nHowever, if the plans are approved then a separate \"stopping up order\" would be needed from the Department for Transport to close the road, requiring a public consultation.\nPlanning documents stated the arrangement would make the road look similar to the Low Traffic Neighbourhood the council trialled at Beech Grove in Harrogate during the Covid pandemic.\nCouncil officers backed the proposals in a report prepared for councillors on the Harrogate and Knaresborough planning committee ahead of the meeting. \nThe report said: \"The proposals will have a minor positive impact on the character and appearance of the conservation area and no significant impact on the setting of nearby listed buildings.\"\nHowever, Harrogate Civic Society is among objectors to the proposal.\nIt objected to the loss of the public right of way and called the proposed planters \"unattractive\".\nSociety chair Henry Pankhurst said: \"We do not agree that closing off the highway to the public is acceptable, even if it was closed to motor vehicles but maintained the right of way for pedestrians and possibly cyclists.\"\nThe planning committee is due to meet to discuss the proposals on Tuesday afternoon.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "Boris Johnson fought and won the 2019 UK general election with the slogan \"Get Brexit Done\".\nIt was a bet that voters were fed up with years of Brexit drama and wanted the government to cut a deal and finally get out of the EU.\nWith a healthy majority, Mr Johnson was able to sideline the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and do the deal which effectively left Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods.\nFor most voters in Britain, that may have been enough for them to accept that Brexit was largely finished with.\nBut in Northern Ireland the sea border continued to dominate politics, ultimately leading to the collapse of devolution.\nWith the Windsor Framework - and a subsequent side-deal with the DUP - leading to the restoration of devolved government, there is perhaps an argument that Brexit is now \"done\" in Northern Ireland too.\nHowever events this week show that is a difficult argument to sustain.\nFirstly, a House of Lords committee highlighted the significant unfinished business of veterinary medicines.\nMedicines have been one of the most difficult post-Brexit trade issues in Northern Ireland.\nThat is because Northern Ireland has remained in the EU's single market for medicines, despite getting most of its medicines from distributors and manufacturers in Great Britain.\nUnder the terms of the original deal, the Northern Ireland Protocol, medicines being sent from Great Britain to NI would have required retesting and relabelling to ensure they met EU standards.\nThe EU ultimately agreed to major changes for human medicines but veterinary medicines still face the prospect of needing to meet those expensive retesting and relabelling requirements, and the risk they will be withdrawn from sale as a consequence. \nThe history of Brexit suggests a deal will ultimately be reached on this issue but that will first require a serious negotiation.\nThe Lords report found no evidence that a negotiation has yet started and the committee chair, Lord Jay, suggested it might not happen until after the European and UK elections.\nThis week also saw the long-delayed start of physical checks on EU agrifood products entering Great Britain.\nHowever goods from the Republic of Ireland are exempt from these checks for now.\nThat is mainly because the facilities at the Irish Sea ports in Wales are not ready and are unlikely to be complete until the first half of next year.\nAlso hovering around this issue is the question of how to impose controls on Republic of Ireland goods entering Great Britain without disturbing the \"unfettered\" flow of goods from Northern Ireland.\nUnfettered access for Northern Ireland goods was a central Brexit promise from the government.\nThat promise is given legal form by the Qualifying NI Goods Regulations, which say that most goods in free circulation in Northern Ireland count as qualifying for unfettered access. \nThere are tighter requirements for food and animal feed. \nThe major challenge around enforcement is how to impose controls on non-qualifying goods without interfering with the free flow of qualifying goods.\nFor example, goods from the Republic of Ireland can flow freely into Northern Ireland; the UK government says it is not going to be checking shipments from Northern Ireland as they arrive at Cairnryan in Scotland.\nSo how will any illicit Irish goods be detected on this route? \nThe suggestion is spot checking, but the precise way in which this part of Great Britain's post-Brexit border will be enforced is not yet clear.\nA vote in the Northern Ireland Assembly this week demonstrated how Brexit is going to remain a persistent feature of Northern Ireland politics.\nIt concerned an obscure regulation - content requirements for organic pet food.\nIt was not a regulation drawn up by a Stormont minister or assembly member, instead it was piece of EU law flowing from the Brussels regulatory system.\nThe assembly was voting on whether it should be added to the body of EU law which continues to regulate the production and sale of goods in Northern Ireland.\nIn this case, it was relatively uncontroversial as the practical effect of the regulation is to align UK and EU rules. \nMost unionists who voted were content to back the regulation as failing to do so would create more divergence between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nThat means the regulation got the necessary cross-community support and will be implemented.\nHowever the first of these \"applicability motions\", on an equally obscure area of regulation, did not get cross-community backing. \nThe UK government now has to decide whether it will make this a subject of negotiation with the EU or impose the regulation without unionist support.\nThere will be a conveyer belt of these applicability motions for as long as Northern Ireland is in the single market for goods and the rest of the UK is not.\nThe potential for them to become a focus of political disagreement is obvious: between unionists and nationalists in the assembly, between the local parti",
    "Labour's Dan Price has been elected as Cheshire\u2019s police and crime commissioner (PCC) after beating incumbent Conservative John Dwyer.\nMr Price, an engineer by trade, received 86,279 votes, 48.1% of the total cast, while Mr Dwyer took 65,836, which equated to 36.7%.\nHe said the public were \"fed up of the lies and the scandals\" and wanted \"change\", adding that he would get on with delivering his priorities, such as bringing in more police officers, as soon as possible. \nMr Dwyer, who was the country's first commissioner to serve in non-consecutive roles after being elected in 2012 and 2021, said the result \"reflected the national picture\".\nLiberal Democrats' Paul Duffy came third in the election, with 27,342 votes.\nMr Price, who was a Warrington Borough councillor until he stood down in 2019, is vice chairman of Great Sankey Parish Council.\nHe said alongside increasing police numbers, his priorities also included a focus on community policing, introduction of new technology and force modernisation.\nHe said he was \"hugely honoured\" to have been elected and said he would \"get on with delivery of my priorities that the public have so clearly supported as soon as possible\u201d.\nHe added that he believed \"fundamentally [that] the public are fed up of the lies and the scandals [and] they want change\". \n\"They want politicians who serve with integrity and honesty and selflessness and that\u2019s exactly what I intend to do,\" he added.\nMr Dwyer said he believed if the\u00a0focus of the election had been \"on local issues alone, I\u2019m sure I would have won today, because we performed so well in the three years I\u2019ve been in post\".\n\u201cPeople are disillusioned with the Conservative Party and I think what we\u2019ve seen with the low turnout is that people just haven\u2019t bothered,\" he said.\n\"They\u2019re fed up with politics and I think I paid a penalty as a result of it.\u201d\nThis is the second time Conservative John Dwyer has been defeated by Labour in this role, having held the post from 2012-16 and again from 2021-24.\nOne of the main talking points in this campaign was Mr Dwyer\u2019s comments about schoolgirls \u201cwearing very short skirts\u201d which were criticised \u2013 particularly by the other two candidates during a debate for Politics North West \u2013 with calls from some for him to stand down earlier this year.\nThe turnout for this election is often quite low, probably not helped by the fact that the Cheshire PCC elections do not coincide with when the two larger councils in Cheshire hold their four-yearly all-out polls. \nAnd this time around it was no different \u2013 coming in at just 21.3%, which was lower than the previous two elections.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram?

    "Scott Major organises the biggest tournament in Minecraft - the world's best-selling video game.\nThe MC Championship, known as MCC, returns this weekend with some of the game's most popular online personalities from across the world.\nIt began as a small idea in the head of the 28-year-old Scottish YouTuber, who says he was shocked when it reached the size it did.\nScott's event reached a record audience during Covid lockdown, when more than 900,000 viewers watched online.\nWith space for 40 competitors, Scott said he was suddenly \"batting away people with a stick\u201d who wanted to take part.\nIt all began in 2019 when Scott, known online as 'dangthatsalongname', wanted a new kind of Minecraft tournament - that was well-run and not too competitive. \n\"We try to focus on fun, so there is no prize money for winning,\" he says.\nThe winner gets a pixelated in-game trophy, commemorative coin and ultimate bragging rights.\nHe spoke with his friend \u2018Noxite\u2019 - the founder of Nottingham-based, Noxcrew -  who create Minecraft content.\nAnd within months the first Minecraft Championship was born. \nIt is broadcast live on YouTube, Twitch and other streaming platforms.\nScott says MCC was \"regularly praised\" when it began, but as it grew in size and ambition it brought new challenges.\nSome Minecraft content creators, even Scott's close friends, were on a waiting list for more than a year to get involved\n\"Suddenly it flipped and that was mentally taxing\", he says.\n\"Even though it\u2019s just people online and it\u2019s just words, eventually it does take a toll and it\u2019s hard to only read the good comments.\n\"I got severe anxiety through the online space,\" he said.\nScott attributes much of the criticism he received to the pressures of lockdown.\n\"I\u2019m an openly gay content creator and I grew up in the west of Scotland, so I had pretty thick skin growing up,\" he says.\n\"But suddenly there were these people who didn\u2019t like me, and my existence was shown to them on a monthly basis.\"\nScott considered quitting several times when he says it began to impact his mental health.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get paid for MCC, it\u2019s done by our own love and drive for the game.\"\n\"Even though I would have people harassing me,  the creators I knew and were interacting with were telling me how fun it was.\n\"That\u2019s what brings people from different communities together and lets them form friendships that they wouldn\u2019t have been able to do before,\" he said.\nScott said MCC made the previously separated Minecraft community feel more like one. \nThe tournament was like a \"world-colliding moment,\" Scott said.\n\u201cThat was always my goal \u2013 bringing the community together.\"\nMinecraft was released by Mojang Studios in November 2011 and has now sold over 300m copies. \nThe building block game has a huge following among children and adults due to its sandbox nature - meaning if you can imagine it, you can create it.\nDuring MCC players take part in eight different games in teams of four.\nSome are influenced by other games like bingo, Mario Kart and the TV gameshow \"Hole in the Wall\".\n\"Noxcrew build video games inside Minecraft,\" he adds. \"It\u2019s taking Minecraft to its limits of what it can do.\nScott organises the MCC teams and creator talent, while Noxcrew - a company of over 30 staff - runs the operational and development side of the event.\nThey use custom models, sounds and textures to transform Minecraft into an immersive gameshow.\nNoxcrew co-owner Joe Arsenault said MCC started at the perfect time during the pandemic, just before the first lockdown. \n\"The Minecraft tsunami exploded and the game got really popular again,\" says Joe\nHe describes MCC as \"an entertainment project, disguised as a competition\".\n\"It would be challenging to host something that\u2019s really intensely competitive and has the integrity you need to be an e-Sport,\" Joe adds.\n\"Minecraft's a goofy game, it's just a block guy with facial hair who punches trees with fists \u2013 its ridiculous and we just accept that it's fine.\"\nMCC competitor FalseSymmetry (also known as Katy) was the first woman to win the tournament four times.\nThe 32-year-old has been a YouTuber in the Minecraft community for over 10 years and thinks the tournament had a positive impact on the game.\n\"Playing in MCC has always been an absolute blast,\" she says.\n\"I don\u2019t think there have been any events I've played in that I haven\u2019t enjoyed.\"\nShe adds: \"It has helped bring consistency to competitive Minecraft games... as well as bringing so many creators together that otherwise may never have collaborated.\n\"The amazing community around the game is what has kept it going,\" she added.\nAfter a five month hiatus, the tournament launches its fourth season on Saturday 4 May.",

    "Labour has retained control of Warrington Borough Council, with the Liberal Democrats overtaking the Conservatives to become the official opposition.\nLabour comfortably kept control of the council, which it has run since 2011.\nThe Conservative vote collapsed, with the party losing all but one of its councillors.\nLabour leader Hans Mundry said he was \"proud\" of the group's large majority.\nThe final result was 42 Labour councillors elected, 12 Liberal Democrats, three independents and one Conservative.\nA number of councillors - around a quarter - decided not to stand for re-election, including the former Labour leader Russ Bowden, and long-standing Liberal Democrat Bob Barr.\nIn Burtonwood and Winwick independent candidate Stuart Mann won one a seat from Labour.\nLabour took a seat in Penketh and Cuerdley from one of the three independent councillors, and won a seat from the Conservatives in Birchwood.\nThe Liberal Democrats won a seat from the Conservatives in Lymm South.\nThe Conservatives lost three seats to the Liberal Democrats in Appleton and three to Labour in Culcheth, Glazebury and Croft.\nThe one seat the Conservatives kept from the 10 they went into the election with is in Rixton and Woolston.\nMr Mundry said he believed it was Labour\u2019s biggest ever win on Warrington Borough Council.\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to have been the leader that led us into this fantastic, historical victory for Warrington and we\u2019re looking forward to serving the people of Warrington,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe national climate does have an impact on local elections but I think as a Labour administration we\u2019ve been doing the right things at the right time for the people of Warrington.\u201d\nBob Barr, the former leader of the Liberal Democrat group, who stood down at this election, said it was an \u201cexcellent result\u201d for his party.\n\u201cWe wanted to become the official opposition again and go from eight seats to 12 and we\u2019ve done exactly that,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI think this has been a real vindication. \n\"The Conservatives have all but been wiped out and they\u2019d gone for a particularly aggressive form of opposition, they\u2019d criticised us for not opposing Labour enough.\u201d\nNigel Balding, previously the leader of the Conservative group, said the result was \u201cdisappointing\u201d and said he felt low turnout was a factor.\n\u201cI think the electorate have given us a message today,\u201d he said.\n\u201cGoing forwards, I\u2019m sure the Conservative voice will continue and we\u2019ve still got one councillor and we\u2019ll continue to do our best.\"\nThe town\u2019s two MPs - Conservative Andy Carter and Labour\u2019s Charlotte Nichols - were both at the count at Birchwood Community Hub.\nAndy Carter said the result was \u201cnaturally disappointing\u201d.\n\u201cIf you compared to 2021, we were looking in many of the wards that the Conservatives secured at 50% turnout and it\u2019s down mid-30s now and I think there\u2019s a message there that our voters have stayed at home,\u201d he said.\nCharlotte Nichols said she felt the results showed \u201ca real move towards the Labour party right across town\u201d.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a real sign of the trust that people in our community have put in us,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThere is a prevailing mood in the country that the Conservatives are squatting in Downing Street.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of discontent with the way local services are being funded but I think actually, when you speak to each of the individual candidates in the individual wards, it has been local issues they've campaigned on and won on.\u201d\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram?

    "People working behind the scenes at the troubled Co-op Live arena in Manchester have spoken of what they say were \"chaotic\" events leading up to the bungled opening of the venue.\nWorkers involved with the project spoke on condition of anonymity as they did not have permission to speak out. They told the BBC:\nCo-op Live was heralded as a \"world-class arena\" that \"Manchester deserves\" by Tim Leiweke, the American businessman leading the project, in an interview with the BBC last month.\nBut \"the perfect building\" Mr Leiweke promised soon suffered fundamental setbacks, with a series of high-profile acts - including Take That and Olivia Rodrigo - having their shows cancelled or postponed at the last minute to the bewilderment and frustration of performers, ticket-holders and staff.\nMr Leiweke has since apologised, and a Co-op Live spokesperson told the BBC events had been paused \"to ensure the safety and security of fans and artists visiting the venue\".\nOne staff member, hired as a \"premium host\" in the venue's VIP rooms, told the BBC she was in the building on Tuesday evening - fewer than 24 hours before the venue's debut performance by A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie was due to begin.\nShe said: \"I think we were very sceptical: that was my first time in the arena and it did not look ready at all... They're doing everything with crossed fingers: it's a bit chaotic.\"\nThe VIP rooms were still \"full of cardboard boxes\", the woman said. \n\"They weren't done - there's loads of final bits [unfinished]. It was filled with workmen who were all still so busy doing random checks here and there, average safety checks... there were loads of wires hanging down.\"\nShe said some stairways also seemed incomplete. \"There were wires everywhere and exposed lighting on the floor. It looked very messy. There were gaps in the stairs... it looked like a work in progress.\"\nThe woman, who has been employed on a casual contract, said staff members are still paid part of their wage if their shift is cancelled at short notice. Staff who are on site when a shift is cancelled are paid in full, a spokesperson for the venue said.\nMeanwhile, another member of staff, this time working in an operations role at the venue, said: \"The root cause of all the problems is coming from the building, not the operations. From an outside perspective, people presume it's being run badly.\"\n\"In reality we have a building that isn't ready, and we're being told it is ready - then things happen out of the blue that cause cancellations\", they said.\nThe staff member said there was relief among colleagues after a piece of ventilation equipment fell from the ceiling on Wednesday night during a sound check.\n\"From an operational side of things, we saw that and went: 'Thank God that's happened [now], we were about to potentially let in thousands of fans into a building that isn't ready,\" they said.\n\"Yesterday I went home and couldn't stop crying. It's not just me, it's the same for a lot of the team, we've put in so much effort,\" they added.\nThe staff member said most public-facing areas of the building are complete - although the offices on the top floor and some premium areas of the building remain \"unfinished\".\nAs of Thursday evening, the dining area in the exclusive Amp Club has \"no fixtures, no fittings, no tables there - it's just a shell,\" they said.\nOn a site visit in February, an employee for Co-op Group - the naming rights partner for the arena - said they were told by construction workers the project was running 35 weeks behind schedule, in part due to delays with crane equipment. \n\"The Co-op's really disappointed with OVG's constant delays,\" the employee told the BBC.\n\"People don't know that OVG [the Oak View Group] own the venue - they just see the Co-op brand,\" they said.\nResponding to the claims from the staff members, a spokesperson for Co-op Live said events at the arena have been paused \"to ensure the safety and security of fans and artists visiting the venue\".\nThe spokesperson added: \"Our staff are as important to us as our fans and artists. We work with multiple suppliers and contractors to support wellbeing of all staff across the project.\"\nTim Leiweke, Chairman and CEO of the Oak View Group, said: \"On behalf of all of us at Oak View Group, I'd like to express my sincere apologies to all those that have been affected.\"\nA spokesperson for the Co-op Group said: \"Co-op is a sponsor and does not own or run the venue, and we have made it clear to Oak View Group, who are responsible for the building, that the impact on ticket-holders must be addressed as a priority.\"\nThey added: \"Co-op members and other ticket holders can be reassured that the venue has the very highest levels of security and safety measures.\"\nBAM Construction declined to comment.\nCorrection 4 May 2024: An earlier version of this article included inaccurate references to an internal Co-op Group document and wrongly stated that the risk of reputational damage to the group had been listed as \"critical\"",

    "Stroud District Council has once again no overall control following Thursday's local election.\nThe Green Party has become the largest party in the district council for the first time in its history - but falls short of taking full control with 22 seats.\nLabour has 20, Conservatives seven and Liberal Democrats two.\nThe council has had no overall control for 13 years.\nThe Green Party's Catherine Braun said she was \"delighted\" and would \"be prepared to continue as council leader\".\nShe said they had always worked \"collaboratively with other parties so that's what we want to continue to do\".\nMs Braun said her party would probably not consider working with the Conservatives, but she would have discussions with Labour and the Liberal Democrats.\nLabour increased its number of district councillors from four to 20 and took a number of seats from the Conservatives, which reduced from 19 to seven.\nConservative group leader, Lindsay Green, said the result was \"disappointing\".\nShe said: \"I don't think it's surprising a lot of people with the national picture.\n\"I think people all across the district and across the country are very disillusioned with politics\".\nMs Green said she would not rule out working with other parties either.\nAnalysis from Gloucestershire political reporter Ed Rowe\nThis has been a historic day for the Green Party, becoming the largest party on Stroud District Council for the first time in history, but it's also been a big day for Labour.\nThe party, which saw bitter splits and in-fighting during the last administration, is now the second largest party on the council, increasing its number five fold.\nBut it was not all happiness and smiles, with the Conservatives dropping from largest group to third, with only seven seats.\nDespite jubilation from the winners, what happens next is unclear.\nNo one party has that magic majority of 26 seats, so deals will have to be done, or at the very least informal agreements made about who runs things.\nWhether Labour and Green councillors can work together or a more cohesive grouping forms, we will just have to wait and see over the coming months.\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The NHS needs more doctors, and this year saw a record number of applications from medical students to start junior doctor training. But problems behind the scenes have meant many have not yet been found jobs. What has gone wrong?\nWhen the email of congratulations arrived in her inbox last month, Emma could not have been any more excited. Inside was meant to be the details of her first job as a junior doctor.\nOn the brink of graduation from Warwick Medical School, the 29-year-old was due to find out about where she would working for the next two years.\nBut despite the email being titled congratulations, next to each of her placements for her two-year foundation course, the first rung on the doctor training ladder, was the abbreviation TBC.\nShe had been given what is called a placeholder job. \"I've been told I will have a job, but that they don't know where yet and it could take until three weeks before I am due to start in August for me to find out. All I know is it will be somewhere in the West Midlands South region.\n\"It is incredibly unsettling. It makes you feel unvalued and an inconvenience. The NHS is short of doctors and yet they cannot find me a job.\n\"I am renting at the moment, but depending on where I am placed I may have to give notice to my landlord and move.\"\nEmma was one of more than 1,000 medical students in this position when the emails initially went out. That was nearly one in nine of those who have applied to start junior doctor training this summer.\nSince then the numbers have dropped to 800 as NHS trusts have created new roles and some students have already decided not to take up their place.\nPart of the problem is that there has been an increase in medical students this summer to start junior doctor training, with just over 9,700 accepted by the UK Foundation Programme, up from 8,655 in 2023.\nSome of these will have come from abroad, and under immigration rules the NHS cannot prioritise UK-trained students.\nThe increase is welcome given the need to train more doctors, with the government in England aiming to double the number of medical student places by 2031.\nBut it has meant NHS trusts have struggled to keep up and ensure they have enough training posts for new graduates. \nThe British Medical Association has this week written to the health secretary to warn it is \"exceedingly concerned\" about the placeholder situation, after being inundated with complaints from worried medical students.\nIts letter says many are reporting they may only be told where they will be three weeks before their August start date, when work schedules are meant to be confirmed at least eight weeks in advance.\nAll they know is what part of the UK they are going to be working in after being allocated to one of 18 foundation school areas in March. \nSome cover very large areas. There is one each for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, while in England, one covers the whole of Yorkshire and Humber. \nMedical students have also had to cope with a change in the way their regions are allocated. As part of the process, they have to list each foundation school in order of preference.\nPreviously people were allocated according to merit - with each student ranked according to how they had performed during their studies and in an application test.\nBut this year that has changed and has been done randomly. The logic behind it was that the previous system was stressful for students and was particularly unfair on those from deprived backgrounds and ethnic minorities. They tended to perform less well, and therefore were more likely to be posted to regions they did not favour, according to the UK Foundation Programme.\nHowever, overall it has resulted in more students not ending up with one of their top five choices - more than 730 compared to just over 430 last year.\nBMA medical students committee deputy chairman Rob Tucker says while students understood the logic behind changing the system, he feels \"something has gone wrong\" given what has happened.  \n\"Students feel like they are in a lottery. It all depends what number the computer algorithm spits out.\"\nAnd he is worried it will lead to more people dropping out and not progressing on to the next stage of training.\n\"Having more students with their bottom choices, and so many with placeholder jobs, increases the chances of more medical students walking away.\n\"It's very hard if you end up in a part of the country you don't want to work [in] and then if you don't know where you are going to work in that particular region until as little as a few weeks before you start, that's not fair.\n\"It costs a lot of money to train a doctor. It's good value if they work for the NHS for 30 or 40 years, but not if you lose them straight away.\"\nThere is sympathy for their plight among those running the system.\nSpeaking at the Royal College of Physicians annual conference last month, North London Foundation School deputy director Dr Celia Bielawski said the deaneries were working hard with NHS tr",
    "A neighbour is leading a campaign to have traffic lights installed at a junction following a number of accidents.\nSarah Brisland started an online petition after a car crashed into her neighbour's garden in Broadwell, Gloucestershire.\nMore than 1,000 people have signed it, many of them sharing their own experiences of driving over the crossroads between Speech House Road and Poolway Road (B4226), and North Road and South Road (B4432).\nGloucestershire County Council has said it will review the petition when it is submitted and it will increase signage at the crossroads.\nMs Brisland, who has lived in Broadwell for 10 years, said she decided to take action after a car \"totally demolished\" her neighbour's fence.\nHaving also witnessed two crashes on CCTV footage in April, she said she believed the number of incidents was down to people \"speeding, not paying attention, and not stopping\".\nThere was also concern among residents about some approaches to the junction being blind spots.\n\"There's been quite a few accidents, some of them are quite minor, but the last two have been some of the worst we've seen in a while,\" she said.\n\"The two that we've witnessed on the cameras, there's clearly either people speeding or messing about, or not paying attention.\"\nMs Brisland said she wanted people in the village, near Coleford, to feel safer, as a result.\n\"It's not even just the cars, it's the pedestrians,\" she said.\n\"The people taking their children to school, the older ones walk across that road to walk to Five Acres [High School]. You've got the elderly, you've got people walking their dogs.\n\"We just decided something needs to be done - it was too close last time.\"\nThe road markings were repainted by the county council in April after concerns their lack of visibility might be leading to crashes.\nResidents have also cited concerns about the speed at which cars approach the junction and some suggested employing stop signs and speed bumps. \nSome residents can remember collisions happening as far back as several decades ago.\nMargaret, who has lived in the area for 20 years, told BBC Radio Gloucestershire: \"When we first moved here, we just used to hear 'beep, smash'.\"\n\"People think they can come out from North Road and South Road but they can't, because the cars just come out too quickly.\"\nResidents believe the installation of traffic lights would be possible because there are traffic lights at other junctions on the B4432.\nLauren Brown said: \"I followed a guy the other day that came flying across.\n\"Traffic lights have worked up at Mile End, so I don't see why they wouldn't work here.\"\nSouth Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust confirmed to the BBC that its crews were called to the crossroads twice in the space of a week in April.\nAfter being called shortly after midnight on 3 April, a spokesperson for the service said it had sent multiple staff and five ambulances to the scene.\n\"Three patients were taken by three land ambulances to Gloucester Royal Hospital, and another by land ambulance to Southmead Hospital,\" it added.\nAn ambulance also attended a crash at the junction on the evening of 10 April.\nFollowing a meeting on Thursday to discuss the future of the junction, a spokesperson for the county council told the BBC: \"Our highways team met with the Forest of Dean District Council to discuss this issue and we will continue to work with them.\n\"We are yet to receive a petition in relation to this area but will review it once it is received.\n\"The junction has recently been re-lined by the council\u2019s safety inspection team to ensure the road markings are clearly visible, and work is planned to increase the number of signs around the crossroads.\"\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A local authority has announced it will ban apostrophes on street signs to avoid problems with computer systems.\nNorth Yorkshire Council is to ditch the problematic punctuation point as it says it can affect geographical databases.\nThe council said all new street signs would be produced without one, regardless of previous use.\nResidents spoken to by the BBC urged the authority to retain apostrophes or risk \"everything going downhill\".\nThe genteel North Yorkshire spa town of Harrogate is consistently named in surveys as one on the happiest places in the country to live.\nHowever, residents the BBC spoke to were generally not pleased with the council's plans.\nPostie Sam was just finishing her round when we caught up with her near a new St Mary's Walk sign that had been erected in the town with no apostrophe.\nHowever, it had since been altered to include one by an unknown hand with a pen.\nShe said, \"I walk past the sign every day and it riles my blood to see inappropriate grammar or punctuation.\"\nThe former teacher said she thought it was \"brilliant\" someone had added the punctuation mark.\nShe said that she spent time teaching children the basics of grammar only for it now to be abandoned on street signs.\nResident Anne Keywood did not think the changes were worthwhile.\nShe said: \"I think we should be using apostrophes. \n\"If you start losing things like that then everything goes downhill doesn't it?\"\nHer husband of 52 years, Andrew, said the signs should be put back to their original state - including an apostrophe.\nRuby Wang, who works at a Japanese restaurant in the town, did not mind the changes.\n\"To be honest with you, because I'm not from this country it doesn't matter because it's the same pronunciation,\" she added.\nDr Ellie Rye, who is a lecturer in English language and linguistics at the University of York, said apostrophes were a relatively new invention in our writing.\n\"In writing you could say they might disambiguate things that could be ambiguous, so they differentiate between two St Marys walking down the street arm in arm, and 'I live on St Mary's Walk' but in practice those two statements aren't really ambiguous. \n\"If I say I live on St Mary's Walk, we're expecting a street name or an address of some kind.\"\nShe added the change would matter to people who spend a long time teaching how we write English but that it was \"less important in [verbal] communication.\"\nNorth Yorkshire Council said it \"along with many others across the country\" had opted to \"eliminate\" the apostrophe from street signs. \nA spokesperson added: \"All punctuation will be considered but avoided where possible because street names and addresses, when stored in databases, must meet the standards set out in BS7666. \n\"This restricts the use of punctuation marks and special characters (e.g. apostrophes, hyphens and ampersands) to avoid potential problems when searching the databases as these characters have specific meanings in computer systems.\"\u00a0\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "A British vet who worked in Kenya for 55 years has recounted the time he went for \"a pee\", only to see a lioness staring back at him. \nHugh Cran, who lives in Somerset and trained in Edinburgh in the 1960s, was also charged at by a wild elephant.\nHe said that every day was a challenge in the unforgiving environment of the Rift Valley, as he travelled miles on rough roads, performing impromptu surgery by torchlight with dirty water.\nMr Cran, who has now written a book, said: \"I once got out of the car to pee and saw a lioness peering at me through the bush.\"\nBut he said the experience only sought to encourage his passion for working in the country.\nMr Cran, from Castle Cary, had answered an advert to be an assistant vet in the Rift Valley shortly after finishing his training. \nHe covered a 100mile (160km) radius of untarmacked roads in the course of his daily work.\n\"I had darting equipment so I was called out to dart zebras which had been snared, or injured lions or cheetahs which had a broken leg or jaw,\" he said.\n\"The distances were so great you couldn't nip back to the surgery and out again, so I used to carry everything in my car for any possible emergency.\"\nHe said over the years he had \"many chance encounters\".\n\"I was threatened twice; on one occasion I was charged by an elephant on the top of a mountain,\" he said.\n\"When that happened you had no time to do anything except get out of the way.\"\nThe second was his close call with the lioness.\nMr Cran said his interest in Africa had been sparked at an early age.\n\"I was always very keen on reading about Africa; King Soloman's Mines, that sort of thing, and I always wanted to work in the Tropics,\" he said.\nBut when he took the job in Kenya he had no idea how long he would end up there.\n\"I intended to stay to test the waters for a year or so but ended up staying rather longer,\" he added.\nAs a young vet he quickly had to adapt to the very different working environment from that he was used to.\n\"Frequently I'd go into my surgery in the morning and turn on the taps, and there was no water,\" he said.\n\"I'd turn on the switch, and there was no electricity. Sometimes in the middle of an operation, say at night, the power would somehow stop.\n\"Vets in this country would probably be appalled, but I think the results were just as good as they would be if you had all the equipment which one gets in this country.\"\nOn one occasion Mr Cran was asked to help a crew filming a flock of pelicans with the help of a microlight aeroplane.\nHe said it was a stunning encounter he has never forgotten.\n\"They were trained to follow the microlight in formation as if it was one of the flock, they were so tame and trusting,\" he said.\n\"If the plane dropped back another bird would take its place as part of an extraordinary interaction. \n\"They were wonderful, wonderful birds.\"\nMr Cran kept diaries of his experiences and has used them to spark the memories he has retold in his book.\nRift Valley Fever, which is named after a disease spread by mosquitos affecting humans and livestock, was published on 25 April.\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and, X.

    "Plans to expand water fluoridation to 1.6 million more people to prevent tooth decay are to be discussed.\nThe Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) wants to introduce fluoridation to more areas of the North East.\nThe plans are currently out for public consultation and will be discussed by Durham County Council on 13 May, though areas across the whole region will be affected.\nFluoride is a naturally occurring mineral which protects teeth against decay and that has historically been added to water in some areas to provide additional protection for oral health.\nDocuments submitted to the council's health and wellbeing board said 26% of five-year-olds living in non-fluoridated areas in County Durham had suffered tooth decay. \nThat was 2% higher than those living in areas where fluoride had been added to water, the document said.\nThe statement also said 120 children under five had to have a tooth removed in hospital due to decay in the year up to March 2023.\nNorthumbrian Water has supplied artificially fluoridated water since the late 1960s to  Chester le Street, Consett, and Stanley in County Durham, Alnwick, Hexham and Cramlington in Northumberland and parts of North Tyneside, Newcastle and Gateshead.\nNow DHSC wants to expand the scheme to Darlington, Durham, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland, South Tyneside, Stockton, Sunderland and areas not currently covered in Gateshead, Newcastle, Northumberland and North Tyneside.\nThe government body said a small number of rural areas could not be covered, as it would not be cost-effective. \nThey added that for every \u00a31 spent on water fluoridation in the area, it expects to save \u00a313 after five years. \nA presentation that will be shown to councillors aims to bust myths about the practice, including that fluoridation is a form of \"mass medication\".\nDocuments state: \"A medication is typically used to relieve symptoms. Fluoride is a mineral, not a medication. It is proven by decades of research to prevent tooth decay.\n\"Fluoridation works in addition to fluoride in toothpaste.  It is a public health measure endorsed by the four UK chief medical officers.\"\nWhen the plans were announced earlier this year, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said: \"Water fluoridation can reduce the prevalence of tooth decay and improve dental health equity across the UK. \n\"It should be seen as a complementary strategy, not a substitute for other effective methods of increasing fluoride use such as tooth brushing.\"\nDurham County Council is expected to make a decision on its response to the consultation before it closes on 17 June. \nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Major pub chain Greene King has called time on its brewery of more than 200 years and announced plans to move to a new \u00a340m site by 2027.\nThe company has produced cask ales from Westgate Brewery, in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, since it was founded in 1799.\nGreene King, which was sold to Hong Kong operator CKA in 2019, owns about 2,700 pubs, restaurants and hotels in the UK.\nEnvironmental and efficiency reasons were cited for the move to a new \"state-of-the-art\" facility on the edge of the town.\nWhat has the reaction been and what does it mean for Bury St Edmunds?\nGreene King, known for brands like Abbot Ale, Greene King IPA and Old Speckled Hen, said the move represented a \"long-term commitment to British brewing\".\n\"I hope that people do see the intent behind this is very much an investment to protect the long term position in Bury St Edmunds and all the jobs that go with it,\" said Matt Starbuck, managing director of brewing and brands at the company.\nPublic consultations will be held and Mr Starbuck anticipated all work would be completed by 2027. \nHe said Greene King was \"committed to retaining our heritage and having an ongoing presence in the centre of Bury St Edmunds\". \nThe brewer said the new site - just over two miles (3.2km) away from the Westgate Brewery - would cut water usage in the brewing process by more than 50% per pint, alongside improvements in energy efficiency.\n\u201cWe have been brewing in Bury St Edmunds for over 200 years,\" Mr Starbuck said.\n\"We are passionate about our craft and the development of this state-of-the-art facility will allow us to maintain brewing at the core of our business going forwards.\"\nIt hoped to submit a full planning application in June.\n\nLaura Jenner, 35, a HR advisor from the town, believed that while the plans were \"exciting\" there was some \"sadness\".\n\"There's a lot of history with [Westgate] - it's a beautiful building and it seems a little bit sad that it will lose that history,\" she said. \n\"But times change and if that makes better business sense, fair enough.\n\"I think if they want to get the best out of the community and Bury St Edmunds, then they really need to give back.\n\"People of all ages in Bury care - they care how the town is impacted and there is a lot they can get out of people if they listen.\"\nIan Norris, who was born in Bury St Edmunds before moving to Scotland, said the company was \"massively important for the town\".\n\"It's not just [important] for employment but because of the vast amount of land that they own in the heart of the town,\" he said.\n\"The local authorities need to be sure that they are involved in the decisions around all of that land and not just let Greene King decide.\"\nTom Appleton, a local arts consultant, said there was \"great growth opportunity\" for the arts here. \n\"Potentially opening up a new space for the theatre would be a really interesting way of being able to better connect the community outside of Bury St Edmunds,\" he said.\nMr Appleton added it was \"loud and clear\" many residents were concerned about the heritage of the site\n\"Being in tune of one's heritage and respectful of it is going to be really important for them,\" he added.\nNethergate Brewery is another brewery based nearby in Long Melford with a taproom and shop in Bury St Edmunds.\nGeneral manager Rob Crawford said while it would not be affected, he understood the move.\n\"If they vacate the town centre that might impact the number of visitors but I can understand the need for a modern brewery,\" he said.\n\"The efficiencies that modern technology can bring can make brewing cheap.\"\nKat Lawson-Phillips is co-founder of Artefact Brewing - a small brewery that operates in nearby Ixworth.\nWhile what they do is \"completely different\" to Greene King, Mrs Lawson-Phillips also said she appreciated the need for a \"modern and efficient\" facility.\n\"From a production and brewing perspective, having a purpose-built, state-of-the-art and sustainable premises is the dream and hugely attractive,\" she said.\n\"But as somebody who lives locally and has grown up locally it is sad to think all this history, heritage and the town centre is going to change.\"\nNick Boley, the Campaign for Real Ale's campaigns and communications director, said the company welcomed Greene King's move to a \"larger and more sustainable brewery\".\n\"Despite the long history of its current brewery in Bury St Edmunds, a move to a more environmentally focused brewery is certainly a good thing,\" he said.\n\u201cGreene King\u2019s commitment to remain in Bury St. Edmunds is a boon to the town, retaining hundreds of jobs and maintaining the town\u2019s historic status a great brewing town.\"\nThe company is due to launch a \"public consultation programme\" on 8 May.

    "Labour's Tracy Brabin has been re-elected as Mayor of West Yorkshire. \nMs Brabin was declared the winner on Saturday following the county's second mayoral election on Thursday.\nShe secured victory over second-placed Conservative candidate Arnold Craven by 275,430 votes to 82,757 under the first-past-the-post system.\nMs Brabin, who was previously the Labour MP for Batley and Spen, became the county's first ever elected mayor in 2021.\nThe position was created following a devolution deal between West Yorkshire's five local authorities and the government. \nThe agreement gave the mayor powers over matters such as public transport, housing and adult skills.\nAs part of the 2021 deal, the mayor also inherited the office of the West Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner, which holds the area's police force to account.\nTaking to the stage at Leeds's John Charles Centre for Sport after her win, Ms Brabin said she had delivered on her 10-point manifesto from her initial election three years ago.\nDescribing herself as a \"free school meals kid who grew up in a council flat\", she said the \"sky was truly the limit\" for others in the county.\nSpeaking afterwards, she said: \"I'm very humbled the public have put their faith in me for another four years.\"\nMs Brabin pledged her new term in office would be about \"delivery, delivery, delivery\". \nShe said her focus would be on such issues as \"franchising buses, mass transit and investing in our communities\".\nLabour have remained confident throughout the campaign that Tracy Brabin would be elected for a second term.\nAll five local authorities in West Yorkshire are Labour-led, and although the party has lost overall control in Kirklees they remain the largest party there. The scale of this result is a real indication that Labour has consolidated its vote in the county.\nHowever, there are signs the party needs to engage with Muslim communities in West Yorkshire over its position on the Israel-Gaza war. \nA second term for Ms Brabin will certainly pose challenges.\nHaving taken the decision in March to bring the county's buses back under public control, she now has to prove that by taking control of fares and routes she can make the network more reliable.\nIn addition she has vowed to get \"spades in the ground\" for a mass transit system for West Yorkshire by 2028.\nHowever, that will rely on funding some of it from the government - and we know the public purse is really stretched. \nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

They recognised that a Labour mayor can make a positive difference in this region.\"\nMr Parker secured 225,590 votes with Mr Street coming a close second with 224,082 a margin of just 1508. \nPro-Palestine candidate Akhmed Yakoob, dubbed the TikTok lawyer, came a comfortable third place with 69,621 votes due to a healthy showing in Birmingham. \nSiobhan Harper-Nunes (Green) secured 31,036 votes, Sunny Virk (Liberal Democrats) totalled 12,176 and Elaine Williams (Reform) got 34,471.  \nOverall turnout was down slightly on three years ago at 29.81%. That figured ranged from 34.95% in Solihull to 28.47% in Birmingham.\nThe outgoing mayor thanked election staff and his political opponents, his campaign team and those who voted for him.\nHe wished Mr Parker \"all strength and wisdom\" as he took over the reins.\nHe said: \"It has been my honour to serve and to lead this place for the last seven years.\n\"I hope I've done it with dignity and integrity, and I hope I've bequeathed to Richard a combined authority - and indeed a role - to which young, aspiring leaders will want to aspire one day.\"\nSolihull was the first of seven local authorities in the West Midlands to declare. \nThe borough gave the first indication of a tricky afternoon for Mr Street, who saw his 2021 majority there slashed by about 5,000 votes. \nThe next big shock came as it was revealed Mr Parker had beaten the incumbent mayor in Wolverhampton by almost 8,000 votes, Labour having lost there in 2021. \nDrama continued throughout the afternoon and into the evening with the race looking too close to call on multiple occasions. \nAll seven local authorities took part in a partial inspection of some votes, known as a bundle check. \nMr Parker won Birmingham, the largest voting district, with 80,251 votes to Mr Street's 66,296. \nThe incumbent mayor picked up Wallsall and Dudley while his successor won Coventry after a full recount and, decisively, Sandwell. \n\"I've covered dozens of election counts in my time and can't remember one as tense as this,\" said the BBC's Rob Mayor as counting continued hours after a result was expected.\nIt was a contest fought over local issues including housing and transport. \nCash-strapped council budgets also defined the race after Birmingham City Council declared itself effectively bankrupt and announced dramatic cost cutting measures. \nMr Street had said the situation in Birmingham was unique, calling the financial crisis the result of a failure of the local authority's Labour leadership. \nBut a gloomy national picture saw him swept from power by the party's candidate in what will be a bitterly disappointing result for prime minister Rishi Sunak ahead of an upcoming general election.\nMr Parker will lead the West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA) and represent 2.9 million people.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The intensifying feud between rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake has reached new heights, with the simultaneous release of two scathing diss tracks.\nAfter weeks of back and forth, the new songs get personal, with allegations of domestic violence and secret children.\nDrake's track, Family Matters, appears to suggest that one of Lamar's children was fathered by another man.\nLamar's response, Meet The Grahams, alleges that Drake is addicted to gambling, sex, drugs and alcohol.\nDrake rejects the claims as a \"shambles\".\nThe two songs, released within minutes of each other on Saturday morning, are much darker than earlier missives in their war of words.\nDrake, who is the most streamed rapper in the world, casually suggests that Lamar is a perpetrator of spousal abuse, rapping: \"They hired a crisis management team/To clean up the fact that you beat on your queen.\"\nOutside of the song, Lamar has never been accused of any form of domestic violence.\nDrake also addresses the legal aftermath of his earlier diss track, Taylor Made Freestyle. \nThe song, which used Artificial Intelligence to duplicate the voice of Tupac Shakur, was taken down after a complaint from Shakur's estate.\nIn Family Matters, he accuses Lamar of pulling strings behind the scenes to force that outcome.\n\"You called the 2Pac Estate/And begged 'em to sue me and get that [expletive] down,\" he says.\nLamar wasted no time in retaliating. His song, Meet The Grahams, arrived 20 minutes later, along with the warning: \"You [messed] up the minute you called out my family's name\".\nThe Compton-born rapper proceeded to call out Drake's parents, and his six-year-old son, by name.\n\"Dear Adonis, I'm sorry that that man is your father,\" he raps in the opening bars. \"Let me be honest, it takes a man to be a man, your dad is not responsive.\"\nHe later calls Drake a \"deadbeat\" and suggests he has secretly fathered another child. \nDrake responded to the latter accusation with an Instagram post, stating: \"Hold on, can someone find my hidden daughter and send her to me pls... These guys are in shambles\", accompanied by several laughing emojis.\nElsewhere on Meet The Grahams, Lamar repeats allegations that Drake has used ghost writers instead of composing his own verses, and that he has undergone plastic surgery.\nLamar also alleges that people on the payroll at Drake's record label OVO are \"sex offenders\".\nThe lyric appears to be a reference to Canadian rapper Baka Not Nice, who began his career as a security guard for Drake, and who was charged in 2014 with forcing a 22-year-old woman into prostitution. \nThe rapper, whose real name is Travis Savoury, pleaded guilty to assault, but the prostitution charges were dropped.\nDrake and Lamar's feud dates back to 2013, when Lamar was a relative newcomer. \nDuring a performance at the BET Awards, he boasted that his skills had \"tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pyjama clothes\". The line was interpreted as a reference to Drake, whose soul-baring blend of rap and R&B had changed the sound of hip-hop.\nThe feud simmered for a few years, boiling over again last year when J Cole and Drake described themselves, along with Lamar, as the \"big three\" of rap, on the song First Person Shooter.\nLamar responded with a fiery verse on the song Like That, declaring that there was no \"big three - it's just big me\".\nSince then, both sides have released a number of diss tracks, with the tension continually ramping up.\nThe fall-out has been good for business, however, with both sides scoring hits in this week's Top 40.",
    "For most people, running a marathon is a huge achievement \u2013 something to tick off the bucket list.\nFor 61-year-old Steve Edwards, though, it has become something of an obsession.\nHe is about to run his 1,000th 26.2-mile race - something only 50 people in the world have accomplished.\nBut what drives him, and with each race getting harder and harder, could this be his last?\nSteve ran his first marathon, in Coventry, in 1981 as a \"naive\" 18-year-old after seeing a poster at his local gym.\n\"I hadn't a clue about what a marathon entailed or how to prepare,\" he says.\n\"But I guess you could say that ignorance is bliss because I went into it open-eyed and just looking forward to it.\"\nDespite having just five weeks to prepare, Steve finished in a respectable three  hours and 38 minutes, but admits he struggled beyond mile 15.\n\"The next day I got out of bed and my legs were like gate posts,\" he laughs. \"I couldn't walk properly for a week and I vowed never to do it again.\"\nHe soon forgot that pledge. Steve enjoyed the \"runner's high\" so much he gave up kung fu, and, like many others during the running boom of the 1980s, joined a running club.\nOver the next four decades, Steve would accomplish countless world records and some truly staggering achievements.\nHe has, on average, run an official marathon every 13 days for the past 36 years, with a combined distance of more than 26,000 miles (41,800km)  \u2013 further than the circumference of the earth.\nIn the marathon world he is known as 'The Godfather', and completing 1,000 marathons in the fastest ever average finish time will certainly cement his place in history.\nBut what is arguably most telling is that every race Steve has entered, he has finished.\nThe retired IT worker from Longborough, Gloucestershire, thinks his unwavering determination and strength is a result of being picked on at school.\nBorn with a deformed left hand, he \"suffered at the hands of bullies for many years\".\n\"Growing-up I was always saying 'I am capable, I can do this',\" he says.\n\"Running gave me a new type of self-confidence that I didn't have in my school years and I'm now very resilient and stubborn.\"\nIn 2010, Steve ran his 500th marathon and planned to stop competing. \n\"I was worn out,\" he says. \"But on the way home I said to my wife 'I think I've got a few more in me.'\"\nHe hoped to complete his 1,000th marathon in 2022, the year he turned 60. However, during the Covid-19 pandemic many races were cancelled and he soon lost his motivation.\nDespite still training, including weightlifting, six days a week, his body never fully recovered from \"all the wear and tear\" and he was close to giving up.\n\"People think I'm a machine,\" he says. \u201cBut sometimes getting out of bed and taking those first few steps to go to the toilet or get a cup of tea I feel like I'm not capable of running one mile, let alone 26.\n\"It now takes me a good few miles to find a rhythm... and I find that I'm getting anxious the day before a race.\"\nAt 09:00 BST on Monday, Steve will be joined by dozens of supporters as he sets off to complete a challenge 43 years in the making.\nHe says he chose Milton Keynes Marathon for the finale as he has completed more races there than anywhere else.\nAsked how he might feel once the race is over, he chokes up and tears fill his eyes.\n\"I don't think it's quite hit me yet what it's going to feel like,\" he says.\n\"Because I know the day after I'll be thinking 'It's all over'. Part of me gets emotional about it.\"\nSteve is still unsure whether he will continue running competitively.\nHe says he has promised his wife Teresa he will stop taking part in challenges.\n\"A part of me is looking forward to not having to train,\" he adds. \"I might pick it up again after a break, but I might not.\"\nOrganisers of the Milton Keynes Marathon have announced a new award in recognition of the \"commitment shown by Steve and Teresa\".\nThe 'Team Edwards Lifetime Achievers Award' will be given to a runner every year who has shown devotion to the sport.\nDuring his marathon-running career, Steve has gone through 100 pairs of shoes, travelled as far afield as New Zealand and raised tens of thousand of pounds for charity.\n\"Personally, I want to look back and know that I achieved my potential,\" he says.\n\"I want to be able to look in the mirror and say 'You gave every race your best on that particular day'. And hopefully that will leave a little legacy that demonstrates that, with hard work and dedication, you can achieve your dreams.\n\"I often look back and think 'Gosh, if I'd never run that first marathon or seen that poster, where would my life had gone?'\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The Green Party is beginning talks to form an administration in Bristol after winning its biggest ever group of councillors in the city.\nThe party now has 34 of the 70 seats available on Bristol City Council (BCC), with Labour on 21, after losing three councillors.\nThe Liberal Democrats have the same number of councillors as before the local election - eight - and the Conservatives saw their numbers cut in half to seven.\nBut no party received enough votes to be in total power of the authority - instead, the council is now in no overall control.\nOn top of that, BCC is switching to a different model of local government, with decisions taken by committees.\nThe Labour Party had been in power of Bristol since 2016 - with Marvin Rees as mayor - before a public referendum saw the position scrapped.\nNow the future of who makes the city's biggest decisions is up for grabs. So what next?\nWell, exactly what it says - no one is technically in control.\nAlthough the Green Party won the highest number of votes, they were two councillors shy of an overall majority.\nThat means councillors within the party will now negotiate with councillors from other parties to find a solution.\nParties which have found themselves in these positions on councils across the country have in the past selected other parties who will work with them.\nThe BBC understands Tony Dyer could become the council's leader.\nMr Dyer, who returns as the councillor for Southville, is the Green nominee for the new role.\nThe decision on who takes on the role of leader and deputy leader, plus the roles of committee and commission chairs and vice chairs, will be taken by full council on 21 May.\nA list of nominated persons will be published ahead of this meeting (likely on 13 May).\nAs of the local election, the council has switched from being run by a directly-elected mayor to a series of eight committees.\nThe committees will run the different parts of the council, including some of their biggest services such as adult social care, housing and transport.\nAs the city moves to uncharted ground, compromise and negotiation will be necessary in order to make the difficult decisions.\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Sir Keir Starmer has added to Tory election misery with a string of Labour victories in regional mayor contests.\nAfter a bruising set of local council results, the Tories had been pinning their hopes on incumbent Andy Street retaining the West Midlands.\nBut he lost out by a margin of just 1,508 votes to Labour's Richard Parker, dealing a further blow to Rishi Sunak.\nThe prime minister now faces the task of rallying his battered party ahead of a general election due within months.\nThe dramatic West Midlands defeat - only confirmed after a nail-biting recount - rounded off a dismal set of results for the Conservatives with Ben Houchen in Tees Valley the party's only mayoral success out of 11 contests across England.\nIn local authority elections, the Tories lost more than 470 councillors and control of 10 councils. \nThe party also failed to hold on to the parliamentary seat in Blackpool South, where it lost to Labour and were almost beaten into third place by Reform UK, a successor to Nigel Farage's Brexit Party. \nDespite the poor performance, talk of a possible move by discontented Conservative MPs to oust Mr Sunak as party leader appears to have dissipated.\nWriting in the Sunday Telegraph, former home secretary and Sunak-critic Suella Braverman said: \"We must not change our leader. Changing leader now won't work: the time to do so came and went. \n\"The hole to dig us out of is the PM's, and it's time for him to start shovelling.\"\nMr Sunak said it had been disappointing to lose Mr Street, and \"dedicated\" councillors, but said by sticking to the party's plan \"we will secure our borders, grow the economy and create opportunities so everyone in this great country can thrive and prosper.\"\nCelebrating with supporters in Birmingham, Labour leader Sir Keir said: \"We started in Blackpool with a 26% swing and we've ended in the West Midlands with our new mayor Richard Parker, and plenty in between - mayoralties, councils and our police and crime commissioners.\"\nHe called the \"phenomenal\" result in the West Midlands \"beyond our expectations\", adding voters had \"had enough of 14 years of decline, chaos and division\" and urged Mr Sunak to call a general election. \nElsewhere, smaller opposition parties performed well with the Liberal Democrats returning 521 councillors - more than the Conservatives on 513 - while the Greens secured their highest ever tally of seats. \nOf the 11 mayoral races, Labour won in 10 areas - the East Midlands, Greater Manchester, Greater London, Liverpool City Region, the North East, Salford, South Yorkshire, the West Midlands, West Yorkshire, and York and North Yorkshire.\nWhile the party has plenty to smile about this weekend, it will have concerns about an apparent backlash in some Muslim areas over its stance on Gaza.\nIn 58 local council wards analysed by the BBC, where more than one in five residents identify as Muslim, Labour's share of the vote was 21% down on 2021, the last time most seats were contested.\nThe potential impact on a general election is unclear, however, with some evidence the biggest drops in support are largely confined to areas where the party's support was already very strong.\nAsked if he was worried about losing votes over the issue, Sir Keir said: \"Where we have not been able to persuade people who might otherwise have voted Labour it is important for me to acknowledge that, to say I have heard, I've listened and I am determined to meet the concerns they have.\"\nIt was a downside to an otherwise positive performance for Labour, which saw it gain 185 councillors to take control of eight councils.\nThe party also gained 10 new police and crime commissioners (PCCs) from the Conservatives, leaving both parties with a total of 17 each. Plaid Cymru's PCC candidate won in Dyfed-Powys.\nMeanwhile, the Liberal Democrats are celebrating gaining more than 100 councillors and taking control of the councils in Dorset and Tunbridge Wells. \nHowever, it missed out on securing a majority of seats in its target areas of West Oxfordshire and Wokingham.\nParty leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"Up and down the country Conservative MPs will be looking over their should terrified of the Liberal Democrats who have won more seats than them in this election.\"\nThe Green Party hailed a \"record breaking campaign\" after winning a total of 181 council seats, an increase of more than 70. \nReform UK performed strongly in the Blackpool South by-election coming just 117 votes behind the Conservatives. \nGeorge Galloway's Workers Party of Britain won four council seats including one in Manchester where they unseated Labour's deputy leader of the council Luthfur Rahman. \nThe Women's Equality Party won its first council seat when Stacy Hart was elected to Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council.",
    "Hundreds of privately owned vintage Ladybird books that became the \"backdrop\" of a collector's childhood are to go on show in her home town. \nHelen Day, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, has lovingly collected and researched the classic pocket-sized works for more than 20 years. \nShe said the \"beautiful pictures\" that explained historical events and fairy tales \"had such a big impression on me as a child\".\n\"They were the backdrop of my childhood, used for school projects and given as birthday presents, they were just always there,\" she added.\nMs Day, who now lives in Harpenden, said the touring exhibition first started in 2018 in Canterbury, but it was always her ambition to \"bring it home\".\nShe said her devotion to the titles was instilled by her parents, who were both teachers. \n\"To me, they were beautiful pictures of the history of Elizabeth I, Nelson, fairy tales like Cinderella, they were the pictures that had such a big impression on me as a child,\" she added.\nMs Day said she owned thousands of Ladybird books, but \"literally I do not know how many\".\nThe books were originally printed by the Loughborough company, Wills & Hepworth, who then published the first volume under the Ladybird title in 1940.\nThe small, illustrated books continued until the mid-1970s, when Ladybird was sold to Penguin Books, she said. \nThe books' distinctive size came about during World War Two's paper shortages.\n\"Someone discovered if you took the largest sheet of paper, that was around at the time, and you laid it out really carefully and folded it and cut it really economically, you could make a small-sized children's book out of just one sheet of paper,\" Ms Day said.\n\"That's the accident that caused the magic of that Ladybird formula that so many of us will remember.\"\nThe durability of the cover was also part of its success, Ms Day added.\n\"They were strong little books, not only were they good quality, but they did not fall apart so they stayed on shelves for years and years and schools didn't throw them out and parents gave them to their kids, and so on and so on,\" Ms Day said.\nShe cannot name her favourite book, but said that at the age of four she remembered it was Little Red Riding Hood, as she was given it as a birthday present.\n\"Most of the history books were about men, just a few were about women, so I spent my pocket money on those, I remember Elizabeth I becoming my heroine,\" she said.\nThe Wonderful World of Ladybird Artists exhibition runs from 10 May to 8 September at the St Albans Museum and Gallery. \nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "For Sadiq Khan the worst fears did not materialise.\nHis record third mayoral victory came after the threat of a Tory surge in the suburbs simply evaporated. Mr Khan's winning margin was 275,000 votes and his 44% share equalled what he achieved in 2016.\nYet there was bitterness in his victory speech, condemning the \"non-stop negativity\" of his Tory opponent. The campaign appears to have taken its toll.\nIn a contest criticised by some London media as lacklustre and without energy, Mr Khan's safety-first strategy  prevailed.\nHis promise of a \"safer, fairer and greener\" capital brought out his own supporters and also looks to have succeeded in persuading Green and Liberal Democrat voters to \"lend\" their support to him in the mayoralty while voting for their natural choices for the London Assembly.\nThis was evident in south-west London where the Lib Dems won their first ever constituency Assembly seat - but Mr Khan comfortably out-polled Ms Hall.\nThere was relief in the Labour camp after a campaign where it did not appear easy for Mr Khan to defend his record.\nOfficial figures published a week from polling day showed knife crime offences in the capital up 20% in the last year. Over eight years the increase was greater still.\nThen 48 hours before polling day, there was widespread shock and revulsion at the death of 14-year-old Daniel Anjorin - killed in a sword attack in Hainault. \nSome thought it might have an impact on the election.\nAmong other pledges Mr Khan offered a fresh commitment to build 40,000 new council homes by the end of the decade - note, not the end of the next four-year mayoral term.\nThere was a big price tag attached to his central \"retail\" offer. \nThe government already funds free school lunches for the majority of primary school pupils but Mr Khan's extension of this to seven-to-11-year-olds not currently entitled for the next four years will cost well over \u00a31bn.\nHe also decided to freeze many transport fares this year, though with no guarantee beyond that. Voters apparently rejected his opponents' attempts to present this as an irresponsible pre-election gimmick.\nMr Khan's victory shows he successfully navigated the biggest controversy of his mayoralty so far - charging the motorists of polluting vehicles through the expanded Ultra Low Emission Zone (Ulez) to cover all of the London boroughs.\nIn the anti-Ulez heartland of Bexley and Bromley, Ms Hall's attempt to gain ground were thwarted by nearly 10,000 votes won by Reform UK's Howard Cox.\nA year ago, the mayor published a book heralding his focus on the environment and cleaning up London's air. \nAttending last year's UN climate conference in New York he claimed to be \"educating\" people and taking them with him on the journey to Net Zero carbon emissions by 2030.\nIt looked then as if tackling traffic congestion, air quality and climate change might form the centrepiece of a radical vision of a third term. That seemed clearly to be what he had hoped would be his legacy.\nThen the brakes were applied after the dramatic loss of political capital he had experienced over the Ulez expansion.\nThat was something his own independent experts advised would not shift the dial in terms of improving air quality, and it enraged sections of outer London and led to Labour's failure to win the Uxbridge and South Ruislip by-election last July.\nThat setback was not repeated when Londoners were asked to choose this time. \nEnvironmental groups heralded Mr Khan's win as a victory for clean air. However, he may now be hamstrung by the limited pledges he ended up making.\nIn his book he talked about pursuing a new system of road-user charging which would take into account the distance, time and emissions of journeys.\nUnder heavy fire from his Tory opponent, claiming he had secret plans for a \"pay-per-mile\" hit on the motorist, he rowed back sharply. \nHe told Transport for London (TfL) to stop all work on it and was forced explicitly to rule it out in his manifesto.\nAt tightly-controlled events on his campaign trail, he was joined by prominent members of the shadow cabinet including Rachel Reeves and Yvette Cooper. \nEnergy spokesman and former Labour leader Ed Miliband was deployed to attack the Tory candidate over climate change while embattled  deputy leader Angela Rayner joined Sadiq Khan to launch his manifesto.\nIt cemented the idea of future partnership and support, but there was notably no pledge of extra money, pleas for which have been a recurring feature of Sadiq Khan's mayoralty so far.\nCentral to Sadiq Khan's campaign was a claim there was a \"moment of maximum opportunity\" where Londoners could soon have a Labour mayor and Labour government working in tandem. \nThe first stage has now happened.\nApparently relaxed about the polling signals and the weakness of his Conservative opponent, he ran a careful campaign.\nKeen to avoid the slightest chance of encountering protest or hostility on the street, over the full six weeks Mr Khan had no spontaneous or unplanne",
    "Labour's Steve Rotheram has won his third successive term as mayor of Liverpool City Region.\nMr Rotheram, who was first elected in 2017, beat his nearest rival by more than 156,000 votes and  increased his vote share by 9.7 points.\nConservative Jade Marsden was second in the poll, narrowly ahead of the Green Party's Tom Crone.\nIn his victory speech, the mayor said the region's voters had \"hollered at the top of their voices\" to tell the government \"enough is enough\" and urged Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to call a general election.\nLive updates: England & Wales local elections 2024\nMr Rotheram secured 183,932 votes, ahead of Ms Marsden, who received 27,708, and Mr Crone, who got 26,417.\nLiberal Democrats' Rob McAllister-Bell was fourth with 21,366 votes and independent Ian Smith came last with 11,032.\n\nAccepting the victory, Mr Rotheram said the people of Liverpool City Region had \"just spoken, they have hollered loud and clear\".\n\"They have two messages - to the government, 'enough is enough', and locally, 'Labour is delivering',\" he said.\n\"The road to Downing Street runs through transformative Labour administrations in local and regional government.\n\"With Labour in Westminster, we will get to see what real devolution is like, not the limited decentralisation we are seeing now.\"\nHe added that Mr Sunak was \"squatting in Downing Street\" and needed to call a general election.\nMr Rotheram also criticised the Elections Act 2022, which requires voters to have photo ID in order to vote.\nHe said to \"those who were unable to have their voices heard\" because of the \"regressive\" law, \"I understand your disappointment\".\n\"I met many people on the doorstep who couldn't vote and I think it's wrong to deny a single person their democratic right to vote,\" he said.\nMs Marsden said not many people would \"ever understand the honour of being on a ballot paper and playing such a major role in democracy\".\n\"It has been an absolute privilege to be a candidate for Liverpool City Region, the best region in the world,\" she added.\nThis was the first time people in the region have voted for a mayor using first-past-the-post method.\nPreviously, the supplementary vote system was used where voters could pick a first and second choice of candidate.\nThe turnout was 23.7% with 272,721 votes cast.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "A mental health nurse feared she would not survive when a patient strangled her as he told her it would be \"fun seeing you die\".\nKazeema Afzal was working at Heath Lane Hospital in West Bromwich on 2 July 2023, when Kiefer Sutton ran at her and wrapped his hoodie drawstring around her neck until she blacked out.\nMs Afzal, from Walsall, said Kieffer Sutton also told her \"It's time for you to suffer your death\".\nSutton, 25, of Wood End Road in Erdington, was found guilty of attempted murder by a jury at Wolverhampton Crown Court and is due to be sentenced on 23 May.\nMs Afzal said Sutton had become angry when her alarm went off and told her: \"Take the alarm battery out, you're disturbing my live chat.\"\nNot long after this, the defendant charged at at her and \"within seconds\" had wrapped the cord around her neck, tying a knot in it to stop her from pulling it loose.\nThe cord was so tight Ms Afzal could not swallow or cry out for help.\n\"I was looking at the door thinking someone will come and save me,\" she said. \n\"I went numb and floppy.

    "Vaccine \"fatigue\" has been blamed for a drop in flu jab uptake among NHS workers at a Nottinghamshire trust.\nFewer than three in five workers at Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust got the flu vaccine this winter, the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) said.\nHealth bosses said that staff having already had multiple jabs was one of the \"main reasons\" for the drop. \nThe national NHS flu vaccination target is 80% but only 43% of workers got it.\nVaccine fatigue has also been cited as a reason the rate of administered flu vaccines was dropping nationally, the LDRS said.\nAll frontline healthcare and social workers are eligible for the flu vaccine through their employer, according to the LDRS which said it was recommended that people get the vaccine annually as it is updated depending on which strains are most prevalent.\nAt the trust, which runs King's Mill Hospital, Newark Hospital, and Mansfield Community Hospital, fewer than 59% of healthcare staff got the jab - down from 62% in 2023. \nMembers of the trust's board heard on Thursday that research is being carried out into the growing hesitancy.\nRobert Simcox, director of people, said: \"One of the main reasons we've found is vaccine fatigue. \n\"People have had multiple vaccines before and felt unwell, whether it's groggy, tired or sore arms.\"\nHe added that accessibility was \"also a challenge\" and said vaccinations were easier for people to get during the pandemic. \n\"We need to increase the opportunities for staff to have it any time of day in their place of work,\" he said. \nThe LDRS said the meeting was told that the past two flu seasons had been very mild, which may be leading to complacency.\nClaire Ward, chair of the board, said: \"Healthcare workers should be more receptive to arguments about the importance of vaccination and the bigger public issues.\n\"We need to communicate the importance, and hopefully it doesn't take a bad winter to increase the uptake.\"\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "You would be brave to predict anything in Scottish politics with any certainty given the fortnight we have just had.\nBut one thing does looks all but nailed on \u2013 John Swinney will be the next SNP leader. And by extension, he\u2019s almost certain to be the next first minister.\nAfter days of turmoil \u2013 and months of challenging polls \u2013 SNP members will be hoping he is the man to steady the ship.\nAre they right?\nLet\u2019s start with Humza Yousaf\u2019s record.\nThere is no doubt that circumstances have been tricky for Mr Yousaf, not least because of the high-profile police investigation into his party.\nBut decisions like standing by the former health secretary Michael Matheson, despite the controversy over his iPad bill, were viewed as strategic, unforced blunders.\nMr Yousaf also angered his then parliamentary allies, the Greens, at the SNP conference last year with an announcement that he was freezing council tax.\nThat decision also went down badly with local authorities.\nAnd in December he failed in a bid to legally challenge the blocking of Holyrood's gender reform bill.\nThat controversial piece of legislation was opposed by a number of his own MSPs, who were not happy his government kept the debate alive.\n\u201cHumza was the gift that kept on giving\u201d as a senior Labour figure put it.\nThey acknowledge Labour\u2019s bounce in the polls \u2013 sometimes closing in on the SNP \u2013 was as much about the unpopularity of Mr Yousaf\u2019s SNP as anything else.\nThe senior Labour figure went as far as to suggest they thought the Conservatives had made a mistake forcing a confidence vote in the first minister, because he was so good for his opponents.\nThe key question now is simple: will John Swinney be different?\nHe brings experience to the job, as Scotland\u2019s longest serving parliamentarian and someone who has served in government in a number of jobs.\nThe phrase \"safe pair of hands\" has been constantly used at Holyrood in recent days.\nOne senior Scottish Labour figure conceded that he would be a more formidable opponent than his predecessor.\nThe fact a contest looks highly unlikely now means opposition hopes of a damaging internal row have dissipated (although do not expect party tensions to disappear completely).\nA Scottish Conservative insider also predicted that that John Swinney would be a \u201ctougher leader\u201d, more likely to bring the SNP back together.\nAnother Scottish Tory figure echoed the feeling that John Swinney would bring more stability to his party.\nAnd a senior Liberal Democrat admitted they were now more nervous the SNP had made themselves \u201cmore electable\u201d by changing leader now.\nBut experience brings baggage.\nYou can expect to hear opposition parties argue at length that Mr Swinney is a sign the SNP have run out of ideas.\nA man who stood down from the government has been brought back because of a crisis.\nSome Tories feel they dodged a potential bullet when Kate Forbes \u2013 the former finance secretary \u2013 ruled herself out of the SNP leadership yesterday.\nOne Tory said they would have been worried about her \u201cfresh approach\u201d and potential to \u201cturn the page\u201d on 17 years of SNP government.\nIt is worth remembering she may well still end up in a senior position in the Scottish government, though.\nThe Scottish Greens are broadly happy with how things look to be turning out.\nThey have made no secret of their disapproval of some of Kate Forbes\u2019 social and economic views.\nWith their support, John Swinney probably has a route to a workable parliamentary majority to pass legislation and budgets - though this is likely to be on an issue by issue basis, rather than any sort of formal deal.\nIt is important to stress that no opposition party seems to regard John Swinney\u2019s election as any sort of massive gamechanger.\nHe may well bring some benefits. But some believe that after years of defying it, electoral gravity may be catching up with the SNP \u2013 and Mr Swinney might find it hard to keep flying.",

    "From bone-chilling thrillers to hilariously dark comedies, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton's anthology has managed to shock and surprise viewers for the past decade.\nAhead of the ninth and final season of Bafta award-winning Inside No. 9, they have been reflecting on the show's history, and it wasn't always plain sailing.\n\"There have definitely been times where TV executives have thought we can't achieve certain things, but we've always proved them wrong,\" explains 56-year-old Pemberton.\nThe pair haven't been afraid to experiment over the years, having produced an entirely silent episode, one all in iambic pentameter and now, in the final series, an episode filmed from a doorbell camera. \nPemberton remembers one particular episode that bosses said would never work.\n\"We wrote an episode where all the characters were filmed talking into a fixed cameras, and to prove that it would work, we directed it ourselves. \n\"It actually ended up being one of the most gripping episodes we've ever made.\"\nThe episode, Thinking Out Loud, was praised highly by critics, and is often included in a roundup of best episodes. \nThe i newspaper awarded the episode five stars and Sarah Hughes wrote that it \"pulled the rug from underneath its audience's feet\".\nThe actors also said bosses weren't too sure about the format of the show when they first suggested it.\n\"When we first pitched the idea of an anthology format with individual stories lasting 30 minutes, it felt radical and wasn't very well received,\" explains Shearsmith.\n\"But now the tide has turned,\" he says, with the likes of Charlie Brooker's TV show Black Mirror proving successful, with seven nominations at this year's TV Baftas. \nIn total, Pemberton and Shearsmith, who previously worked together on black comedy show The League of Gentleman, have written 55 standalone episodes of Inside No. 9 which can be watched in any order. \nThe duo credit the success of the show to the variety of genres it crosses and the self-contained nature of each episode.\nShearsmith says people are now more interested in commitment-free TV instead of drawn-out series with convoluted plots and too many characters. \nPemberton describes the series as \"a box of chocolates and one of them is poison\". \n\"Sometimes you think the story is one genre and then halfway through it turns into another,\" he says. \"It does so well because you never know what you're going to get.\"\nPrevious series have been met with a positive response from critics, with the eighth one receiving five stars from Carol Midgley at The Times, who described it as \"exquisite\".\nAnd the pair definitely have pulled off some pretty impressive stunts over the years. \nIn 2018 their Halloween special episode tricked viewers into thinking the live show had run into technical difficulties so an old episode would air instead. It turned out the technical difficulties were actually all planned and part of the spooky twist. \nBut the problem with these kind of stunts and tricks is that they can only be done once. \nRegular Inside No. 9 viewers know to always think outside the box and expect the unexpected. \nSo how do the writer and actor duo continuously manage to surprise viewers and deliver some killer (sometimes literally) twists? \n\"It has become increasingly difficult when people know to watch for red herrings, but we just try and focus on inventing good stories that will hook you quickly and only need 30 minutes to tell,\" says 54-year-old Shearsmith. \n\"The last 30 seconds of a show shouldn't be everything, it's actually all about the journey,\" he adds. \"The punchline of a joke doesn't make sense without the actual joke.\"\nPemberton says that it's important for the them to \"plant the seed early\" and says many viewers watch the episodes again, to see all the things they didn't spot the first time round. \n\"The answer is there all along,\" Pemberton tells the BBC. \nSpeaking about the new series that airs on 8 May, there's not much that Shearsmith and Pemberton will give away. \nBoth say they are \"very cagey\" when it comes to giving out information about the show, as part of its appeal is people don't know what to expect. \nPemberton says the films and shows that have stuck with him the most over the years are the ones where he's gone in blind. \"I think if I had read a synopsis or seen a trailer before it would have ruined it for me.\" \nHowever, the duo are particularly excited about the first episode of the final series, which will be the 50th episode in the anthology. \nBoo to a Goose sees an ensemble of British actors including Siobhan Finneran and Charlie Cooper all stuck on a late night train that has broken down. \n\"Every series we do an ensemble piece and we love it, because we put together our favourite actors, trap them together and see what happens,\" Pemberton says. \nAs the series come to an end, the pair say they are feeling a mix of emotions. \nShearsmith says he never thought the show would be as successful as it is and is \"delighted\" that it has",

    "South West Water plans to deliver a smaller than planned desalination plant in Cornwall later in 2024.\nIn 2023, plans were announced to build a large plant at Par.\nNow, it plans to create a smaller desalination plant in Par, using existing infrastructure, to \"avoid any impact to the marine environment\".\nThe company said this plan would give it more time to develop its application for a larger desalination plant. The plans are part of a \u00a3125m project to increase water resources in the region.\nThe company said: \"Focussing on the pressing need to secure resilient water supplies, South West Water will deliver a smaller plant later this year... \n\"This plant will be capable of producing between 2.5 and 5 million litres of clean drinking water each day when needed, and will allow more time to develop the application for a larger desalination plant.\"\nIt added the larger desalination plant would \"replace the smaller one and reuse as much of the existing infrastructure as possible to produce up to 20 million litres of drinking water daily, as previously announced by the company\".\nDavid Harris, drought and resilience director of South West Water, said: \"Desalination is one important step in a wider programme of work we are delivering to ensure resilient supplies across our region in the face of a changing climate.\"\nHaving received criticism from residents and conservation groups, Mr Harris said: \"We share the passion that many locals have shown to protect the sensitive marine environment in St Austell Bay. \n\"Taking more time to fully understand this environment will allow us to enhance our proposals and be sure that we are doing everything we can to minimise any impact we have to marine habitats. We have been developing our plans to be consistent with other proposals for development for the area.\u201d\nSouth West Water said it was \"working in consultation with stakeholders and regulators to complete further environmental surveys to support its planning application for the second phase\".\nIt said further public meetings with residents would be held later in 2024.\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Stigma surrounding the death of Aberdeen church elder John Strachan was so severe that it forced his widow to emigrate.\nHaving contracted HIV from one of his regular blood transfusions, the 44-year-old engineer died in October 1987.\nAlmost four decades on - and ahead of the UK infected blood inquiry findings being published - his only son continues to relive the day his \"world fell apart\".\nBob Strachan said: \"My father died - just two weeks before my ninth birthday - and that's when the rumours started.\"\nAcross the UK more than 3,000 people died after contracting HIV or hepatitis C through NHS transfusions and other treatments during the 1970s and 80s.\nHaemophiliac John Strachan regularly required blood transfusions at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.\nDespite his health problems, he had continued to lead an active and community-focused life, particularly around the church.\nBut following his death, word quickly spread through the congregation about the cause of his death.\nSon Bob explained: \"My mum protected me from what was all being said, but some years later I learned of all the additional heartache she went through.\n\"There was a lot of stigma surrounding HIV and Aids in the 1980s - and one member of the church made it her business to let everyone know how my father died without  adding any of the context.\n\"Back then you only had HIV if you were either gay or took drugs.\n\"My mother took me away from it all and we went first to New Zealand and then on to Canada to be with family members.\n\"We eventually moved back to Scotland and settled in the Stirling area where she started to rebuild our lives.\"\nMr Strachan also believes his father was not told of his positive HIV results for six months, putting both himself and his mother at risk of infection.\nHe also feels that his paternal grandfather's death a few years later was a direct consequence of the scandal.\nThe 45-year-old psychology graduate, who works as a pastor and counsellor in Jedburgh, admits the scars from his childhood have yet to fully heal.\nHe added: \"My world fell apart when my father died and that pain has never gone away.\n\"The more I found out about what had actually happened made everything even worse.\n\"My grandfather gave up on life after my father died - he died from a broken heart.\n\"This is the biggest health scandal we've had in the NHS and me and my family were all caught up in it.\"\nScotland's public inquiry into contaminated blood led to a support scheme being introduced in 2017.\nIt initially provided financial help and wider support for people infected with hepatitis C, HIV or both as a result of NHS treatment.\nThe scheme was expanded to also provide payments to partners of infected people who had died.\nA UK-wide inquiry began in 2018, with former judge Sir Brian Longstaff taking evidence from current and former parliamentary ministers from across all four nations, as well as survivors and bereaved family members.\nThe report of his findings will be published on 20 May.\nWhile much of the narrative surrounding the inquiry is about compensation for victims, Mr Strachan believes an acknowledgement and an apology will be just as welcome.\nHe added: \"All the politicians seem to be talking about is how much money should be paid out.\n\"This is about so much more than people looking for compensation payments.\n\"Yes, people should receive compensation as their loved ones died through no fault of their own, but I want to know that there is a realisation by the people involved that this had widespread impact on families and communities.\n\"I want them to acknowledge that my mum lost her husband, I lost my father and my children missed out on their grandfather.\n\"An apology will go a long way to bringing closure.\"",
    "The cast of The Lords of the Rings have paid tribute to their co-star Bernard Hill, who has died aged 79.\nThe actor - who played King Th\u00e9oden in Peter Jackson's trilogy - passed away early on Sunday morning.\nElijah Wood, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan and Sean Astin, who played the four hobbits in the films, said goodbye to their \"funny, gruff, beautiful\" friend.\nThey told Comic Con fans in Liverpool they had lost a \"family member\".\nHill had been due to appear at the Merseyside event but had pulled out.\nHis co-stars from the films, based on JRR Tolkien's classic fantasy novels, stood up together on stage to share their thoughts on his passing.\nAstin, who played Frodo's faithful companion Samwise Gamgee in the trilogy, began by saying: \"So we lost a member of our family this morning, Bernard Hill passed, King Th\u00e9oden. \n\"So we want to take a moment before we walk off the stage to honour him.\n\"We love him. He was intrepid, he was funny, he was gruff, he was irascible, he was beautiful.\"\nBoyd, who played Pippin, recounted watching the trilogy with Monaghan, saying: \"I don't think anyone spoke Tolkien's words as great as Bernard did. The way he grounded those words in a realism.\n\"He would break my heart. He will be sorely missed.\"\nHill's fiancee Alison and son Gabriel were with him when he died.\nThe Manchester-born actor joined the cast of The Lord of the Rings for the second film in the trilogy, 2002's The Two Towers, and returned to the franchise for 2003's The Return Of The King, which picked up 11 Oscars.\nHe was also well known for his role as Captain Edward Smith in Titanic. \nBut Hill's breakout role was in 1982 BBC TV drama Boys from the Blackstuff, where he portrayed Yosser Hughes, a character who struggled - and often failed - to cope with unemployment in Liverpool. \nAlan Bleasdale, who wrote Boys from the Blackstuff, said Hill's death was \"a great loss and also a great surprise\".\n\"It was an astonishing, mesmeric performance - Bernard gave everything to that and you can see it in all the scenes. He became Yosser Hughes.\"\nHe added: \"I was desperate to work with him.

He had a great strength, physically and of personality.\"\nHill was due to return to TV screens in series two of The Responder, a BBC drama starring Martin Freeman, which begins airing on Sunday.\nLindsay Salt, director of BBC Drama, paid tribute to him, saying: \"Bernard Hill blazed a trail across the screen, and his long-lasting career filled with iconic and remarkable roles is a testament to his incredible talent.\"\n\"From Boys from the Blackstuff, to Wolf Hall, The Responder, and many more, we feel truly honoured to have worked with Bernard at the BBC. Our thoughts are with his loved ones at this sad time.\"\nIn Boys from the Blackstuff, Hill drew praise for his gritty portrayal of Yosser Hughes, an intense and memorable character who pleaded \"Gizza [give us a] job\" as he sought work. \nThat show won a Bafta for best drama series in 1983, and in 2000 it was ranked seventh on a British Film Institute list of the best TV shows ever made.\nAnother of Hill's memorable BBC TV performances came in the 2015 drama series Wolf Hall, adapted from Hilary Mantel's book about the court of Henry VIII. Hill portrayed the Duke of Norfolk - an uncle of Anne Boleyn and an enemy of Cardinal Wolsey.\nOther roles in Hill's decades-long career included the 1976 BBC TV series I, Claudius, an appearance in 1982's Gandhi, Shirley Valentine in 1989, The Scorpion King in 2002 and 2008 Tom Cruise film Valkyrie. \nHe was meant to be at Comic Con Liverpool on Saturday, but had to cancel at the last minute, the convention said in a post on X.

    "A man has been taken to hospital following a serious assault in a car park in Bushmills, County Antrim in the early hours of Sunday morning. \nThe man in his 20s was found nailed to a fence, with a nail through each hand, shortly after midnight.\nTwo vans, one belonging to the injured man, were found on fire in the car park near Dundarave Park. \nPolice said paramilitary involvement was one key line of inquiry.\nGraffiti on nearby public toilets has been linked to the assault and arson.\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said the man was left with potentially life-changing but not life-threatening injuries.\nPolice said it was a \"sinister attack.\" \n\"We live in a democratic society where there is no justification for this. Those responsible brutalise their own communities and control others through intimidation and violence.\"\nCrews from Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) also attended the scene and extensive damage was caused to both vehicles.\nIt is understood the man was taken to hospital in a fire engine. \nSpeaking to BBC News NI on Sunday afternoon, Assistant Chief Constable Bobby Singleton said it was a \"really shocking incident with levels of, almost, ultra violence\".\n\"We thought these kind of incidents were firmly in our past,\" he said.\n\"It's early days and we are keeping an open mind, but this incident bears all the hallmarks of what we would see as paramilitary-style attacks, so that will be one key line of inquiry,\" he said. \nHe added that, while the incident happened in a residential area, there are also holiday lets and that it was a busy bank holiday weekend. \nThe smell of burnt out wreckage greets tourists as they arrive at the car park, which is used as a park and ride service, open 24/7 and sits next to a housing estate at the end of the Main Street of the village.\nAbout 20 people in mobile homes and camper vans were woken up by the sound of banging and blue lights in the early hours.\nInternational visitors and Northern Ireland guests told BBC News NI of their shock at what they witnessed, in a village known for its tourist attractions.\nBBC News NI spoke to Jackie - who was staying in her camper van when the incident took place.\n\"I saw the fire and I just hoped it was nothing to do with the campers, I put on my dressing gown and flip flops and went out,\" she said. \n\"One of campers was a nurse and tried to help,\" she added. \n\"I just thought: 'This is awful to happen in a place like Bushmills - they're trying to promote tourism and this has happened',\" she added.\nCauseway Alliance councillor Alderman Richard Stewart said it was a \"horrific attack.\"\n\"This is not wanted in Bushmills, it's not wanted in Northern Ireland.

    "Israel's government has moved to shut down the operations of the Al Jazeera television network in the country, branding it a mouthpiece for Hamas. \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the cabinet agreed to the closure while the war in Gaza is ongoing.\nPolice raided the Qatari broadcaster's office at the Ambassador hotel in occupied East Jerusalem on Sunday.\nAl Jazeera called claims it was a threat to Israeli security a \"dangerous and ridiculous lie\".\nThe channel said it reserved the right to \"pursue every legal step\".\nIsrael's Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi said equipment had been taken in the raid.\nA video posted by the minister on X shows police officers and inspectors from the ministry entering a hotel room.\nA BBC team visited the scene, but was prevented from filming or going into the hotel by police.\nAccording to Reuters news agency, the Israeli satellite service Yes displayed a message that read: \"In accordance with the government decision, the Al Jazeera station's broadcasts have been stopped in Israel.\"\nThe blockage is effectively only partial, however, as the channel is still accessible through Facebook in Israel.\nThe shut down of Al Jazeera in Israel has been criticised by a number of human rights and press groups.\nThe Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) said they had filed a request to the country's Supreme Court to issue an interim order to overturn the ban. \nThe group said that claims that the broadcaster was a propaganda tool for Hamas were \"unfounded\", and that Sunday's ban was less about security concerns and more to \"serve a more politically motivated agenda, aimed at silencing critical voices and targeting Arab media\".\nThe Foreign Press Association (FPA) urged the Israeli government to reconsider its decision, saying the shut down of Al Jazeera in the country should be \"a cause for concern for all supporters of a free press\".\nThe FPA said in a statement that Israel now joins \"a dubious club of authoritarian governments to ban the station\", and warned that Mr Netanyahu has the authority to target other foreign outlets that he considers to be \"acting against the state\".\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists' (CPJ) Program Director Carlos Martinez de la Serna echoed the same concerns, saying: \"The Israeli cabinet must allow Al Jazeera and all international media outlets to operate freely in Israel, especially during wartime.\" \nThe UN's Human Rights office also called the Israeli government to reverse the ban, posting on X: \"A free & independent media is essential to ensuring transparency & accountability. Now, even more so given tight restrictions on reporting from Gaza.\"\nForeign journalists are banned from entering Gaza, and Al Jazeera staff there have been some of the only reporters on the ground.\nFor years, Israeli officials have accused the network of anti-Israeli bias. \nTheir criticisms of the broadcaster have intensified since the 7 October Hamas attacks on southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 were taken hostage. Some 128 of those hostages are still unaccounted for, with at least 34 presumed dead. \nAt least 34,683 Palestinians have been killed and 78,018 injured in Israel's subsequent military campaign in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nLast month, the Israeli parliament passed a law giving the government power to temporarily close foreign broadcasters considered a threat to national security during the war against Hamas.\nQatar, where Al Jazeera is headquartered, is mediating talks between Israel and Hamas over the now almost seven-month-long conflict. \nPrevious negotiations mediated by Qatar led to a temporary ceasefire and the release of 105 Israeli hostages in November.\nAl Jazeera has accused Israel of deliberately targeting its staff. \nJournalists including Hamza al-Dahdouh, the son of Al Jazeera Gaza bureau chief Wael al-Dahdouh, have been killed by Israeli strikes. Israel denies targeting journalists.\n\"Israel's suppression of free press to cover up its crimes by killing and arresting journalists has not deterred us from performing our duty,\" the network said in its response to Sunday's ban.",
    "Sweden has a global reputation for championing high taxes and social equality, but it has become a European hotspot for the super rich.\nOn Liding\u00f6 island there are huge red and yellow wooden villas on rocky cliff tops, and white minimalist mansions with floor to ceiling windows.\nLess than half an hour's drive from Stockholm city centre, this is one of Sweden's wealthiest neighbourhoods.\nSerial entrepreneur Konrad Bergstr\u00f6m flicks the light switch in his wine cellar, to reveal the 3,000 bottles he's got stored there. \"French Bordeaux, that's what I love,\" he says, flashing a bright white smile. \nElsewhere, there's an outdoor pool, a gym upholstered in reindeer leather, and a workshop-cum-nightclub, complete with a large metal urinal.\n\"I have a lot of musical friends, so we play a lot of music,\" explains Bergstr\u00f6m. He made his money co-founding businesses including a headphones and speaker company, and this home is one of four properties he owns in Sweden and Spain.\nIt's not a surprising lifestyle for a successful entrepreneur, but what might surprise global observers is how many people have become as wealthy as Mr Bergstr\u00f6m - or even richer - in Sweden - a country with a global reputation for its leftist politics.\nAlthough a right-wing coalition is currently in power, the nation has been run by Social Democrat-led governments for the majority of the last century, elected on promises to grow the economy in an equitable way, with taxes funding a strong welfare state.\nBut Sweden has experienced a boom in the super rich over the last three decades. \nIn 1996, there were just 28 people with a net worth of a billion kronor or more (around $91m or \u00a373m at today's exchange rate), according to a rich list published by former Swedish business magazine Veckans Aff\u00e4rer. Most of them came from families that had been rich for generations.\nBy 2021, there were 542 \"kronor billionaires\", according to a similar analysis by daily newspaper Aftonbladet, and between them they owned a wealth equivalent to 70% of the nation's GDP, a measure of the total value of goods and services in the economy.\nSweden - with a population of just 10 million - also has one of the world's highest proportions of \"dollar billionaires\" per capita. Forbes listed 43 Swedes worth $1bn or more in its 2024 rich list.\nThat equates to around four per million people, compared to about two per million in the US (which has 813 billionaires - the most of any nation - but is home to more than 342 million people).\n\"This has come about in a sort of a stealthy way - that you haven't really noticed it until after it happened,\" says Andreas Cervenka, a journalist at Aftonbladet, and author of the book Greedy Sweden, in which he explores the steady rise of Sweden's super rich.\n\"But in Stockholm, you can see the wealth with your own eyes, and the contrast between super rich people in some areas of Stockholm and quite poor people in other parts.\" \nOne reason for the rise of the new super rich is Sweden's thriving tech scene. The country has a reputation as the Silicon Valley of Europe, having produced more than 40 so-called unicorn start-ups - companies worth more than $1bn - in the past two decades.\nSkype and Spotify were founded here, as well as gaming firms King and Mojang. More recent global success stories include the financial tech start-up Tink, which Visa acquired for around $2bn during the pandemic, healthcare company Kry, and the e-scooter company Voi. \nAt Epicenter - a shared office and community space with a giant glass atrium - veteran entrepreneur Ola Ahlvarsson traces this success back to the 1990s. He says a tax rebate on home computers in Sweden \"wired or connected all of us much faster than other countries\".\nA serial co-founder himself, he also points to a strong \"culture of collaboration\" in the start-up scene, with accomplished entrepreneurs often becoming role models for - and investors in - the next generation of tech companies. \nSweden's size makes it a popular test market, too. \"If you want to see if it works on a larger market, you can - at limited cost and without too much risk for your brand or for your stock price - try things here,\" says Mr Ahlvarsson. \nBut Mr Cervenka argues there is another narrative that deserves more attention - monetary policies which he says have helped transform the country into a paradise for the super rich.\nSweden had very low interest rates from the early 2010s until a couple of years ago. This made it cheap to borrow money, so Swedes with cash to spare often chose to invest in property, or high risk investments like tech start-ups, many of which shot up in value as a result.\n\"One of the big factors that's driven this huge increase in billionaires is that we've had, for a number of years, quite a strong inflation in the value of assets,\" says Mr Cervenka.\nAlthough top earners in Sweden are taxed more than 50% of their personal incomes - one of the highest rates in Europe - he argues that successive governments  - on ",

If I could do it then I thought, 'why not?'\"\nAfter finding out he was a match for someone, Mr Marshall donated stem cells at Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital in April 2020.\nHe said he had felt \"a bit of excitement and a bit of apprehension\" on getting the call, but felt it was his \"opportunity to do something good for someone else\".\nThe recipient, Mr Neander, a grandfather-of-three in his early 60s, had previously been diagnosed with a blood cancer known as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.\nAfter the donation, the pair had to wait some time to meet up because the Anthony Nolan Trust asks that there be no contact between patients and donors for two years.\nOnce this period was up, Mr Marshall and Mr Neander started communicating via email and video calls, before Mr Neander made the trip from Canada to Sheffield in April.\nMr Marshall said meeting Mr Neander in person \"made me feel that donating stem cells is the best thing that I've ever done\".\n\"Becoming a dad has made me realise time is so precious and donating stem cells to give Rod more time is the best gift that I have ever given,\" he said.\n\"The blood we share hasn't just made us friends but more like family.\" \nMeanwhile, Mr Neander said: \"The chance to say thank you to Tom, my stem cell donor, is overwhelming.\"\nThe transplant had allowed him to \"get back to the things I love\", Mr Neander said.\nHenny Braund, chief executive of the Anthony Nolan Trust, said: \"Our donors like Tom are incredible.

    "Under the rich, leafy cover of the Ukrainian spring, an artillery unit awaits. \nOnly a fraction of their job is firing rockets from their 50-year-old launcher. Most of their time is spent digging a new bunker into the hillside. \nThey're outgunned and outmanned by the Russian invaders, 5km (3 miles) away in the eastern Donetsk region, who are inching closer.\nIncoming American ammunition is expected to help, but how the Ukrainian government is addressing its need to recruit is controversial. \nA new mobilisation bill passed earlier in April was criticised for not including a limit on time served. A clause aimed at demobilising soldiers after three years was dropped at the army's request.\nNow, war-weary troops have told the BBC the military needs to \"rethink\" how it recruits. \nDespite Kyiv lowering the conscription age to find replacements, it's not just a numbers game.\nThousands of trained troops like Oleksandr, a radio operator in the 21st separate Mechanised Brigade, have been fighting for the best part of two years without a proper rest. \n\"If we go home,\" he says, \"inexperienced soldiers might be able to hold the line against the Russians, but a lot of them will die.\"\nHe taps his handset in a bunker where he also sleeps with four other soldiers. The thickness of the air tells you it's well lived in. \nOutside, the woodland provides an illusion of calm, periodically jarred by a whistling artillery shell overhead. \nThis time last year, the arrival of spring's hard soil brought a sense of optimism with an anticipated counter-offensive. The conditions make it easier to move men and machinery.\nToday, it just makes these troops' job of digging new defences more difficult.\n\"My men have become professionals after fighting for so long,\" says their commander with the call sign \"Chyzh\", proudly.\nHe points to their mobile rocket launcher under camouflage netting. \n\"They know each vehicle is like a woman,\" he claims. \"Each one is individual, with her own whims and characteristics.\"\nTucked away, their 1970s truck symbolises the current state of Ukraine's military. Old-fashioned in many ways yet modern in others - with a GPS guiding system - it lacks one key resource: rockets. \nWhile Russia's army isn't a model of modern warfare, it is advancing on multiple parts of the eastern front line. It's why we're seeing new Ukrainian trenches being dug 30km (19 miles) back. \nThe invading forces have learnt tactical lessons and enjoy air superiority. Moscow has also drastically increased weapons production and is mobilising men at a faster rate than Ukraine can. \nThe sentiment in our wooded trench mirrors the Ukrainian government's mantra of \"fighting for as long as it takes\". \nWhile the soldiers we meet might not have felt they could speak entirely freely, it's not an issue for Illia, whom I meet in the relative privacy of the main square of Kramatorsk, in eastern Ukraine.\nIllia, a combat medic, thinks the military has been dishonest about what signing up means.\nHe argues that it would be more effective if recruiters told new soldiers that the first six months are \"super hard\" - but that they would then be trained for more specific roles.\n\"The infantry is the hardest job in the military,\" he says.\nTired as Illia is, the idea of fighting alongside a petrified conscript in a trench is not an appealing one. He also thinks a lack of transparency about the realities of the battlefield is further putting men off from registering to fight. \n\"What if this war lasts 10 years?\"\nBack in Kyiv, as we stroll down her normal jogging route, local MP Inna Sovsun explains to me why she abstained on the mobilisation bill vote. Her partner serves as a frontline medic. \n\"I spend countless nights worrying where he is,\" she explains. \"It's the experience of millions of Ukrainians.\" \nMs Sovsun thinks there should be more of a focus on rotation, arguing Ukraine has enough men of a fighting age to swap with the 500,000 or so who are currently fighting.\n\"There are highly trained soldiers who can't be swapped, but what about the people in trenches?\" she asks. \"It takes time to train them, but what if this war lasts for 10 years?\"\n\"We can't pretend to rely on the same people who started serving on day one.\"\nUntil now, Ukraine's army recruitment has been hampered by historical corruption claims and diminishing volunteers. \nNow ministers are pursuing two key objectives: restoring trust in the system whilst increasing the pressure on men to fight. \nBoth made more difficult by the battlefield not going Ukraine's way.\nAdditional reporting by Hanna Chornous, Thanyarat Doksone, Anastasiia Levchenko and Hanna Tsyba.

Previously, the government said it aimed to start the flights in spring.\nMr Sunak said there would be \"multiple flights a month through the summer and beyond\".\nWhen Parliament approved the legislation, according to Home Office there were 52,000 asylum seekers who could potentially be sent to Rwanda.\nBut, speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Rwanda's government spokesperson Yolande Maloko said: \"I cannot tell you is how many thousands we're taking in the first year or in the second year.\"\nBut, when asked if Rwanda could accommodate all of the people in the current backlog. \n\"This will depend on very many factors that are being worked out now,\" Ms Maloko said. \nSign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.\nPressed to give a commitment on the number that could be given homes in Rwanda Ms Makolo said \"we are ready\".\nBut, she would not give an assurance it would be able to take the 52,000 people the UK would like to send, merely saying it would be \"thousands\".\nMinisters have said repeatedly they want the notion of being sent to Rwanda to be a deterrent for those trying to come to the UK. \nBut, Ms Makolo said Rwanda had been \"attacked unjustly\".\n\"Living in Rwanda is not a punishment. It is a beautiful country, including the weather,\" she added. \nTransport Secretary Mark Harper also appeared on the show and was asked whether the UK government has a back-up plan.\nAlthough he didn't answer directly, Mr Harper said the government has a \"plan to start flights going in 10 to 12 weeks that is being worked on by the Home Office\".\nMr Harper added: \"We want a steady rhythm of flights going to Rwanda through this year.\n\"We will continue working closely with Rwanda on the partnership agreement we have got that has got all of the safeguards in place that people want to see.\n\"I think if you can set up a system of deterrent through those flights you will break the business model of the organised crime groups who traffic people across the very dangerous waterway of the English Channel.\"\nLabour's Pat McFadden told the programme he thinks the government will succeed in getting flights running to Rwanda but believes it won't fix the migration problem or be value for money.\nHe declined to scrap the scheme on the the first day of a Labour government, should it win the next general election, but reiterated the party does not want to continue with Mr Sunak's policy.\nMr McFadden also said he doubted Labour would work to return any asylum seekers back to the UK.\nSeparately, Ms Makolo denied Rwandan involvement in the bombing of a displacement camp in the Democratic Republic of Congo. \nAt least nine people, including seven children, were killed in the strike on the Mugunga camp in the eastern city of Goma on Friday.\nThe US has blamed the Rwandan army and M23 rebel group. \nMs Makolo said the US government had been \"very hasty to blame us without looking, without investigating this incident and without talking to the people who are affected. \n\"It's something that we outright reject and it's unfair,\" she added.",
    "A disabled woman who was prevented from buying enough tickets for her daughters to join her at Taylor Swift's Cardiff concert has received an apology from Ticketmaster.\nWhile other customers could buy up to four tickets for the gig, Cat Dafydd was told by the ticket seller that she could only buy one accessible ticket, with one complimentary ticket for a carer.\nMs Dafydd, who uses a wheelchair following a spinal cord injury, resorted to spending \u00a31,800 to see Swift with her daughters in France.\nTicketmaster apologised and subsequently sent Ms Dafydd three complimentary tickets for the Cardiff concert, but its accessibility policy has not changed.\nMs Dafydd, from Llandysul, Ceredigion, said she first contacted Ticketmaster in June 2023 to ask about taking her daughters to the concert.\nShe was told she would be unable to do this because she required an accessible ticket.\nMs Dafydd said: \"I can't take my daughters, but if I didn't have a disability I would be able to.\n\"It made me feel, as a disabled person, as if I was worth less than anyone else.\"\nMs Dafydd decided to spend \u00a31,800 on hospitality tickets for Swift's show in Lyon, France, through another website.\nWhile she and her daughters are excited for the Eras tour, they believe that Ticketmaster's rules are unfair.\nElliw, 11, said travelling to France would put additional pressure on their mother.\n\"The day before the concert, my mum will probably be in a lot of pain and will have to lie down on the bed,\" said Elliw.\nMs Dafydd said: \"Being disabled has cost me so much more in order to just have a wonderful experience with my children that other people can have really easily.\"\nMs Dafydd sent a letter to Ticketmaster in June 2023 to complain about its accessibility policy.\nHowever, she said it was \"completely ignored\".\nAfter receiving a request for comment from the BBC, Ticketmaster apologised to Ms Dafydd and offered her three free tickets to the concert in Cardiff.\nTicketmaster said the situation was \"not handled according to the standards we have set for ourselves\".\nManaging director of Ticketmaster UK, Andrew Parsons, added: \"We take accessibility very seriously and always work with venues and promoters to accommodate requests wherever possible. \n\"We apologise to Ms Dafydd and are pleased that the situation has now been resolved.\u201d\nMs Dafydd said: \"I'm glad that Ticketmaster has apologised and recognised that my experience with their access service was not what it should have been.\"\nElin Williams, from Disability Wales, said buying tickets for events could \"take hours\" for disabled people.\n\"Very ironically, the process of buying accessible tickets isn't accessible,\" she said.\n\"It's very unfair when non-disabled people can buy a tickets in a few simple clicks in under a couple of minutes, when it can take hours for disabled people.\n\"It means that people are put off from being able to go to these shows because of the inequality and barriers that exist.\"\nCardiff's Principality Stadium, which was not responsible for ticket sales but is hosting the Swift concert, said: \"Our role as host venue is to work in partnership with the promoter and ticket operator to deliver a safe and enjoyable experience for all fans attending the stadium.\" ",
    "Seven members of the same family were injured when a tour bus overturned on a day trip during a holiday in Turkey.\nThe family was among a group of 11 from Blackpool who were in the vehicle when it crashed in the Manavgat region on Thursday.\nVinny Carlton-Simons, 43, had to have surgery to put 10 pins in his legs. \nMr Carlton-Simons\u2019 wife, Danielle, described the scene after the crash as \"like a warzone\".\nShe told the BBC her six-year-old son, Reggie, was hanging out of the window at the moment the vehicle went over, but she managed to pull him back in.\nAs the vehicle lay on its side, her 19-year-old brother Bobby convinced her to hand over the boy, warning her she was \"covered in oil\" and smoke was starting to pour from the engine.\nDanielle, 40, was part of a group that included her mother Laura, 59, her daughter Saisha, 20, and Saisha\u2019s boyfriend Kacper Zielinski, 24.\nDanielle\u2019s son Kai, 16, was also on the trip and, along with Bobby, helped to rescue people from the crashed vehicle.\nThe day trip on Thursday was the first day the group \u2013 which also included family friends and neighbours - had all been out together.\nThey were on their way to the zoo when the crash happened.\nDanielle said there had been no seatbelts on the vehicle, which was carrying 16 tourists in total, and that she had been told by the driver that the brakes had failed.\nThe vehicle came to rest on its side against a lamppost.\nWhen ambulances arrived, the group were taken to three different hospitals for treatment, and Danielle said she had not yet been able to make contact with her friends.\nHer husband Vinny\u2019s mother has flown out from the UK to be with him.\nDanielle, a trainee trauma counsellor, said she believed the only reason son Reggie was alive was because he had asked to swap seats with Vinny moments before the tour began.\n\u201cHe would have been under the vehicle if he hadn\u2019t been sitting next to me,\u201d she said.\nDanielle added: \"I just can't believe it's happened to us.\"\nThe family is hoping to return to the UK in the coming days.\nA spokesman for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCSDO) said it was in touch with the family.\nThe spokesman added: \u201cWe are providing consular support to a number of British nationals following an incident in Turkey, and are in contact with the local authorities.\u201d\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The children hear the dogs snarling outside, just beyond the flimsy plastic of the tent. \nThe seven children of Rehab Abu Daqqa crowd around their mother. She is the last safe harbour in their lives. They have shared things, these children and their mother, which cannot be communicated to those who have not seen the things they have seen. Is there a word to express what a child feels knowing that just a few yards away, animals are dragging a body from a grave? \nThe vocabulary of childhood is inadequate amid the horrors of this emergency cemetery in Rafah.\nScared is the word Rehab Abu Daqqa uses. \nWARNING: This report contains descriptions some readers may find disturbing\nThat is accurate. But there is more to it, she knows. The children have seen dogs eating the bodies. A human leg lying by a fence. So yes they are scared. But revolted too, and uncomprehending. The children who once had a home, went to school, lived according to the established rhythms of their family and community, are now refugees in a place that reeks of death. \n\"This morning the dogs took out a body from one of the graves and were eating it,\" Rehab Abu Daqqa says. \"From night until dawn the dogs do not let us sleep\u2026 our children keep holding on to me because of how scared they are.\" \nThe dogs come in packs of dozens. Domestic pets whose owners are dead or displaced, mixed with Rafah's existing population of strays, all of them now feral and scavenging for whatever they can eat. The cemetery has numerous shallow graves where people place their dead until a time comes when they can be taken to their home area. On some graves relatives have placed bricks to try to keep the dogs away from the dead.\nRehab Abu Daqqa is gaunt and exhausted. Her mouth and nose are covered by cloth to fend off the stench of the graves. She praises the young men who came earlier to reinter a body dragged out that morning. \n\"I don't accept that me or my children should live next to a cemetery. My child is in the 3rd grade and today instead of playing a game he was drawing a grave and in the middle he drew a dead body. These are the children of Palestine\u2026 What can I tell you? Miserable, the word miserable doesn't even explain it.\"\nThe cemetery is one of several in Gaza that has become a refuge for people whose homes have been destroyed in the fighting. There are more than 1.4 million people crowded into Rafah - five times its pre-war population. According to the Norwegian Refugee Council that works out at 22,000 people for every square kilometre. Already disease is spreading, with outbreaks of diarrhoea, hepatitis A, and meningitis - as well as a continuing hunger crisis. \nRafah is where the refugees of Gaza reach the final wall, the border with Egypt which is closed to the overwhelming majority of the displaced. They arrive after being pushed from one place to another by the advance of the Israeli forces. Rehab Abu Daqqa has fled three times already and may soon have to uproot her family again if the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) offensive on Rafah goes ahead.\nIsrael's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said a military operation in Rafah will go ahead \"with or without\" a ceasefire to destroy what he says are four Hamas battalions in the city. Hamas insists there can be no deal without a commitment to permanently end the war. Far right members of the Israeli coalition cabinet are warning Mr Netanyahu against compromise. The Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a standard bearer for the settler movement, has called for \"absolute destruction\" in Rafah, saying there can be no \"half work\". \n\"Where do they [refugees] move to? \" asks Dr Rik Peeperkorn, regional director of the World Health Organization (WHO), who recently returned from Rafah. \n\"We already have a crisis in health. We have a water and sanitation crisis, a food crisis. There's a humanitarian disaster. So, there'll be just another humanitarian disaster on top of this\u2026 What we expect will be substantial additional mortality and sickness when a military incursion happens. So, a lot more people dying\u2026 a lot more death and a lot more diseases.\" \nDr Peeperkorn worked for seven years in Afghanistan with the UN and is not a man who is easily daunted. But when we met in Jerusalem he looked tired. The tiredness of a man who wakes every morning to the certainty of a crisis that seems to threaten ever worse consequences.\nThe WHO is already preparing for additional field hospitals to help if people are forced to move. But what happens to the seriously ill and the elderly, the 700 kidney dialysis patients who are currently being treated in a facility which once used to cater to 50?\n\"If you look at our health sector, it is crippled already and an incursion will actually mean that we lose another three hospitals\u2026 like they cannot be reached, they might be damaged, they might be partially destroyed. We are preparing for it with a contingency plan which is like a band aid.\" \nMy BBC colleagues have provided graphic evidenc",

We expect these to have supply from Monday morning.\u201d\nFour water stations were set up at Tesco, Asda, Sea Road and Hastings Academy, but hour-long queues were reported.\nThe damaged pipe, in remote woodland, had been replaced and was feeding water back to the treatment works, Southern Water said on Saturday.\nBut pressure on reservoirs as a result of the outage added to supply issues, pushing the number of households without water on Sunday to 32,500.\nSouthern Water said bottled water deliveries would continue throughout Sunday to customers on its priority services register.\nThe firm said compensation for affected businesses would go \"beyond regulatory and statutory obligations\".\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "This is an attempt to right a rock wrong. One of the most famous musical myths is simply not true. \nThe daughter of Mama Cass Elliot from folk vocal group Mamas and the Papas, Owen Elliot-Kugell, has a clear message to share about her mother's cause of death: \"There was a ham sandwich, but she didn't eat it and she didn't choke on it. So enough with the jokes.\"\nAnd there have been a lot of jokes, for almost half a century, including by Mike Myers as Austin Powers. \nIn the 1997 film, the time-switching special agent is writing a list of friends he knows in London and then scoring them out when he remembers they have died. After naming Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin he mournfully sighs: \"Mama Cass. Deceased. Ham sandwich.\" \nCass Elliot (Mama was a nickname which she preferred not to use later in her career) sang on some of the mid-60s most memorable singles, including California Dreamin', Monday Monday and Dream a Little Dream. Her powerful voice was a crucial element of the harmonies that made the Mamas and the Papas so loved.\nBy 1974, she had gone solo and had just completed a two-week run at the London Palladium, when she died at the age of 32 in the Mayfair flat she had borrowed from her fellow American singer Harry Nilsson. The autopsy stated her cause of death as a heart attack and that there were no drugs in her system. \nHer only child, Owen, was seven at the time and back at home in the US when she was told the news. \nNow, ahead of the 50th anniversary of her mother's death on 29 July, she has written a memoir My Mama, Cass, both as a tribute and as a way of correcting the sandwich-based inaccuracy.\n\"It's beyond frustrating, almost immeasurable,\" she says down the line from LA, explaining how it has been, having to live with the ham sandwich legend for 50 years. \n\"Even as a little girl, when I was hanging out with my friends at school, they didn't know who my mom was, but I would go home to have playdates with some of these kids and it was kind of frequent that one of their parents would make a comment to me like, 'Hey, did your mom really die choking on a ham sandwich?'\n\"It bothered me because it was such a horrible story, and I knew that it wasn't true. And it just felt so cruel to have a rumour like that perpetuated. It tortured me.\"\nUnderstandably, she has done extensive work to piece together what did happen in the days leading up to her mum's death; an itinerary which included playing her final Palladium show before \"staying up for 36 hours\".\nShe was due to go to Mick Jagger's birthday party all night, then head straight to a brunch thrown in her honour, followed by an afternoon tea hosted by a US journalist. \n\"By the time she got back to her flat, it was evening the following day,\" continues her daughter. \"She was hungry, and her dancer made her a sandwich from the only thing that was in the flat, ham, and left it on her bedside table. She never even took a bite.\"\nWhat also still upsets Elliot-Kugell is that the ham sandwich myth plays into another issue which was present throughout her mum's life - weight.  \nFrom the age of seven Cass had battles with obesity. As a teenager she was prescribed amphetamines to speed up her metabolism. \nElliot-Kugell describes it as \"the beginning of a very bad cycle.\"\nCrash dieting and drug taking would feature over the course of the rest of Cass's life. \nBut what makes her so proud of her mum is the way that she \"pursued and persevered until she made it.\"\n\"She knew when she was a teenager that she wanted to be a performer and told everybody that she was going to be the most famous fat girl that ever lived. She had that forethought of knowledge as a child. I think that's pretty cool. I think that's really cool.\"\nA move from Baltimore to New York after school led to Cass becoming part of the Greenwich Village folk scene, before heading to Washington DC and then California, to join the Mamas and the Papas, but only after a delay due to the founding member, John Phillips, having to be persuaded that Cass's weight would not hold the group back. \nEliot-Kugell believes that things would have been completely different for her mother if there had been the same attitudes towards fat shaming then that there are now, describing her as a \"trailblazer\".\n\"She paved the way for these other young ladies nowadays who are of a heavier stature to break through in the music business and be accepted for who they are. I really do believe that she helped lay the groundwork for a lot of people.\"\nThe book highlights examples of everyone from Dean Martin to her own band members making jokes in public about Cass's weight, and how she would have to \"grin and bear it\" to survive, especially when it came to TV appearances.\nBy the early 1970s, Cass was regular on US variety shows, guest hosting the Tonight Show and regularly appearing on the Carol Burnett Show, but at a cost. \nShe would inevitably appear in skits making fun of her weight.

    "Labour's deputy campaign coordinator says her party needs to rebuild trust with Muslim voters, amid an apparent backlash over its stance on Gaza.\nThe party's position on the Israel-Hamas war appears to have dented its support in Muslim areas in England's local elections.\nLabour's Ellie Reeves admitted it had \"a lot of work to do\" to rebuild support before the general election.\nShe added this included ensuring voters \"understand our position\".\nIn 58 local council wards analysed by the BBC, where more than one-in-five residents identify as Muslim, Labour's share of the vote was 21% down on 2021, the last time most seats were contested.\nIt was a downside to an otherwise positive performance for Labour, which saw it gain more than 170 councillors to take control of eight councils.\nThe potential impact on a general election is unclear, however, with some evidence the biggest drops in support are largely confined to areas where the party's support was already very strong.\nAnd there are signs that any adverse reaction was less prominent in London, where incumbent Labour mayor Sadiq Khan called for a ceasefire before the party leadership did.\nLabour's vote is up by three points on average in parts of London where more than 15% identify as Muslim, compared with 4.5% where the proportion is less than this.\nLabour called for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza conflict in February, after months of wrangling over its position.\nIts initial stance after the war began, in which it called for humanitarian pauses in the fighting, prompted Labour resignations in councils and from its frontbench last year.\nThe decline in its vote share in areas with a big Muslim population appears to have been largely to the benefit of independent candidates standing in those areas.\nAli Milani, chair of Labour Muslim Network, said Labour's positioning on Gaza \"is going to have a serious electoral consequence\".\n\"If I was a Labour MP in Bradford or Birmingham or Leicester or parts of London or Manchester I would be seriously concerned,\" he added.\nThe Greens, who called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" just over a week after the war began, have also increased their share of the vote from 2021.\nCo-leader Carla Denyer said Labour's stance on the conflict had been the \"final straw\" for some Labour supporters who were already disappointed by policy U-turns in other areas.\n\"I have met many voters on doorsteps who brought it up proactively as an issue,\" she added.\nShe also said \"part of the Muslim community switching their votes\" was also a factor in Newcastle, where the Greens gained their first-ever seats on the city council.\nOn Sunday, recently re-elected Worthing Councillor and Momentum co-chair Hilary Schan resigned from Labour in order to support pro-Palestinian candidates from other parties - and she has joined journalist Owen Jones's We Deserve Better campaign.\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast on Saturday, Ellie Reeves said: \"We know that we've got a great deal of work to do to rebuild trust with Muslim communities.\n\"I understand people's concerns about what's happening in Gaza. The loss of life there has been intolerable - that's why we have called an immediate ceasefire\".\nShe added that \"a lot of listening needs to be done,\" and the party also needed to make sure voters \"understand our position\".\nLabour's national election co-ordinator Pat McFadden echoed her, telling the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the situation in the Middle East was a \"high foreign policy priority\" for Labour, if it was elected.\n\"The better lives that people want for the Palestinian people is something the Labour leadership shares,\" he said.\nHe acknowledged that in some parts of the country, the conflict was proving a problem for Labour and said: \"There will be some people who maybe voted Labour in the past who haven't in the local elections because of this issue and where that's the case we'll work to get people's support back.\"\nIn the West Midlands mayoral race, independent candidate Akhmed Yakoob, who campaigned on Gaza, won over 69,000 votes.\nIn Blackburn with Darwen, Labour lost council seats to independent candidates who quit the party over the leadership's Gaza stance.\nIt also faced a surge from pro-Palestinian independents in Bradford, where the Labour council leader said Gaza had been a \"big issue\". \nThe local party leader in Oldham said the conflict was a factor there, where Labour lost overall control of the council, but also blamed a wider unhappiness with \"mainstream parties\".\nGeorge Galloway's strongly pro-Palestinian Workers Party of Britain won four seats - two in Rochdale, one in Calderdale and one in Manchester, where they ousted the Labour deputy leader of the council Luthfur Rahman.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 253 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 34,500 people have been killed in Gaza since th",
    "Four Israeli soldiers have been killed in a Hamas rocket attack near one of the main crossings used to deliver aid into Gaza, Israel has said.\nThe Kerem Shalom crossing was closed overnight by Israel following the strike.\nSubsequent Israeli strikes in the southern Gazan city of Rafah have reportedly killed at least 12 people. \nIsrael's military said early on Monday it was urging Gazans sheltering in parts of Rafah to evacuate.\nIt comes as talks aimed at securing a ceasefire deal in Gaza and the release of hostages have stalled.\nThe Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said 10 projectiles had been fired from an area near the Rafah crossing in southern Gaza, about 3.6km (2.2 miles) from Kerem Shalom. \nHamas's armed wing claimed responsibility and said its target was a nearby Israeli army base. \nThey were fired from a site some 350m from a civilian shelter, the IDF said\nIt called the launches \"another clear example of the terrorist organisation's systematic exploitation of humanitarian facilities and spaces, and their continued use of the Gazan civilian population as human shields\".\nHamas denies it uses civilians as human shields.\nThe Israeli military confirmed a counter-strike in Rafah, saying it struck the launcher from which the projectiles were fired and a nearby military structure.\nThere were two Israeli strikes on Sunday, killing at least 12 people according to Gaza health officials.  \nThe latest violence follows two days of talks with mediators in Cairo, Egypt. \nThere has been little progress, with both Israel and Hamas saying they will not give ground on key demands, but discussions are expected to resume on Monday. \nHamas said its delegation would travel to Qatar to consult with the group's leadership.\nCIA chief William Burns, who has also been involved in mediation efforts, has left the Egyptian capital for talks in Doha, according to reports.\nThe truce proposal is believed to involve a 40-day pause in fighting, allowing the release of hostages in Gaza and a number of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails.\nHamas said it viewed the current proposal in a \"positive light\", but the main sticking point appears to be whether the ceasefire deal would be permanent or temporary.\nThe group is insisting any deal makes a specific commitment towards an end to the war, but Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected that on Sunday.\n\"The state of Israel cannot accept this [Hamas's demands], we are not prepared to accept a situation in which the Hamas brigades come out of their bunkers, take control of Gaza again, rebuild their military infrastructure, and return to threatening the citizens of Israel in the settlements surrounding the southern mountains, in all parts of the country.\n\"This will be a terrible defeat for the state of Israel,\" he added.\nThe war began after waves of Hamas gunmen stormed across Gaza's border into Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. The group is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many Western countries.\nDuring the subsequent Israeli military campaign in Gaza, more than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed and over 77,900 wounded, according to figures from the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nMr Netanyahu has faced pressure from within his far-right coalition to press ahead with the long-promised offensive in Gaza's southern-most city, Rafah, where an estimated 1.4 million people have taken shelter after fleeing fighting in northern and central parts of the strip.\nThe US is reluctant to back a military operation that could cause significant civilian casualties, and has insisted on seeing a plan to protect displaced Palestinians first.\nEarly on Monday, the IDF said it was encouraging residents in Rafah's eastern neighbourhoods to make their way toward an \"expanded humanitarian zone.\"\n\"The expanded humanitarian zone includes field hospitals, tents and increased amounts of food, water, medicine and other supplies.\n\"In accordance with the approval of the government, an ongoing situation assessment will guide the gradual movement of civilians in the specified areas in eastern Rafah, to the humanitarian area,\"  a statement posted to X, formerly Twitter, read.\nSeven months into its offensive against Hamas, Israel has said that victory is impossible without taking Rafah.\nBut with more than more than 1.4 million displaced Palestinians sheltering there, Western powers and neighbouring Egypt have raised fears that there could be high numbers of civilian casualties.\nUpdate 7 May 2024: The number of soldiers killed in the Hamas rocket attack has been updated in this article from three to four.",
    "The front-runner for the SNP leadership has suggested rebuilding the party could be delayed if another candidate enters the race.\nJohn Swinney told BBC Scotland the SNP has not been as cohesive as it should have been and had endured a \"rough couple of years\".\nIt comes amid reports that veteran SNP activist Graeme McCormick, who is openly critical of the Scottish government, has collected enough signatures to stand against Mr Swinney.\nMr McCormick, who has declined to speak to the BBC, is thought to have canvassed for support at an independence march in Glasgow on Saturday.\nThe BBC has approached the SNP for comment. The party would not confirm whether Mr McCormick has secured a nomination.\nHis plan to challenge Mr Swinney has been reported on social media by SNP members and in various national newspapers.\nMr Swinney, the former deputy first minister and party leader, could be elected within days, with the deadline for candidates to declare at midday on Monday.\nCandidates must have 100 nominations from at least 20 local party branches.\nAsked whether he would welcome another leadership contest given reports about Mr McCormick, Mr Swinney said: \"I think it would be better if we just got on with things, that we started the rebuilding of the SNP and its political strength.\"\nHe told The Sunday Show: \"We had a lot of strains around a couple of issues in parliament and I think we\u2019ve just had a rough couple of years.\n\"The party has been engaging but frankly, we've not been as cohesive as we should have been. That's been obvious to the public.\n\"The SNP has not looked cohesive, the SNP has not looked together \u2013 the central point of my message is we\u2019ve got to get ourselves together.\"\nMr McCormick is a retired lawyer who stood against Mike Russell to become party president in 2023, losing by 599 votes to 79.\nHe previously argued for abolishing tax and replacing it with an annual rent on land, and that the route to Scottish independence lay through international treaties, with Scotland dissolving the union immediately if the SNP returned the most MPs in Scotland at a general election.\nIn a speech at the party conference he described the SNP government as being like \u201cflatulence in a trance.\u201d \nMr Swinney is the only declared candidate so far to succeed Humza Yousaf, who announced he would stand down after ending a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens. \nThe abrupt end of the Bute House Agreement came two days after Mr Yousaf said he had no intention of doing so, and left him facing two votes of no confidence.\nThe move angered the Greens, who had previously criticised the Scottish government for scrapping key climate targets and pausing puberty blockers for under 18s referred by the country's specialist gender clinic.\nLast year, Mr Yousaf only secured a narrow win over Kate Forbes in an often fractious SNP leadership contest - despite being Nicola Sturgeon's chosen successor.\nMr Swinney - who secured Kate Forbes' backing and has offered her a \"significant\" role in his government - said he wants to bring the party together after the last \"difficult\" leadership election.\nHe also said he is \"physically and mentally ready\" for the role, after he decided not to stand in the 2023 leadership contest. \nMr Swinney previously led the party for four years in opposition from 2000 to 2004.\nIf elected, he said he would seek to govern on a \"moderate centre left\" platform, and that he would be open to working with any other political party in the parliament to pass legislation.\nLast year Mr Swinney told the BBC\u2019s Nicola Sturgeon podcast that he had been trying to stand down from government since 2016.\nHowever he said he had been persuaded to run on this occasion after discussions with his family.\nHe chose not to run in 2023 as he felt \"tired and drained\" after a number of years in important roles, but that he was feeling refreshed after a year out of the cabinet. \nMr Swinney said: \"I thought it was time for other people to take leading roles\u2026 I thought I\u2019d done my bit.\"\nHowever he said he now had \"peace of mind\" that running would be the \"right thing to do for me and my family, and my party and my country.\"   \nThe Perthshire North MSP added that he was confident he would deliver independence, and that he would aim to do this through \"reasoned conversation\".\nScottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy said it was \"laughable\" that Mr Swinney wanted to take conflict out of a push for independence.\nHe said: \"Scotland needs a first minister focused on the public\u2019s real priorities \u2013 fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy \u2013 not one fixated on dividing the nation just to pacify the warring SNP.\"\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the SNP were a \"divided and chaotic\" political party, who had \"broken the trust\" of Scottish people.\nHe told The Sunday Show that Mr Swinney was managing his party and its \"decline\", rather than focusing on the priorities of people in Scotland.\nBy Jenni Davidson, senior politics reporter\nWh",
    "A tangle of bramble thickets and a barbed wire fence now surround the crumbling walls of Viewhill House.\nIt has sat as a ruin in the heart of Inverness since a devastating fire 17 years ago, but it was not always such a forlorn sight.\nIt was once an elegant villa, built by local engineer Joseph Mitchell in 1835, with a stunning outlook over the River Ness.\nMany people have happy memories of staying there when it was a youth hostel in the second half of the 20th Century and there are still hopes that it could be restored.\nDonnie Aird was a teenager when his parents became hostel wardens in the 1950s.\nHe said it was a big change living at Viewhill House, which he remembers as a \u201cbuzzing place\u201d with a friendly atmosphere.\n\u201cIt was a hive of activity in the summertime with people from all over the world,\" he said.\n\"There would often be a queue at the office, sometimes even all the way down the steps leading to the main street with people waiting patiently to book in and hoping they\u2019d get a bed.\u201d\nFacilities were basic, with segregated male and female dormitories, and guests were allocated a chore to do in the morning.\nAnd like other hostels there was a strict curfew.\nDonnie said: \u201cYou had to be in by 10 o'clock. Almost everyone kept to the curfew but there was the odd occasion when people were found trying to get in through windows.\"\nPets were not allowed but Donnie says people smuggled them in - and did not always take them home with them.\nHe says: \u201cI remember at least three dogs being left behind. \n\"There was one dog that was just a tiny puppy and my parents kept him for years. He was named Dormie because he was found in the dormitory.\u201d\nMany people visited the hostel while hitchhiking or cycling round Scotland.\nMaggie Roger stayed there in 1968 and 1969 while on summer cycling tours with her Dutch friend Ebba.\nThe teenagers set off from Bridge of Weir getting as far afield as Ullapool, Skye and Aberdeen on their trips.\nMaggie, who is still a keen cyclist, vividly remembers a sense of freedom.\nShe said: \u201cWe left my parents\u2019 house with nobody else watching us.\n\"We had hooters on the front of our bikes rather than bells and we used to hoot at everybody. \n\"Cars would go past us and they\u2019d toot their horns and we hoot back at them and we\u2019d see them again three or four days later. It was so much fun.\u201d\nOn their second trip to the hostel they got a warm welcome from the warden.\n\u201cShe remembered us and she let us stay even though she hadn\u2019t really enough room. I just remember her being so friendly,\u201d said Maggie.\nMaggie said it is sad to see the site since the fire, which hit when the property was vacant.\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s just weeds and trees and a fallen down house. \n\"It is a shame it has been left for so many years and yes, it might be nice to preserve it but who is going to preserve it and how long is that going to take \u2013 another 17 years?\u201d\nJoseph Mitchell, who built Viewhill House in the 1830s, started his working life as an apprentice of renowned engineer Thomas Telford.\nDespite humble origins Mitchell achieved great things, including designing the first railway connection between Inverness and Perth, which sceptics had said was impossible.\nConservation architect Calum MacLean believes it is still possible to save the engineer's former home, which is owned by Magnus Properties. \nHe would like to see a small museum in part of the restored B-listed building dedicated to Mitchell who he describes as one of the \"founding fathers of Inverness.\"\nHe said: \u201cHe has an enormous legacy and it's a story we really should be celebrating.\" \nCalum added: \u201cIt is a testament to Joseph Mitchell\u2019s engineering skills that it is still standing. \n\"But every year that it is left without a roof it is going to become a bigger and bigger technical challenge to conserve and restore the building.\u201d\nThe weather is already taking its toll.\nStorms during the winter of 2021-22 blew down part of a wall and Calum fears there could be further uncontrolled collapses.\nHe said: \u201cThat would be the worst outcome of all and we would lose a lot of the original material. \n\"Ideally we want to start to record all these stones, store them safely, so that when the opportunity comes to rebuild we have all the material there to do it.\u201d\nHighland Council said its building standards team continued to monitor the site.\nA spokesperson said: \"The building is in private ownership, and while the council has supported the Highland Historic Buildings Trust and others to look at various options, the site is extremely challenging to develop and with limited public funding available, the council cannot develop this site.\n\u201cThe council would, however, welcome discussion with the owners and others to consider options.\u201d\nBBC Scotland has attempted to contact Magnus Properties.",
    "Peterborough\u2019s Regional Pool was commissioned to be demolished this year.\nIt came after reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac) was found in the building in September 2023.\nThe facility on Bishop\u2019s Road also previously struggled with other issues which included structural cracking, out-of-date mechanical installations and damaged asbestos.\nThere are plans for a new pool but an outline business case would need to be submitted.\nA Freedom of Information request (FOI) revealed Peterborough City Council spent \u00a3200,000 on repairs in the past financial year.\nIn 2023-24, part of that money saw \u00a3104,000 spent on asbestos works and fan motors while \u00a350,000 was also spent on inspections and testing.\nThis was the largest influx of capital investment the pool had received since 2015-16.\nAside from this, a \u00a31m temporary car park was also established at the site on Bishop\u2019s Road and \u00a3275,000 was also spent \u2060in response to Legionella bacteria outbreaks last year.\nIn the last decade, the figures showed \u00a3723,349 was invested into the pool.\nA further \u00a3355,430 was spent on maintenance and repairs and \u00a3328,434 on inspections and testing in this period.\nThe average annual cost of maintenance and repairs has doubled - from an average of \u00a326,000 a year in 2015  to an average of \u00a357,000 in the last three financial years.\nThe council said it would cost them \u00a326.3m to repair the facility which was built in the 1970s.\nHowever, it is estimated a new pool could cost \u00a330m with demolition costs expecting to reach up to \u00a32.5m\nThe council said this cost would be offset by how much the value of the land the pool\u2019s built on increases and how much it will save on security and monitoring.\nLeader of the council, Mohammed Farooq said demolition work might take \"a few months\" to get under way.\nThe authority has pledged a new \u00a330m pool for the city, scheduled to be completed by 2028.\nIt would include a teaching pool, splash pool, cafe, sports hall, gym, clip and climb facility and soft play area.\nIt is expected that the council will award a contract between September 2025 and January 2026, and then building work would begin.\nJohn Howard, deputy leader and cabinet member for corporate governance and finance, said council officers had \"taken the time to carefully consider the options available\".\nHe said the new facility would \"serve the city well for decades to come and will attract people from far and wide\".\n\"That must be our aspiration, rather than placing a sticking plaster on what we have already,\" he explained.\nMr Farooq added he believed the council had \"taken the right decision\" and residents would be updated on the pool's progress.\nIn the meantime, modular pools which require no excavating, have been considered as an alternative.\nNo date has been confirmed for these pools yet.\nOpening season for the Peterborough Lido has also been extended to compensate for the loss of the Regional Pool. The Lido was kept open for the first time in its history during the winter last year.\nPreviously, Ben Negus, of the City of Peterborough Swimming Club, who practiced at the facility until it closed said building a new pool was \"the right decision\u201d.\n\u201cThe pool lasted over 10 years after its sell-by-date,\" he said.\n\"It has not been improved over the years and we need a new modern facility.\u201d\nMorgan Stevenson, co-chair of the City of Peterborough Swimming Club, told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: \"2028 is a long wait and we've seen plans and promises made in the past.\n\"The need now is for decisive action and tangible progress to deliver a facility for the now and the future needs of our growing city.\"\nFollow Peterborough news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "\nThe fallout from the Conservatives' losses in the local elections in England is on most front pages. \nRishi Sunak has reportedly told the Times that Britain is heading for a hung parliament, with Labour as the largest party. The paper says that's the first time he's conceded his party is on course to lose its majority. \nThe prediction for a hung parliament came from the elections expert, Michael Thrasher, but the Times says other pollsters have dismissed his calculation, which is based solely on how people voted in the local elections, and assumes that Labour will win only one seat in Scotland.\nAccording to the Daily Telegraph the prime minister has abandoned the idea of holding a general election in the summer, and the vote is now expected in October or November. \nThe paper says he is hoping that by then, an improving economic picture and deportation flights to Rwanda will give him better chances of re-election.\nUnder the headline \"Prepare for disaster - that's all Tories have left\" Britain's former chief Brexit negotiator, Lord Frost, says in the Telegraph that last week's results point to fewer, perhaps many fewer, than 200 Tory MPs after the next general election. \nHe argues the party is in trouble because it's been trying to be \"inclusive and mainstream\" instead of implementing Conservative policies such as deregulation, being tough on migration, and cutting taxes and public spending.\nIn an editorial, the Sun says Mr Sunak has six months to win Tory voters back and can now concentrate on that without being distracted by - what it calls - \"ludicrous leadership speculation\". \nThe paper says the prime minister should put more money into people's pockets and leave the European Convention on Human Rights if it prevents flights to Rwanda.\nWriting in the Daily Express, the former Conservative leader, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, argues that \"despite the bad results, it is not over yet\" if the party now focuses on delivering on the public's priorities. He says Mr Sunak has to stop the boats, limit legal immigration, cut taxes and reduce European regulation stifling our financial services.\nLabour's campaign co-ordinator, Pat McFadden, has told the Guardian that his party is planning to target the south of England heavily at the general election. He said the local elections had shown that some \"blue wall\" seats in the region were turning red.\nThe Daily Mail says there are fears that many councils will now be dominated by the war in Gaza rather than local services. The paper says more than 40 pro-Palestinian campaigners have been elected as councillors. \nAway from politics, the Daily Mirror highlights a campaign for more support for former football players living with dementia. The paper says last year the Premier League and Professional Footballers' Association pledged one million pounds for them, but campaigners say the game must go further.\nAnd finally the Telegraph says a report by the UK's biggest investment company claims Britain's economy would be better off if it had fewer buy-to-let landlords. The firm, Legal and General, has hit out at \"unscrupulous\" landlords over claims many are taking people's money and \"giving them a bad experience\".",
    "Having both faced the break-up of their marriages in recent years, presenters Rylan Clark and Rob Rinder found a life-changing tour the inspiration they needed to move on with their lives. \n\"This trip is part of my restart in life,\" says Rylan Clark positively. \nWith close friend and travelling companion, Rob Rinder, he has embarked on a tour of Italy for a new BBC Two series, retracing the steps of the Grand Tourists of the past.\n\"We've both been through painful divorces recently and are ready for the next chapter,\" says Clark, who rose to fame on the X Factor and has since become a popular TV and radio presenter.\nThe Grand Tour, the original gap year, was a rite of passage for the young male nobility of the 18th Century, who would travel to Europe to discover its culture, architecture - and themselves. \nIn the series, Clark and Rinder, who share the same divorce lawyer, travelled to Venice, Florence and Rome following in the footsteps of one of the most famous of Grand Tourists, romantic poet Lord Byron, on the 200th anniversary of his death. \nByron - like Clark and Rinder - was also in the public eye and divorced. He journeyed to Italy to escape from the mounting pressure of life. It's something Clark can identify with. The culmination of his marriage breaking down after six years, and the knock-on effect of stopping work for the first time in 10 years, sent Clark into a \"downward spiral\", he says.\n\"I tried to finish myself off. I didn't eat. I went down to 9 stone (57kg). I'm 6ft 4in (1.9m), I looked horrendous,\" he says.\nGrateful for everything he has built, having grown up in a council house in Stepney Green, east London, with not very much, Clark says he would give it all up not to have put his mother, Linda, through the trauma of that difficult time.\n\"She's a 70-year-old woman and she had to watch her successful son literally disintegrate.\" \nHe adds that starting afresh - going out on dates when you're in the public eye - brings with it its own difficulties.\n\"I always thought when I was younger, imagine being known, you'd probably be able to get anyone you want. It's the complete opposite,\" he says.\nRinder, a criminal barrister who rose to prominence as a TV judge, had been with his partner for 11 years, but his relationship broke down four years into their marriage. \nFor him, one of the hardest things to do is live in the moment, rather than in his head.\n\"Recently, I went on a date and I thought it had gone rather well, and he said, 'Well I did rather feel like I was being cross-examined',\" he says.\n\"I'm one of life's great overthinkers, it stops me doing everything. It stops me finding joy, it stops me taking risks.\"\nOn his arrival in Italy, Byron fell in love. Like the original tourists on the Grand Tour, Rinder and Clark met up with prospective love interests too, taking themselves out of their comfort zone to date Venetian men. But they also studied the art, architecture and culture of the historic Italian cities.\n\"I wouldn't say I know a lot about art,\" says Clark. \"I come from quite a working-class background and art wasn't the thing that we had hanging up in our houses. It would be fake chandeliers from down the market - that was our family heirlooms.\"\nRinder comes from a working-class background too and was brought up by his single-parent mother.\n\"Opera wasn't on the buffet - or ballet or books,\" he says. \"Really for me, education - be it in the music or the arts - it was the way out.\"\nAlthough Rinder has studied art, the Grand Tour was not just about him educating Clark, but Clark educating him, he says.\n\"Every painting we've looked at, some of which I've seen multiple times, he's found something new and beautiful in it,\" he says.\nFor Clark, the tour has given him the confidence to not feel intimidated to talk about art any more. He has made no secret, he says, of the fact he didn't have that much confidence in himself.\nJust as carnival guests in Venice would wear masks to conceal their identities, Clark says he too wears a mask every day in the form of make-up. \n\"I'm very much two people,\" says Clark. \"So everyone knows me as Rylan - has a laugh, big teeth, wears a bit of make-up - a lot of make-up - and is just that presenter off the telly - or that idiot off the telly. \n\"Whereas actually at home, I'm Ross. Ross is who I grew up as, Rylan's my job. Ross is the one that sits at home with a tracksuit on and a Peroni in the hand, so I am very different.\"\nHe says the make-up he wears is his suit of armour.\n\"So you can take the piss out of my teeth, you can say I look orange, but at the end of the day when I wipe it all off, Ross isn't bruised, Rylan takes the battering, that's how I deal with it.\"\nFor Clark, who loves design and says he wanted to be an architect growing up, the trip has given him the chance to redefine himself. \n\"When you're 'something', people want you to be that 'something' and stay in your lane, sometimes it's nice to indicate, slip over,\" he says.\nIt does feel like he an",
    "An adventurer and social media influencer has climbed up and down Ben Nevis several times in a week to remove \"absolutely disgusting\" rubbish left in an emergency shelter. \nPaul Arnott, 29, from Bedfordshire, said when he became stranded on a hike he took cover and discovered \"a nightmare\" that included a frozen tent, rotten food, and bottles of bodily fluids. \nThe video creator decided to use his TikTok account, Downtherapids, that has more than 92,000 followers, to highlight the issue. \n\"It's a way of giving back to the mountains and the community,\" he said.\nSince a young age, he has climbed mountains and has travelled all over the world exploring and making videos.\nHe first arrived in the Fort William area of Ben Nevis, Scotland, two weeks ago.\nSpeaking about why he sought out emergency shelter he said: \"I got stuck in pretty bad conditions at the top of the summit, there were 60mph winds, I couldn't see a thing.\n\"I went in there and it was absolutely filthy, it was a nightmare, there was rotten food, saturated clothes, bottles of bodily fluids, all sorts of stuff, it was absolutely disgusting.\"\nHe took it upon himself to return and started clearing it out at night, when the route was less busy.\nHe said since posting on his social media channels, \"it's been insane\" and he has received offers of help from other people. \nSo far, he has collected more than 10 bags of rubbish and is trying to break up, and bring down, a broken tent. \n\"I want to keep doing things like this, it's such a positive thing to do, so I want to use my platform in a good way.\"\nHe believed there were \"two sides\" to why the rubbish was left. \nSome items could have been left due to an emergency and there were \"unable to bring it down\". \n\"But there should be some sense of responsibility to let the community know and arrange for it to be brought down.\n\"It's important to respect the mountain and keep the environment safe\", he added. \nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

It showed no aspiration for what is an aspirational city,\" he added. \n\u201cYou can\u2019t just sit there and moan from the sidelines about the incumbent,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have solutions.\u201d\nAfter the results were announced, Ms Hall said she would \"continue to hold Sadiq to account, for hard-working families, motorists and women.\n\"I urge Sadiq to make London better for all our sakes,\" she added.\nMs Hall remains as a member of the London assembly.\nLib Dem candidate Rob Blackie told BBC London after the declaration: \"We've increased our vote everywhere in London and [are pleased] to have got into third place for the first time in a long time.\"\nZo\u00eb Garbett, the Green Party candidate, said she had been \"squeezed\" by Labour's pledges on the environment and new electoral rules removing second preference voting. \nOnly 70 votes seperated the Greens and Lib Dems in the final tally.\nSteve Reed, Labour's shadow environment secretary, said Mr Khan increasing his majority in a third election was \"remarkable\". \n\u201c[Khan] did it by making a very positive pitch to Londoners about what he would do in a third term,\" he said.\nThe Croydon North MP said the Conservatives were \"out of touch with London and Londoners\". \nMr Scully denied Tory members in the capital were out of touch and instead laid the \"blame fairly at the central party organisation\". \n\"Members are as equally puzzled and as frustrated as I am with this process because they do reflect modern London,\u201d he added.\nThe Conservative Party and Ms Hall's campaign declined to comment.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "In the picturesque village of Tintern, in south Wales, an elderly gentleman can often be found taking pictures at community events and family celebrations.\nBut David Hurn, 89, is far from your average photographer.\nOver the past seven decades he has documented everything from the Aberfan disaster to the Beatles at the height of Beatlemania.\nIn the '70s he set up Newport\u2019s prestigious School of Documentary Photography, producing scores of photographers.\nAnd these days the man often described as Wales' most important living photographer has streams of new admirers, after getting to grips with social media.\n\"Twitter and God knows what\u2026 I don't even know what they all mean, I just don't understand it,\" he said.\n\"But I suddenly discovered that there was this thing called Instagram.\"\nIn 2016, the self-taught photographer casually started an account on the social media platform, sharing his musings on photography and photos taken throughout his career.\nNow these Instagram posts - which have helped him build up a following of more than 54,000 Instagram followers - have been brought together in a photo book titled David Hurn: On Instagram.\nDavid, who was raised in Cardiff, never intended to become a photographer.\nIn fact he had his heart set on becoming a vet, but his dyslexia meant he left school with no qualifications.\nNational Service and a transfer to The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst followed.\nOne day he was in the officers' mess - the social space and accommodation for personnel - when he picked up a copy of the magazine Picture Post and became overwhelmed by an image on one of its pages.\n\"Suddenly I started to cry really quite violently. It was not just little tears, it was big sobbing,\" he said.\nThe image was of a Russian army officer buying his wife a hat in a department store in Moscow.\nIt triggered a memory of his own father returning from World War Two and taking him and his mother to Howells department store in Cardiff and buying her a hat.\n\"It was the first memory I had of the love between my mother and my father,\" said Hurn.\n\"I instantly realised that all Russians don't eat their children.\n\"This one simple picture I believed more than the propaganda.\"\nOn leaving Sandhurst he headed for London.\n\"I kind of learnt photography by sitting in the coffee bars and shooting a bit,\" he said.\nIt was in a coffee bar that he met the politician Michael Foot, who at that time was working as a journalist.\nFoot told him about the unfolding uprising in Hungary and suggested he go there and take pictures - and that is exactly what he did. \nHe got into Budapest in an ambulance after contacting the Red Cross.\nHe met journalists from Life magazine whose photographer had been unable to get into the city so he was asked to work for them.\n\"Little did they know that I was up in my room reading my book on how to put film in my camera,\" laughed David.\n\"I learned very quickly that it's better to start at the top than the bottom. \n\"If you start at the top you just cling on and learn very quickly.\"\nHis first pictures appeared in Life Magazine and then the Observer.\nHe said: \"Suddenly, sort of, at the age of 22 I had a name.\"\nHurn quickly built a career covering current affairs, but it was not long before his career took a more glamorous turn.\nOne of the first big stars he photographed was Sophia Loren while she was making the film El Cid in 1960.\n\"Sophia was wonderful. We became very good friends and so we would eat every night together,\" said Hurn.\nWhen the fashion magazine Harper's Bazaar wanted Loren to do a fashion shoot, she agreed to do it on the condition that Hurn took the pictures - which led to more fashion work.\nIn 1963, Hurn was asked to take publicity shots of Sean Connery for the Bond film From Russia with Love.\n\"Now that\u2019s a very funny story,\" he laughed.\nThey were in Hurn\u2019s west London studio to shoot the poster when the publicist realised they had forgotten to bring the gun for Connery to pose with.\n\"I said \u2018don't panic, one of my hobbies is target shooting with a pistol,\" said Hurn.\nHe produced his Walther air pistol which can be seen in the finished poster.\nThe following year, at the height of Beatlemania, he spent about seven weeks photographing John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr at Abbey Road Studios during the filming of A Hard Day\u2019s Night.\n\"I got on with them very well,\" he said.\n\"I must be one of the few people that's played Monopoly with The Beatles.\"\nAnd he said he spotted some tension between the band.\n\"I wasn't totally convinced that they actually really liked each other all that much,\" he said.\n\"It didn't surprise me when they quickly broke up later.\"\nWhat were they like?\n\"I found John a little bit aloof to everybody\u2026 Paul had an attitude of being slightly pompous, absolutely understandable because it turns out that he was really the guy writing the thing, George was off on a world of his own\u2026 and Ringo was just a nice guy. I found him lovely.\"\nHe went on to spend that Chris",
    "St Giles' Cathedral sits at the heart of Edinburgh's Old Town, an architectural anchor at the centre of Scotland's capital city.\nAlso known as the High Kirk, it has played a major part in many of Scotland's big moments. \nCelebrating its 900th year in 2024, the church has been the focus of historic and notable events from the 12th Century through to the death of the Queen in 2022.\nWe look back at some of its most interesting stories.\nAbout 30,000 people queued along the Royal Mile to file past the coffin of the late Queen after that memorable journey down from Balmoral.\nHer four children formed a guard of honour during the vigil. \nReverend Dr George Whyte, interim moderator of St Giles' Cathedral, said: \"I think we played a good part in allowing people to pay their respects and for Scotland to say thank you to her for 70 years of service.\"\nThe church was again at the centre of royal celebrations several months later, when King Charles returned to be presented with the Honours of Scotland.\nAlong with Queen Camilla, and the Duke and Duchess of Rothesay, they attended the National Service of Thanksgiving and Dedication.\nRev Whyte said even outside of these big events, the cathedral is a big attraction.\nHe said: \"We have one and a half million visitors a year across our doorstep.\n\"It costs money to run it and we are always thinking of how to balance the books.\n\"Volunteers play a large part. It's hectic at times and there are pressure points.\n\"If we can be useful and fulfil our function as a Christian presence in the middle of Scotland's capital, then I think we'll be doing the job.\"\nMany famous films have been set in or around St Giles'. \nBut few are bigger than a Marvel Studios blockbuster.\nOne Hollywood filmmaker wanted to remove the metal support structure which holds up the old stone ribs of the famous crown spire.\nSarah Phemister, head of culture and heritage at St Giles', said: \"Maybe the most surprising was our involvement in the Marvel film.\n\"We were in Avengers Infinity War and that was a really unusual experience.\"\nShe added: \"The location managers came up to the crown spire and were very interested in filming a fight scene, but were a little concerned about the metal structure which is basically holding up the spire and did request maybe we could remove it, just for the scene, and then pop it back.\n\"We did, very politely, explain that that probably would lead to the collapse of one of the most iconic bits of Edinburgh's skyline.\n\"So we had a complete replica roof in a warehouse somewhere in Leith for one of their dramatic fight scenes.\n\"It was a bit 'blink and you miss it' but we definitely did appear.\"\nIn 1911 the Thistle Chapel became home to the Knights of the Thistle - Scotland's ancient order of chivalry and nobility which still meets at St Giles'. \nA year later Edinburgh city clock firm James Ritchie donated a new clock mechanism to St Giles'. \nStephen Preston, former tower tour guide at the cathedral, said: ''Ritchie's came along and said we'd love to give you a new clock mechanism however we hate the clock faces so we'll do you a deal.\n\"We'll give you the clock mechanism for free if you take those ugly clock faces down.\n\"There have been no clock faces on St Giles' since but the bells chime every quarter hour.\nHe added: \"It tells you a bit early.\n\"It's almost, get ready for the time, and then, here's the time, on the last chime.\"\nIn the 19th Century, St Giles' Cathedral was restored under the guidance of William Chambers - the dictionaries publisher - who'd dreamt it should become 'Scotland's Westminster'. \nQueen Victoria sent a donation of \u00a3200 to the appeal fund but it took 16 years to demolish and rebuild and Chambers died in 1883 just three days before the grand re-opening service.\nGargoyles and grotesques were designed to scare off evil and protect those inside.\nIn 1798, a local newspaper recorded two golfers chipping balls up and over the cathedral. \nStephen Preston said: ''They claim they started in Parliament Square just behind us in the High Street and they found the golf balls in front in Advocates Close. \n\"Up and over - 50 metres, \" he said.\nIn 1637 - after the Union of the Crowns - King Charles I tried to unify the Scottish and English faiths and made St Giles\u2019 a cathedral. \nWhen he tried to impose a new prayer book in St Giles\u2019 it's said a local woman, Jenny Geddes, threw her stool at the preacher, starting a riot.\nThe church started out in the Catholic faith.\nJohn Knox converted St Giles's to Protestantism in 1559-60 after 400 years as a Catholic church - despite Scotland still having a Catholic monarch, Mary Queen of Scots.\nThe history of St Giles' dates all the way back in 1124 when King David I founded the church.\nThe Romanesque-designed building was constructed before most of the Old Town - before there was even an Abbey at Holyrood let alone a palace.\nIn the 14th Century, after the Scots signed the Declaration of Arbroath - a letter to the Pope affirming Scotland\u2019s independen",

    "The boss of Eurotunnel has insisted there will not be long queues of cars at its terminals when a new EU travel system starts in October.\nBrits heading to and from Europe will need to register fingerprints and a photo at the border, which has prompted warnings of delays.\nEurotunnel chief executive Yann Leriche said journeys would take five-to-seven minutes longer, but extra lanes and technology mean the process will go smoothly.\nThe BBC has had the first look at new machines people will need to use at Folkestone or Calais.\nAt the Port of Dover, Eurostar\u2019s St Pancras terminus and Eurotunnel in Folkestone, French border police check passports as people leave the UK.\nThe EU\u2019s much-delayed Entry Exit system, or EES, will replace manual passport stamping.\nCitizens of countries which are outside the bloc, including the UK, will need to register their biometric information.\nThere have been repeated warnings of queues as a result, and calls for the EES launch to be pushed back again. \nThere were hopes that an app being developed by the EU could enable some of the registration to be done from home, but it is not expected to be ready for use in October.\nAt Eurotunnel\u2019s Folkestone and Calais sites, we saw how the company which operates vehicle and freight shuttles across the Channel Tunnel has been preparing for the new system.\nThe equivalent of \u00a370m is being spent building processing zones, where people will queue in their cars to use automatic machines.\nYann Leriche, the chief executive of Eurotunnel operator Getlink, told the BBC that travellers \"will simply [get] out of their car, spend a few minutes on their kiosks, and go back to their car and continue their journey\u201d.\nHe said it would take \u201cfive to seven minutes extra to get through\u201d, but added \u201cas we have extended the number of lanes, there will be no delay on the highway, nothing. It will happen in a very smooth manner\u201d.\nThe company will recruit 140 new staff to assist passengers.\nI tried out one of the prototype machines which Eurotunnel will use at its terminals.\nFirst, it took a scan of my passport.\nNext, the machine then took a photo of my face.\nI was then asked to put my right hand on another scanning pad, which recorded my fingerprints.\nA series of questions about my journey followed on the touchscreen, to which I had to answer \"yes\" or \"no\". \nAt the Port of Dover, the plan is slightly different.\nPort staff will have iPads for car passengers to register their information.\nCoaches will be processed off-site at the Western Docks, with e-gates or kiosks.\nMonday marks 30 years since Queen Elizabeth II and President Mitterand took part in the Channel Tunnel's official opening event.  \nPaying passengers had to wait several months longer to take the journey on Eurostar trains.\nThe tunnel opened \u00a32bn over budget. The company operating it nearly went bust at one point, but it later became profitable and the services through the tunnel have endured.  \nWith the pandemic over and preparations under way for the introduction of EES, Getlink boss Mr Leriche wants to see an increasing number of trains going through the tunnel.\nEurostar, a separate company to Eurotunnel, runs passenger services from London St Pancras through the Channel Tunnel to Paris and beyond. Since the tunnel opened, it has been the only operator doing that. \nNow, there's talk of rival operators springing up. \nMr Leriche said: \"We are confident that within the next 10 years, there will be a doubling of the direct connection between London and Europe\".\n",
    "Rathlin Island's only shop has avoided closure after having almost \u00a312,000 stolen in an online scam.\nThe future of the Co-Op Shop was in doubt after it is believed criminals used a phishing email to access its banking details. \nHowever, the Co-Operative Bank has now returned the money to the business, saying it fell prey to a \u201ccommon type of scam\u201d.\nRathlin's residents and shop staff have expressed relief the \"island's lifeblood\" can stay open.\nRuari Morgan, the chairperson of the community cooperative that runs the shop, said they found out from the bank in March that \"a standing order of \u00a311,900 had been approved and the money had left the account\".\n\"Leaving us with nothing left in the account at all. So the shop was in real danger. We couldn\u2019t afford to keep it going without that money\u201d.\nMr Morgan and others spent five weeks attempting to get the money back. \nIt was refunded a day after BBC News NI contacted the bank. \n\u201cObviously we were relieved to finally get the money back. But it took 37 days to get that refund and that took a toll. \n\"I spent more than 40 hours on phone calls just trying to get a resolution. But getting to the end of it and getting the money back into the account is a relief.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s a bit of an accounting nightmare because I\u2019ve been paying for stuff out of my own account to keep the shop operating, so we need to get the books all balanced again.\u201d\nWith Rathlin Island's very low crime rate, the incident has shocked people. \n\u201cEveryone is now aware of how easily these scams can happen and it\u2019s shown that we\u2019re not immune to this type of stuff on Rathlin,\" said Mr Morgan.\nHe has also taken precautions to stop it happening again.\n\"We\u2019ve purchased a new laptop which will only be used for our HMRC stuff and payroll. Absolutely no web browsing or email or anything else will be done on that laptop and hopefully that will protect us a bit.\"\nAoife Molloy, a staff member in the shop, said she has been worried for weeks about its future.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been scary to be honest. I am very lucky to have a job that\u2019s all-year round \u2013 there aren\u2019t many of them on the island. \n\"And if I lost this one I\u2019d probably have to leave Rathlin and that would break my heart. I\u2019ve been here 15 years and can\u2019t imagine ever living anywhere else.\"\nNoel McCurdy, a regular customer, said it had been a worrying time for islanders.\n\u201cWe need our local shop. People can shop in Ballycastle or shop online but the shop is a focal point for the island community, people meet up here in the mornings to pass the gossip around. \n\"It\u2019s part of the community.\"\nAnother regular customer, Margaret McQuilkin, was shocked by news of the scam.\n\u2018It\u2019s dreadful, you never expect it to happen to you and certainly not to our little Co-Op Shop, which is the lifeblood of the island,\"\nBut while crime is rare on Rathlin Island scams like this are becoming more and more common across Northern Ireland.\nPSNI Ch Supt Gerard Pollock, chair of the ScamwiseNI Partnership, said everyone needs to be vigilant.  \n\u201cCriminals can now access banking and personal data by exploiting communication networks through phones, social media, emails or text messages.\n\u201cAnyone can be targeted. Never click on links in text messages or emails from someone you do not know and never reply to suspicious numbers or emails.\u201d\nThe Co-Operative Banking Group said it is \u201cextremely sorry\u201d that this happened and encouraged customers to remain vigilant.\n\u201cWe sympathise with the distress caused and have refunded the full amount lost.\n\"We want to reassure our customers that we have robust security controls in place to protect them from fraud.\n\"We do ask that customers remain vigilant when it comes to suspicious activity on their account and never share key account or security information with anyone.\u201d",
    "Two Nasa astronauts are due to head for the International Space Station aboard a new spacecraft.\nBoeing\u2019s Starliner will blast off from Cape Canaveral in Florida, in its first crewed test flight.\nThe mission has been delayed for several years because of setbacks in the spacecraft's development.\nIf it is successful, it will become the second private firm able to provide crew transport to and from the ISS, alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX.\nNasa no longer wants to own and operate such vehicles, preferring now to buy the service from the commercial sector.\nThe scheduled lift-off is set for 22:34 local time on Monday (03:34 BST Tuesday).\nBut the launch is also a moment of jeopardy for Boeing. Its airline business is under pressure because of a series of accidents. And the firm\u2019s space sector is also under scrutiny following difficulties in developing  Starliner itself.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really big day for Boeing\", commented Dr Simeon Barber, a space scientist at the Open University.\n\u201cThe company has been working on the spacecraft for so long, they have had a few problems with the test flights and there\u2019s a lot riding on this\u201d.\nStarliner was originally due to have its first uncrewed test flight in 2015 but this was delayed until 2019. When it did occur, software glitches led to an internal clock malfunction, resulting in thrusters over-firing. So much fuel was consumed that the capsule couldn't reach the space station.\nA second attempt was planned in August 2021 but delayed again until May 2022. An issue with the propulsion system was blamed. When Starliner did finally get off Earth, it managed to complete its full mission but concerns were then later raised about the performance of some thrusters and the craft's cooling system.\nCorrecting these faults and additional issues to do with the safety of wiring and parachutes pushed the first crewed demonstration back to where we are today.\nNasa and Boeing would not have given the go ahead for astronauts to fly the mission unless they were certain all the glitches had been sorted out. And the launch will be aborted if there is any sign of problems with the spacecraft.\nAt a pre-flight news conference, a reporter put it to the Navy-trained astronauts that the setbacks must make their flight \"scary\" for friends and family.\nBarry \"Butch\" Wilmore said it would be wrong to describe the various technical issues as \"setbacks\".\n\"We'd call them steps forward. We find an issue and rectify that and we have articulated that to our families so that they understand that,\" he added.\nAnd Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, who will pilot the spacecraft, commented: \"We are all here because we are all ready. Our friends and family have heard about it and we've talked about it and they are happy and proud that we are part of the process to fix it all.\"\nWhen Nasa announced that SpaceX and Boeing would take over from the old space shuttles, it gave them both a similar contract, one that would bring their capsules into service and then pay for six operational missions. The SpaceX contract was worth $2.6bn while Boeing got $4.2bn. SpaceX was able to fly its crew flight test in 2020. This means Boeing is four years behind. The company has also spent a lot of money to put things right.\nDr Barber said SpaceX and other start-ups had a new approach to technology development that led to greater innovation.\n\"You have a traditional space company (in Boeing) that has been around a long time and does things in a certain way and you have a new space company which has done things in a different way, by building, testing, crashing, learning and then building again and so their development cycle is very rapid,\" he told BBC News.\nBoeing\u2019s commercial crew programme manager Mark Nappi told reporters at a news conference that finding faults in test flights was a normal part of the process in developing a new spacecraft.\n\u201cDesign and development has constant ups and downs, but the overall slope is always up. So that is where we have got to today. We are basically at the top of that slope\u201d.\nThe arrival of Boeing's spacecraft into service will mean competition for SpaceX which should bring down costs, according to Libby Jackson, who is the head of space exploration for the UK Space Agency.\n\"That is really important not just for Nasa, but for other space agencies, such as the UK Space Agency, because we are spending the taxpayers' money getting our astronauts to the ISS and we want the best value for money,\" she said.\nStarliner is 5m tall and 4.6m wide (16.5ft by 15ft), when attached to its rear service module. It's wider than the capsule used in the Apollo missions. There's room for up to seven astronauts, although it will probably fly routinely with just four. It's intended to be reusable and fly up to 10 times.\nThe spacecraft launch at in the early hours of Tuesday morning should see it cross the southwest of the UK about 20 minutes after lift-off.\nDuring the journey to the ISS, the crew will test seats, assess onboard life-support and n",

To help you prepare, here\u2019s a guide to all 37 songs in the contest \u2013 which I\u2019ve sorted into barely-coherent musical categories, because everyone needs a system.\nThe success of K\u00e4\u00e4rij\u00e4\u2019s mutant rave-rap anthem Cha Cha Cha at last year\u2019s contest has unlocked something potent.\nEverywhere you look in Malm\u00f6, there\u2019s a sense of musical experimentation and outr\u00e9 risqu\u00e9 performance.\nTop of the heap is Croatia\u2019s Baby Lasagna, whose ridiculously catchy Rim Tim Tagi Dim is currently the bookmakers' favourite to win.\nLoud and aggressive and memorable and fun, it blends elements of rock and techno to tell the story of a farm boy saying goodbye to his milking stool and setting out for the big city.\nAccording to singer Marko Puri\u0161i\u0107, the lyrics are a reference to the brain drain that\u2019s affecting Croatia\u2019s economy.\nAnother strong contender Switzerland\u2019s Nemo, whose song The Code is a hare-brained hybrid of pop, opera and electro.\nInspired by Nemo\u2019s childhood experience as an opera singer, it uses elements of Bizet\u2019s Carmen and Mozart\u2019s The Magic Flute to explain how they came to terms with their non-binary identity. It\u2019s surprisingly intense.\nFinland\u2019s Windows95Man, on the other hand, is trying too hard to stand out, emerging from a giant egg and dancing around in his underpants. But all the antics aren\u2019t enough to distract from the fatally generic Europop of his song, No Rules.\nI\u2019m much more enamoured by Joost Klein from the Netherlands who takes a whistle-stop, happy hardcore tour of Europe in the infectiously silly Europapa.\nPerformed in high-rise shoulderpads, while LED screens project images of currywurst and paella, the song is nonetheless rooted in tragedy.\nJoost lost his parents at a young age, and the song reflects that no matter how far he travels, he can\u2019t outrun his grief.\nPull on your dancing trousers, because Eurovision is ready to party.\nThere are a ton of uptempo dance-pop numbers this year, led (gasp) by the UK\u2019s entrant, Olly Alexander.\nFormerly of the pop band Years and Years, his bubbling synthpop anthem, Dizzy, recalls Gloria Gaynor\u2019s I Will Survive by way of The Pet Shop Boys.\nInstantly memorable, if a little undercooked, the song has risen to 10th place in the odds after rehearsal footage was released this week, showcasing some memorable choreography and a revamped ending to the song.\nBut he faces stiff competition, as pop fans are spoilt for choice this year.\nCypriot entrant Silia Kapsis, for example, channels Janet and Britney with her infectiously bombastic song, Liar. Her lyrics could do with some work (\u201cThe only problem in this room is about you\u201d) but the breath-taking dance routine will be popular with voters.\nNot to be outdone on the choreography, Malta\u2019s Sarah Bonnici does the splits and a somersault during her performance. But her song, Loop, is paper-thin, and languishes in last place with bookmakers.\nBy contrast, Spanish duo Nebulossa have already had a viral hit with their song, Zorra. The title translates as both \u201cvixen\u201d and \u201cbitch\u201d and the lyrics are a commentary on the double standards women face. It\u2019s a shimmering piece of 80s candy-pop that\u2019s good enough to eat.\nMeanwhile, five-time Eurovision winners Luxembourg are back in the competition for the first time in 31 years, represented by Tali Golergant.\nShe punches above her weight with Fighter, a vibey, syncopated pop slammer whose chorus sticks in your head like a sausage on a fork.\nLooming over the competition like a pop Godzilla is Albanian diva Besa. Her song, Titan, has an appropriately gargantuan hook and a thrilling tempo-switch at the end. \nHer bright blue bodysuit seems to have been inspired by Steps' video for Deeper Shade of Blue. And why not? It's a classic.\nRounding out the field are Iceland\u2019s Hera Bj\u00f6rk with Scared Of Heights and Polish singer Luna with The Tower. \nBoth songs are both perfectly accessible, radio-friendly pop \u2013 but I suspect they\u2019ll struggle to survive the semi-finals.\nEurovision wouldn\u2019t be Eurovision without a raven-haired diva over-emoting about her personal struggles, and this year is no exception.\nIsrael\u2019s Eden Golan has the best of the bunch \u2013 a stirringly emotional piano ballad called Hurricane, in which a ",
    "Argentina\u2019s president Javier Milei says he accepts the Falkland Islands are currently \u201cin the hands of the UK\".\nIn an interview with the BBC, the right-wing politician vowed to get the islands back through diplomatic channels but said there was \u201cno instant solution\u201d.\nHis language on the status of the Falklands is different from past leaders who have historically maintained the islands are Argentine.\nPresident Milei admitted it could take decades to try to gain sovereignty of the Falkland Islands from the UK and said Argentina does not \"seek conflict\".\nIt comes after he promised a \u201croadmap\u201d for the islands to become Argentine, on the 42nd anniversary of the Falklands War in early April.\nHe had criticised politicians who \u201cbeat their chests demanding sovereignty of the islands, but without any result\u201d.\nThe UK and Argentina went to war over the British overseas territory - known as the Malvinas in Argentina - in 1982.\nThe invasion claimed the lives of 255 British servicemen, three islanders and 649 Argentinian personnel.  \nBut President Milei praised Margaret Thatcher who was the UK prime minister during the Falklands War.\nHe was speaking in his presidential palace office, in which there was some Margaret Thatcher memorabilia on a display table.\nElsewhere, sat a photograph of a former Argentine president with the Rolling Stones, a bust sculpture of himself, and a water bottle with his photograph on it.\nLady Thatcher ordered the torpedoing of the Argentine naval cruiser the General Belgrano during the war, resulting in the deaths of 323 people on board.\nAsked if he still admired her, President Milei said: \u201cCriticising someone because of their nationality or race is very intellectually precarious. I have heard lots of speeches by Margaret Thatcher. She was brilliant. So what's the problem?\u201d\nArgentina has long claimed sovereignty over the islands in the south-west Atlantic Ocean - 300 miles off its coast and 8,000 miles from the UK . There is a plaque of them displayed in a courtyard of the presidential palace in Buenos Aires.\nThe UK\u2019s Foreign Secretary, Lord Cameron, visited the islands in February and said their sovereignty was not up for discussion.\nPresident Milei said: \u201cIf that territory is now in the hands of the UK, he has a right to do that. I don\u2019t see that as a provocation.\u201d\nThat seems like a significant remark as past leaders and many Argentines have always refused to accept the islands were British. \nIn 2013, when Lord Cameron was prime minister, islanders voted in favour of remaining a UK overseas territory.\nPresident Milei said he wanted the islands to become Argentine \u201cwithin the framework of peace\u201d.\n\u201cWe are not going to relinquish our sovereignty, nor are we going to seek conflict with the United Kingdom,\u201d he said.\nHe refused to put a timeframe on this, saying \u201cit\u2019s going to take time\u201d and it would involve a \u201clong-term negotiation\u201d.\nWhen asked why the UK would agree to this, he told the BBC: \u201cThey might not want to negotiate today. At some later point they might want to. Many positions have changed over time.\u201d\nHe denied it was not a priority of his but, when pushed, admitted \u201cof course\u201d it could take decades - referencing the handover of Hong Kong from the UK to China in 1997.\nHis rhetoric is notably tamer than his left-wing predecessor Alberto Fernandez, who called the islands \u201cstolen land\u201d and the UK\u2019s claim on them \u201cdisgusting\u201d.\nUnder his leadership, Argentina broke a co-operation deal and pushed to reopen talks on the islands.\nPresident Milei\u2019s approach has surprised some, given his radical approach to other policies during his campaign - for example campaigning with a chainsaw to symbolise his desire to slash public spending and the state, which he also defended in the interview.",
    "Newly-elected West Midlands Mayor Richard Parker said he was committed to rebuilding the Labour Party's trust with Muslim communities.\nMr Parker defeated Tory incumbent Andy Street, who had held the office for seven years and was seeking a third term, by just 1,508 votes, in a shock loss for the Conservatives.\nHowever, independent candidate Akhmed Yakoob, who campaigned on a pro-Palestine ticket, won 69,621 votes, diminishing Labour's lead in some of its typical stronghold areas.\nBBC analysis has shown Labour's position on the Israel-Hamas war appears to have dented its support in Muslim areas in England's local elections this week.\nIn 58 local council wards analysed by the BBC, where more than one in five residents identify as Muslim, Labour's share of the vote was 21% down on 2021, the last time most seats were contested.\nSpeaking on BBC Politics Midlands after his electoral win, Richard Parker addressed voters' concerns about Gaza.\n\"It's a very important point and it matters to this region,\" he said.\n\"I've been out speaking and listening to many of our inner city communities, including the Muslim community.\n\"I understand their concerns, I understand how important this issue is to them and I'm committed to working with our council leaders, our councillors, our MPs in the region and with the Labour Party nationally to start to rebuild the trust we've lost with the Muslim community.\n\"I'm hoping if we do that and we demonstrate to them we do care and we understand their concerns, we can rebuild that trust and we can win them back to Labour.\"\nLabour called for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza conflict in February, after months of wrangling over its position.\nIts initial stance after the war began, in which it called for humanitarian pauses in the fighting, prompted Labour resignations in councils and from its frontbench last year.\nSpeaking in Birmingham after Mr Parker's win, Labour leader Keir Starmer addressed Labour voters who turned away from the party over its stance on Gaza.\n\"I say directly to those who may have voted Labour in the past, but felt on this occasion they couldn't, that across the West Midlands we are a proud and diverse community,\"  Mr Starmer said.\n\"I have heard you, I have listened, and I am determined to meet your concerns and to gain your respect and trust again in the future.\"\nLabour's campaign chief and Wolverhampton MP Pat McFadden told Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday: \"I understand why people have got strong feelings about this issue, thousands of people have been killed.\n\"There\u2019s a great impulse to help people that are in a terrible situation, that\u2019s something that we share.\n\"The better life that people want for the Palestinian people is something the Labour leadership shares. If we\u2019re fortunate enough to be elected at the general election, its a very high foreign policy priority for the Labour Party.\n\"Two things have guided us since 7 October last year, the first was defending Israel\u2019s right to defend itself after that atrocity and that remains part of our position and the second is working to get a better future for the Palestinian people, both of those things will guide our position going forward.\"\nWhen asked whether the party\u2019s stance on the issue will have an impact in a general election, he replied: \"I do acknowledge that in some parts of the country that was the case and there will be some people who may have voted Labour in the past that haven\u2019t in the local elections because of this issue and where that's the case we\u2019ll work to get people\u2019s support back.\n\"Overall I do have to stress, these were tremendous local election results, a tremendous by-election and a set of Mayoral elections that went beyond the expectations that we had.\"\nOn BBC Politics Midlands, Mr Parker also discussed the mayoral results and what it meant for Labour in the next general election.\n\"It was an emotional rollercoaster. I'd actually only written a losing speech,\" the new mayor said.\n\"I had a great platform for my campaign and that was provided by the great work the Labour Party have done under Keir Starmer's leadership. \n\"What I think my victory demonstrated is that if we continue to work hard, campaign on issues that are important to working people, the Labour Party is in a great place to win the next election.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Community leaders in Peebles are proposing to knock down their town-centre hub rather than face a \u00a31.8m repairs bill.\nPeebles Community Trust (PCT) bought the former church and ex-servicemen's club premises in 2019  for \u00a3200,000.\nDespite re-roofing the building, upgrading the electrics and installing insulation, further problems, including asbestos, dry-rot and rising damp, have been discovered.\nMichael Ireland, chair of PCT, said: \"I'm not ashamed of our investment in the building, but it is sensible to draw a line in the sand.\"\nPeebles Ex-Servicemen's Club bought the Templars Hall on School Brae just after their formation in 1922.\nThe building was considerably expanded during the late 1960s to cater for its increasing membership, and throughout the 70s and 80s it was regarded as one of the busiest venues in the Scottish Borders.\nFollowing the club's closure, a buy-out by the PCT attracted support from several funding providers.\nToday the building is home to the Peebles Ex-Servicemen's Pipe Band, a Men's Shed, the PCT's re-use sales room, and several other community organisations.\nMr Ireland added: \"We have invested a lot of public money in the existing building and I know that us now wanting to demolish it may be a problem for some people.\n\"But without the investment we have made so far, this building would be derelict, and a real eye-sore.\n\"While a lot of people will have emotional ties with the building, it isn't in keeping with the area, and our proposals provide the opportunity to have a building that does befit this conservation area.\"\nIt was during last year when plans were taking shape for installing a new heating and ventilation system, that additional problems around the building were identified.\nAlong with the new heating costs of \u00a3400,000, bills for the additional work came to just over \u00a31.4m.\nAn indicative cost for demolition and rebuilding of \u00a31.86m was provided by a separate contractor.\nPCT director Andy Wright said: \"We have managed to keep the lights on over the past five years, but it has already required a lot of repair work.\n\"The directors have now stepped back to try to find a better solution.\n\"We are now proposing to demolish the building and develop a new School Brae hub that is fit for the community and will remain fit for the next 50 years.\"\n\nSeveral options have been considered since the repair bill landed last year; including the closing up and selling of the building, handing it over to Scottish Borders Council, or creating a green space following demolition.\nBut the need for a hub is leading the PCT down the road of rebuilding.\nIf the demolition and rebuild plans win public approval, the PCT directors hope to draw up a development brief and launch an architectural design competition later this year.\nMr Wright added: \"While it has its structural challenges and doesn't look attractive, this is still a building that has a place in the community's hearts, so we are aware how sensitive the demolition proposals will be.\n\"However, so far the reaction has been entirely positive.\"\n\nThe PCT will hold an extraordinary meeting before the summer to assess public feedback.\nThey will then explore funding options for the project at the same time as launch the design competition.",
    "Andy Street has said he is not putting the blame elsewhere for losing the West Midlands mayoral election.\nThe Tory incumbent, who had held the role for seven years, lost by just 1,508 votes to Labour's Richard Parker on Saturday.\nThe Conservatives lost more than 450 council seats in England this week. When asked if he believed the blame for him losing the mayoral election lay with the Conservative party, Mr Street told the BBC: \"I can't have it both ways\". \nHe added: \"We ran this election very much as my campaign. So ultimately what one has to say is I didn't persuade enough people to have confidence in our plans for the future.\"\nThe former mayor said he was \"gutted\" to have lost the election and that he was now going to take time to reflect.\n\"I'm the type of person who's given everything to this job, I think everyone would acknowledge that,\" he said.\n\"Now it's no longer, there it's an obvious time in life to pause, reflect, decide.\"\nHe added: \"I love the job but also I genuinely thought that the mayoralty [and] the combined authority were doing good things for the region and the region was coming stronger through it. \n\"It was my privilege to lead this region, an honour, you might say. I do feel gutted that that is not to continue.\"\nWhen asked if he could perceive the electoral results as a \"very near victory\", Mr Street replied: \"I feel very, very proud of what we've done over the last seven years...but also I feel incredibly proud of the Conservative team across the West Midlands.\n\"To get within 1,500 votes of the Labour Party when Labour is ascendant across the national polls in an area that many would say is their backyard, I think is an incredible achievement by my team so I do feel very, very proud of them.\"\nWhen asked if the campaign had relied too much on \"Brand Andy\", Craig Tracey, the Conservative MP for North Warwickshire, told BBC Politics Midlands he had not got that impression.\nMr Tracey said: \"I don't think there was any complacency at any point and we put in a big shift for him, from the parliamentary party but also the voluntary party and councillors.\n\"If you look at Andy Burnham's win in Manchester, he said it's about places not politics, so I think for a mayoral election, you can go on that one person.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Yeovil Hospital's existing stroke services in Somerset will not be reduced until their replacements over the border in Dorset are ready, health bosses have confirmed.\nPlans were approved in January to remove the hyper-acute stroke unit (HASU), meaning the most urgent stroke patients would be transported to either Dorchester or Taunton for treatment.\nResidents on either side of the border were concerned the new unit at Dorset County Hospital would not be ready before Yeovil's existing HASU had shut down.\nHealth bosses have now provided assurances that none of Yeovil's existing provision would be closed until the new unit in Dorchester was ready to go.\nNHS Somerset's Integrated Care Board (ICB) voted to have a single emergency stroke unit for the county at Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton.\nUnder the ICB plans, Yeovil District Hospital will keep 12 acute stroke beds where people can be cared for from 72 hours after a stroke, but it will lose its four hyper-acute beds.\nThe ICB said the change would lead to \"better outcomes for patients\".\nWest Dorset MP Chris Loder, whose constituency includes Dorset County Hospital, met NHS Somerset bosses last week after writing a letter setting out his \"significant reservations\" about the proposals.\nFollowing the discussions, a spokesman for NHS Somerset told the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS): \"The changes agreed will take 18 months to implement.\n\"The process will make sure that the services needed (at Dorset County Hospital) will be ready to go, before emergency stroke services at Yeovil move.\"\nCouncillor Adam Dance, who is standing to be the next MP of Yeovil, said he shared Mr Loder's concerns and would keep up the pressure on the Department of Health and Social Care to re-examine the changes.\nHe said: \"I would prefer that he was demanding, as I am, an answer to why relocate the HASU to Dorchester, when we could just reinvest at Yeovil?\"\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and, X.

    "Bunkers are a visible reminder of the Channel Islands' Nazi Occupation and, at one coastal fortification, footprints of a small child set into the concrete are an islander's lasting link back to that time.\nTony Hobbs was three-and-a-half years old when German forces landed in Guernsey in June 1940. \nNow 87, his memories of that time are still clear.\nDuring the building of a coastal bunker, built on the island as part of Hitler's Atlantic Wall, he was taken to the top and left his footprints in the drying concrete.\nTwo days before the start of five years of occupation, three German planes bombed St Peter Port Harbour as trucks were lined up on the quayside - the majority were carrying tomatoes for export.\nThirty-four people were killed and 33 were injured in the attack on 28 June 1940, which saw 49 vehicles damaged or destroyed.\nMr Hobbs remembers watching from his home at Salerie Corner, as the planes came in and bombed the trucks lined up at the White Rock and as horses fled without their riders, dragging their carts behind them.\n\nThe next day he said what was to be his final goodbye to his father as he went off on the lifeboat.\nHarold Hobbs was part of the Guernsey lifeboat crew that was tasked with collecting up the Jersey lifeboat to take it to England, because the authorities did not want it to fall into enemy hands.\nAs the lifeboat had been approaching Jersey, it was attacked by a German plane and Mr Hobbs senior was killed. \nAfter his father's death, Tony Hobbs, his mother and grandfather moved to take over an empty family house at L\u2019Islet for the duration of the occupation.\nThe family had decided life might be safer in the countryside than in the main town of St Peter Port.\nHis mother took on the job of washing clothes for some of the German officers in return for food and his grandfather befriended some of the German soldiers.\nMr Hobbs said: \"My grandfather had a bit of a laugh because they were speaking in a Yorkshire accent, and they told my grandfather that during the First World War they were captured in one of the first battles and spent the best part of four years up in Yorkshire.\n\"One day, they asked me if I\u2019d like to go on top of the bunker. So, I climbed the ladder, and the bunker was just finished so I stood right on the very edge of it.\"\nWith the concrete still drying, his feet left imprints.\nMr Hobbs said: \"I remember going up on the ladder. My grandfather told me that they found a ladder from somewhere and they went up and stood beside me. I was only three inches from falling over the top.\"\nIt was some time before he went back up to see them again: \"I kept saying for 60 years I\u2019m going up there one day.\n\"And then one day I bought an old van and it had a roof rack and my wife said 'put your ladder on top'.\n\"So that\u2019s what I did. I put the ladder on top and I went up and that was 20 years ago.\"\nThe bunker is currently owned by the Liberation Group and sits on the land alongside the Puffin and Oyster restaurant, overlooking Grand Havre Bay.\nBy BBC Guernsey communities reporter Isla Blatchford\nI got permission from the bunker's owners to see if the footprints had survived the past 80-plus years. Tony joined the search from the ground via a video call.\nI certainly didn\u2019t have the confidence of a young Tony as I climbed up the ladder. \nMy knees were knocking as I stepped on to the roof. I was OK once I was up and the view certainly helped. There can\u2019t be many people who have looked at Grand Havre from that vantage point.\nMy nerves - and the workplace risk assessment - didn\u2019t let me get too close to the edge but I could see that the footprints Tony had said should be there, no longer were. The concrete had worn smooth.\nBut, further in, I spotted a little footprint, highlighted by the small amount of dirt filling it. Alongside it, there was another. Small enough to be a child\u2019s. I was happy and relieved to show them to Tony again.\nI\u2019m privileged to have seen the mark he made on history and to have heard his stories of life during the occupation.\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

They put so much thought and care into it.\u201d\nTrinkets and two teddy bears were placed in Ruby\u2019s cot. One bear was cremated with Ruby and the other went to her three-year-old sister, Poppy.\n\u201cPoppy was told Ruby had sent her the teddy and she just clung onto it,\" the grandmother said. \n\u201cNow when mummy cries or is upset, she runs to get the teddy it and sits with her, it has been a lifeline.\n\u201cThe midwives called every day for counselling and stayed in touch to help, it is not just about the babies for them, it is about the experience for the mother.\u201d\nMelissa Davis, director of midwifery at North West Anglia Foundation Trust, said that the midwifery team provided support to bereaved families and to the midwives who were also impacted.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t just stop at the end of the day, when you go home you take it with you,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt is a difficult job, whatever role you do.

    "The owners of a fiberglass puffin that has stood outside a bookshop for more than 50 years have launched a campaign to get him restored.\nThe Book House in Thame, Oxfordshire, has appealed for pictures taken of the puffin over the years.\nThey hope the beloved bird, known as Fat Puffin, could get a makeover on BBC programme The Repair Shop.\nLuise Pattinson said previously unseen photos could show how \"fundamental\" it had been to the town.\nMrs Pattinson, who runs the shop with brother-in-law Brian Pattinson, said: \"He is so special, he's quite embedded in the history of Puffin Books and the history of the town, so he's a very special gentleman indeed.\"\nFat Puffin, who measures more than 1m high (3.2ft), was gifted to the shop by Puffin Books in 1972, as it was one of the few children's bookstores in the country.\nBut his condition has deteriorated over the years through wear and tear, being knocked over and a kidnapping by students in 1984, which left him dangling from the town hall by a rope. \n\"They presented us with a demand for \u00a33m which we promptly paid and he was returned,\" Mr Pattinson joked.\nHe no longer has his wooden plinth, part of his foot has broken off and his head is prone to toppling, despite attempts to mend him with car repair kits.\n\"He's had too many bumps,\" Mrs Pattinson explained.\n\"His head cracked open once and he had a big split which we tried to repair ourselves.\n\"When we shook out all the ballast we found a load of money so people obviously thought he was an RSPB collecting box when he had the split in his head.\n\"So he's all chipped and all his joints are now creaking and splitting, so he needs a really good makeover because he's just breaking apart bless him.\"\nFat Puffin used to be sighted outside the shop with a fellow puffin called Muffin, who he \"married\" in 2004. \nMrs Pattinson said: \"They're celebrating their 20th wedding anniversary this year. \n\"Poor old Muffin is not quite as heavy and portly, so she abandoned her place by the front door quite a while ago because she had a tendency to fly off down the High Street with every puff of wind, and wasn't quite so stable.\n\"Fat Puffin needs very clever reconstruction, which we just can't do, so we think The Repair Shop team might be able to repair him, and hopefully Muffin too so they can be reunited.\"\nIn order to make an application to the programme she is \"really hoping for pictures people have taken over the years - the older the better really - to prove how much a part of everyone's lives he's been\". \nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

    "A young Yorkshire author, who has twice been diagnosed with cancer, is taking part in an 150-mile walking challenge to raise money for charity. \nAuthor Hannah Russell, from Masham, will join this month's 'We Walk for Yorkshire' challenge for Yorkshire Cancer Research.\nHannah, 27, was diagnosed with sarcoma cancer when she was 21, and later developed skin cancer.\n\"I want to help raise awareness of the charity and the important work it does,\" she said, \"but also to try and encourage people to go to their doctor if something doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201d\nHannah was first diagnosed with cancer in her early twenties, after she started feeling pain in her right hip.\nShe was referred for further tests and was diagnosed with sarcoma, a cancer which is found in the body's soft tissue. \nFollowing chemotherapy and radiotherapy to treat the cancer, Hannah was given the all-clear by doctors.\nHowever, a year later, she was diagnosed with skin cancer. She underwent further radiotherapy and had 14 surgeries to remove the cancer.\nYorkshire Cancer Research was set up to fund research intended to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer in the local area.\nThroughout May,  the charity is challenging people across Yorkshire to walk a collective total of 31,000 miles - a symbolic figure representing the number of people typically diagnosed with cancer in Yorkshire each year.\nThe 'We Walk for Yorkshire' campaign hopes to encourage people to get outdoors and enjoy being active, while simultaneously raising awareness of the important role exercise plays in cancer prevention and treatment.\nHannah said she was advised to go walking as part of her rehabilitation following cancer treatment, and recalls pushing herself \"to walk a little bit futher every day\".\n\"When you\u2019ve been through so much, it\u2019s a great way to get out and focus your mind on something.\"\nHannah will be walking the Yorkshire Three Peaks as part of her challenge, as well as some of the Dales Way. \n\nDr Kathryn Scott, Chief Executive at Yorkshire Cancer Research, said: \u201cThere is growing evidence that exercise plays a vital role in cancer treatment and recovery, as well as helping to prevent cancer. \n\"That\u2019s why we\u2019re inviting people across the region to get active and take part in 'We Walk for Yorkshire'.\"\nPeople can sign up on the charity\u2019s website, where they can choose their own challenge and set up a fundraising page to share with friends and family.\n",
    "An initiative to train homeless shelter residents in barbering skills in Devon has recruited its first trainees.\nSisters Abi and Anna, tenants of St Petrock's, a homeless charity in Exeter, said they were the first sign-ups to an initiative by Hair at the Academy (HATA), a hairdressing school.\nThe siblings said they were both keen to \"thrive and make something of themselves\".\nHATA said it has been working with homeless people offering free haircuts.\nHairdresser Rhi Belcher, who is leading the training, said she and HATA founder Mary Pugsley MBE were approached by community interest firm Hair in the Community with the idea. \nMs Belcher said the six-month programme meant trainees could go \"from education to employment\", alongside gaining a mental health awareness certificate. \nTrainee Anna, 21, said she had spent her life \"in the care system\", while she had experienced homelessness twice in the last two years, staying in hotels and moving around each time. \nShe said her dream job would be to \"own a van and make coffee, travelling around the world\" - but the training could turn her vision into one of \"coffee and cuts\".\nReferring to periods of separation from her sister, Anna added: \"I'm glad that we got back together and we live together because we both want to thrive in our lives and make something of ourselves.\"\nAbi said she was \"really grateful\" for the opportunity to work alongside each other. \nOrganisers said the scheme was a \"beacon of hope\" for individuals seeking to rebuild their lives.\nMs Belcher said: \"A lot of the people who find themselves living on the streets, when they look in the mirror, don't recognise the person looking back.\n\"So when you can take them back to maybe the bricklayer that used to have a skin fade, and that's who they can see in the mirror again, it gives them that extra little lease of life and hope again.\"\nShe said chatting to clients could be \"eye-opening\", including tales of trouble, hardship, but also of \"real achievement and hope and strength\".\n\"I think it's nice just to be seen and heard at the same time by a complete stranger,\" she added.\nFollow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "\"I just thought it was normal,\" says Peter looking back at how volatile he used to be with his partner, Amy. \nThe 25-year-old admits he was \"quite controlling\", bombarding her with texts and phone calls demanding to know her movements. \nAnd if Amy didn't keep up with his communications, he says he would get \"quite angry\". He now feels ashamed of his behaviour. \nThe couple, whose names have been changed and identities protected, have been helped by charity For Baby's Sake.\nIt's one of the organisations being evaluated for a project aiming to identify the best way to support children and families experiencing domestic abuse.\nMore than 800,000 children in England and Wales have spent the past 12 months living in an abusive home, according to new research estimates.\nThis is more than the number of children who will start primary school this year - says Foundations, a leading research centre examining family support services.\nOverall, one child in every five has experienced some form of abuse at home, it says.  \nThe research centre is leading the \u00a32.6m study which aims to produce better evidence to ensure public money is spent on the most effective schemes.\n\"We're currently operating in the dark,\" says Dr Jo Casebourne, Foundations' chief executive. \n\"We just don't know what works to support children affected by domestic abuse, which feels completely unacceptable given the scale of children affected.\"\nAmy and Peter were referred to For Baby's Sake by social workers when they were expecting their first child.\nAt first, Amy, 23, admits she struggled to accept they had a problem, but she says \"looking back, it was really difficult\". \n\"I would always be waiting by the phone,\" she explains. \"And I'd be worried about doing certain things just in case I didn't answer the phone, in case it would upset him.\"\nPregnant mothers can be referred to the programme by GPs, midwives and other professionals when there are concerns about domestic abuse. For Baby's Sake will then work with both parents and support them for two years. \nAmy and Peter saw separate counsellors each week, which they say allowed them to start working through their problems before their daughter, Rosie, was born.\nPeter says it helped him understand the impact of witnessing domestic abuse and coercive control during his own childhood. \n\"I was thinking, 'there's no problems here,'\" he says. \"'This is how I've grown up, I've seen relationships handled. It's no one else's business'. But then upon some deeper reflection, I noticed the impact I was having on her, I realised things need to change.\"\nDomestic violence is a major reason for referrals to children's social care. And the police recorded more than 1.4 million domestic abuse-related incidents and crimes in England and Wales in the year to March 2023. \nIt can include physical, sexual or emotional abuse, including controlling behaviour. The Home Office calculates the social and economic cost of the damage it causes in England and Wales at about \u00a374bn a year.\nBut the impact on the lives of families and children is incalculable.\nAmy says the counselling made the couple realise the effect their relationship would have on their daughter, and that potentially it could \"result in the same things happening to her when she grows up\".\nWhen Rosie arrived, the For Baby's Sake team also worked with them as a family.\nTwo years on, she is a chatty, happy toddler and the couple are expecting a second child.\nWithout the help, Amy doesn't think their daughter would be \"thriving like she is now - and as happy as she is\".\n\"Now I know what's expected of me,\" says Peter. \"I know how to regulate my emotions. I know how to be the best dad and partner possible.\"\nJudith Rees, director of operations at For Baby's Sake, says they start seeing families when the mother is pregnant because research shows stress levels can have an impact on babies in the womb.\nThey work with \"the person causing harm and the person experiencing domestic abuse\" in a non-judgmental way, she says.\nAnother parent supported by For Baby's Sake is father-of-two Andrew. The charity helped him separate from his wife.\n\"I was getting abused mentally, not physically, and this is when I fled,\" he says.\nAs a man experiencing abuse, he says he found it particularly difficult to ask for help.  \n\"You feel worthless,\" he says. \"You try to disguise it and pretend that everything's fine and try to keep going. But it doesn't work that way. It destroys you.\"\nFor Baby's Sake says it recognises many couples don't stay together and it is important that they separate safely and in the best way for the children.\nIts own results show most of the families involved have babies born at full-term and a good birth weight, which gives those children a healthy start.\nJudith explains: \"We've also seen that in 75% of babies that are reaching [the age of] one in the last six months, there has not been a police call out to that home. So, there is a reduction in domestic abuse within home as w",
    "When Karan Shah, 32, goes to vote in the western state of Gujarat, he and his 59-year-old mother will be armed with water bottles and fruit to beat the heat. To escape long queues, they plan to reach the polling station early in the morning.\nMr Shah and his mother are among millions of Indians who will cast their ballots in the third phase of the general election on Tuesday, when 94 constituencies across 12 states go to the polls.\nIndia's general election is usually held every five years in April and May, and voters and polling officials are used to dealing with the harsh summer heat. But this year, India - along with other parts of Asia - is experiencing one of its hottest summers on record, in line with recent years. Last month, at least nine people died due to heat-related issues as searing temperatures hit the country.\nIn April, federal minister Nitin Gadkari fainted while addressing a campaign rally in the western state of Maharashtra, later explaining that the crowded venue and high temperature had made him feel uneasy. Days before that, in the eastern city of Kolkata where temperatures soared above 43C, a television anchor passed out while presenting weather updates. She later said that the studio had become extremely hot as its cooling systems had failed.\nAnd there is no respite in sight - India's weather department has predicted longer and more intense heatwaves in May.\nElection authorities are taking steps to address this by supplying drinking water in polling booths and extending voting timings. \nBut some experts have speculated that the extreme temperatures may be impacting voter turnout. \nIn an interview last week with India Today news channel, N Gopalaswami, a former chief election commissioner, said that the heat \"may have had a role\" to play in lower voter numbers this year. Compared with the 2019 election, the first two phases of polling held on 19 April and 26 April saw at least a 3% dip each in voter turnout. \nMr Gopalaswami also suggested that a tweak to polling schedules in the long term - holding elections between the cooler months of February and March - might encourage more people to vote.\nPolitical parties, too, have been tweaking their campaign schedules this year due to the heat. Last week, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker Rajeshwar Singh told local media that party workers were visiting voters' homes only in the mornings and evenings, while afternoon meetings were being held indoors.\nDr Amit P Gawnde, a pulmonologist, says that spending long hours in the heat can lead to an electrolyte imbalance, which in turn can cause fatigue, dizziness and blackouts.\n\"Patients with comorbidities, like heart ailments or high blood pressure, face a higher risk of experiencing heat-related problems,\" he says.\nVoters say they are apprehensive about the heat but will take precautions.\nSukhada Khandge, who lives in Pune district in Maharashtra state, says that she will cover her face and body when she steps out to vote on Tuesday. \nPune is one of the hottest regions in Maharashtra, which will vote in two more phases on 13 and 20 May. For the past week, Pune has been experiencing temperatures between 39C and 42C and weather officials say this is likely to continue in the coming days.\nMs Khandge says she will vote early in the morning to avoid crowds and the heat.\nIn the western state of Gujarat - where polling will be held in 26 constituencies on Tuesday - Dipakumar Hasmukhbhai Patel says he aims to travel to his polling booth in Surat city on his motorbike in the morning.\n\"Towards the afternoon, it gets so hot that you have to travel by car,\" he says, adding that he is aware that one can get a heatstroke or suffer from dehydration if not careful.\nDeepika Jigar Tumdawala, 31, who is also from Surat, says that she finds voting during this time of the year uncomfortable, especially since she lives in an industrial area and the fumes from factories add to the heat.\n\"But voting is my democratic right so I'll brave the heat and go and vote,\" she adds.\nApprehension about the heat are likely to persist among voters in the coming weeks as well.\nIn the southern state of Telangana, which is set to vote on 13 May in the fourth phase, the scorching heat has already become a topic of conversation.\nPratibha, 40, who uses only one name, told BBC Telugu that she suffered a heatstroke just days ago and was experiencing severe headaches.\n\"It is difficult to come out to vote in these temperatures. It is going to be challenging to take elderly people to the polling stations. Polling should start earlier for them,\" she said, adding that she plans to take her 70-year-old mother to vote early in the morning. \nFor the first time this year, the Election Commission - which oversees elections in the country - has allowed people older than 85 years and those with disabilities to vote from their homes. The commission also issued guidelines in March to minimise the impact of heat on the elections.\nIt instructed electoral off",

    "The US has opened a new inquiry into troubled jet firm Boeing, after the company told air safety regulators that it might not have properly inspected its 787 Dreamliner planes. \nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it would look into whether staff had falsified records.\nIt said Boeing was re-inspecting all 787 jets on the manufacturing line.\nBoeing will be forced to develop an \"action plan\" to address concerns about planes already in service, it added. \nBoeing did not comment.\nInternally, the company told staff last week that the \"misconduct\" had not created an \"immediate safety of flight issue\", according to a message seen by BBC News.\n\"We quickly reviewed the matter and learned that several people had been violating company policies by not performing a required test, but recording the work as having been completed,\" Scott Stocker, head of the Boeing 787 program, said in the email to staff.\nThe FAA said that Boeing had come forward \"voluntarily\" last month to warn that it \"may not have completed\" inspections required to confirm adequate electrical safeguards where the wings join the main body of certain of its 787 Dreamliners, a large jet often used on international flights.\n\"The FAA is investigating whether Boeing completed the inspections and whether company employees may have falsified aircraft records,\" it said.\n\"As the investigation continues, the FAA will take any necessary action - as always - to ensure the safety of the flying public.\" \nIt is the latest problem to erupt at Boeing in recent years. In January, an unused emergency exit door blew off a new 737 Max 9 plane shortly after take-off, thrusting its manufacturing and safety processes into the spotlight.\nThe incident prompted the temporary grounding of dozens of planes and has forced the firm to drastically slow production, while sparking increased regulatory oversight, criminal investigation and other legal and financial troubles.\nIn March, chief executive Dave Calhoun said he would be stepping down by the end of the year, becoming the most high-profile person to exit the company in the wake of the incident.  \nBoeing's reputation had been damaged a few years ago, when two of its 737 Max planes crashed within five months of each other, claiming the lives of 346 passengers and crew. A 737 Max flown by Ethiopian Airlines aircraft crashed shortly after take-off in March, 2019, following a Lion Air crash in October 2018. That led to the then chief executive Dennis Muilenburg being fired. \nLast month, Congress hosted a hearing featuring whistleblowers, including Sam Salehpour who testified that his concerns about the 787 had been dismissed. \nBoeing has said it is working to reform its corporate culture to encourage people who see problems to speak out, with a \"more than 500% increase\" in reports from employees since January.",
    "The untold story of Sir Christopher Lee is set to be revealed in an upcoming documentary film. \nThe Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee features interviews with friends, family members and famous directors.\nJon Spira, from Headington, Oxford, had access to Lee's scrapbooks and 100 interviews from the British Film Institute's library.\nThe filmmaker tells the BBC the actor's life was an \"incredible story\" waiting to be told.\nLee starred in more than 250 films across eight decades, including the Hammer Horror, James Bond, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars franchises.\nBut as Spira's film explains, he had a military career during World War Two still shrouded in mystery, and helped track down Nazi war criminals.\n\"Because he could speak fluently a range of different languages he got pulled into the secret service doing missions of which the facts have never fully come out,\" Spira explains. \n\"His cousin was Ian Fleming and a lot of people think the character of James Bond was based on him.\n\"He certainly didn't do anything to disavow people of that.\n\"You could almost do this as two films. That's why we called it The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee, because his life is one story and his career is another.\" \nOn-screen he worked with esteemed directors such as Powell and Pressburger, Orson Welles, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and Tim Burton.\nThe documentary features interviews with three more - John Landis, Joe Dante, and Peter Jackson - as well as actress Harriet Walter, who is also Lee's niece.\n\"Peter Jackson was very prepared to talk about the emotional side,\" Spira recalls.\n\"About how amazed he was as a film fan, in awe of Christopher Lee, and couldn't believe he got to work with him. He discovered his unique insecurities, like many actors have.\n\"He was a really complex person who was very emotional, and had this austere image. He had a lot of frustrations in his life - we explore that.\"\nThe documentary also takes some flights of fantasy. \nIt is narrated by a string puppet of Christopher Lee made by the team behind Wes Anderson's animated movies, and voiced by Peter Serafinowicz.\nA stop-motion sequence is directed by Sandman illustrator Dave McKean.\nSpira is crowdfunding for its Blu-ray release because he believes less effort has been made with physical media of late.\nHe said: \"There's a whole market of people who are being forgotten that really love film, want to own it, and maybe don't trust that these things will always be streaming.\"\nHe has launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise \u00a340,000 \"to do something really special\" for collectors.\nLee named The Wicker Man and Jinnah as among the best films he was in, but when Spira is asked, he opts for cult 1983 Australian musical The Return of Captain Invincible.\n\"If you do one wonderful thing with your day, I suggest you watch Christopher Lee sing Name Your Poison,\" he says.\n\"He wanted to be an opera singer all his life\u2026.

    "The tight-knit and peaceful surfing community in the Mexican port of Ensenada is in shock.\nThree foreign surfers - two Australian brothers, Callum and Jake Robinson, and their American friend, Jack Carter Rhoad - had been in the town just a few days earlier, enjoying some of the finest surfing spots in North America at the start of what was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime.\nNow, their bodies are being repatriated to their families after they were brutally murdered at a camping site.\nThey were planning to take a well-worn route, setting out from Ensenada, surfing and camping along the Pacific coast, and arriving in Rosarito further north. Unfortunately, they never made it to their accommodation.\nInstead, several days later, their bodies were found down a well several kilometres from the camping site, their burnt-out pick-up truck found nearby. Each man had been killed by a gunshot to the head, the authorities said, sending a chill through the local surfing community.\nThe implications of the violence are still reverberating through the quiet beach-town.\n\"It's difficult. In truth, I've always felt safe here,\" said Jessica, an American from San Diego now living near Ensenada, her wetsuit still dripping from a morning surf.\nAt various times in its 500-year history, Ensenada has teemed with visitors from the United States. During the years of Prohibition in the early 20th Century, the city's economy received a particular boost from Americans coming south in search of legal liquor.  \nToday, it's the third biggest city in the state with both a booming tourist industry and a thriving ex-pat community. Thousands of foreigners - from silver-haired retirees to digital nomads - have settled in the city to enjoy its beachfront properties, warm climate and relaxed atmosphere amid the rising cost of living in the US.\nAnd, of course, it attracts huge numbers of surfers every year. \nThe region of the Bay of All Saints (Bahia de Todos Santos in Spanish) as a whole is a surfer's paradise. Spots like San Miguel Beach and Todos Santos Island are renowned among the surfing community with a major competition, the Billabong XXL, having been held in the latter.\nSo, the chances are that the three murdered men had little or no trepidation about embarking on their trip. And few among their fellow-surfers will have necessarily warned them against it beyond urging them to be careful.\nJessica, the American from San Diego, said that she had come to the beach town to surf with her husband. They run programmes for young people in the \"really cool, really friendly\" local surfing community.\n\"Obviously, we take precautions and investigate carefully where we're going before we go. But it's so beautiful here and the people here are so kind, we intend to surf the whole coast while we live here,\" she said.\nSome Mexican surfers put the murders into the context of the region's constant violence.\nWhile the young men never expected to meet such a grisly fate simply by pursuing the thing they loved, their murders are a stark reminder of the degree of criminality in Mexico's northern states.\n\"This is the struggle, and it is important that it's not a silent one. We have to continue to draw attention to these problems, continue to protest and march, keep raising our voices and call for an end to the impunity,\" Paulina Rodriguez, a surfer and resident of Ensenada, told the BBC.\nPowerful drug cartels are engaged in a territorial war over \"plazas\" - the drug-smuggling and people-trafficking routes north, with illegal guns also being moved southwards. It is all a multi-billion industry for the cartels which operate along the border, and foreigners have run afoul of organised crime in Mexico on numerous occasions.\nFrancisca Acosta, a younger Mexican surfer, echoed the concern that impunity for violent crime is rife in Mexico.\n\"(The killings) speak to a greater problem in Baja California and across Mexico,\" she said with a sigh. \"There's a huge problem with impunity. The disappearances and violent crimes are getting ever closer to home.\"\nThe country's poorest are the most vulnerable, she said.\n\"If this can happen to tourists, it can happen to anyone,\" she added. \"As organised crime is on the rise in society, you can feel the fear on the streets.\"\nThere has been some swift action by local authorities after the surfers' deaths. \nThree people have been arrested in connection with their murders, including a woman who was in possession of one of the men's mobile phones.\nThe working theory of the state authorities in Baja California is that the detainees had tried to steal the group's vehicle, possibly for its tyres. But, on meeting resistance, the attackers killed them before burning their tents and trying to hide the bodies.\nThe state attorney general, Maria Elena Andrade Ramirez, said that her office would carry out an exhaustive investigation of \"these unfortunate events until those responsible feel the full weight of the law\".\nIn some respects, the violent e",

The remaining four candidates had less than 10% of the votes. \nMr Mulino is thought to have been propelled to victory by voters who hope the country will return to the economic boom it experienced when Ricardo Martinelli was president from 2009 to 2014. \nAs his lead in the vote count became unassailable on Sunday, Mr Mulino told his cheering supporters: \"Mission accomplished, Ricardo\".\nBut he also sought to set himself apart from Martinelli, saying that he is \"no-one's puppet\" and that he would use the popular mandate he had been given to \"work hard, very hard for Panama\".\nHowever, after casting his vote on election day, Mr Mulino visited Ricardo Martinelli in the Nicaraguan embassy, where the latter has sought asylum to avoid arrest after he lost his appeal against his money laundering conviction.\nDuring his brief campaign, Mr Mulino raised eyebrows promising to \"close\" the Dari\u00e9n Gap, the expanse of jungle on the Panamanian-Colombian border which more than half a million migrants crossed by foot on their way to the United States last year.\nMr Mulino will now not only face the challenge of how to make good on that promise but also of tackling a drought which has hampered the operation of the Panama Canal.\nRead: Can the Panama Canal save itself?\nThe pro-business election winner has said he will attract investment but also nodded to some of the concerns many voters raised, including access to drinking water and rising crime rates.\nHe will take over from the outgoing president Laurentino Cotizo on 1 July.

    "High visitor numbers are turning one of Britain's most scenic lakes green, researchers say.\nA report funded by the UK space agency suggests a link between peak tourist periods and algal blooming at Windermere in the Lake District.\nAlgal blooming is caused by warm temperatures and nutrients, and can make the water green and toxic.\nCampaigners are linking the blooms to discharges of sewage, which although mostly treated, are nutrient-rich. \nUnited Utilities, the local water company, insists its wastewater plants can cope with peak tourist periods. \nWindermere is England's largest lake and one of the country's most popular natural attractions. \nBut in recent years, the normally clear water has been turning green due to algal blooming, particularly during the summer. Blooming is the rapid growth of algae and can lead to reduced oxygen levels in the water, killing fish and aquatic life. \nRichard Flemmings from the environmental data company Map Impact, has been trying to work out why. He wanted to study whether the blooms are just the inevitable consequence of climate change and hotter, drier summers, or whether human discharges are also playing a role. \nBoth treated and untreated sewage discharges contain heightened levels of the key blooming nutrient phosphorus, from both human excrement and detergents.  \n\"There is a significant correlation between visitor numbers and chlorophyll content,\" Mr Flemmings says. \nChlorophyll is the compound present in plants that gives them their green colour and so an indicator of algal concentration. With funding from the UK space agency, Map Impact used infrared analysis of satellite images to measure chlorophyll levels over the last five years in Lake Windermere.\nWhat makes Map Impact's work interesting is that it combined the chlorophyll analysis with mobile phone data.  \nThis allowed it to estimate the number of people in the Windermere catchment area at any given time. This can vary widely from just 40,000 to 50,000 people when it's just residents, or up to 300,000 when you add tourists on a busy summer weekend.\n\"So what you see is typically you get a high spike in the number of people and then three to five days later you get a spike in chlorophyll in the lake,\" said Mr Flemmings. \nHeat is one of the main drivers of algal blooming and though hot summer days are also likely to boost visitor numbers, Mr Flemmings says it has been possible to separate out the two factors.\n\"What we know is that algal blooms are in part caused by an increase in nutrients in the water and one of the contributors to nutrients is phosphorus which can come from human waste,\" he says. \nThe Environment Agency has done research suggesting that more than half of the phosphorus in Windermere comes from sewage. That includes sewage from overflows, United Utilities works, private sewage treatment facilities and septic tanks. \nIn November 2023, just 3% of the water samples collected from the lake's shoreline met minimum standards under UK legislation.\nMatt Staniek from the Save Windermere campaign, says treated sewage from places like the Langdale Wastewater Treatment Plant are part of the problem. It has a permit to emit more than 1m litres a day of treated effluent into the River Brathay, which feeds into Windermere. There are other similar outflows around the catchment area, and while the wastewater treatment plants can remove some of the phosphorus, some of it is also flows out into the river. \n\"In the press there's a lot about untreated sewage,\" Mr Staniek says. \"But in relation to Windermere and the ecological damage that's being inflicted upon our lake, the treated sewage is as much of a problem,\" he said.\nMr Staniek believes that when there are higher numbers of visitors, more treated sewage contributes to the algal blooming. He wants to see all sewage discharges diverted away from the Lake. \n\"Studies from all over the world demonstrate the exact same issues we're facing with Windermere,\" he said.  \"There is one solution that protects the lake forever, and that is to stop putting sewage in it.\"\nUnited Utilities, the local water company, has carried out a feasibility study for what it calls a \"discharge free\" solution. But the miles of new sewage network that would be needed come with a hefty price tag. \nThe company denied its treated effluent might be behind the blooming. \n\"Our wastewater treatment works are sized to treat the sewage from maximum population numbers at peak times, and use the highest treatment standards including phosphorus removal and UV treatment to kill bacteria,\" a United Utilities spokesperson said. \nSo what's going to give? \nBarney Cunliffe runs the Michelin starred Gilpin Hotel near the lake and has joined with others in the hospitality industry to raise money for the Save Windermere campaign. \nMr Cunliffe says he's worried that if nothing changes there might be what he calls \"a catastrophic event\" on the horizon - a massive algal bloom that effectively kills the lake and dea",
    "A group of women are warning others to do background checks on partners met through dating apps after loans worth thousands of pounds were taken out in their names by the same conman. \nPeter Gray, 35, who met the women on Tinder, was jailed after defrauding four women out of about \u00a380,000.\nOne victim said Gray, from West Yorkshire, \"totally ruined my life\" and left her with significant trust issues.\nTinder said it had \"implemented various ways to warn users of potential scams\".\nGray, of Mirfield, was sentenced to 56 months in prison in February and given restraining orders in relation to the victims. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Clare McDonnell, Jessica - not her real name - described how she met Gray on the app in 2018 after coming out of a six-year relationship.\nAlthough he wasn't her usual type, he was \"a good listener and everything I needed at the time\", she recalled.\nOn their third date, Jessica was at his apartment and got up to use the bathroom.\n\"I left my bag on his dining table, he went in my bag and took pictures of my driving licence and both my bank cards,\" she said.  \nShe later discovered loans up to the value of \u00a39,000 were taken out in her name.\nDespite Gray offering to pay back the money over time, Jessica went to the police.\n\"I didn't want to be tied to this guy for five years because I barely even knew him,\" she said.  \nHannah, another woman who met Gray on Tinder, described him as being initially \"calming and reassuring,\" but something \"didn't sit right\".\nA week later, after Hannah decided to call the relationship off, she received an acceptance letter for a loan of \u00a320,000 in her name.  \nThe pair rekindled their relationship a few months later after Gray showered her with gifts and declarations of love, however she later ended it once again. \n\"I think the alarm bells and red flags were just waving high,\" she said. \nSources: Action Fraud/Victim Support/Stop Scams UK\nAcross all of the relationships, Gray developed close connections that would help him commit offences for his own personal financial gain.   \nWhen Hannah found out she was pregnant, her sister looked into Gray's past and tracked down one of his ex-partners, who warned her of his hidden past.\n\"There's no way that I'm going to let a child be brought up anywhere near such a vile human,\" Hannah said. \n\"My world had just literally broken apart in front of my eyes in that half an hour conversation.\" \nGray repeated the pattern once again when he matched with Elizabeth - not\u00a0her\u00a0real name - in 2020.\nHe sent flowers to her home, despite Elizabeth never revealing where she lived.  \nElizabeth said: \"Red flags popped up, but I just kept thinking, stop being silly, you need to be going for a guy that treats you nice.\" \nTwo days before moving into her new house, Elizabeth's mortgage was pulled after Gray used her driving licence to secure a loan of about \u00a310,000 in her name. \nJessica said Gray's actions had \"totally ruined my life\" and said she's stopped taking ID and bank cards out on dates.\n\"I don't trust anybody I meet,\" she said. \nElizabeth said: \"You're constantly thinking, is this person who they say they are or are they not?\"   \nTwo of the women individually used the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme, also known as Clare's Law, which gives people the right to ask police for a background check on their partner.\nIn a statement, Tinder said it \"acts to help prevent and warn users of potential scams or fraud by using AI tools to detect words and phrases and proactively intervene\".  \n\"We have implemented various ways to warn users of potential scams or fraud, from in-app features to pop-up messages and education,\" a spokesperson said.  \n\"All users can request that their match be photo-verified prior to messaging.

    "The personal information of an unknown number of serving UK military personnel has been accessed in a significant data breach, the BBC understands.\nThe hack targeted a payroll system used by the Ministry of Defence, which includes names and bank details of both current and some past armed forces members.\nIn a very small number of cases, the data may include personal addresses.\nIt is unknown who is behind the hack or what the data may be used for.\nThe data, described as \"personal HMRC-style information\", relates to current and former members of the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force over a period of several years. \nThe system was managed by an external contractor and no operational MoD data has been obtained.\nIt is understood the MoD has taken immediate action and the system has been taken off-line, while investigations are under way.\nThe MoD is in the process of notifying and providing support and advice to those affected, including making veterans' organisations aware of what has happened.\nDefence Secretary Grant Shapps is due to update MPs about the hack in the Commons on Tuesday.\nHe is expected to set out a \"multi-point plan\" in response, which will include action to protect affected service men and women.\nWhile it has not been disclosed who is behind this hack, it comes amid increased warnings about cyber-security threats facing the UK from hostile states and third parties. \nLast year, the government published an updated version of its long-term defence strategy which said the use of \"commercial spyware, ransomware and offensive cyber capabilities by state and non-state actors has proliferated\".\nIn March, the government publicly accused China of being behind an August 2021 hack targeting the details of millions of voters held by the Electoral Commission. \nIn December 2023, the National Cyber Security Centre said Russian intelligence was behind a \"malicious cyber activity attempting to interfere in UK politics and democratic processes\".\nPublic institutions and private firms have also been targeted by hackers demanding ransoms. \nThe Metropolitan Police said it is not involved in any investigation at this stage.",
    "Seven people have been killed and at least 35 injured in an air attack on Russia's Belgorod region, on the border with Ukraine.\nRegional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov blamed Ukrainian forces for the strike near the village of Beryozovka, which he said was carried out with drones and hit minibuses transporting workers to a meat production facility, as well as a private car. \nMr Gladkov said several other locations in Belgorod region had also come under attack in the last 24 hours, with residential buildings damaged.\nThe Belgorod region has often been targeted by Ukrainian forces since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. \nHours later, Mr Gladkov reported another fatal attack, this time in the village of Nikolskoye. At least one person was killed when an outdoor cooking area was struck, he said.\nThe deadliest strike on the region so far occurred in December, when a drone and rocket attack killed 25 people and wounded another 100 in the city of Belgorod.\nIn March, Mr Gladkov said 9,000 children would be evacuated from the city and the wider region after shelling that authorities have blamed on Ukraine.\nMeanwhile, Russia has continued to target Ukraine's energy infrastructure, damaging a facility in the northern Sumy region - which borders Belgorod region - in an overnight bombardment.\nUkraine's energy ministry said the attack had left more than 400,000 people without power.\nPower was partially restored by morning, local authorities said. \nAccording to the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Russia is massing troops in the regions of Belgorod, Kursk and Bryansk in preparation for an offensive operation against northeastern Ukraine and the city of Kharkiv. \nCiting a Ukrainian military observer, the ISW said that the Russian military has gathered roughly 50,000 personnel. Ukrainian officials have long warned that Russia is gearing up to launch an attack to seize Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. \nOn Monday, the Russian Ministry of Defence said it had started preparations for missile drills simulating the use of non-strategic nuclear weapons.\nTactical nuclear weapons are small nuclear warheads and delivery systems intended for use on the battlefield, or for a limited strike.\nTASS news agency reported that the drills, ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin, were expected to take place \"in the near future\" and would involve missile formations as well as air and naval forces.\nThe decision to hold the drills was taken in response to \"provocative statements and threats by certain Western officials against the Russian Federation\", the ministry added.\nAlthough it did not name the officials, Russia has repeatedly criticised remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron about possible intervention by Nato troops in Ukraine. \nRussia also reacted angrily to comments last week by the UK Foreign Secretary, David Cameron, who said that Ukraine can use British weapons for strikes within Russia.",
    "We perhaps should not be surprised that the prime minister has seized upon an extrapolation of Thursday's local election results that pointed to the prospect that the general election could result in a hung parliament in which Labour would be the largest party. \nSuch a scenario, he argued, would mean that Sir Keir Starmer would be \"propped up in Downing Street\" by the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens.\nMany Conservative MPs (and indeed Labour ones too) believe that a poster their party ran in the 2015 election, when the polls were pointing to a hung parliament, showing the then Labour leader, Ed Miliband, in the pocket of the former SNP leader, Alex Salmond, played a key role in delivering the Conservatives a surprise overall majority.\nWhether or not that is what happened is not easy for analysts to say. However, British Election Study data collected at the time did not show any marked swing away from Labour among those who came to believe that Mr Miliband would be willing to do a deal with the SNP.\nBut, in any event, how realistic is it to use the share of the vote won by the parties in local elections to anticipate what might happen in an immediate general election? There are certainly two potential difficulties.\nAlthough the ups and downs in party performance in local elections often run in parallel with the rises and falls in party support in the polls, some people (around one in five) vote differently in local elections than they would in a general election. \nAs a result the divergence between the level of support parties win in a local election and how well they would perform in a general election has become more marked.\nNowadays the Liberal Democrats consistently outperform their national standing in the local ballot boxes. The same has also come to be true of the Greens, while independent candidates have also enjoyed some notable success in recent years. Labour, in contrast, often do less well in local elections.\nMeanwhile, the party political battle in Scotland is now very different from that in England - and the outcome of the current battle north of the border between Labour and the SNP could be crucial to the result of the next election. English local elections do not tell us much about what will happen north of the border.\nThese developments have made discerning the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election more difficult. \nAt the same time, there are two particular features of the results of this year's local elections that make it especially difficult.\nFirst, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have now switched to Reform than to Labour. But Reform were only on the ballot paper in one in six council wards. So, it may well be the case that people who would vote Reform if there had been a Reform candidate locally stuck with the Tories instead.\nCertainly, Conservative support fell more heavily where Reform did stand. In the BBC's sample of key wards the party's support fell by 19 points in these wards - compared with 11 points in wards where Reform did not stand. Labour, in contrast, did rather better where Reform stood.\nThat 19-point drop matches the 19-point fall in the average level of Conservative support in the polls since May 2021. That figure may represent a better guide to the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election.\nSecond, the local election results confirm the message from last year's contests that the geography of party support has changed to the Conservatives' disadvantage.\nThe party's support fell more heavily in wards it was trying to defend. \nAt the same time, some voters seemingly voted for whichever party was best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. Labour's support increased most (at the expense of the Liberal Democrats) in wards where they started off second to the Conservatives, while the Liberal Democrats advanced most (and Labour did less well) in wards where were the principal challengers locally.\nIndeed, it is these two patterns that help explain why the Conservative Party lost nearly one in two of the council seats it was trying to defend. Conservative MPs would be unwise to assume that the same fate could not also befall them.\nSir John Curtice is Professor of Politics, University of Strathclyde, and Senior Fellow, National Centre for Social Research and 'The UK in a Changing Europe'.

    "Victor Farrant, a rapist who was serving a whole-life sentence after murdering his former girlfriend, has died in prison.\nThe Prison Service said Farrant, 74, died at HMP Wakefield on Friday.\nThe children of victim Glenda Hoskins said his death had ended an \"agonising two months\" since they heard he was being considered for early release.\nThey added that everyone should \"feel safer that this repeat offender psychopath will not strike again\".\nFarrant had been suffering from a longstanding health condition prior to his death and a coroner will now look into the cause of his death. \nHe was convicted of the murder of Mrs Hoskins, 44, his former girlfriend and mother-of-three, and the attempted murder of Ann Fidler, 45, in 1996.\nSentencing him to life, Mr Justice Butterfield, sitting at Winchester Crown Court in 1998, said Farrant was so dangerous that he should \"never be released\".\nIn a joint statement on Monday, Mrs Hoskins' children, Iain, Katie and David, said: \"Farrant's whole-life sentence and the judge's remarks that he should die in prison should have been respected.\n\"However, Farrant's death, like his imprisonment, changes nothing for us. The circumstances and death of our mother, Glenda Hoskins, will haunt us for the rest of our lives.\n\"His death, though, does bring to a close a very painful chapter for us all.\n\"We, and the public at large, should certainly feel safer that this repeat-offender psychopath will not strike again.\"\nEarlier this year, Mrs Hoskins' family said they had been contacted by officials who said Farrant was being considered for compassionate leave as he had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and could have months to live.\nA Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (Mappa) meeting in April looked at the case and the family said it had been passed to the prison governor to decide whether to make a formal application for his release.\nFarrant was jailed in November 1988 for 12 years for rape and other offences, but just weeks after he was released on 7 November 1995, he beat Ms Fidler at her home in Eastleigh, Hampshire.\nSix weeks later, he murdered accountant Mrs Hoskins at her luxury waterside home in Portsmouth by pushing her under the water in the bath.\nHe left her body in the attic, where it was found by her 15-year-old daughter Katie.\nAfter killing Mrs Hoskins, Farrant went on the run and was eventually found in the south of France.\nA Prison Service spokesman said: \"Victor Farrant died on 3 May at HMP Wakefield.\n\"As with all deaths in custody, the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman has been informed.\" \nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "A mother-of-two who has waited 11 years for a kidney transplant said a new medical pilot had given her hope. \nThe average wait for a new kidney is 16 months, but Gemma Louis has waited for years because the chances of her body rejecting a new organ are high.\nThe 44-year-old, from Chester-le-Street, has to endure 12 hours of dialysis a week and said the life-saving procedure was like \"having a second job\".\nThe new programme means kidney patients who usually need transfusions before and after a transplant could get blood better matched to their tissue type to reduce the risk of organ rejection. \nMs Louis, a civil servant, has chronic kidney disease and needs four hours of dialysis three evenings a week.\nThe mother-of-two said her condition had impacted her quality of life. \n\"It's like having a part-time job - two jobs,\" she said.\n\"I go to work on a daytime and on a night I go to dialysis, which if you include travel and being on the machine, it's six hours an evening.\"\nMs Louis said the condition had restricted her love of travel and that trips had to be planned around where dialysis was available. \n\"I can't ever do anything spur of the moment. Nothing's ever last minute.\"\nOn a weekend trip to Marbella, Ms Louis carried out peritoneal dialysis, a procedure involving a tube through the abdomen, to filter the blood. \nTo have her treatment, she had to take a suitcase full of fluids and equipment.\nThe pilot scheme at London's Hammersmith Hospital sees scientists making sure blood for kidney transplant patient transfusions is better matched, not just to their blood type, but also their tissue type.\nThe closer match reduces the chances of patients producing antibodies which can \"attack\" new organs. \nClinical scientist, Ruth Chisman, is the deputy head of the NHS Blood and Transplant Centre in Newcastle, which organ matches for the region.\nShe said she was hopeful the programme, which would need to attract thousands of new blood donors, would be rolled out to the North East and Cumbria.\n\"We have 300 patients in our region waiting for kidney transplants and a handful of them, 10 to 15, have waited as long as Gemma, 10 years or more, which means attending hospital for dialysis,\" she said.\n\"This can be multiple times a week which is a very restrictive lifestyle.\n\"It's much better and healthier for the patients and the NHS if we can get them transplanted.\"\nAll adults in England are now considered to have agreed to be an organ donor when they die, unless they have expressly opted out. \nHowever, their loved ones can overturn this wish. \nLynn Robson, specialist nurse in organ donation based at the Newcastle centre,  said it was important that registered donors had a conversation with their next of kin so they were clear on what they wanted to happen after their death.\n\"Donors need to have the conversation with their loved ones so they are certain of their wishes,\" she said.\n\"It is a time of immense sadness losing a loved one, but many families take great comfort and feel pride knowing that they have helped save lives.\"\nMs Louis said it would be \"great\" to get her life back.\n \"I've a huge bucket list.

This process is repeated until there are only two candidates left.\nAt this point, Mr Swinney only has to win more votes than his last opponent.\nThe SNP has 63 seats in the parliament - which is short of a majority. \nHowever, Mr Swinney is still expected to win the nomination with Green MSPs likely to either back him or abstain. \nHolyrood's presiding officer recommends to the King that the winner is appointed as first minister.\nA swearing-in ceremony at the Court of Session in Edinburgh could take place as early as Wednesday.\nMr Yousaf's premiership imploded last week after he ripped up the government's power-sharing Bute House Agreement with the Scottish Greens. \nThat left the SNP administration with a minority in parliament. \nFacing motions of no confidence in him and his government, Mr Yousaf confirmed he was standing down last Monday.\nIn his resignation speech, he said he had \u201cclearly underestimated\u201d the hurt he had caused the Greens by ending the agreement.\nMr Yousaf congratulated Mr Swinney and urged the SNP to come together to back its new leader.\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s now important, more than ever, that we unite so we can take our message of independence to every single doorstep in Scotland.\u201d\nIn response the leadership confirmation, Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross told BBC Scotland News: \u201cJohn Swinney\u2019s own campaign slogan was uniting for independence.

    "Former US President Donald Trump has been held in contempt of court for violating a gag order for the 10th time in his hush-money trial in New York.\nJustice Juan Merchan issued his most serious warning yet to Mr Trump, saying further violations could mean jail.\n\"At the end of the day, I have a job to do and that job is to protect the dignity of the judicial system,\" the judge said.\nThis is the second gag order ruling of the trial. \nEarlier in the hush-money proceedings, Judge Merchan sided with the prosecution and fined Mr Trump $1,000 (\u00a3796) each for nine violations.\nMr Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a payment to a porn actress to hide an alleged sexual encounter. He has denied all wrongdoing.\nOn Monday, the third week of testimony in the first-ever criminal trial of a former president, Justice Merchan said it appeared the $9,000 gag-order fine from the previous infractions had not served as a deterrent. \n\"Therefore going forward this court will have to consider a jail sanction,\" he said.  \"It is important that you understand that the last thing I want to do is put you in jail.\"\nProsecutors said last week they were \"not yet seeking jail\" for Mr Trump's alleged gag order violations.\nJustice Merchan acknowledged that incarcerating Mr Trump would be very disruptive to the proceedings. But he called the gag order violations \"a direct attack on the rule of law\" that he cannot abide.\nSitting with a stern expression at the defence table, Mr Trump showed little reaction to the threat of jail.\nAfter court adjourned for the day, Mr Trump called the gag order \"disgraceful\" and seemed defiant in the face of the warning. \"Our Constitution is much more important than jail. It's not even close. I'll do that sacrifice any day,'' he said later outside the courtroom.\nProsecutors argued last week that Mr Trump's social media posts, where he suggested the jury is unfair because the area is \"95% Democrat\", violated the order. \nThe former president, a Republican, has repeatedly argued he cannot get a fair trial in overwhelmingly Democratic Manhattan.\nBBC News reporters are in the Manhattan courtroom covering the historic first criminal trial of a former US president. You'll find their updates and analysis on the BBC news website and app, and across TV, radio and podcasts.\nIn Justice Merchan's written ruling, he said Mr Trump was held in contempt because he made public statements about the jury and how it was selected.\nHe wrote: \"In doing so, the defendant not only called into question the integrity, and therefore the legitimacy of these proceedings, but again raised the specter of fear for the safety of the jurors and of their loved ones.\"\nJustice Merchan added: \"Defendant is hereby put on notice that if appropriate and warranted, future violations of its lawful orders will be punishable by incarceration.\"\nIn addition to the threat of jail time, Mr Trump was ordered to pay a $1,000 fine by the end of the day on Friday. He also has to take down the offending social media post by 14:15 ET (18:15 GMT) on Monday.\nDefence lawyer Todd Blanche had defended Mr Trump, arguing last Thursday that the gag order was unfair.\n\"Everybody can say whatever they want\" about the trial, except for his client, Mr Blanche said.\n\"They're not defendants in this case,\" Justice Merchan responded. \"They're not subjected to the gag order.\"\nHe pointed out that Mr Trump is allowed to speak. However, as a defendant \"there are some things you can't talk about\", added the judge.\nMr Blanche said Mr Trump should be able to respond to digs about the trial from President Joe Biden, his Democratic opponent in November's White House election.  \nThe judge countered that there was nothing in the gag order that would prevent Mr Trump from doing so.\nIf Mr Trump spent time in jail, it would be a historic first for a former US president, and it could pose quite a security problem. \nFormer presidents are entitled to lifelong Secret Service protection. In a statement, the Secret Service said Monday it provides protections \"for all settings around the world\" using complex and high-tech methods, but would not comment on any specific operations.  \nThe New York Department of Corrections told the BBC it would find \"appropriate housing\" for Mr Trump if necessary, but keeping him safe in jail would be a complex issue for New York officials. \nJustin Paperny, director of the prison consulting firm White Collar Advice, said Mr Trump's presence would be expensive and pose a \"massive\" security risk, meaning a warden would likely hold the former president in solitary confinement. \n\"Then there's the risk of: do you isolate a 78-year-old man in segregation, and risk all that accompanies putting a first-time nonviolent offender in the hole?\" he said. \"It would be a total nightmare.\"\nThe rest of the testimony in court - while lacking many bombshell moments on the stand - took jurors through several documents that prosecutors consider cruci",
    "Former prison inmates said their lives were \"transformed\" by a new project which offered them a job after release.\nHMP Highpoint near Haverhill, Suffolk, in partnership with City and Guilds, launched the programme to teach inmates how to maintain railway infrastructure back in August 2022. \nOnce inmates are released, they then have a job lined up working in the industry that hopefully deters them from re-offending.  \nRyan Hull and Othman, former inmates, said the programme has given them a sense of relief. \nMr Hull, 31, initially didn't apply for the programme after thinking he wouldn't be accepted.\n\"It was quite a nice feeling because it guaranteed me a job,\" he explained.\n\"There was the anxiety of going to go back to the same lifestyle [once out of prison]\n\"When you live a certain lifestyle for so long it's hard to break the cycle.\n\"It offered me a different route away from that.\"\nMr Hull has already had great success in his employment.\nHe worked on the tracks for about six weeks before he was then promoted to a labour manager looking after 250 men.\n\"The railway has so much progression and so many different routes,\" Mr Hull added.\nLife is \"completely different\" he said from how it was before he went into prison.\n\"The money you earn is yours and you don't have to worry about a single thing because everything is above board and you are doing the right thing.\"\nOthman, 39, joined the programme in September 2022 just after it launched but experienced tough competition.\n\"It was very popular as it was new at the time,\" he said.\n\"I thought this was a step for me to go down the straight route and not come back to prison.\"\nOthman said he had \"a lot of anxiety\" about leaving prison but the course left him \"relieved\".\n\"I was able to meet employers and I studied the course, learnt the skills so upon release it was all up hill,\" he added. \nOthman now works on the Euston railway line and said life was \"peaceful\".\n\"It's the best thing ever, I wouldn't change it and I can't see myself ever going back to my old lifestyle,\" he said.\n\"The peace that you get when you know that you're doing right and my family is proud and happy for me.\" \nAlex Pond is the executive director of training at City and Guilds that offers vocational education and apprenticeships.\nMr Pond said City and Guilds had noticed a space in the rehabilitation industry that could improve the UK's skill shortage.\n\"At first it was quite difficult because there was no funding and the industry wasn't really engaged,\" he explained. \n\"But through breaking down doors and communication we quickly realised there was an appetite both in society and the industry.\"\nSince August 2022, 107 inmates have completed the programme and 87 of those are still in employment. \nMr Pond said the success in the rail industry has prompted them to consider other industries including construction and electrical.\n\"Three weeks ago I was coming out of a classroom in this very prison and a prisoner stopped me to say he had been in for 18 years,\" Mr Pond continued. \n\"He said this was the first time in 18 years that he had been given hope and he completed his course and he's now working on the railway.\n\"I am very proud.\"\nLisa Wheeler is the land-based activities manager at HMP Highpoint and the staff member who interviews the inmates for the programme.\nShe said when the inmates know they are getting employment on the outside \"they take it more seriously\".\n\"They know when getting out it is security for them,\" she said. \n\"It gives them a sense of pride - they're proud they've done the course, they're going out to work and they are providing for their family.\"\nMs Wheeler said the programme was so popular, inmates from other prisons have visited to take part. \n\"It's about someone believing in them and saying, actually, you can do this,\" she continued.\n\"A lot of the men at the end of the course say thank you, but I didn't do anything.\n\"I just gave them the tools to use and to better themselves and get a job.\"\nFollow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Trinity College Dublin (TCD) has met with student protesters and outlined a range of measures which it hopes will end an encampment on its campus.\nHowever, students have said they will continue their protest until all of their demands have been met.\nOn Friday, dozens of students erected tents, calling on the university to end all business and academic links to Israel due to the war in Gaza.\nIn a statement on Monday evening, TCD said it was in \"solidarity with the students in our horror at what is happening in Gaza\".\nThe university said it has \"initiated a process to divest from investments in companies that have activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and appear on the UN Blacklist\".\nTrinity is setting up a task force, including student representatives, it added, to discuss preserving academic freedom \"while understanding better how we engage - or not - with states that are in contravention of human rights\".\nThe university also condemned \"the ferocious and disproportionate onslaught in Gaza\" and welcomed the International Court of Justice's  interim ruling in South Africa's genocide case against Israel.\nThose involved in the protest called Monday's developments \"a partial victory\" but said they intend on continuing their encampment.\nIn a statement, BDS representatives confirmed they met with TCD to discuss their demands and \"negotiate future actions\".\nBDS stands for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, a non-violent movement that promotes cultural, academic and economic sanctions against Israel in protest at its treatment of Palestinians and Israeli-Arabs.\nOn the university's decision to divest from UN blacklisted companies, a BDS spokesperson said: \"While we appreciate these steps are being taken, we note there are more Israeli companies in the endowment fund as well as suppliers and exchanges that the university has ties to.\"\nThe group added: \"We cannot stop yet. This is the time to push Trinity College Dublin to divest from all Israeli companies in the endowment fund as well as suppliers and exchanges.\"\nThe students have also welcomed the university's decision to treat the encampment as an internal matter, rather than a police one.\nLast Thursday student newspaper Trinity News first reported that TCD students' union had been fined \u20ac214,000 (\u00a3183,000) over campus protests.\nThe demonstrations had focused on the university's response to the war in Gaza, as well as proposed course fee hikes and increased accommodation costs.\nTCD cited a loss of income as a result of recent protests at the Book of Kells tourist attraction, which is located on the university campus, but said it supported the right to protest.\nStudents' Union President L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moln\u00e1rfi told BBC News NI that TCD had \"essentially declared war\" and the student body intended to \"escalate\" its campaign.\nOn Friday night students set up an \"encampment for Palestine\" on the TCD campus.\nStudents also used benches to block access to the Book of Kells attraction.\nTCD said it did not support the \"unauthorised BDS encampment\".\nOn Saturday afternoon, the university said access to its campus has been restricted to students and staff with valid college ID cards.\nIt said it had done so to ensure that \"those protesting on campus are members of the college community\".\nLast week, Mr Moln\u00e1rfi said he believed the real reason why the students' union was being fined was because TCD authorities \"are terrified of the wave\" of anti-war protests across university campuses.\n\"Student movements in the US have been absolutely inspiring and we believe that we need to take further action,\" he added.\nPolice in the US have detained more than 2,000 people nationwide in the past fortnight at college rallies and protest camps.\nPro-Palestinian protesters have also disrupted US graduation ceremonies in recent days.\nDemonstrators, who have been calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza war, are also demanding academic institutions financially divest from Israel and companies that stand to make money from the conflict.\nStudents have also occupied UK campuses in protest against the conflict in Gaza with pro-Palestinian protesters in cities including London, Manchester, Newcastle and Leeds setting up tents outside university buildings.\nIsrael began bombing Gaza after Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 200 others.\nThe Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said more than 34,000 people had been killed in the Strip since 7 October.",
    "Russia has started preparations for missile drills near Ukraine simulating the use of tactical nuclear weapons in response to \"threats\" by Western officials.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said recent statements by French President Emmanuel Macron and the British Foreign Secretary David Cameron constituted a \"completely new round of escalation of tension\".\nLast week, Mr Macron refused to rule out potentially deploying French troops, should Kyiv request them, while Lord Cameron said that Ukraine had the right to use British weapons for strikes within Russia.\nOn Monday, Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that Lord Cameron's \"hostile outburst\" contradicted previous British assurances that the long-range missiles sent to Ukraine would not be used on Russian territory and meant that the UK was a \"party to the conflict\".\nThe ministry added that the response to Ukrainian strikes using British weapons on Russia could involve targeting any British military facilities and equipment on the territory of Ukraine and beyond.\nIt also said that Mr Macron's statement on possible deployment of French troops to Ukraine could be considered as \"readiness for direct confrontation with Russia\".\nBoth the British and the French ambassadors in Moscow were summoned on Monday.\nThe tactical nuclear weapons drills announced on Monday were ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to TASS news agency.\nThey were expected to take place \"in the near future\" and would involve missile formations as well as air and naval forces.\nTactical nuclear weapons are small nuclear warheads and delivery systems intended for use on the battlefield, or for a limited strike.\nThey are designed to destroy enemy targets in a specific area without causing widespread radioactive fallout.\nStrategic nuclear weapons, on the other hand, are large and designed to be fired at a long range - for example, between continents. Russia holds regular drills with strategic nuclear weapons.\nIn April, Belarus's long-time leader Alexander Lukashenko said \"several dozen\" tactical nuclear weapons were stationed in his country.\nA Ukrainian military intelligence spokesman dismissed the announcement that drills would take place, calling it \"nuclear blackmail\".\nBut Nato spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah said it was \"dangerous and irresponsible\" and stated that Nato remained \"vigilant\".\nFollowing a meeting in Paris with Mr Macron and Chinese President Xi Jinping, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that she hoped President Xi would help de-escalate Russia's \"irresponsible\" nuclear threats.\nRussia's sabre-rattling come on the eve of President Vladimir Putin's inauguration for a fifth presidential term.\nUkraine's foreign ministry has said it will no longer regard Vladimir Putin as a legitimate president after his inauguration and has urged other countries and international organisations to follow suit.\nHowever, a French diplomatic source quoted by Reuters said the French ambassador would attend the ceremony. \nGermany and several other European countries have ruled out sending their envoys.",
    "Three tourists found dead in Mexico were shot in the head and their bodies dumped in a well, authorities have confirmed.\nOfficials believe the men were attacked trying to stop the theft of their pickup truck.\nAustralian brothers Jake and Callum Robinson, 30 and 33, and their American friend Jack Carter Rhoad, 30, disappeared on 27 April while on a surfing trip in Ensenada.\nRelatives of the three men identified their bodies on Sunday after travelling to Mexico to assist authorities, a state prosecutor said.\nThe attackers wanted the vehicle for its tyres and shot the tourists when they resisted, Baja California state prosecutor Maria Andrade suggested.\nTheir bodies were found in a 4m (15ft) deep well about 6km (4 miles) from the site of the attack in the town of Santo Tom\u00e1s on Friday.\nAbandoned tents, a burnt white pickup truck and a phone linked to the missing surfers were found nearby.\nA fourth body was found in the well, but had been there longer and was unconnected to the case, officials said.\nTwo men and a woman have been detained on suspicion of direct or indirect involvement in the attack. One man with a previous criminal record has been charged with \"forced disappearance\".\nEarlier, the FBI said it was looking into the case and was in touch with international partners. \nBaja California is one of Mexico\u2019s most violent states, as local drug gangs fight turf wars.\nIn 2023, it had the country's second highest murder rate, after the state of Guanajuato, according to official figures. \nNational Defence Secretary Luis Cresencio Sandoval said earlier this year that 85-90% of murders committed in Baja California were linked to drug trafficking and organised crime. \nBut the Ensenada area, about 120km (75 miles) south of the US-Mexico border and known for its surfing conditions, is considered safer and has long attracted tourists from California.\nThe brothers' parents - Deborah and Martin Robinson - said Callum had been living in the US, chasing his dream of becoming a professional lacrosse player.\nJake was on \"the trip of lifetime\" to visit him before starting a new job in Victoria as a doctor, they said on Friday.\n\u201cCallum and Jake are beautiful human beings. We love them so much and this breaks our heart.\u201d\nFriends of the brothers have also flooded social media with tributes.\nCallum's teammates at Stevenson University Lacrosse club said the athlete was a larger-than-life personality.\n\"With his beautiful long hair and charming smile, he truly embodied the nickname \u2018big koala\u2019 - warm, friendly, and always there to lend a helping hand,\" a statement from the club said.\nHis girlfriend, Emily Horwath, said her heart was \"shattered into a million pieces\". \n\"I don\u2019t have the words right now... I will love you forever,\" she wrote in a post on Instagram, alongside pictures of the couple.\nCarter Rhoad's social media accounts showed happy snaps of him proposing to his partner less than a year ago.\nA fundraiser set up by friends of his family said he and the Robinson brothers had \"brought immeasurable joy, love, and kindness\" to the world.\nAustralian Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the country was thinking of the Robinson family.\n\"It has been an absolutely horrendous, absolutely horrific ordeal and our thoughts are with all of them today,\u201d he said at a news conference on Monday.\nThe killings have sparked fear and anger in the Ensenada region.\nScores of protesters marched through the city on Sunday, carrying surfboards plastered with slogans written in Spanish.\n\u201cThey only wanted to surf - we demand safe beaches,\" one said. \"Australia we are with you,\" another said.\nA group of surfers later performed a \u201cpaddle-out\u201d ceremony, an ocean vigil to honour the trio.\nIt is not the first time that Australian surfers have been killed while holidaying in Mexico. \nIn 2016, Dean Lucas and Adam Coleman were murdered in north-western Sinaloa state when they fought back during an attempted robbery. \nTheir bodies were found in their burnt-out camper van weeks later.\nOn X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, Mexico\u2019s foreign ministry said that Mexico\u2019s ambassador to Australia had traveled to Baja California to work with Australian consular officials and help the families of the victims.\nState Department figures show that at least 1.6 million US citizens live in Mexico, which is also the top destination for US tourists globally, with more than 30 million visitors in 2022.\nIn 2022 - the last year for which State Department data is fully available - 192 Americans died in Mexico, of which 46 were ruled as homicides.",
    "An up-and-coming singer who stood in for Olly Murs at a Take That gig in Glasgow at the last minute said it has \"been madness\".\n\"It's been a whirlwind,\" Daniel Rooney told BBC News. \"My phone's not stopped for three days. It's been really fun.\"\nThe 26-year-old had been playing at a hotel bar nearby when he was asked to step in for support act Murs, who could not make it due to transport issues.\nTake That's frontman Gary Barlow later thanked him on Instagram.\nRooney, from Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire, said he had been playing in his regular slot at the Radisson Red hotel when the presenter Ross King spotted him.\nHe was then whisked to the Ovo Hydro, where he found himself playing in front of 14,000 fans. \"I usually play to around 40 people,\" he laughed. \"It's madness.\"\nRooney said he did not have time to feel nervous as it all happened so fast.\n\"I was more just focusing on what songs to sing,\" he said. \"I was more excited than anything else.\"\nRooney said Take That were \"brilliant\" and gave him some advice on what to play. When the gig finished, he also got some positive feedback from them.\nBarlow also showed his appreciation on social media, writing: \"This young man saved the day, thank you.\"\nHe added a picture of Rooney and three love heart emojis.\nRooney said his friends and family didn't believe him when he first told them what had happened.\n\"They thought it was a wind-up,\" he said. \"It was only when they started seeing the news reports that they knew I wasn't joking.\"\nHe said he wants to enjoy his newfound fame and will spend the coming weeks recording some music.\n\"I just want to keep it going, and and see where it all goes,\" he said.\nRoss King told BBC Good Morning Scotland that he had been having a meal in the hotel when he saw the news that Murs could not make the gig.\n\"Gary Barlow is one of my best mates. We suddenly got in contact,\" he said.\nKing said he told Barlow there was a \"young guy\" playing in the hotel, adding: \"He's a great player, he's a great singer and he's got a great personality, I'd love to bring him over.\"\nHe said Barlow responded, telling him to bring Rooney over.\n\"We literally ran from the Radisson Red, there were no soundchecks and Daniel went on and just absolutely slayed the audience. He was just sensational,\" he said.\nOn social media, fans praised Rooney's performance at the Ovo Hydro, with one saying he'd smashed it.\nMurs, who has been supporting the world famous boy band on their This Life tour, was unable to make the gig on Friday night after his flight from London was cancelled.\nHe had been updating fans over the day on his Instagram story on his efforts to get to Glasgow. He posted a video from inside the plane before exiting and attempting to board another flight.\nEventually, he posted on social media that it was not going to happen.\nAfter their gigs in Glasgow, Take That are due to perform in Manchester this week.\nBut their five dates will now be held at the AO Arena, after they were forced to move from the troubled Co-op Live arena due to \"ongoing technical issues\".",
    "The black leather sofa in the corner of Dr Ellen Wiebe's office looks out of place in a doctor's surgery. \nBut this is no ordinary clinic. Canadian clinician Dr Wiebe is showing Liz Carr, a comedian, actress and disability rights campaigner, where people sit when they come to end their lives with the help of a doctor. \n\"They can snuggle up with their loved ones if they want,\" says Dr Wiebe. \"It's a good place for some people.\"\nCarr became a wheelchair user after becoming ill when she was only seven years old.\n\"Apart from the fact I don't have the desire, I think probably I would be eligible [for assisted dying] under Canadian law,\" Carr suggests to Dr Wiebe.  \nDr Wiebe doesn't disagree - though she does tell Carr she would have to convince her she was \"suffering unbearably\" in order to be given a cocktail of drugs to end her life.\nIn Canada, people with a disability can have an assisted death, provided they feel they are suffering intolerably and their condition cannot be reversed.\nCarr has been a vocal opponent of assisted dying for more than a decade. But in the last six months, the debate has accelerated, with Scotland set to debate an assisted dying bill this autumn, and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer saying he would back a UK-wide change to the law.\nThe Silent Witness actress is concerned about how this could affect vulnerable or disabled people. These fears are central to her new documentary Better Off Dead?, in which she makes the case against assisted dying in the UK. \nAssisted suicide is banned in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. While there is no specific offence of assisted suicide in Scotland, euthanasia is illegal and can be prosecuted as murder or culpable homicide.\nJust last week, broadcaster Esther Rantzen, who is terminally ill with lung cancer, begged MPs to attend a debate on a petition which argues that \"terminally ill people who are mentally sound and near the end of their lives should not suffer unbearably against their will\".\nCarr is afraid that changing the law for terminally ill people could eventually result in those who are poor, disabled or mentally ill being allowed to have an assisted death in the UK - or even feeling compelled to do so. \nThe actress says the possibility is \"terrifying\". \nShe points to Canada where the law was changed in 2016 to allow those whose death was \"reasonably foreseeable\" to have an assisted death, and then changed again in 2021 to include those with a medical condition who were \"suffering unbearably\". \nJournalist Melanie Reid, who became tetraplegic (paralysed from the neck down) in 2010 after a horse-riding accident, doesn't see a potential change to the law as something to fear, and tells Carr she has \"a human right to decide what happens to my body\".\nShe believes the law should also allow people who are not terminally ill, but who are suffering in other ways, to end their lives.\nBut Dr Katherine Sleeman, a specialist in palliative care, says she is concerned for people who may feel they are a burden to their families. \n\"Patients will say to me: 'I don't want to go to a care home really, but I know my family want me to do it and I know it will be easier for them so I think I'm going to say yes',\" Dr Sleeman explains. \n\"Substitute the words 'go to a care home' with 'have an assisted death' and I think it's a completely different picture.\"\nThe specialist believes no assisted dying law can be completely safe, and that some people who do not really want to die will always \"slip through the net\". \nLord Falconer, a King's Counsel who has sponsored four bills that would allow people with less than six months to live to have medical assistance to die, says assisted dying should only be for those with a terminal illness - and that there would need to be legal safeguards to protect vulnerable people.\n\"Being disabled is most certainly not the same as being terminally ill,\" he tells Carr. \"The line in the sand for me is terminal illness and it goes no further than that.\"\nBetter Off Dead?, BBC One and iPlayer, will air on Tuesday 14 May at 21:00",
    "A woman said her young son was scared the family would be arrested when \"aggressive\u201d Eurostar staff asked her to take their kirpans - religious miniature swords worn by Sikhs - out of their suitcase.\nKaren Kaur was travelling home from Paris to Bedfordshire with her family when she was told they had to put their kirpans in a tray.\nMrs Kaur claimed she checked the train operator's website before setting off but the religious blade was not mentioned as an item that was banned or needed to be handed in.\nEurostar told the BBC kirpans were not permitted but apologised that the message was not delivered in a sensitive way.\nMrs Kaur is an Amritdhari Sikh (initiated Sikh) who wears a kirpan.\nThe kirpan is an article of faith to protect others and its part of the religious uniform to be worn at all times.\nShe said: \u201cI had assumed it would be fine as the kirpan is legal to carry in the UK.\u201d\nAfter the blade was detected, she said staff \"were really aggressive\".\n\"It got heated and a manager was called, while demanding to put our kirpans in the tray. We eventually put the kirpans in the tray but continued to protest,\" she said.\n\"It was tiring and disturbing and my son cried - he was frightened we'd be arrested. I was enraged inside.\u201d\nMrs Kaur said she had travelled via train from Paris to London before but added: \"This is the first time they have said I can\u2019t take my kirpan at all. I was completely baffled.\u201d\nShe claimed the manager told her \"daggers\" were not allowed on the Eurostar but agreed to let her on board \"if the driver was fine with it\".\n\"The manager then made an executive decision and rushed us to the train.

    "New restaurants, public toilets, shopping centres and offices in England will be required to have separate male and female toilets under proposed legislation, the government has said.\nThe law will affect new non-residential buildings as part of a push \"ending the rise\" of gender-neutral toilets, Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch said.\nA consultation highlighted concerns from women, elderly and disabled people who felt \"unfairly disadvantaged\" by toilets being converted into gender neutral facilities sharing cubicles and sinks, the government said. \nBut transgender rights groups argue gender-neutral toilets can protect trans people from discrimination.\nThe rights groups say that, along with other people who do not conform to the gender binary, trans people can face intrusive challenges when using male or female toilets.\nThe government hopes to present the long-talked about legislation to Parliament in the next few weeks and, if approved, have it in force later this year. \nThe change to building regulations will also allow contained, universal toilets in addition to single-sex toilets where space allows, or instead of single-sex toilets where there is not enough space. \nA universal toilet is defined by the government as a self-contained room with a toilet and sink for individual use. \nThe government said gender neutral toilets were leading to increasing waiting in shared queues and less privacy and dignity. \n\"These regulations will guide organisations to design unisex and single-sex toilets, ending the rise of so-called gender-neutral mixed sex toilet spaces, which deny privacy and dignity to both men and women, \" Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch said.\n\"Today\u2019s announcement will also create better provision for women so that our particular biological, health and sanitary needs are met.\"\nWhen asked on ITV's Good Morning Britain if gender-neutral toilets would persuade people to vote Conservative following poor local election results, Women's Health Minister Maria Caulfield insisted: \"This is an important issue for women.\"\nThe new legislation will also apply to buildings going through major refurbishment. Exemptions include care homes, cells in custody suites and schools. \nA consultation, which received 17,000 responses, found 81% agreed with the intention for separate single-sex toilet facilities and 82% agreed with the intention to provide universal toilets where space allows.\nSex Matters, a campaign group which describes itself as promoting \"clarity about sex in law, policy and language\", said many would \"breathe a sigh of relief at this welcome return to common sense\". \nCEO Maya Forstater added: \"Single-sex toilets offer privacy, dignity and peace of mind for both sexes, but they\u2019re especially important for women and girls.\"\nMermaids, a transgender youth support charity, said in response to the government proposals: \u201cIn order to ensure everyone is served fairly and that everyone can feel comfortable using public toilet facilities, not only are gender-specific facilities in which trans people can feel safe in using vital, but gender-neutral facilities are also greatly necessary to ensure non-binary people\u2019s experiences with toilet facilities are one of comfort.\u201d\nLast week the government also announced proposals to ensure hospital patients in England have the right to request treatment on single-sex wards, with transgender people placed in rooms on their own.\nPatients will also have the right to request a person of the same biological sex delivers any intimate care.",
    "Kris Hallenga, founder of breast cancer awareness charity CoppaFeel!, has died at the age of 38.\nThe campaigner, who was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer 15 years ago, encouraged millions of women to check their breasts. \nHallenga was diagnosed when she was 23 after being turned away from her GP for more than a year. \nHer friend, broadcaster and author Fearne Cotton, said: \"She lived more fully than I've ever seen anyone live.\"\nCoppaFeel!'s mission was to educate young people about breast cancer to ensure early, and potentially life-saving, diagnoses.\nIn a statement on Monday confirming her death, the charity CoppaFeel! said: \"Kris approached life in a wildly creative, fun and fearless way, and showed us that it is possible to live life to the full with cancer.\"\nIt added that she had died \"with fulfilment and a heart full of love\".\nAlongside her philanthropic work, Hallenga was also a columnist at The Sun and author of best-selling book Glittering a Turd, which details how she discovered her life after being told she would die. \nIn 2014, a documentary about her life and work - Kris: Dying to Live - was aired on BBC Three.\nIn it, she said: \"I feel like I'm a voice for other girls going through [cancer]. Every day that I enjoy, that I am grateful for, is another level of acceptance for me.\n\"We are all going to die. I am just aware that it might happen sooner than I possibly had planned.\"\nLast year, Hallenga held a living funeral, attended by celebrities including Dawn French, at Truro Cathedral.\nAt the event, also called a pre-funeral, French revived her Vicar of Dibley role as Geraldine Granger and delivered a eulogy. \nReflecting on the day, the 65-year-old actress said: \"It was my privilege and joy to Dibley it up at Kris's FUNeral on Sat. She wanted to host the best possible party. She did. It was phenomenal.\"\nExplaining her reason for wanting to have a living funeral, Hallenga said: \"I want to be present at the event where my people have a thing or two to say about me, where I have the opportunity to show how much they mean to me.\"\nOne month after her diagnosis, Hallenga set up CoppaFeel! with her twin sister Maren to help raise awareness at schools and music festivals.\nOn Monday, the charity said that Hallenga's family had requested \"peace and privacy\".\n\"Please remember the amazing life Kris led and the things she achieved, but above all else honour her memory by checking your chest... it could just save your life,\" it added. \nIn England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, cancer treatment should start within 62 days of an urgent referral by a GP.\nThe charity Breast Cancer Now says significant progress has been made on breast cancer research over the decades but it is \"not a done deal\".\nIt estimates that 11,500 people a year in the UK die from the disease. \nIf you have been affected by issues raised in this article you can visit the BBC Action Line pages.",
    "A charity has offered vulnerable people free dental care, after poor access to dentists had left patients with life-threatening problems.\nAccording to homeless charity Lifeline, based in Harrogate, one resident \"would have probably died\" if he had not had 12 teeth swiftly removed.\nLifeline has teamed up with charity Dentaid, which offered free dental treatment at pop-up centres.\nLast week, Dentaid took its mobile unit to Starbeck in Harrogate. \nFormerly homeless people were able to have dental check-ups, extractions and fillings at the pop-up, which for some  was the first time they had accessed this service in years.  \nRob, who used to be a drug addict, said that being on the methadone programme for 14 to 15 years had rotted his teeth.\n\"I've always had problems with my teeth,\" he said. \n\"The last couple of years, I've actually looked after them but on Saturday one of my fillings fell out, so I needed to go in and get it fixed. \n\"I've been paranoid about eating over the weekend in case I did any more damage.\"\nRob added that he was \"blessed\" to have the opportunity to visit the mobile unit, as he had known people who had been waiting for \"up to two years\" for an appointment.\nAnother patient, who preferred not to be named, said this was the first time he had seen a dentist since he was 12 years old. \n\"It's nice to be looked after and cared for, and to feel appreciated,\" he said.\nThe patients were treated by retired dentist Geoff Baggaley, who had practised in Yorkshire for 42 years but now volunteered at Dentaid. \nMr Baggaley believed access to dental care had worsened over the years, which had caused knock-on issues.\n\"Going back to when we first started all those years ago, there was never really an access problem. Now there is an access problem,\" he said.\n\"We know from the evidence that this is leading to more dental decay and I think more dental anxiety because it has become a real struggle to find a dentist. \n\"I know from reports that there has probably been an increase in oral cancer diagnosis and late oral cancer diagnosis because patients can't get the care that they need.\"\nCarl Good, CEO of Lifeline, said that a man using the charity nearly lost his life due to oral problems. \nHe said: \"One of our first ever residents ended up having 12 teeth out and they said that had that not been treated immediately, then he would have probably died.\"\nHowever, the Department of Health and Social Care said its dental recovery plan would create 2.5m extra appointments this year and nearly 500 more dental practices had already opened to new patients in England.\n\"Our plan includes offering dentists \u00a320,000 'golden hellos' to work in under-served areas and rolling out mobile dental vans to our most isolated communities,\" a spokesperson said.\n \"The NHS has also seen and treated record numbers of cancer patients over the past two years, with survival rates improving across almost all types of cancer, including mouth cancer.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "A Pennsylvania pastor survived a shooting in the middle of his Sunday sermon when the attacker's gun jammed, giving congregants time to subdue him. \nFootage of the attack shows pastor Glenn Germany diving behind his lectern after a man approaches, raises his arm and aims a gun at Mr Germany.\nPolice identified the gunman as 26-year-old Bernard Polite. \nAfter Mr Polite's arrest, police found another man fatally shot at his North Braddock home.\nThe victim was identified as Derek Polite, 56. Police have not yet commented on Bernard Polite's relationship with him. Detectives from the Allegheny County Police Department's homicide unit are now handling the investigation. No charges have been filed in the shooting of the Derek Polite at this point.  \nThe Reverend Glenn Germany, pastor at Jesus' Dwelling Place Church in North Braddock, a Pittsburgh suburb, told the BBC's US partner CBS News he believed God had saved him from the attack.\n\"I'm so grateful,\" he said. \"You know, he shot. You can hear the gun click.\"\nMr Germany said he saw Mr Polite walk in and smile at him, but assumed he was coming to speak with another member of the church. \n\"But instead he came right here where I'm standing... and that's where he just pulled out the gun out,\" he said. \"I'm looking right down the barrel of the gun.\"  \nWhen Mr Polite's gun failed to discharge, church Deacon Clarence McCallister ran up the centre aisle and tackled him. While Mr Polite was being restrained, Mr Germany approached and took the gun. \nOnce police arrived, Mr Germany said Mr Polite spoke to him and apologised. \nMr Polite appeared to suffer from mental illness, Mr Germany said, and told him he heard voices. \"The voices were in his head and said 'go shoot the pastor.'\"\nMr Polite is facing multiple charges, including attempted homicide. He was denied bail and is being detained at a jail in Pittsburgh ahead of a preliminary hearing next week. \nAccording to a criminal complaint obtained by WTAE, Mr Polite told police that he tried to shoot Mr Germany because \"God told him to do it\" and he was hoping to go to jail to clear his mind.",
    "Vienna is hosting a series of performances of Ludwig van Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony to mark 200 years since its premiere on 7 May.  \nThe symphony, widely regarded as one of the great masterpieces of Western classical music and culminating in the Ode to Joy, was first performed in 1824 in Vienna, where the German composer lived and worked for most of his life. \nNow the city is celebrating with a series of performances of the symphony, notably by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by famed Italian Riccardo Muti.\n\u201cIt's the whole world to us to be able to sing this wonderful message of love,\u201d Heidrun Irene Mittermair, an alto in the Vienna Singverein Choir, told the BBC. \u201cYou're lifted up at the end, when you're singing.\u201d\nHeidrun, like the rest of the singers in the Singverein Choir, is not a professional musician - she\u2019s a schoolteacher. But her choir sings at Vienna\u2019s famous Musikverein Concert hall, with the Vienna Philharmonic, one of the world\u2019s finest orchestras.\nOver the past few days, the choir has been singing the stirring Ode to Joy, the choral finale of Beethoven\u2019s Ninth. Based on a poem by Friedrich von Schiller, it embraces a vision of universal brotherhood.\nThe musicologist Otto Biba said the symphony was revolutionary, partly because it culminated with singing.\n\u201cIt was a symphony, but with something new in the fourth movement. There was a choir on the stage and the soloists were starting to sing,\" he said. \"There were so many new details. It was very difficult for the musicians, and very experimental.\u201d\n\u201cBeethoven opened the door to the future. It's a work left by Beethoven for the next generation,\u201d Mr Biba said.\nElke Manner-Prochart, a mezzo soprano who also sings in the choir, said it was challenging to perform.\n\u201cWe have three movements to be like an audience, but not as relaxed as the audience,\" she says. \n\"At the beginning of the fourth movement the heart begins to beat and we have to concentrate. And then it's a challenge, because we have, in a very short time... to give them all the emotions. It's not so easy.\u201d\nThe symphony was first performed at the court theatre, the K\u00e4rntnertortheater, in Vienna in 1824. Beethoven himself was one of the conductors, despite his increasing loss of hearing.\nIn the orchestra were musicians who would later go on to become founding members of the Vienna Philharmonic.\nDaniel Froschauer, first violinist and Chairman of the Board of the Vienna Philharmonic, says the piece is part of the orchestra\u2019s history. \n\u201cIt\u2019s part of our DNA, a unique piece,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\u201cIt's an outcry for peace. It's an outcry for unification, it's an outcry for brotherhood, and obviously, it's also the European Anthem,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt takes something out of you to play it. Beethoven challenges you, there's no question. At the beginning, for example, you don't know whether you're in D minor or major, it's not declared. It just immediately takes you in a different cosmos.\u201d\nHeidrun Irene Mittermair says that, for her, the greatness of the symphony lies in the way it moves \u201cfrom the darkness to the light\u201d.\n\u201cWhen you hear the violins or the basses towards the end, when the choir is starting, when the soloists are singing, everything is like exploding in joy, exploding in light and happiness, so that not one bit of this darkness is here any longer,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI think Beethoven had a lot of darkness in his life. And I think with this Ninth Symphony, he overcame it.\u201d",
    "A new strain of an animal disease that could have a devastating impact on livestock farmers looks set to spread across England, experts have warned.\nThe government said there is a \"very high probability\" bluetongue virus will be more widely spread by infected midges blown over from northern Europe.\nThere have been 126 cases on cattle and sheep farms in England. The virus does not affect people or food safety.\nFarmers are calling for a vaccine to be developed quickly against the strain.\nLast week, one vaccine was given emergency approval in the Netherlands, where there have been more than 6,000 cases of the new strain, known as BTV-3.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the government was \"actively engaging\" with vaccine manufacturers on the development of a BTV-3 vaccine for use in the UK.\nThe virus can see around 30% of a sheep herd lost, although the mortality rate is lower with cattle.\nThe disease causes tongue and mucous membrane lesions, problems with swallowing, lameness and stiffness, affecting animal welfare and leading to a reduction in milk yields.\nKent farmer Roger Dunn, who farms 400 cattle and 1,200 sheep, had an outbreak of bluetongue shortly before Christmas, despite a control zone with movement restrictions already being in place.\nThe virus spread was contained on the farm by culling six cattle, for which he was compensated, and it did not spread to the sheep. But Mr Dunn knows the impact could have been far worse.\n\"When you could be losing 30 to 40% of your business, it is a big worry,\" he told the BBC.\n\"These are all pedigree Sussex cattle so that is years and years of breeding. You could lose a lot of bloodlines through it. You could lose your whole herd through it if it becomes a serious outbreak so it can be quite devastating. And, with the whole problem of movement and everything else, it just becomes a nightmare.\"\nHe added that, because his farm is in a known bluetongue area, some buyers are \"very hesitant\" to buy stock from him.\nCattle farmer David Barton, who is chair of the National Farmers Union's (NFU) livestock board, said farmers were \"anxious to protect their livestock\" but that there were still questions over the vaccine approved in the Netherlands.\nHe said: \"As this is a very new vaccine, there are still questions to be answered - not least about the cost of the vaccine, how it will be rolled out, and what support the government can offer to get it deployed quickly and efficiently.\"\nLast year's outbreak was the first in the UK since 2007. Bluetongue can affect ruminants, such as sheep, cattle, goats and deer, and camelids like llama and alpaca.\nThe first case of the new strain was found in November and since then there have been 119 cases in cattle and seven cases in sheep across Kent, Norfolk and Suffolk. The most recent case was confirmed on 8 March.\nExperts at The Pirbright Institute virus research centre are now studying exactly how the culicoides midges are spreading the disease.\nScientists at the institute are breeding colonies of midges to study how some types carry the virus while others do not.\nMeanwhile, midge traps placed at 18 farm sites across the country are each providing tens of thousands of the biting insects in a night for the scientists to study and are acting as an early alert system to the presence of those midges which could transmit the virus.\nDr Marion England, who is overseeing the national surveillance of culicoides midges, explained: \"The temperature that the midges become active at is lower than the temperature at which the virus can be transmitted so actually knowing the midges are up and running means a little while later we might see bluetongue transmission.\"\nBut she warned that, with midges \"everywhere\", controlling the spread of the virus would be difficult.\nDr England told the BBC: \"It only takes one midge bite to transmit the virus so one infected midge can bite an animal once and that animal will have a fully developed infection.\"\nDr Carrie Batten, head of the national reference laboratory for bluetongue, warned farmers to \"be vigilant\" and to look out for any clinical signs in their livestock to help the institute spot an outbreak as early as possible and take necessary measures.\n\"As this is an insect-borne disease, it is very easy for an escalation in terms of numbers of positive animals in the field,\" Dr Batten said.\nShe added that the laboratory was already looking to scale up its response to be able to test about 2,000 farm samples a day and give farmers their results within 24 hours.\nA spokeswoman for Defra said the government was actively monitoring the situation and reviewing its current bluetongue virus control strategy.\nBluetongue is a notifiable disease so anyone suspecting the disease must report it to the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA).",
    "Boeing's first crewed space flight was postponed just two hours before launch for a safety check, Nasa officials say.\nAstronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were already in position inside the Starliner when the decision to halt was made because of a potential issue with an oxygen relief valve in the Atlas rocket run by the United Launch Alliance. \nThere was no issue with Boeing's Starliner Spacecraft which sits on top of the rocket.\nFlight engineers discovered that the valve had been rapidly opening and closing in the period before launch and so the countdown was aborted. \nThe flight team are currently examining the data to see how much energy was expended by the valve. If it has exceeded its operational life it will need to be replaced, which ULA say its engineers can do in a few days.\nThe spacecraft had been expected to blast off from Cape Canaveral in Florida and make its way to the International Space Station (ISS).\nThe soonest a new launch attempt may be made is on Friday, Boeing said in a post on social media. \nThe mission has already been delayed for several years because of setbacks in the spacecraft's development.\n\"Standing down on tonight's attempt to launch,\" tweeted Nasa chief Bill Nelson. \"As I've said before, @NASA's first priority is safety. We go when we're ready.\"\nBoeing is hoping to become the second private firm able to provide crew transport to and from the ISS, alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX.\nMr Musk's company was the first to achieve this in 2020 with its Dragon capsule, in a flight that ended close to a decade of US reliance on Russian space rockets.\nThe Starliner's first uncrewed test flight was originally scheduled to take place in 2015 but ended up being delayed until 2019. When it did occur, software glitches led to an internal clock malfunction, resulting in thrusters over-firing. So much fuel was consumed that the capsule was unable to reach the ISS.\nA second attempt was planned in August 2021 but delayed again until May 2022. An issue with the propulsion system was blamed. When Starliner finally did leave Earth, it managed to complete its full mission but concerns were raised about the performance of some thrusters and the craft's cooling system.",
    "A-listers have been sashaying down the red carpet for fashion's biggest night out - the Met Gala.\nActors, musicians and business magnates are among those dressing to impress at the Metropolitan Museum of Art fundraiser in New York City.\nThe 2024 edition of the black-tie extravaganza is inspired by The Garden of Time, a short story by the British New Wave sci-fi author JG Ballard.\nThe annual gala raises money for the museum's Costume Institute.\nThis year's theme has been chosen to complement the Costume Institute's forthcoming exhibit Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\nThe BBC didn't get a ticket either - but here's a quick guide to the event.\nThose outside of fashion's inner sanctum never get to see the private cocktail and dinner events that comprise this multimillion-dollar fundraiser.\nBut fashion critics everywhere do get to watch their favourite actors, artistes and influencers walk a lengthy red carpet.\nGuests began arriving at the Met and walking up the iconic New York landmark's grand staircase to the click of a thousand cameras from 18:00 EST (22:00 GMT).\nBut expect late arrivals - we're looking at you, Rihanna.\nFashion magazine Vogue, which organises the event, is exclusively livestreaming the red carpet on its website and all of its digital platforms. Streams are also available to US viewers on NBC's Peacock streaming platform and E!.\nInternational viewers can tune in via TikTok, YouTube, Instagram and X.\nYou can follow the BBC's live blog for updates.\nThe gala and its explosion in popularity has been overseen by Vogue's global editorial director Anna Wintour.\nThe Met Gala's theme often serves as a prelude to the Costume Institute's spring 2024 exhibition - and this year is no different.\nThe exhibit - Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion - uses technology to \"breathe new life\" into garments from the Met's archives so fragile they can no longer be worn and must remain under glass.\nArtificial intelligence, computer-generated imagery, X-rays and soundscapes will be used in \"creative and immersive activations designed to convey the smells, sounds, textures, and motions\" of these items, according to the museum's website.\nThe dress code for Monday's red carpet is The Garden of Time, which shares its name with a dystopian tale written in 1962 by JG Ballard, in which the last bastion of the super-rich is overrun by a working-class mob of the \"great unwashed\".\nCommentators are calling it an exploration of rebirth and renewal, and of humanity's tendency towards cycles of creation and destruction.\nFor an event that celebrates affluence and excess in an age of economic uncertainty and global volatility, the theme may sound a little on the nose.\nThe short answer is no. Fashion's biggest night is a cocktail and dinner party for about 400 to 450 invited guests.\nWealthy celebrities and brands snap up all the available tickets and tables at the charity benefit.\nAn individual ticket goes for around $75,000 (\u00a360,000), more than the average down payment on a house.\nA 10-seat table starts at $350,000.\nIn 1995, Ms Wintour's first year overseeing the event, a ticket cost just $1,000.\nThe gala raised about $22m last year, when its theme paid tribute to late design legend Karl Lagerfeld.\nMs Wintour has recruited four big names to serve as co-chairs at this year's event.\nThey are Latino music stars Bad Bunny and Jennifer Lopez, US actress Zendaya and Australian actor Chris Hemsworth, making his debut at the gala. \nCo-chairs help promote the event, plan its theme and dinner, and arrive at the beginning of its red carpet portion.\nServing as honorary chairs are Shou Zi Chew, chief executive officer of TikTok, and Jonathan Anderson, the creative director of the Loewe's fashion house.\nTikTok - currently under the threat of a nationwide ban - and Loewe's are also sponsoring the gala and exhibition.\nThe guest list is always top secret, but several celebrities have already confirmed their attendance.\nRihanna has said she will be there, and we can expect her to be accompanied by her rapper-partner A$AP Rocky.\nWe can also expect to see J-Lo's significant other, Ben Affleck, as well as Zendaya's man Tom Holland. \nOthers to look out for include Ayo Edebiri, Dua Lipa, Emma Stone, Lily Gladstone, Lady Gaga, Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner, Kate Moss, Blake Lively, Lil Nas X and Lea Michele.\nPower couple Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are not tipped to attend. Neither is Jared Leto, who often stands out among the male attendees.\nSpeculation is also rife over the likelihood of appearances by Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who is facing multiple sexual misconduct lawsuits, and Kendrick Lamar, who is locked in a heated war of words with rival rapper Drake.",
    "Argentina's President Javier Milei has denied that it is ordinary Argentines who are paying for his radical austerity measures.\nIn a BBC interview, Mr Milei, who campaigned with a chainsaw to symbolise his desire to slash public spending, insisted that the political class were paying for his huge cuts, not the people.  \nThe right-wing economist was voted in after years of high government spending and high debt.\nInflation is now starting to fall after it initially soared when he took office in December, but it remains the highest in the world annually.\nThe president's critics argue millions of Argentines are paying the price for his austerity programme. \nIn the five months since he was sworn in, he has slashed public sector jobs, energy and transport subsidies, and the value of the currency so people's money is worth less than it was.\nMeeting him for the interview in his presidential office, there were clues to his unconventional political background as a celebrity TV economics pundit: a photo of the Rolling Stones (he was in a tribute band), a bust of himself on the desk, a toy model with a chainsaw, and a water bottle with a photo of himself on it.  \nGifts from his fans, his team said. \nHis face lit up with glee when he told me his favourite Rolling Stones song is Rip This Joint, which he said was off an album with \"libertarian components\". \nSince he became president, he has maintained his radical rhetoric about the economy, but has toned it down on other issues. \nHe refused to repeat his past criticism of China, one of Argentina's biggest trading partners, a nation which he labelled an \"assassin\" during his presidential campaign.\nAs far as economics is concerned, he has made cutting inflation, which stands at 287% annually, his clear priority, arguing that \"the most regressive tax that most afflicts people is inflation\".\nBut many of his policies have caused prices to rise in the short term, at a time when salaries and pensions are not keeping up with inflation. \nJulia is one of those who can no longer make ends meet on her monthly pension of about US$190 (\u00a3150).  \nThe 72-year-old retired chef travels two hours every day to supplement her meagre pension by singing in Buenos Aires. \nIt is the common people who are suffering, she told me, in tears. \nConfronted with her statement, President Milei said this was \"false\". \nHe insisted that the brunt of the burden was being borne by what he called the political corporation, claiming that 90% of the cuts were falling on the political class and only 10% were achieved through cutting government spending on pensions.\nIndependent analysts say spending on pensions has been cut by 30-40% in real terms - with some saying this makes it one of the biggest government spending cuts.\nIn his interview with the BBC, President Milei celebrated the fact that his administration had managed to lower spending to a level below tax income for the first time since 2008.\nWhen repeatedly asked what he would say to pensioners like Julia who are struggling, he said: \"You can't make a macroeconomic evaluation based on the situation of an individual.\" \nHe argued people were being influenced by information spread by the \"rotten\" mass media and journalists, whom he described as \"serial liars\". \nWhen it was put to him that the information that people had access to were prices on shelves, such as the price of milk, which has doubled since he took office, he said: \"You don't do economics based on the price of an individual asset.\" \nHe defended his policies to the BBC, saying that \"there is no magic, real life needs time\". \n\"What would have been the alternative? To continue to print money like the previous administration that generates inflation and ends up affecting the most vulnerable?\" \nMr Milei insisted his economic programme was helping the most vulnerable - for example, by increasing some welfare benefits such as support for unemployed people with children to buy food.  \nHe said economic indicators were \"improving\" and that \"in the last month, salaries beat inflation\".\nBut many Argentines say they are not convinced by his argument. \nVanessa L\u00f3pez, who works at a soup kitchen in a poor neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, said demand for their service had increased.\n\"It's not only people who are homeless, there are entire families that come looking for a plate of food.\"\nSome of the president's fans are willing to give him time. Nicol\u00e1s Vargas said he and his partner Ornella struggled to make enough to cover the basics.\nBut he said Argentina's economic crisis was something that \"has been going on for a long time, even decades, and it cannot be fixed in two, three, four months, even a year\".\n\"I have that faith.

    "A host of Wales' most famous artists have criticised cuts to the Welsh National Opera (WNO).\nA protest letter, signed by the likes of Sir Bryn Terfel, Katherine Jenkins, Michael Sheen and Ruth Jones, has been sent to First Minister Vaughan Gething.\nIt says funding cuts from Arts Council of Wales and Arts Council England (ACE) would be \"devastating\".\nACE said it had \"unwavering\" commitment to WNO and the Welsh government said it had \u00a3700m less to spend than in 2021.\nArts Council Wales has also been asked to comment.\nWNO announced in April that it is cutting back its spring tour in 2025 and will not be performing in Llandudno or Bristol.\nThe funding received from ACE was cut by 35%, while Arts Council of Wales reduced its funding to WNO by 11.8% following its investment review announced in September 2023.\nThe letter has been organised by Elizabeth Atherton, herself a singer and member of the Senedd's Cross Party Working Group for Music.\nOther names included on it are actor Luke Evans, harpist Catrin Finch and singer Aled Jones.\nIt warns that WNO is \"being forced to make its orchestra and chorus part-time\".\nIt also calls the \"potential dismantling of one of Wales' finest national institutions devastating for the nation\".\nMs Atherton said: \"Without emergency financial assistance Wales stands to lose its flagship arts organisation, a brand that represents Wales globally and attracts international talent to our shores.\"\nShe called on the Welsh government to \"enter into talks with both representatives of WNO and the UK Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer to discuss how WNO's cross-border agreement for funding can be honoured.\"\nMs Atherton added that \"an emergency package be put in place by both administrations to secure the future of the company\".\nThe Welsh government said: \"We have been clear our budget is up to \u00a3700m less in real terms than when it was set in 2021 and we have had to take extremely difficult decisions.\"\nACE said its commitment to opera and classical music is \"unwavering\" and is investing over \u00a315.3m in the WNO over the next three years for its work in England.\n\"We know that funded organisations are currently faced with a challenging operating environment and we are working closely with them and being as flexible as we can,\" they said.",
    "Students and staff at Oxford and Cambridge universities have begun protest camps against the war in Gaza. \nSo-called \"liberated zones\" were set up at Oxford's Museum of Natural History and King's College, Cambridge, earlier.\nThe demonstrators called for the universities to cut financial ties with Israel following its offensive in Gaza.\nOxford University has previously expressed \"profound sympathy for those suffering in Gaza, Israel, and the West Bank\".\nIn the past week, Pro-Palestinian protesters have have set up tents outside university buildings in cities including Manchester, Sheffield and Newcastle as well as at Goldsmiths, University of London.\nIn a joint statement, Oxford Action for Palestine and Cambridge for Palestine called for the universities to stop lending \"financial and moral support\" to the Israeli government.\n\"Oxbridge's profits cannot continue to climb at the expense of Palestinian lives, and their reputations must no longer be built on the white-washing of Israeli crimes,\" it said.\nCambridge Jews for Justice in Palestine, a group of Jewish students at the University of Cambridge said it was also supporting the demonstration \"to oppose Israel's occupation of Palestine\". \nMore than 33,000 people have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry there says, the majority of them civilians. \nIsrael rejects accusations that it is engaging in genocidal acts in its campaign in Gaza, and has insisted it has the right to defend itself following the armed incursion by Hamas on 7 October.\nOn Thursday, the Union of Jewish Students said the encampments were creating a \"hostile and toxic atmosphere\" on campuses and called on universities to \"take their duty of care to Jewish students seriously\".\nIn a statement, The University of Oxford said it was aware of the latest protests.\nIt added: \"We respect our students and staff members right to freedom of expression in the form of peaceful protests.

    "Many of Scotland's beaches are still bearing the scars of a series of severe storms that have blasted the country in the past eight months.\nSome have suffered a severe loss of sand and damage to adjacent structures such as paths and harbours.\nCoastal experts are warning that they may not have enough time to recover before the next bad weather comes along.\nLaura Douglas is a senior countryside ranger with the East Lothian Council Ranger service. \nShe said in her twenty-plus years of experience she had never seen this amount of damage along the coastline because of the weather, which has affected the area's famous sand dunes.\nLaura says: \"In some areas, particularly here at Gullane, we've had more than 10m depth of dune that's gone. \n\"We've been able to estimate that, particularly at Yellowcraig, that's probably 80 years' worth of dune development just because of the amount of material that's coming out.  \n\"Within that we've also lost a lot of the sea buckthorn that grows here on the dunes. A lot of that has been pulled out which holds the dunes together so it's having a massive impact on the dunes system here. \"\nThe loss of so much sand has exposed some remnants from World War Two, and the remains of an old military ship dating back to about 1881.\n Laura fears the frequency of storms has made the coastline particularly vulnerable.\n\"There isn't a lot of time in between storms for the sand dunes to redevelop. If the dunes system can't redevelop, the height won't be the same. There's a real change all the way along the coast.\"\nA few miles to the west at Edinburgh's Portobello beach, some locals are shocked by the amount of sand that has been washed away.\nColin Cornwall has lived here all his life, and regularly does a litter pick on the beach.  He says it is the worst he has seen.\n\"We've lost a lot of sand - six or seven feet in places. There's a 10ft drop at part of the defence wall and that was about three foot from the wall to the sand. \n\"My granddaughters used to jump down on to the sand - but now it's about a nine or 10ft drop. The sand hasn't just shifted along the beach - it's gone back out to sea.\n\"That's just not going to be washed back in by the tides.\"\nHe added: \"It's been bad before but and it's corrected itself without anyone being called in to do it - the beach has sorted itself out. I know there are people saying that it happens all the time - but not to this extent.  I'm very worried. It can't go on like this. \n\"Sand moves, I understand that, but here's no way that six or seven foot of sand is going to be miraculously washed back in.\"\nNamed storms such as Babet and Ciaran have battered Scotland over the past eight months, particularly on the East coast. \nThere have been eleven of them since September. The Scottish government's Dynamic Coast project is looking into the impact of the weather on our beaches.\nDr Alistair Rennie is the project manager. He says beaches have the capacity to repair to some extent, but the number of storms we've seen is making that recovery more difficult.\n\"That frequency really hurts because it doesn't give the natural systems quite enough time to recover and repair themselves.\n\"It is a concern and as we look at climate change we should expert more of these sorts of impacts. \n\"We need to invest in all forms of resilience, whether that's repairing sea walls or replenishing our beaches.  \n\"But also adapting - trying to get used to these sorts of storms and making ourselves more resilient as communities, as businesses and infrastructure owners.\"\nCouncils are now putting together coastal change adaption plans, to deal with the impact of rising tides and stormier seasons.\nIan Chalmers from East Lothian's structures and flooding team says they need a strategy for future severe weather.\n\"Some of the coastal erosion that we're experiencing is relatively unknown,\" he said.\n\"So we need to understand which areas are going to be worst affected and from that we can look at adaptations.\nBut what we are seeing is that we're losing sand on all of our beaches so where do we actually bring that sand in from? \n\"It's looking at that kind of longer term plan as to whether there's anything else we can do.\"\nHe also said that it would be essential to monitor and understand key risks along our coastlines, what kind of infrastructure is going to be affected, before putting measures in place.\nMany councils are keeping a close eye on how key beaches recover, and using Scottish government funding to plan ahead and prepare for the expected  storms of the future.\nBut there is a worry that beaches will not have enough time to repair before the next series of extreme weather events.",
    "A motorist who is traumatised after being ordered to stop on a motorway by a man posing as a police officer, has been told there will be no criminal investigation and police will not speak to the man face-to-face.\nThe woman says the man waved what looked like a police warrant card, drove close to her at speed in an unmarked car and ordered her to pull over on the M1 in Leicestershire.\nShe did not stop, fearing a repeat of the Wayne Couzens case.\nTwo police forces have now apologised. \nCouzens used his police warrant card to falsely arrest Sarah Everard in March 2021. He then raped and murdered her.\n\nThe woman, who wants to remain anonymous and is using the pseudonym Lisa, has told the BBC that when she came off the motorway, she reported the man and gave his car registration to the police. \nIt has now emerged he was not an officer, but he had worked for the police. Lisa describes him as \"a fake policeman who wanted to do me harm\".\nShe says in March 2023, she was driving on her own, northbound on the M1 in Leicestershire. She admits she was speeding, doing about 80mph.\nShe says a lone male driver, in an unmarked car, crossed in front of her and went further ahead in the outside lane.\nAs she came up behind him, also in the outside lane, he started waving a small black wallet out of the driver\u2019s window, with an EIIR Royal-style symbol. \nShe thought it was a police warrant card: \u201cImmediately, I thought he\u2019s a policeman. I\u2019m speeding, I should pull over.\u201d\nBut because she felt uneasy, Lisa decided instead to move into the middle lane and stay there.\nShe says the driver then slowed down in the outside lane so that he was driving parallel with her.\n\u201cHe leaned over holding the steering wheel with one hand. He was driving alongside me all the time, shouting to pull over. He was really angry. I felt really stressed,\" she said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s looking at me, not the road ahead and the window wasn\u2019t open on my side, but it was on his passenger side and he\u2019s waving the badge that I can clearly see is a black wallet with a police crest badge stuck on the outside. \n\"I immediately thought of Wayne Couzens and David Carrick. I was genuinely frightened. I was shaking. I was gripping the steering wheel.\u201d\nWhen she did not stop, the male driver suddenly slowed down, moved across to the inside lane and turned off the motorway.\nLisa reported the man as soon as she could when she stopped, but by then she was in the Derbyshire force area. \nShe was told that he was a Northamptonshire police officer and because it was initially treated as a complaint against a police officer rather than a crime, it was Northamptonshire who first dealt with it. \nIt began an investigation, and over the following months established that the man was not an officer but had worked in a civilian role with the force, working for a contractor, and had left the role months before Lisa reported him.\nNorthamptonshire passed the complaint to the Leicestershire force because Lisa was driving in its patch, and it needed to be dealt with as a crime report.\nBy this stage all CCTV footage from the time had gone, and it took until the end of August for Leicestershire to log it as an alleged crime of impersonating a police officer. \nBecause of the delays, this was almost at the end of the six-month limit for prosecuting such an offence. \nLeicestershire says it then ran out of time and did not speak to the man. It has apologised to Lisa.\nIn a statement, it told BBC News: \u201cLeicestershire police takes any report of impersonation of a police officer extremely seriously. However, on this occasion our response did fall below the expected standard.\u201d\nThe Professional Standards Department of Northamptonshire Police also apologised in a letter to Lisa in February this year. \nIt says: \u201cUltimately you have been given a poor service throughout the life of this investigation. \n\"You were left feeling distressed following a male\u2019s actions and this should have been investigated as a crime from the outset.\n\"Unfortunately, early misinformation that this male was a police officer with Northamptonshire Police led to this becoming a complaint investigation as opposed to a criminal investigation.\u201d\nIn the letter, the force promised to speak to the man. It contacted him a month later and, in a pre-arranged phone call, the man denied the allegations. Officers did not visit his home. \nThis was now twelve months after Lisa had reported him.\n\nNorthamptonshire Police has also revealed that there was no record of the man returning his ID card when he stopped working for the contractor. \nIt says that while the card would have had a Northamptonshire Police crest, it would have been stamped with the words \u201cnot a warrant card\u201d and would not have been in a small black wallet. It added that practices for returning cards have now been tightened up.\nLisa is incredulous at the police response and a year on still gets upset when she describes what happened: \u201cI feel really let down. I still feel sick, panicky and scared. ",
    "Police in Los Angeles have cleared out a pro-Palestinian encampment at the University of Southern California (USC).\nOfficers in riot gear moved into the site early on Sunday, as USC warned those who did not leave that they could be arrested, according to CBS, the BBC's US partner.\nNo arrests have been reported, and USC President Carol Folt thanked the police and campus security for clearing the camp \"as peacefully and safely as possible\".\nRocked by weeks of pro-Palestinian protests, US universities are preparing for possible disruptions at upcoming graduation ceremonies.\nNortheastern University\u2019s ceremony in Boston on Sunday passed largely peacefully at the city\u2019s Fenway Park where police were in attendance.\nMembers of the graduating class held Palestinian flags and chanted pro-Palestinian phrases. Other students waved Israeli flags.\nThe protest at USC in California ended after officers formed a perimeter around the camp.\nZain Khan, a USC student journalist, told CBS that the encampment had around 100 people and was cleared out by \"dozens\" of police officers and members of the university's Department of Public Safety (DPS).\n\"Most of them peacefully left, some of them were chanting,\" he said.\nUSC later posted on social media that the campus was open to students, faculty, and staff with valid identification, but warned that \"tents and related equipment\" were not allowed and could be confiscated.\nIn a statement on Sunday, Dr Folt said action had to be taken because the encampment was disrupting exams and preparations for commencement ceremonies, and the situation was \"spiralling in a dangerous direction\".\n\"My goals were to prioritise safety and return our campus and our surrounding community to normalcy,\" she said.\n\"We were determined to ensure our students could finish their exams without further disruption and that USC could host the commencement celebrations our graduates have worked hard to earn.\"\nDr Folt confirmed earlier this week that USC had started disciplinary investigations into an unspecified number of individuals who \"violated our policies and the law\", according to CBS. \nThe proceedings follow the arrests of 93 people at USC last month after police and protesters clashed on campus.\nThe clear out of the USC camp comes just days after riot police removed a similar encampment at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).\nEarlier this week, police in New York arrested 112 protesters after Columbia University sought help clearing the Manhattan campus. Police later confirmed that an officer accidentally fired his gun during the clear out.\nThere was also campus tension at USC in mid-April when it announced it would cancel a graduation speech by a valedictorian Muslim student, citing unspecified security concerns.\nThe move came after complaints that her social media presence was antisemitic.\nThe university then cancelled the main graduation ceremony, which was set to take place on 10 May. Other commencement events are still set to take place on campus this week.\nUS universities have been rocked by weeks of protests, with demonstrators calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza war, and for academic institutions to financially divest from Israel and companies who stand to make money from the conflict.\nThere have been demonstrations at nearly 140 institutions across 45 states and Washington DC since the protests started at Columbia University last month, according to a BBC tally.\nPolice have detained more than 2,000 people nationwide in the past fortnight at college rallies and protest camps.",
    "The Angling Trust and Action for the River Kennet (ARK) have called for immediate government intervention on sewage pollution.\nThe groups stress that without this, the ecological health and biodiversity of chalk streams in the Kennet, Lambourn and Pang rivers are at risk of long-term, irreversible damage.\nDirector of ARK, Charlotte Hitchmough, said she has been left \"frustrated\" and \"shocked\" at the current levels of pollution.\nA spokesperson from the Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) has said sewage pollution is \"unacceptable\" which is why they are quadrupling inspections and pursuing criminal prosecution if water companies breach their permits.\n\"It's not the way we should be treating our chalk streams and it's not the way a developed country should be managing their sewer network,\" Ms Hitchmough said.\nEvent duration monitoring has shown the last year has been \"particularly bad\" she said, with sewage treatment works \"discharging untreated sewage continuously for months at a time\".\n\"We need action and we need action at pace,\" she said. \nMs Hitchmough said spills from sewage treatment works are the \"tip of the iceberg\", manholes are not monitored and become overwhelmed when sewage systems are full.\n\"The pressure of the sewage and water in the sewer force the lid (of the manhole) up and we get untreated sewage pouring directly from the manhole into the river,\" she said.\n\"You can smell it, you can see wet wipes, you can see exactly what the contents are.\"\nNitrate and phosphate levels in rivers rise when large sewage spills happen which upsets the balance between algal and plant communities.\nAlgal growth then begins to stop the photosynthesis of green plants causing them to wither and rot, resulting in a downward spiral of river health.\nMs Hitchmough said \"although we're a long way away\" eventually this would lead to \"rivers that can't support life\".\nIn an urgent appeal to water regulator Ofwat, the Environment Agency, and environment secretary Steve Barclay, the Angling Trust and ARK have raised significant concerns regarding ongoing sewage pollution issues in the Kennet, Lambourn and Pang river catchments, overseen by Thames Water.\nA Defra spokesperson said: \u201cSewage pollution in our waters is unacceptable, which is why we are consulting on banning water bosses\u2019 bonuses when criminal breaches have occurred, as well as quadrupling water company inspections and fast-tracking investment to cut spills.\n\u201c100% of overflows are now being monitored and if water companies, including Thames Water, are found to breach their permits action will be taken \u2013 up to and including criminal prosecution.\u201d",
    "People in Bushmills have been \"left in shock\" following a serious assault in which a man was left nailed to a fence, an assembly member has said.\nA man was taken to hospital following the incident in a car park in the County Antrim town in the early hours of Sunday.\nThe man in his 20s was found with a nail through each hand at a fence.\nUUP leader Doug Beattie said the attack had \"all the hallmarks\" of being carried out by loyalist paramilitaries. \nPolice said paramilitary involvement was one key line of inquiry.\nTwo vans, one belonging to the injured man, were found on fire in the car park near Dundarave Park.\nGraffiti on nearby public toilets has been linked to the assault and arson.\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said the man was left with potentially life-changing but not life-threatening injuries.\nAssistant Chief Constable Bobby Singleton told BBC News NI it was a \"really shocking incident with levels of, almost, ultra violence\".\nSpeaking to BBC's Evening Extra programme, Mr Beattie described it as \"appalling and absolutely barbaric\".\nHe called for a stronger, multi-agency response to so-called paramilitary attacks. \n\"They are criminals and they need to be treated as such and I think we give them a little bit too much credibility because we don't have a better way of explaining them,\" the UUP leader said.\nSuch attacks are \"designed to instil fear into communities\", making it difficult for people to challenge those responsible, he added.\n\"[The] only way to challenge that is to use everything available to us - MI5, NCA, PSNI, HMRC - everything working together to dismantle these people\u2026 to make sure that we put them away and we put them away for a long time,\" he said.\nMr Beattie said agencies \"need to really look at this from top to bottom\" and criticised the use of segregated prison regimes in Northern Ireland.\n\"They go into prison and they come out with their title of brigadier and some sort of kudos within communities - that all has to end,\" he added.\nAlliance MLA Sian Mullholland described the attack as \"absolutely uncalled for and unjustifiable\".\nShe said that there was \"no place for vigilantism\", adding this was \"something that shouldn't be happening in 2024 in our society\".\n\"If people do have concerns, the police and the justice system as the only route that we have to follow - otherwise we're in the wild west,\" Ms Mulholland told BBC News NI.\nShe added the \"ripple effects\" of the \"barbaric\" attack would be felt beyond the victim, by the community in Bushmills, the emergency services who responded to the incident, and tourists staying in campervans in the car park during the attack. \nDUP MLA Paul Frew said: \"This criminal and violent behaviour cannot be tolerated in a peaceful community and has to be condemned.\"\nTUV leader Jim Allister expressed his \"dismay at the gruesome and cruel attack\".",

    "A work of art hidden in a dark corner of a National Trust manor house for 150 years has been revealed as a rare surviving print by the inventor of colour printing.\nThe copy of a portrait by Dutch artist Sir Anthony van Dyke was assumed to be oil-on-paper until curators at Oxburgh Hall, Norfolk, sent it away for conservation. \nIt was discovered the reproduction of the Three Eldest Children of Charles I was in fact a print by Jacob Christoff Le Blon, who first created the three-colour printing process.\n\"Only three Le Blon prints of it are known to survive, so to have discovered a fourth is really exciting,\" said National Trust curator Jane Eade.\nThe discovery at the home of the Bedingfield family, who were devout Catholics, suggested they were secret Jacobites - supporters of the Catholic Stuart royal family in exile instead of George I. \nThe Protestant king inherited the British throne in 1714.\nThe portrait includes the future James II, the last Catholic monarch of Britain, whose son James Francis Edward Stuart attempted to take back the throne in a failed uprising in 1715.\n\"Copies of this painting are known to have been popular with those sympathetic to the Jacobite cause, and it would have been quite feasible that the print has spent its whole life at Oxburgh - although we lack enough evidence to prove it,\" said Oxburgh collections and house manager, Ilana van Dort.\nThe original portrait is part of the Royal Collection, to which Le Blon was given access by George I, and his print dates to 1721-22.\nHe was the first to create a three-colour printing process \u2013 the forerunner of the CMYK colour printing used today.\nThe revolutionary method used mezzotint, a monochrome printmaking process, with separate plates inked in blue, yellow and red, and superimposed on one another in order to create variable depth of hue. \nUntil Le Blon, artists had inked colours one beside the other on a single printing plate.\nA specialist paper conservator at the trust's Royal Oak Conservation Studio at Knole, Kent, carried out conservation treatment. \nAnalysis helped identify colours Le Blon was known to have used such as indigo, carmine or red lake.\n\"A thick layer of 19th Century varnish was particularly challenging,\" said Ms Eade.\nThe story of its conservation will feature in the new BBC Two series of Hidden Treasures of the National Trust, which starts on Friday.\nFollow Norfolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Rishi Sunak has said the general election result is \"not a foregone conclusion\", despite \"a disappointing\" set of local elections for the Tories.\nSpeaking to broadcasters for the first time since the extent of Tory losses were clear, the PM said he was \"determined to fight\" on.\nThe party lost 470 council seats, as well as all but one mayoral contests. \nThe BBC has spoken to a number of Tory MPs who reflected an increasing pessimism in the party. \nOne senior figure in the party described the next months as \"managed decline\", and talked of the Conservatives waiting for their fate.\nBut there appears to be no prospect of a move against Rishi Sunak in the coming days.\nChallenged over his suggestion there could be a hung Parliament, Mr Sunak said: \"The independent analysis shows that whilst of course this was a disappointing weekend for us, that the result of the next general election isn't a foregone conclusion and indeed actually is closer than, or the situation is closer than, many people are saying - or indeed some of the opinion polls are predicting.\n\"And that's why I'm absolutely determined to fight incredibly hard for what I believe and for the future country that I want to build, and that's what I'm going to do.\"\nOne MP argued talk of hung Parliament was \"delusional\" and said the Tories would be lucky to win more than 200 seats out of 650 at the general election. \nJeremy Corbyn won 202 seats in Labour's drubbing in 2019. \nOthers are more pessimistic and think the number of Tory MPs could be similar to 1997, when John Major returned just 165. \nEven among those who think a hung parliament is possible, few are arguing the Conservatives have much chance of being the biggest party.\nOne former cabinet minister, themselves facing a challenge to keep their seat, said the case to voters would be they should vote Conservative to stop a Labour landslide. \nThe prime minister's job in the next few days will be to try and rally his party and persuade them all is not lost.\nBut as has been the case for some time now, there is still an active debate about what the party should do next.\nFormer prime minister Liz Truss is among those arguing privately that changing the leader would be mad but that the Conservatives need to offer \"fundamental reform\" - policy, not personnel.\nThere are figures on the right of the party agitating, and calls for the Conservatives to back leaving the European Convention on Human Rights. \nSome want a radical reshuffle or more moves to cut taxes.\nSome have suggested finding more wedge issues to highlight differences with Labour on cultural issues. \nFormer home secretary Suella Braverman is among those urging the prime minister to change course and adopt more right-wing policies, although she argued it would be \"impossible\" to change leaders so close to a general election. \nBut those in the centrist One Nation group agree with Andy Street, who lost the West Midlands mayoral contest by just 1,508 votes, that the party should focus on \"moderate, inclusive, tolerant Conservatism\". \nTalk of tacking to the right is \"barmy\", said one MP. \n\"They are in a minority.\"",
    "SNP leadership front-runner John Swinney is expected to succeed Humza Yousaf unopposed after a potential challenger withdrew his bid at the 11th hour.\nEarlier it emerged that veteran SNP activist Graeme McCormick, who has been openly critical of the Scottish government, had secured a nomination.\nHowever he then announced that although he had met the threshold of support needed to secure a nomination, he had decided not to proceed and would back Mr Swinney instead. \nThis came after a \u201clengthy and fruitful conversation\u201d with Mr Swinney in which Mr McCormick said they had \"agreed the challenges\" which the SNP, the government and the people faced. \nThis means Mr Swinney is expected to be elected leader of the SNP after nominations close at midday on Monday.\nMr Yousaf resigned after just over a year in the role following the fallout from the decision to terminate a power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens.\nMr Swinney announced he was putting his name forward as he gave a speech at an event in Edinburgh last week.\nMr Swinney, 60, previously led the SNP between 2000 and 2004 and said he would not be \"interim leader\" or a \u201ccaretaker,\u201d adding he intended to see out a full term.\nOn Sunday he suggested that rebuilding the SNP could be delayed if another candidate were to enter the leadership race - though said he would engage with internal party democracy.\nHis preference, he said, was to \"get on with things\" as the party had not been as cohesive as it should have been in recent years.\nLeadership candidates are required to get 100 nominations from at least 20 local SNP branches before standing in the race.\nMr McCormick is a retired lawyer and stood against Mike Russell to become party president in 2023, losing by 599 votes to 79.\nHe previously argued for abolishing tax and replacing it with an annual rent on land, and that the route to Scottish independence lay through international treaties, with Scotland dissolving the union immediately if the SNP returned the most MPs in Scotland at a general election.\nIn a speech at the party conference in October last year, he described the SNP government as being like \u201cflatulence in a trance\u201d.\nLate on Sunday, Mr McCormick released a statement saying he and Mr Swinney had \"explored new thinking on a range of issues\" that would \"inspire activists\" within the SNP and in the wider independence movement.\nConfirming he was backing Mr Swinney, he said: \"This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians, and I\u2019m sure that John\u2019s determination to deliver Independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.\"\nFormer SNP leadership candidate Kate Forbes confirmed earlier she was not standing and backed Mr Swinney, having been promised a \"significant\" cabinet role if he becomes first minister.\nIf no other candidate meets the nomination deadline, Mr Swinney would be free to seek parliamentary approval to become first minister.\nMr Yousaf has decided to stay on in the role until a replacement is selected.\nOnce his resignation has been accepted by the King, parliament has 28 days to select a replacement.\nThere will then be a vote in the chamber to decide the new first minister, which is passed by a simple majority.\nThe SNP has 63 seats in the parliament, which means it does not have a majority, but the vote is likely to pass regardless.\nThe parliament's presiding officer then recommends to the King that the winner be appointed as the new first minister.\nA swearing-in ceremony at the Court of Session in Edinburgh could take place as early as Wednesday.\nAt that point, Mr Swinney would officially become first minister.\nMr Yousaf announced his intention to step down from the role last Monday.\nHe had ended the Bute House Agreement with the Scottish Greens, leaving him short of support for the minority SNP government at Holyrood.\nHe would have faced two votes of no confidence in his leadership last week had he not stood down.\nThe Scottish Conservatives dropped their motion after his departure was confirmed, while Scottish Labour's - which was a vote of confidence in the entire government - was defeated with backing from the Greens.\nHis resignation came 13 months after defeating Ms Forbes and Ash Regan, who has since defected to the Alba Party, in the race to replace Nicola Sturgeon.\nHe became the first ethnic minority leader of a devolved government in the UK and the first Muslim to lead a major UK party.\nIn his resignation speech, he said he had \u201cclearly underestimated\u201d the hurt he had caused the Greens by ending the agreement and said his replacement would be tasked with \"repairing our relationship across the political divide\".",
    "A caravan club has been accused of \"bullying\" its members after it increased its fees by thousands of pounds.\nSite fees at Derwentwater Static Caravan Site in Keswick, Cumbria, have increased from \u00a36,500 to \u00a310,500.\nCaravan owner Terry Hawkins said the price hikes came into force with \"with no consultation, explanation, or justification\".\nThe Camping and Caravanning Club, which operates the park, said the charge had been increased due to \"inflationary\" costs and it made no profit from the fee.\nMr Hawkins believes the club is in breach of its own rules, which he said stated the club must manage its camp sites at a \"reasonable\" cost.\n\"This increase is ridiculous, has no justification and no one could consider this reasonable,\" he said.\n\"It's the older, most loyal and life-long members who are being financially exploited and bullied by the club.\"\nThe club said the fee was paid by home owners when their static caravan was \"sited\" on the campsite. \nIt was paid by those who purchased a new caravan or when their holiday home reached the end of its \"permitted life expectancy\", which was every 15 years, it said.\nAccording to the club, the charge covers the collection, delivery and siting of the unit, as well as materials and labour costs to refurbish the pitch.\nA spokesperson for the club said: \"The fee is only applicable to a small number of people at any one time and we continue to monitor and recalculate the fee to ensure we only pass on the necessary costs to the owner.\"\nHomeowners also pay an annual site licence fee, which allows them to keep their home on the site and access the club's services.\nThe site licence fee increased by 5% this year to \u00a34,650.\nThe Camping and Caravanning Club said it was up to homeowners whether they wished to pay the increased fees.\n \"Should the caravan holiday home owner feel they no longer want to stay on the campsite, they are able to take their current unit and leave with no charge from the club,\" the spokesperson said.\nFollow BBC Cumbria on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "South African opposition leader John Steenhuisen believes he has what it takes to eventually become president.\nThat is despite coming up against the thorny issue of race and the African National Congress's 30-year grip on power.\nFor decades he has argued that his party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), is the key to South Africa's progress.\nThe centre-right movement emerged from the liberal white benches of the old apartheid parliament, positing itself as a liberal alternative to the ANC.\nMr Steenhuisen joined the DA as an activist in the 1990s, when he was roughly 19 years old. \n\"I decided to go into politics because of my frustration with the status quo in our country, where South Africa's immense potential was being squandered at the hands of an inept government,\" he said in a 2020 interview.\nA young Mr Steenhuisen enrolled on a course in politics and law at university but never graduated - something he was later mocked for by social media users and other politicians.\nIn a defiant speech to parliament, Mr Steenhuisen, then chief whip of the DA, said \"financial and work pressures\" had forced him to drop out. \n\"I'm not ashamed of this because I knew from an early age that I wanted to be a public representative,\" he said.\nMr Steenhuisen certainly showed ambition as a budding politician - he was elected as a councillor for his home city of Durban aged 22 and is thought to be one of the youngest to have ever held this post.\nFrom there, the future leader scaled the ranks of regional politics - that is until 2010, when he was forced to resign as the DA's leader for the KwaZulu-Natal region after it emerged that he was having an affair.\nAt the time, Mr Steenhuisen was married but also romantically involved with a DA spokeswoman, Terry Kass Beaumont. Ms Beaumont also had a spouse - DA KwaZulu-Natal official Michael Beaumont.\nMr Steenhuisen's infidelity did \"no significant damage\" to his career, Paddy Harper, a journalist with South Africa's Mail & Guardian newspaper, tells the BBC.\nMr Harper notes that Mr Steenhuisen eventually married Ms Beaumont, which may have prevented the affair becoming a stain on the opposition leader's legacy.\nIn 2011, shortly after his resignation, Mr Steenhuisen was elected to national parliament. Three years later, he became the DA's chief whip.\nAt this point, the party was preparing to make a major change. The DA has long been perceived as a party that promotes the interests of white, Asian and coloured (as people of mixed race are known in South Africa) people, in a country where they make up just 7%, 3% and 8% of the population respectively.\n So, partly in an attempt to diversify its appeal, the DA appointed its first black leader.\nThe charismatic Mmusi Maimane was viewed as the party's best shot at the presidency, but he quit just four years later. \nAs the DA reeled from his exit, Mr Maimane said the party was the wrong \"vehicle\" for uniting a South Africa that remains divided along racial lines 30 years after the end of white-minority rule.\nMr Steenhuisen was appointed as interim leader the following month - but what should have been an unquestionable triumph for this dedicated DA member was not without contention. \nSocial media users pointed out that the DA leadership was now all white, while DA officials who had quit alongside Mr Maimane warned the party was lurching back to the right.\nWhen asked last year whether the DA's image as a \"fundamentally white party\" was a structural issue, Mr Steenhuisen told the BBC: \"People are looking beyond race towards competence, [the] ability to get things done and being able to deliver - that's the game in town and that's going to be the game in the next election.\"\nHe opposes race quotas in the workplace - introduced by the ANC in a bid to close South Africa's racial economic gap - calling them \"crude\" and unsuccessful.\nOn Mr Steenhuisen's approach to racial issues, South African political analyst Richard Calland says: \"He comes across as someone who is privileged, but unconscious, unaware of the context, unaware of the lived reality for most South Africans.\"\nThis makes it hard for him to extend his appeal to black voters, who are still far more likely to be living in poverty than the white population.\nSouth Africa was the world's most unequal country in 2022, a situation partly driven by race, according to the World Bank.\nNevertheless, Mr Steenhuisen is clearly popular within the DA. He has been re-elected twice as party leader, receiving 80% or more of the vote each time.\nSome analysts believe a portion of Mr Steenhuisen's clout comes from Helen Zille, the DA's former leader and still a major political figure within South Africa.\n\"Zille has continued to be the power behind the throne. Her attitude is that her presence is essential, not just for the DA, but for the future of democracy in South Africa,\" Mr Calland says.\n\"Steenhuisen, I think, is to a large extent beholden to her. Her support was essential for him to become leader.\"\nA poll taken ",
    "TikTok has filed a lawsuit to try and block the US from banning it if its Chinese parent company does not sell its stake in the social media app.\nFears that data about millions of Americans could land in China's hands drove Congressional efforts to try and split TikTok from the Beijing-based company ByteDance,\nTikTok has said ByteDance \"is not an agent of China or any other country\". And ByteDance insists it's not a Chinese firm, pointing to the many global investment firms that own 60% of it. \nBut the app's extraordinary success in the US has made it yet another flashpoint between Washington and Beijing. \nSome 170 million Americans use TikTok every month. That includes about six in 10 teenagers, a fifth of whom say they are on it \"almost constantly\", according to Pew Research Center. More than 40% of US users say it's their regular source of news. \nA ban on TikTok was challenged by the company on Tuesday. In the lawsuit, the social media company called the attempted ban an \"extraordinary intrusion on free speech rights\" and its millions of American users.\nA total ban would be difficult to police. While forcing ByteDance to sell the app is seemingly simpler, that option also faces obstacles.  \nFor one, analysts say Beijing will try its best to scupper a sale. But who will buy TikTok's US operations, which, by some estimates, could fetch up to $100bn (\u00a380.2bn)? \nAnd the biggest question of all: Would ByteDance sell its most successful app? \nFounded in 2012 by Chinese entrepreneurs, ByteDance first hit the jackpot with short video app Douyin in China. A year later, it launched TikTok, an international version. TikTok was banned in China but gained a billion users in five years.\nIt is now run by a limited liability company based in Los Angeles and Singapore but is essentially owned by ByteDance. While its founders own only 20% of ByteDance, it's the controlling stake in the company. About 60% is owned by institutional investors, including major US investment firms such as General Atlantic, Susquehanna and Sequoia Capital. The remaining 20% is owned by employees around the world. Three of its five board members are American. \nBut Beijing's grip over private companies in recent years worries the US about how much control the Chinese Communist Party has over ByteDance, and the data it holds. These concerns are not unfounded. Last year, a former ByteDance employee alleged in a lawsuit that Beijing had accessed TikTok user data in 2018 to spy on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong - ByteDance dismissed this as \"baseless\". \nThe US has been cracking down on China's massive footprint on its soil as intelligence officials increasingly warn of espionage, surveillance and hacks. In 2022, Washington banned the sale and import of communication devices from five Chinese companies, including Huawei and ZTE. Now, the suspicion has spread to infrastructure such as Chinese-made cranes that are common in US ports, including those used by the military. \nBeijing has dismissed these concerns as American paranoia and has warned that a TikTok ban will \"inevitably come back to bite the US\". \nSince 2022, TikTok has been routing all US users' data through Texas-based technology giant Oracle to address security concerns. TikTok has stressed US data will be ringfenced and stored on Oracle servers in the US. \nTikTok's Singaporean CEO Shou Zi Chew was grilled by Congress twice in less than a year, and downplayed the app's connection - and his personal links - to Chinese authorities. His repeated reminders that he is Singaporean and not Chinese went viral. And he said after the House vote that TikTok \"will continue to do all [they] can, including exercising [their] legal rights\" to protect US users' access to the app. TikTok pointed to his statement in response to the BBC's queries. \nDespite ByteDance's attempts to reassure Washington, the US House of Representatives voted in March to give ByteDance six months to sell TikTok to non-Chinese owners, or have the app blocked in the US. Last month, the House and the Senate approved the same measure - except this time it's bundled with other bills that promise aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. President Joe Biden later signed the bill into law. \nThe newer version gives ByteDance nine months to decide TikTok's fate - if the chances for a sale look promising, Mr Biden can further extend the deadline by another 90 days. \nValuing TikTok for a sale is tricky. \nAs a privately-owned company, it does not release financial details, but reports estimate its US revenue stood between $16bn to $20bn in 2023, making up as much as 16% of ByteDance's revenue. \n\"In a normal market, it won't be hard to fetch a $100bn valuation. However, under the current political risks and lack of liquidity, the valuation would take a big hit if a transaction does happen,\" said Li Jianggan, who runs Singapore-based venture capital firm Momentum Works.\nIn other words, it would be akin to a distress sale, a further blow for ByteD",
    "Nintendo has finally broken its silence on the successor to its smash-hit Switch - but don't get too excited.\nFans have been eagerly awaiting news on the console for months, but little official information has emerged.\nNintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has now promised an announcement at some point before March 2025.\nBut he also said there would be no mention of the new machine at the company's Nintendo Direct event next month.\nIn a post on X, the boss of the Japanese company, said: \"It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015.\"\nHe said next month's Direct would focus on the \"Nintendo Switch software line-up for the latter half of 2024\".\n\"But please be aware that there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during that presentation,\" he said, adding that this information would arrive \"within this fiscal year\".\nThe company holds several of the trailer showcases each year, and recent outings have sparked masses of speculation about whether the \"Switch 2\" - as fans have unofficially called the new machine - would appear.\nOther announcements, such as the reveal of upcoming Pokemon Legends: Z-A, have also sent the rumour mill into overdrive.\nThere's never been much doubt that Nintendo was working on something - the original Switch has sold more than 130 million units since it was released in 2017.\nIt hasn't seen too many blockbuster releases since last year's Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Super Mario Wonder.\nThe company has released Mario Vs. Donkey Kong and Princess Peach: Showtime! this year, but beyond remakes of Luigi's Mansion 2 and role-playing game Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, no further in-house titles are planned.\nThere are also complaints that the seven-year-old console struggles to run some newer games.\nPiers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at Ampere Analytics, told the BBC some Nintendo fans had been \"demanding a more powerful Switch for at least the last three years\". \nBut, he said, the company has refused to rush out a new machine and kept customers interested with upgrades such as the revised OLED screen model released in 2021.\n\"From 2021 to the end of 2023, Nintendo sold 60 million more Switch consoles to consumers globally and has generated operating profits in excess of $10bn (\u00a37.98 bn) based on today's exchange rates,\" he said. \nThe post from company boss Mr Furukawa coincided with Nintendo releasing its financial results for the past year.\nWhile it reported a rise in profits, sales of software and hardware were down, but the company said the Switch had 123 million annual users despite being eight years old.\nIt also said it had plans to expand the use of Nintendo characters into other areas.\nThese include the next Mario movie, a Donkey Kong Country area of its Super Nintendo World attraction at Universal Studios Japan, and a new company museum near its HQ in Kyoto, Japan.\nAs for the Switch follow-up, various rumours and alleged leaks about the new machine's capabilities have emerged over the past year, but nothing has been confirmed by Nintendo itself.\nPiers believes that the follow-up won't be a massive change in direction, unlike some of Nintendo's previous console releases.\n\"Judging by the success of the Switch, we expect the new device to be a similar form factor and to continue the legacy of the original product,\" he said.\nPiers said he expects the new console to be released in the first half of 2025.\nBut we can now say, with confidence, that we'll know something by the end of this (financial) year.\nAdditional reporting by Liv McMahon.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",
    "There was a gap in Northern Ireland's early response to the Covid pandemic, the chief scientific advisor has said.\nProf Ian Young was testifying at the UK Covid Inquiry, which is sitting in Belfast.\nHe said his part-time role had not been replaced in February and March 2020 while he was on leave.\nThe first Covid lockdown began on 23 March, the same day Prof Young returned to his role.\nThat absence meant there was no local health representative attending Sage (Strategic Advisory Group of Experts) meetings.\nThe Sage group is a committee of scientists responsible for advising meetings on Covid.\nProf Young said there was a lot of catching up to do and it was not until mid-April that he had time to establish a broader group of experts within Northern Ireland.\nHe told the inquiry he had not been integrated into the Department of Health's (DoH) initial response to the pandemic as he hadn't been directed to by anyone in the department.  \nHe said it was his expectation that he would be \"called on\" for his advice when others thought it was \"necessary\".\nWhen Prof Young returned to his job several significant decisions had already been taken in Northern Ireland with regards to its response to the pandemic. \nHis evidence was part of week two of the inquiry's sitting in Northern Ireland. \nThe inquiry was told that, by the end of January 2020, Northern Ireland was aware of two different scenarios provided by the UK government, which outlined the potential impact of massive loss of life as the virus began to take hold around the world.  \nThe inquiry's lead counsel is continuing to look at who exactly was in charge and taking he lead on preparing for the impact of a global pandemic. \nProf Young also said:\nEarlier, the top civil servant at the DoH during the pandemic was challenged over who should have taken the lead advising Stormont departments at the start of the crisis.\nRichard Pengelly was questioned by inquiry chairwoman Baroness Hallett.\nHe said his department led the health response, but did not believe it was responsible for taking the lead for other parts of government.\nHe said his department \"cannot dictate or mandate other departments\". \nBaroness Hallett replied that the department may not be able to \"dictate\" to other departments, but she suggested \"you can lead\".\n\"Forgive me, I don't understand what lead means if it doesn't?\" Mr Pengelly asked her.\n\"As in encouraging others to check that their resilience is better, getting them prepared?\" Baroness Hallett replied.\nMr Pengelly suggested that was in fact the role of civil contingencies planners, through Stormont's Executive Office.  \nMr Pengelly also said:\nMr Pengelly was also questioned by Peter Wilcock KC, counsel for the NI Covid-19 bereaved families for justice.\nMr Wilcock put it to the former permanent secretary that based on evidence by Eddie Lynch, the commissioner for older people in Northern Ireland, older people had been forgotten about in pandemic planning. \nMr Pengelly accepted that a Covid-19 emergency response strategy, published by the department in March 2020, made no specific mention of the \"acutely vulnerable status of older people\".\nHowever, he said that at the time the document was published his department understood that the Covid response would include this group, which, he added, it did. \nMr Pengelly was asked by Mr Wilcock if it was surprising the document did not refer to the importance of infection prevention and control measures in the \"microenvironment of care homes\" in particular.\nHe responded the document did not get into the \"granular detail\" across every sector and that there were other areas not mentioned.\n\"The fact that something is not specifically mentioned in there does not mean that it's not strategically important, and I can't emphasise that point enough,\" he said.\n\"Care homes were hugely important to us and particularly the care of all residents within care homes and indeed the staff.\"",

It puts the Conservatives\u2019 tally on 25%.\nThat represents a one point drop on the same estimate last year and equals the record low previously recorded in 2013 and 1995.\nHowever, Labour\u2019s projected share has also fallen a point on last year to 34%, meaning the party\u2019s nine point lead over their principal rivals has not changed.\nIn a relatively modest performance, the Liberal Democrats were on 17%, down three points on last year.\nAway from the council elections, much political attention was focused on the regional mayor contests. \nMayors were up for election in ten areas, three of them new, plus the key role of Mayor of London. \nLabour candidates were re-elected in five races, and won the three new mayoralties: the East Midlands, the North East and York & North Yorkshire.\nFor the Conservatives, Ben Houchen comfortably retained his Tees Valley seat, although with a reduced share of the vote. \nHowever, in the other mayoral race the Tories had hoped to win, the West Midlands, Labour's Richard Parker beat the sitting mayor, Andy Street, in a very close result.\nThe contest came down to just 1,508 votes out of almost 600,000 ballots cast.\nEarlier, Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan won a third term as Mayor of London, taking over a million votes in the capital and increasing his share of the vote over the Conservative candidate. \nMr Khan took 44% of the vote, up almost four points. His Conservative rival Susan Hall was 11 points behind on 33%, with the Lib Dems and Greens on 6% each.\nLondon mayor votes are counted by each London Assembly area so we know how different constituencies voted. \nMost areas voted in the same way as the last mayoral election in 2021 but two, South West and West Central, switched to Labour majorities from Conservative last time. \nMr Khan won in nine of the 14 constituencies. You can explore the result in each by tapping or rolling over the map below. \nLabour won the Blackpool South by-election with a resounding 59% share of the vote. Turnout was 32% which was lower than the last election when it was 57%.\nReform came a very close third to the Conservatives with only 117 votes difference. \nThe overall pattern of Conservative council seat losses and Labour gains is repeated across England. Although Labour lost council seats in the North West, overall. \nThe Lib Dems made gains, with their strongest showing in the South East where they have increased their number of councillors by 48. \nLabour has gained ten police and crime commissioners from the Conservatives and now has 17 while the Tories have 19.

    "North Korea's former propaganda master Kim Ki Nam has died at the age of 94, said state media. \nHe died due to old age and \"multiple organ dysfunction\" for which he had been receiving treatment since 2022, said KCNA.\nHe had spent decades leading propaganda efforts in the totalitarian state, including building a personality cult around the ruling Kim dynasty.\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un attended his funeral early on Wednesday and paid tribute to the \"veteran revolutionary who had remained boundlessly loyal\" to the regime, the report added.\nSouth Korea's Yonhap news agency likened him to Nazi Germany's propaganda boss Joseph Goebbels, widely known for his mantra \"repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth\".\nKim Ki Nam had no blood relations with the ruling patriarchy despite sharing the family name that is among the most common in North and South Korea.\nHe was appointed deputy director of Pyongyang's Propaganda and Agitation Department in 1966, where he worked closely with Kim Jong Il, the predecessor and father of current leader Kim Jong Un. \nKim Ki Nam later rose to lead the department, playing a crucial role in shaping the country's messaging, as he served what has now become the world\u2019s longest-running family dynasty. \nHe reportedly had a close relationship with Kim Jong Il, with several media reports describing them as \"drinking buddies\".\nIn the 1970s, he was put in charge of the state mouthpiece, Rodong Sinmun newspaper.\nHe later led initiatives to establish the role of Kim Il Sung - widely seen as North Korea's founding father - in the country's history, and to support Kim Jong Il's succession of the leadership, according to North Korea Leadership Watch, a site on Pyongyang's political culture.\nThe propaganda department Kim Ki Nam oversaw maintained a stranglehold over communication and information flows in an out of the state. \nSouth Korean and Western entertainment, including music and movies, are banned. \nRare footage obtained by BBC Korean early this year showed the public sentencing of two teenage boys to 12 years of hard labour for watching K-dramas. \nState television had also blurred the trousers of British presenter Alan Titchmarsh in a BBC gardening programme because jeans are seen as a symbol of Western - and specifically American - imperialism in the country.\nKim Ki Nam is one of few North Korean officials to have visited the South, leading a delegation to attend the funeral of former South Korean president Kim Dae-jung in 2009.\nOne example of how the propaganda machine kicked into action was after the sudden death of Kim Jong Il in 2011. This hastened the ascent of his son, Kim Jong Un, as the country's leader. The young Kim was believed to be just in his 20s at that time.\n\"No force on earth can check the revolutionary advance of our party, army and people under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Un,\" read one of the first KCNA reports after Kim Jong Il's death.\n\"Under the leadership of Kim Jong Un we should turn our sorrow into strength and courage and overcome the present difficulties,\" the report said.\nIn 2015, images on state media showed the tall, bespectacled Kim Ki Nam - in his 80s at that time - standing among a group of military officials and taking notes while Kim Jong Un spoke.\nHe had retired in the late 2010s, passing on his role to Kim Jong Un's sister Kim Yo Jong, but continued to appear at public events - a sign that he remained on good terms with the regime.\n\"Kim Jong Un kept Kim Ki Nam in key propaganda positions for years, indicating that he, like his father, trusted and relied on him,\" said Rachel Lee, a Senior Fellow at the US-based think tank 38 North Program.\nMs Lee added that the Rodong Sinmun dedicated its entire frontpage on Wednesday to Kim Ki Nam's death and details of his funeral and this \"speaks to the respect accorded to him\".\nLeif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said Kim Ki Nam's death marks \"the end of an era\" for North Korean propaganda. \n\"This is someone who sought to glorify the Pyongyang regime in a way to appeal across and beyond the Korean Peninsula,\" he said.\nThe state's propaganda machine has since departed from the previous generation\u2019s spin on pan-Korean nationalism, Prof Easley said. \n\"Now, Kim Jong Un demonises South Koreans and heavily relies on nuclear weapons for political legitimacy,\" he said.",
    "The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is standing by its decision to convict two carers of benefit fraud, despite the cases leading to a public outcry.\nVivienne Groom from Cheshire and George Henderson from Lancashire were separately ordered to repay thousands of pounds worth of Carer's Allowance, claimed over several years.\nMr Henderson said he had \"ticked a box mistakenly\" when applying for the benefit, while Ms Groom said she had been told her income was too low to be declared.\nThe CPS had been urged to review the prosecutions but senior district crown prosecutor Emily Lloyd said it \"did not believe\" the errors on the forms were an \"honest mistake\".\nMs Groom's \u00a316,800 inheritance was seized after she had failed to declare her part-time minimum wage job at her local Co-op in Tarvin, near Chester, while she was caring for her mother between 2014 and 2019.\nWithout legal aid to pay for representation in court, she pleaded guilty to benefit fraud last year, and agreed a payment plan with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).\nBut after her mother died, the department referred the case to the CPS when it learned she was due to inherit \u00a316,000 from the sale of her mother's house.\nMs Groom said a social worker had told her that her pay was too low to be declared, which was why she had not included it. \n\n Mr Henderson was convicted after a trial in 2018 and forced to sell his house in Leyland to repay \u00a319,500 plus interest and costs because he had failed to declare his work as a taxi driver while claiming Carer's Allowance for six years.\nHe was also handed a suspended prison sentence with requirements to wear an electronic tag.\nMr Henderson said that a DWP adviser did not tell him he had to declare the fact he was working as a taxi driver, adding: \"I've ticked a box mistakenly and honestly incorrectly.\"\nA DWP appeal by Mr Henderson in 2018 - separate to his conviction earlier that year - concluded his misrepresentation \u201cwas not done with fraudulent intent\u201d, adding \u201cit was more probable than not that you were telling the truth and the false declaration was an innocent mistake\u201d.\nMs Groom\u2019s prosecution prompted widespread national media coverage last month and concerns were raised in Parliament, including by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey.\nA former senior DWP carer\u2019s allowance manager said prosecutions should be quashed \u201cat the very least\u201d in cases where officials failed to notice recipients were being wrongly paid the benefit over a number of years.\nAlex Scahill, who managed DWP teams that administered Carer\u2019s Allowance and Universal Credit until 2019, spoke to the BBC after seeing coverage of Ms Groom's case because he said it was \"heartless\" and made him \u201cupset and outraged\u201d.\n\u201cThese people are vulnerable. It\u2019s affected their health, it\u2019s affected their lives,\u201d he said, adding \u201cthat\u2019s not what the DWP is about\u201d.\nHe said the DWP was \u201ccomplicit in perpetuating\u201d overpayments where it had not acted on automatic alerts warning when Carer\u2019s Allowance recipients may no longer be eligible for the benefit.\nAs of February 2023, the DWP said it was seeking to recover 145,567 overpayments of carer's allowance, including almost 12,000 cases concerning overpayments of between \u00a35,001 and \u00a320,000.\nLabour MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth Debbie Abrahams is a member of the Work and Pensions select committee which questioned senior officials about Carer's Allowance overpayments last month.\nShe said \u201cif (an overpayment is) over a period of time going back several years I personally think it should be written-off\u201d.\nEmily Lloyd, from the CPS in Merseyside and Cheshire, said the form that Ms Groom and Mr Henderson would have used to claim Carer\u2019s Allowance as \u201cquite clear\u201d because it asks: \"Have you been employed at any time since six months before the date you want to claim?\u201d\nMs Lloyd said: \u201cThe dishonesty test for the CPS is quite clear \u2013 would a reasonable person make this error? \n\"In both cases, the prosecutors did not believe so.\"\nOther pages of the claim form also refer to employment, Ms Lloyd said, meaning \u201ceven if ticking \u2018no\u2019 was a mistake, these pages would have prompted the claimants\u201d.\n\u201cA prosecution will not be brought where a complainant has made an honest mistake,\u201d she added.\nA DWP spokesperson said it was \u201ccommitted to fairness in the welfare system, with safeguards in place for managing repayments, while protecting the public purse\u201d.\n\u201cClaimants have a responsibility to inform DWP of any changes in their circumstances that could impact their award, and it is right that we recover taxpayers\u2019 money when this has not occurred\u201d, they added.\n\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram?

    "Facebook users whose accounts were hacked and hijacked to sell fake Taylor Swift tickets have criticised the platform for not doing more to stop the scammers.\nSome said friends had lost hundreds of pounds after responding to scam posts offering tickets to Swift's UK tour dates, and that Facebook did not respond to multiple attempts to report the hacks.\nKerry Plant, from Worcester, said: \"Had they reacted to this a little bit sooner, then we could have prevented quite a bit of this.\"\nFacebook said it takes \"the safety and security of our community seriously\" and is \"continually investing in protections against fraud\".\nThere has been huge demand for tickets to see the pop superstar's Eras tour, which reaches Europe when she plays in Paris on Thursday, before UK dates in June and August.\nLast month, Lloyds Bank estimated that British fans had lost \u00a31m in ticket scams, 90% of which were said to have started on Facebook.\nMs Plant said two Facebook friends had lost more than \u00a3300 each after being duped by posts advertising tickets on her feed after her account was hacked.\nShe said she tried Facebook's suggested steps to report a hack, as well as emailing the company about 15 times, reporting a data breach and trying to contact them on other social media platforms. Friends also reported her account and the fake posts, she said.\n\"It\u2019s upset me quite a bit that I've not been able to stop this happening, and that Facebook hadn't responded to me, despite quite a lot of effort,\" she said.\n\"We even found [Facebook chief executive] Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s email and emailed him, but a couple of days later I got an email back saying, 'You don't have permission to email this person'.\n\"So lots of hours have been spent trying to rectify it. But I feel like they're obviously such a big company that they just don't care about this sort of stuff.\"\nOther people almost fell for the scam, but contacted Ms Plant directly to check before handing over any money.\nShe said she resorted to contacting all of her other friends separately to warn them.\n\"I think the worst thing is you can't do anything about it. They\u2019re such a big organisation that you\u2019re pretty powerless really,\" Ms Plant added.\nThe company removed her account last week after being contacted by the BBC.\nZhenya Winter, from London, also had her account hacked, and discovered a friend of her sister had fallen foul of a scam post on her account selling non-existent tickets.\n\"I found out by my sister calling me up saying, 'This lady is absolutely distraught,'\" she said.\n\"Even though it's not my fault, you feel guilty.\"\nMs Winter, who works in the payments industry, said the post was so sophisticated that she suspects the hackers used artificial intelligence to replicate her writing style. \n\"Even some of my fellow experts in payments were potentially duped by it. But I managed to get to them just before they did the transaction.\"\nShe tried to report the hack and contact Facebook multiple times, and asked friends to do the same, but was \"furious\" at the lack of response.\nAnd when friends tried to comment on the posts to warn others, they were blocked by the hackers, meaning their replies did not appear.\n\"It's hugely frustrating,\" she said. \"So even when I knew this was happening, I was absolutely defenceless to do anything apart from to communicate via WhatsApp or whatever to my mates.\n\"Apart from that, I'm absolutely powerless. I don\u2019t particularly want to use Facebook ever again.\n\"I think they have a responsibility to take action quickly. It's obviously a scam. They've had multiple complaints about it.\"\nFacebook has since removed Ms Winter's account, but the time it took \"frankly isn't good enough\", she said.\n\"They took ages to do it... After I reported it, there were still scams going on for at least two or three weeks afterwards.\"\nThe hackers asked for payments to be sent to accounts with \"challenger banks\" like Revolut and Monzo, which are more susceptible to fraud, Ms Winter said.\nIf someone is tempted by an ad on Facebook, she suggested it is always worth double checking with the account holder by contacting them separately first.\n\"I would always be in doubt,\" she said. \"Assume that it's nefarious until you can confirm it.\"\nKaren Elrick, from Glasgow, told the BBC last month that three or four Facebook friends had lost about \u00a3750 each.\nHer account was hacked in December and Facebook has still not responded, despite multiple requests, she said. She doesn't have control of her account, which is still active. \n\"For whatever reason, Facebook don't seem to be that interested and don\u2019t seem to be taking it down,\" she said.\n\"It's very frustrating and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.\"\nConsumer organisation Which? said: \"If Facebook does not respond to reports of accounts being hijacked by scammers, this is completely unacceptable.\n\"This is exactly the type of failing that Ofcom should be prepared to take strong action against using the Online Safety Act, including potentially issuing ",
    "Toronto police have said a security guard was shot overnight outside the home of Canadian rapper Drake.\nPolice said suspects in a vehicle shot the guard at the corner of the Park Lane Circle mansion around 02:00 EDT (06:00 GMT) on Tuesday before fleeing the scene.\nIt remains unclear if Drake was at home when the incident occurred or whether he was a target of the shooting.\nHe is currently embroiled in a war of words with US rap rival Kendrick Lamar.\nBut police said it was too early in their investigation to speak about a motive.\n\"We are in contact with [Drake's] team and they are cooperating,\" Inspector Paul Krawczyk of the Integrated Gun and Gang Task Force told reporters on Tuesday morning.\nHe said police are currently assessing video that captures the shooting but is not releasing information about it due to video quality issues.\nThe victim is in hospital and is in serious condition, he added.\nWitnesses told Canadian media he had sustained several gunshot wounds, including one to the chest.\nToronto Mayor Olivia Chow told reporters she had been briefed by police about the shooting but declined to provide details.\n\"Any shooting is not welcome in this city and I hope the police will find the people that are violating the law and catch them,\" she said.\nThe lyrical beef between Drake and Lamar has grown bitterly personal, with a flurry of \"diss tracks\" exchanged between two of hip-hop's biggest stars over the weekend.\nThe Canadian's house, in the ritzy Bridle Path neighbourhood of Toronto, is the subject of cover art for Lamar's latest song Not Like Us, which is currently topping US and global music charts.\nIn the song, Lamar accuses Drake of having relationships with underage women, and of harbouring a secret love child, with the image appearing to suggest he is housing multiple sex offenders under his roof.\nDrake's response, The Heart Part 6, denies the allegations and says he \"feels disgusted\" by them.\nThe rapper has discussed his home, which he refers to as The Embassy, in his own music and on social media. Its gates are twice as high as permissible under city law, because of his security needs.\nPictures online show the property has been cordoned off with caution tape as police investigate the shooting.\nThe BBC has reached out to representatives of both artists for comment.",

They have not yet been charged.\nThe three friends had disappeared on 27 April while on a surfing and camping trip near Ensenada, sparking a desperate search over several days.\nIt ended when their bodies were found dumped in a cliffside well on Friday. Each man had been killed by a gunshot to the head, according to local authorities. \nBaja California state officials have said the three tourists were likely murdered while trying to stop the theft of the tyres of their pickup truck. A fourth body was also found in the well but had been there longer and was unconnected to the case, they added.\nAfter travelling from Perth to identify her sons' bodies in Mexico, Mrs Robinson said: \"Now it's time to bring them home to family and friends and the ocean waves in Australia.\"\nFighting back tears, she spoke about her family's pride at the lives Callum and Jake had built.\nCallum had been living in the US, chasing his dream of becoming a professional lacrosse player, but always found time to coach junior teams, she said.\n\"[He] was a lovable, larger-than-life character... known as the big koala.\" \nAnd Jake - a doctor - was \"a happy, gentle and compassionate soul\".\n\"Jake's passion was surfing and it was no coincidence that many of the hospitals that he worked in were close to surfing beaches,\" she added. \nThe couple also thanked everyone who had supported the family since their sons went missing, including friends and consular officials.\n\"We know that they were truly loved and impacted many people's lives,\" Mrs Robinson said. \n\"Please live bigger, shine brighter and love harder in their memory.\"",
    "A review into the BBC's migration coverage has found while there is no consistent bias towards one viewpoint, there are risks to impartiality.\nCommissioned by the BBC board, in April 2023, Dr Madeline Sumption's review found while the BBC \"produces a lot of excellent content on migration... there are also weaknesses\".\nThere were \"risks to impartiality that point in multiple directions\".\nAnd it \"often tells migration stories through a narrow political lens\".\nThe review, focused on news and current affairs, also suggested coverage sometimes sought narrow \"balance\" by quoting soundbites from people with opposing views, while audiences wanted greater depth. \nViewers and listeners needed more context and explanation around complex policies such as sending asylum seekers to Rwanda, it found.\nJournalists were sometimes anxious about taking on topics they felt could be hostile to migrants - even though these issues could be investigated while also being respectful towards the people involved and subjects such as immigration fraud covered \"in a factual and nuanced way, without demonising migrants\".\nAnd by focusing primarily on political developments, the BBC could overlook concerns such as how migration affected communities, housing, public services and the labour market.\n\"BBC coverage should have equal empathy for migrants and UK residents who worry about the impacts of migration,\" Dr Sumption wrote.\nThe UK public's views on migration \"run the gamut from deeply sceptical to very liberal\", her review said.\n\"But audiences generally recognised that migration brings both benefits and challenges. \n\"The BBC should reflect this nuance and not just the strongest views on either side\".\nDr Sumption spoke to more than 100 people, including journalists and experts, inside and outside the BBC, and 17 focus groups.\nMany felt the coverage was largely negative, framing migration as a problem, with positives, such as migrants' contributions to the labour market - as well as the challenges - under-reported.\nThey often wanted more international context and answers to questions such as \"Is the UK a 'disproportionately' popular destination for migrants and asylum seekers?\"\nAnd some had noticed the coverage was more sympathetic to Ukrainians than other migrant groups.\nThe BBC could do a better job of distinguishing between refugees and asylum seekers, the review found.\nIt was \"striking that the BBC almost never uses the term 'Ukrainian migrants' - Ukrainians are described as 'refugees', even though they have not been assessed for refugee status\". \nBut it often described asylum seekers who could be sent to Rwanda as \"migrants\", even though many were believed to be refugees.\nSome BBC journalists and external experts - regardless of their views on migration - suggested the BBC was too readily led by the political agenda, which focused heavily on small boats during the review period, even though small-boat arrivals made up only a few percent of total immigration figures.\nOther routes to asylum and subjects such as emigration and integration received little coverage, the review found.\nAnd the voices and perspectives of migrants themselves were often missing entirely from BBC reporting. \nMany of the challenges arose from a lack of time or subject-specific expertise among many of the BBC journalists reporting on migration, the review found, with many migration stories covered by the online or political teams, who are thinly spread across all topic areas.\nBBC board member Sir Nicholas Serota, who chairs the editorial guidelines and standards committee, said: \"As recent events confirm, migration is a highly contested area of public policy - and that is why BBC reporting on it must meet the highest editorial standards.\n\"This board-commissioned review finds that BBC coverage of migration has many strengths but that it could also better reflect the topic's complexities, as well as ensuring coverage is not overly dominated by political and high-profile voices.\n\"We have asked the director general and the executive to ensure all actions suggested in the review are implemented and the editorial guidelines and standards committee of the board will monitor progress to ensure all the challenges raised are addressed.\"\nThe BBC executive has endorsed six key points from the report, which it expects all journalists to consider carefully when working on stories about migration:",
    "A man who stabbed his younger brother and two sisters hundreds of times before throwing the boy out of a window has pleaded guilty to their murders.\nAndy Cash killed his 18-year-old sister Lisa Cash and his eight-year-old twin brother and sister, Christy and Chelsea Cawley in Dublin in September 2022.\nA court heard horrific details of the attack he carried out in home they shared in Rossfield Avenue in Tallaght.\nCash was given three separate life sentences for the murders.\nA powerful victim impact statement, compiled by the victims' mother Margaret McDonagh and other relatives, was read to Dublin's Central Criminal Court.\n\"Our whole world is gone and there isn't anything that will change it\", they said. \n\"We will live with this unbearable heartache and pain for the rest of our lives\".\n\nWarning - this article contains distressing content\n\nGarda\u00ed (Irish police) told the sentencing hearing that in the lead-up to the stabbings, there was a family event to mark the one-year anniversary of a relative's death.\nDetective Garda Robert Whitty said alcohol was consumed and other family members became uncomfortable with some of the things Andy Cash was saying. \nCash then left the gathering and took a taxi to Rossfield Avenue and went inside the family home while the driver waited in the taxi.\nThe court heard the twins, Chelsea and Christy were asleep in bed while Lisa Cash was watching TV in another room. \nThe taxi driver heard screaming but was unsure where it was coming from. \nThe defendant then emerged from the house and told the driver to call 999.\nWhen the Garda Emergency Response Unit (ERU) arrived they saw Cash upstairs acting erratically and aggressively. \nHe threw a television from the top floor and as officers approached the house he dangled a child from the window. \nThe child, who already appeared lifeless, was dropped to the ground, Det Gda Whitty said.\nPolice tried to enter the house but were repelled by Cash who was still acting violently.\nERU members then forced entry to the home and used non-lethal weapons to subdue the killer. \nThe court heard the scene was one of carnage and all three young victims had suffered \"catastrophic\" injuries.\nThey found Lisa Cash badly injured at the bottom of the stairs but were unable to save her life.\nA post-mortem examination revealed 71 slash and stab injuries to her face, neck, chest and limbs. \nThere were also signs that the teenager had tried to defend herself from the attack.\nChristy suffered 107 sharp force injuries before being thrown out a first floor window of the house.\nHis twin sister Chelsea was stabbed and slashed 65 times.\nLater Garda inquiries revealed that when he arrived at the house, Cash had first entered Lisa's room.\nThe teenager was overheard telling her older brother that she did not have any money and that he should not be there. \nCash then began stabbing Lisa in the doorway of her bedroom before turning on the twins.\nOn Tuesday, Cash spoke only to answer \"guilty\" when the three murder charges were read to him.\nA defence barrister told the court that since going into custody in September 2022, his client had been assessed by two psychiatrists and a psychologist. \nHe said Cash asked him to say that he was \"sorry for his actions and sorry to the people he has hurt\".\nThe judge said his three life sentences will run concurrently.\nBut the family's victim impact statement said: \"There is no amount of time a person can spend in a jail cell that will justify what has happened to our family.\"\nThey added: \"Lisa, Christy and Chelsea deserved so much more from life, they deserved to grow old and live their lives however they would have chosen to and to have families of their own. \n\"They were the most beautiful, kind and loving children in the world. We will cherish every memory made with them and love and miss them forever.\"\nThe family said there were not enough words to describe the pain and hurt that is in their hearts.\n\"We miss everything about them, hearing their voices, their laughs, the conversations we would have, the games we would play as a family, the hugs and kisses that we won't ever get from them again,\" they wrote.\n\"We are no longer the people we were when they were alive as we died with them that day.

    "The debate about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on jobs is growing. The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) reports that up to eight million workers in the UK could be vulnerable as the technology becomes capable of performing their tasks. But in Cambridgeshire, a company is using AI to try to extend the working life of people with physical jobs. \nBeing a mechanic can be tough on the body. There is a lot of bending, lifting and stretching in order to work underneath vehicles. \nJobs like these can lead to muscular-skeletal problems, which cause pain in the back, joints and muscles. In 2022-23 it was affecting 473,000 workers in the UK.\nSome people are forced to give up jobs they love because of it, but at German Autowerks in Kimbolton they have used AI to try to prevent that.\nTechnicians were filmed as they carried out their everyday tasks. AI then analysed the video and identified the pressure points and potential problem areas on the body.  \nThe company then used the information to select specific exoskeletons from the open market for staff to wear - they are powered harnesses which take some of the strain of the job away from the body.\nJohn McGaughey, a technician, said \"after a few minutes it's like wearing clothing, you don't realise it's there\".\n\"A wheel is about 20kg but this makes it feel half the weight, and you can enjoy the work because you're not feeling the aches and pains,\" he said.\nThe AI technology was provided by Hertfordshire-based Stanley Handling, which believed systems such as these would become standard Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) in future - like a hard hat or hi-vis jacket. \n\"It's about protecting people,\" said the company's solutions consultant, Andre Jutel.\n\"There are a lot of difficult manual jobs out there and we have an ageing workforce. The average worker may not be able to retire at 65 - it might have to be 75. This type of technology assists them in working for longer.\"\nBut could and should jobs like this be automated instead? \nAndre Jutel said in some cases it was impossible or impractical, adding: \"Businesses are dynamic. They change and certain tasks aren't needed any more. \n\"I've seen a \u00a3100,000 piece of machinery become redundant in a few months because it's designed for a set purpose. Humans are flexible and adaptable - that's why we think it's better to focus on helping them.\" \nArtificial intelligence already assists workers in many professions. Doctors use it to help diagnose and treat patients, police forces use it to perform admin tasks and free up officers, teachers use it to save time on lesson planning and farmers use it to predict harvesting times. \nIn each of these situations, and with the ergonomic analysis of the mechanics, AI performs tasks faster than a human could - but a person always checks the results. There are concerns that without policy to protect them, many jobs will be lost to AI rather than supported by it. Last year, BT announced plans to replace thousands of jobs with AI technology.\nThe Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) believes that secretarial, customer service and administrative roles are most imminently at risk, which affects a greater proportion of women.  \nCarsten Jung, senior economist at IPPR, said: \"AI is set to be a game changer for millions of us. Many firms are already investing in it, and it has potential to speed up many more tasks as more businesses adopt it.\n\"A jobs apocalypse is not inevitable - government, employers and unions have the opportunity to make crucial design decisions now that ensure we manage this new technology well.

    "Disney is banking on a password crackdown and spate of sequels as it pushes to make its streaming business profitable. \nThe company, which is under pressure as audiences move away from traditional pay-TV and cinema, said it was on track to meet its goals after new subscribers and price rises helped to narrow losses in its streaming business. \nDisney+ gained more than six million subscribers globally between January and March, excluding India. The streaming service now has more than 117 million subscribers.\nThe increase is important for a service that has seen growth flag in recent months but is viewed as critical to Disney's future.\nHowever, Disney's share price tumbled by more than 8% with investors remaining wary of its prospects. \nDisney told investors that a planned password crackdown, which will start in some countries this summer and roll out globally in September, should help drive subscriber sign-ups in the months ahead. \nIt is also hoping a number of sequels bring fans to the box office. \nDisney has follow-ups to its Moana and Inside Out movies as well as sequels for Planet of the Apes and Deadpool. \nChief executive Bob Iger, whom Disney brought out of retirement in 2022 to boost profits and investor confidence, admitted that the company was \"swinging back a bit to lean on sequels\" after a period in which some of its new films flopped.\n\"Given the competition in the overall movie market, there's a lot of value in sequels obviously because they're known and cost less in terms of marketing,\" he said.\nMr Iger added that the company would strike a \"balance\" with new films, while cutting back on Marvel films and television shows to ensure what is produced is higher quality. \nDisney's sprawling empire, which includes news stations, sports-focused ESPN as well as theme parks and cruise lines beyond its film and television studio, has been buffeted by changes in the entertainment industry.\nMr Iger recently fended off a campaign by investment groups, which had accused the company of being slow to respond.\nIn the most recent quarter, revenues in Disney's traditional television business continued to drop, falling 8%, as subscribers cancelled and advertising declined. \nBut Mr Iger said his turnaround plan was working, noting that Disney+ reported an operating profit of $47m in the first three months of the year, compared with a loss of $587m in the same period a year ago.\nIncluding ESPN+ and Hulu, home to hits such as Shogun, operating losses for its streaming businesses narrowed to $18m in the quarter from $659m a year ago. \n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely rare in streaming to hear the word \u2018profitable\u2019 but Disney finally achieved it, kind of,\" said Mike Proulx, research director at Forrester.\n\"This is a big turning point for Disney and for the streaming market in general so long as content quality and frequency don\u2019t get compromised,\" he added.\nRevenue in the company's experiences division, which includes its theme parks and cruise lines, grew 10%. \nIt warned investors that it was seeing signs that travel was moderating from the post-Covid boom, but said it expected growth to rebound later this year. \nOverall, the company said revenue rose about 1% to $22.1bn.\nIt reported an overall loss of $20m, which was affected by a $2bn charge related to the merger deal it struck for its business in India, which has struggled after it lost key rights to show certain cricket matches.

    "Donald Trump's lawyer attacked Stormy Daniels' credibility during heated cross-examination at the former president's hush money trial.\n\"Am I correct that you hate President Trump?\" asked Susan Necheles during tense questioning in New York that at points descended into a shouting match. \n\"Yes,\" said the former adult-film star. \nMs Daniels' alleged sexual encounter with Mr Trump is at the centre of the former president's first criminal trial.\nMr Trump denies falsifying accounts to cover up a $130,000 hush-money payment to Ms Daniels.\nMs Daniels detailed time she says she spent with Mr Trump - an account that led to a combative cross-examination.\nMs Necheles, one of Mr Trump's defence lawyers, worked to paint Ms Daniels as driven by hatred and a desire for money.  Mr Trump has denied that the sexual encounter with her occurred.\nThe exchanges between the two women grew increasingly heated - they were nearly shouting - when Ms Necheles accused Ms Daniels of trying to extort Mr Trump through the hush-money deal. \n\"False,\" Ms Daniels replied. \"That's what you did, right?\" Ms Necheles said. \"False!\" Ms Daniels repeated.\nMs Daniels' claim - that she received $130,000 (\u00a3103,000) from Mr Trump's personal lawyer in 2016 in exchange for her silence about having sex with him 10 years earlier - is at the centre of the historic New York trial, the first criminal trial of a former US president. \nMr Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal paying Ms Daniels to hide the alleged sexual encounter. He has denied all wrongdoing.\nEarlier in the day, under questioning from the prosecution, Ms Daniels provided a detailed picture of her alleged encounters with Mr Trump. \nBut the star witness was repeatedly reprimanded by the judge for her meandering answers.\n\"Ms Daniels, please just keep the answers short,\" Justice Juan Merchan said.\nAdding to the tension, lawyers for Mr Trump objected to nearly every question prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked Ms Daniel about the alleged encounter. Justice Merchan mostly sustained the objections, siding with the defence. \nAs the day went on, however, prosecutors objected to several of Ms Necheles' questions on cross-examination. Those also were sustained. \nBBC News reporters are in the Manhattan courtroom covering the historic first criminal trial of a former US president. You'll find their updates and analysis on the BBC news website and app, and across TV, radio and podcasts.\nMs Daniels was allowed to walk jurors through some of her alleged encounter with Mr Trump inside his Lake Tahoe hotel suite in 2006.\nMr Trump was wearing silk pyjamas, she said, and asked her several \"business-like\" questions about her family, her upbringing and her work in the adult film industry. \nAt one point, he compared Ms Daniels to his daughter Ivanka, Ms Daniels said, saying that people underestimated both women because they were beautiful. \nMs Daniels also explained how the hush-money deal came to be, saying she first became interested in selling her story once she heard someone else was planning to. \n\"I'd rather make the money than someone making the money off of me,\" she said. \nBy 2016, after Mr Trump had launched his campaign for president, Ms Daniels learned Mr Trump and his lawyer, Michael Cohen, wanted to buy her story. The deal would be a win-win, Ms Daniels testified, because she did not want her then-partner to find out about her alleged encounter with Mr Trump.\nBut Ms Daniels claimed she was not particularly motivated by the money, saying on the stand she \"didn't care\" about the sum she was eventually paid to her by Mr Cohen.\nAnd Ms Daniels also laid out some of the specifics of the alleged deal, saying she would be forced to pay $1 million every time she violated the agreement and spoke out about her experience with Mr Trump. \nMost of what Ms Daniels' shared on Tuesday is not new information, it's been shared by Ms Daniels in a number of interviews and in her memoir. But her story carries some added weight now, told face to face with Mr Trump as part of the unprecedented criminal charges brought against him. ",
    "Police in Slovakia are trying to find out who sent more than 1,000 bomb threats to schools and other institutions on Tuesday.\nPolice teams with sniffer dogs and bomb disposal experts were called out repeatedly across the country. \nThe alerts prompted mass evacuations. \nOfficials said they were treating the threats \"as a particularly serious crime of terrorist attack\".\nEmails from an anonymous sender reportedly began arriving at 05:00, alleging that explosives were stored in hundreds of schools spanning the country's eight regions.\nThe number of confirmed threats issued has reportedly been growing.\nOfficials have not specified what is in the threats. But according to TV reports, they were written in Slovak, sent from a Russian email address and targeted what the author described as enemies of Islam.\nClasses were suspended as specialist teams investigated the alerts. The vast majority were sent to schools, but Slovakia's national police announced on social media that at least 110 banks and 40 electrical stores also received the bomb threats.\nPolice say they are working intensively, co-operating with security services to identify those behind the threats.\nAuthorities said the threats had caused psychological stress across the country, adding that the disruption to educational services could have \"far-reaching consequences\".\nIt comes after similar emails were reportedly sent to more than 120 schools in the Bratislava region last week, according to police.\nIf caught, the perpetrator faces life imprisonment.\nThe incidents come at a time of heightened tensions over the war in neighbouring Ukraine.\nIn April, Slovakia's newly elected populist-nationalist leader, Robert Fico, pledged not to send \"one more round of ammunition\" to Ukraine.\nFor months, Ukrainian forces have struggled to defend their front lines from the Russian advance because of a shortage of shells, rockets and air defences.\nBut Mr Fico has refused to join about 20 countries that have signed up to a Czech-led operation to procure large quantities of artillery ammunition on the global arms market.\n",
    "The red flags start at Belgrade\u2019s Nikola Tesla Airport and run all the way along the motorway into the centre of Serbia\u2019s capital.\nThis is Serbia\u2019s way of showing that it is proud of its \u201cironclad friendship\u201d with China \u2013 and welcoming Xi Jinping to Belgrade.\nAt the Western City Gate, more commonly known as the Genex Tower, one entire tower is draped in China\u2019s national colours.\nJust for good measure, there is a billboard for Hisense, the Chinese home appliances manufacturer which opened a refrigerator factory in Valjevo, western Serbia, last year.\nIn some parts of Europe, the Chinese president\u2019s itinerary might have raised eyebrows. After all, it is not often that Serbia finds itself as part of a three-stop tour by an international leader of such stature.\nBut Serbia has been deepening its relationship with China in recent years, even as it continues with negotiations to join the European Union.\nMr Xi is likely to use his trip to highlight his criticisms of Nato. His visit coincides with the 25th anniversary of the US airstrikes on China\u2019s embassy in Belgrade. And in an editorial for the Serbian newspaper, Politika, the president made it clear that feelings over that incident still run high.\n\u201cWe should never forget,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such tragic history to repeat itself.\u201d\nThat kind of rhetoric resonates in Serbia, where the vast majority of people oppose Nato membership. That is a key factor in why this stop on Mr Xi\u2019s European tour makes perfect sense.\nCommercial connections are also a factor. The two countries signed a free trade agreement last year, building on a \u201ccomprehensive strategic partnership\u201d in 2016 \u2013 the year of Mr Xi\u2019s previous visit to Serbia.\nChina now claims to be the largest source of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Serbia. Its ambassador, Li Ming, says that Hisense, along with mining company Zijin and tyre manufacturer Linglong, provide 20,000 jobs.\nUN trade figures actually put China in fifth place on the foreign direct investment list, behind Germany, Italy, the US and Russia.\nNonetheless, the Chinese investments are eye-catching \u2013 and only likely to increase. Serbia has just taken delivery of its first Chinese electric high-speed trains. They will eventually run alongside Swiss-made rolling stock on the Belgrade-Budapest railway, which is being reconstructed with Chinese expertise and finance.\nAnd that is just the start. Serbia\u2019s infrastructure minister, Goran Vesic, says Chinese partners will work on other infrastructure, including roads, bridges, tunnels and sewage. \u201cThere is really a lot of room for co-operation with Chinese companies,\u201d he told Serbia\u2019s national broadcaster, RTS.\nNo wonder Serbia\u2019s president, Aleksandar Vucic, is planning to personally serve the finest wines his country has to offer to his Chinese counterpart during a banquet in Mr Xi\u2019s honour.\nNoting that within five years Serbian wine will face no import tariffs in China, Mr Vucic told China Central Television that Serbian wines were \u201cnot as expensive as [those] in France\u201d and that he believed Mr Xi was \u201cgoing to like\u201d his selections.\nThis was perhaps a gentle dig at Emmanuel Macron, who hosted Mr Xi for the first stop on his European trip. The French president\u2019s offering was a bottle of R\u00e9my Martin Louis XIII cognac, which would cost the best part of \u20ac5,000 in Belgrade.\nA trip to the Pyrenees was also included in the charm offensive \u2013 to sweeten pleas by Mr Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for Mr Xi to ensure more balanced trade with Europe and influence Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine.\nAfter Belgrade, the next stop for China\u2019s president will be Budapest, where he will meet his strongest ally among the leaders of EU member states, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.\nChinese investments are also a strong factor there \u2013 with a factory for electric car giant BYD among the projects that buttress Mr Orban\u2019s resistance to the EU consensus on everything from migration to providing arms to Ukraine.",
    "TikTok has filed a lawsuit aiming to block a US law that would ban the video app in the country unless it is sold by its Chinese parent company.\nIn the filing, the social media company called the act an \"extraordinary intrusion on free speech rights\" of the company and its 170 million American users. \nIt said the US had put forward only \"speculative concerns\" to justify the measure and asked the court to stop it.\nPresident Joe Biden signed the bill into law last month, citing national security justifications. \nIt followed years of debate in Washington, which has claimed that TikTok's Chinese ownership raises the risk that data on US users could fall into the hands of the Chinese government or be used for propaganda. \nTikTok has maintained it is independent of the government, while parent company ByteDance has said it has no plans to sell the business. \nThe Chinese government has criticised the law as US \"bullying\" of a foreign firm and signalled it would oppose a sale.\nIn a briefing with reporters on Tuesday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the law was \"not a ban. It is a divestment\".\nShe referred further questions to the Department of Justice which declined to comment. \nUnder the US law, app stores would be barred from offering TikTok in the US starting in January 2025, unless parent company ByteDance found a buyer. President Biden could extend that deadline by 90 days if talks are making progress. \nIn the filing with the DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday, TikTok said the sale requirement was \"simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.  And certainly not on the 270-day timeline required by the Act\".\nIt said the measure had unfairly singled out TikTok, creating a \u201ctwo-tiered speech regime with one set of rules for one named platform, and another set of rules for everyone else\u201d.\nIt noted that similar attempted bans, including by former president Donald Trump, had met with trouble in US courts.\nThe company added that the decision by many politicians, including Mr Biden, to maintain accounts on the app undermined the claims of a security threat. \nThe US has in the past restricted foreign ownership of broadcast television and radio stations, which require government licences to access public airwaves. \nTikTok said its business was distinct, and the government could not dictate ownership of \"privately created speech forums\".\nIt said it had spent more than $2bn in an effort to address US concerns, creating safeguards on US data. \nJacob Helberg, who leads a committee charged by Congress with monitoring the national security implications of US-China trade, said TikTok's investments were viewed in Washington as a \"deceptive marketing effort\".\nHe said the lawsuit was \"unserious\" and failed \"to address the national security question at hand\".\nBut Ashley Gorski, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union,  said TikTok's lawsuit made a persuasive case that the measure was an effective ban, despite White House claims to the contrary, raising free speech concerns. \n\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" she said. \n\"There is no public evidence of harm that would meet the extraordinarily high bar imposed by the first amendment.\"\nShe said comments by lawmakers, such as US Senator Mitt Romney, who recently tied the widespread support for the measure in Congress to the desire to shape US perceptions of the Israel-Gaza conflict, would make it harder for the US to defend the law. \nBut Congressman John Moolenaar, the current leader of the committee that helped to craft the law, said he was confident it would be upheld.\n\u201cCongress and the Executive Branch have concluded, based on both publicly available and classified information, that TikTok poses a grave risk to national security and the American people,\" he said.\n\"It is telling that TikTok would rather spend its time, money, and effort fighting in court than solving the problem by breaking up with the Chinese Communist Party.\"\nThe law aimed at TikTok is part of a number of actions the US has taken against Chinese technology firms in recent years, as tensions rise between the world's two biggest economies.\nSeparately on Tuesday, the Department of Commerce confirmed it had revoked permissions that had allowed US companies to export certain goods to Chinese technology giant Huawei.\nThe US sharply limited exports of items such as computer chips to Huawei starting in 2019, citing ties to the Chinese military.\nThe measures hit the company hard but more recently it appeared to mount a comeback.",
    "Fuelled by climate change, the world's oceans have broken temperature records every single day over the past year, a BBC analysis finds. \nNearly 50 days have smashed existing highs for the time of year by the largest margin in the satellite era.\nPlanet-warming gases are mostly to blame, but the natural weather event El Ni\u00f1o has also helped warm the seas.\nThe super-heated oceans have hit marine life hard and driven a new wave of coral bleaching.\nThe analysis is based on data from the EU's Copernicus Climate Service.\nCopernicus also confirmed that last month was the warmest April on record in terms of global air temperatures, extending that sequence of month-specific records to 11 in a row.\nFor many decades, the world's oceans have been the Earth's 'get-out-of-jail card' when it comes to climate change. \nNot only do they absorb around a quarter of the carbon dioxide that humans produce, they also soak up around 90% of the excess heat. \nBut over the past year, the oceans have displayed the most concerning evidence yet that they are struggling to cope, with the sea surface particularly feeling the heat.\nFrom March 2023, the average surface temperature of the global oceans started to shoot further and further above the long-term norm, hitting a new record high in August. \nRecent months have brought no respite, with the sea surface reaching a new global average daily high of 21.09C in February and March this year, according to Copernicus data. \nAs the graph below shows, not only has every single day since 4 May 2023 broken the daily record for the time of year, but on some days the margin has been huge.\nAround 47 days smashed the record for that day of the year by at least 0.3C, according to BBC analysis of Copernicus data. \nNever before in the satellite era had the margin of record been this big. \nThe biggest record-breaking days were 23 August 2023, 3 January 2024 and 5 January 2024, when the previous high was beaten by around 0.34C. \n\"The fact that all this heat is going into the ocean, and in fact, it's warming in some respects even more rapidly than we thought it would, is a cause for great concern,\" says Prof Mike Meredith from the British Antarctic Survey. \n\"These are real signs of the environment moving into areas where we really don't want it to be and if it carries on in that direction the consequences will be severe.\"\nThis human-driven ocean warming is having considerable impacts on global sea life and may even be shifting the seasonal cycle of sea temperatures, according to a recent study.\nPerhaps the most significant consequence of the recent warmth has been the mass bleaching of coral globally.\nThese key ocean nurseries turn white and die because the waters they live in grow too hot. They are a critical element in the ocean ecosystem, home to around a quarter of all marine species.\nUnusually warm seas may also have taken a direct toll on one of the most beloved ocean-going creatures in the coldest continent, the emperor penguin.\n\"There have been examples of the sea-ice collapsing before emperor chicks have properly fledged, and there have been mass drowning events,\" says Prof Meredith. \n\"The emperor penguin is a threatened species because of climate change, and the sea-ice and the ocean temperatures are strongly implicated in that.\"\nIn the UK, rising sea temperatures are having an impact, with a number of creatures having vanished completely from coastal locations - some barnacle species, for example.\n\"The problem of climate change is that it's happening too quickly for evolution to catch up with it,\" says marine biologist Dr Nova Mieszkowska from the University of Liverpool.  \nSign up here for our climate and environment newsletter.

As a result, it tends to push up the global average.\nEl Ni\u00f1o kicked into gear in June 2023 - after a prolonged period of cooler La Ni\u00f1a conditions - and reached a peak in December, although it has s",
    "A judge has indefinitely postponed Donald Trump's federal trial in Florida over his alleged mishandling of classified documents while in office.\nUS District Judge Aileen Cannon said that setting a trial date before resolving significant questions over trial evidence would be \"imprudent\".\nHer court order on Tuesday cancelled the 20 May 2024 start date she had previously set for the proceedings.\nThe trial is now unlikely to begin before the 5 November US election.\nMr Trump's lawyers have proposed that the trial be held after his presidential rematch with Joe Biden, his successor in the White House. Prosecutors meanwhile have pushed for it to take place this year.\nBut the 20 May date set by Judge Cannon appeared less and less likely to hold amid slow-moving deliberations over multiple pre-trial issues.\nThe former president is accused of keeping top-secret documents in his possession after leaving office, rather than returning them to the National Archives as prescribed by law.\nGovernment prosecutors have also alleged that he then obstructed efforts to take back the documents, including by plotting to erase security video at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\nMr Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has pleaded not guilty to the 40 felony counts against him, which range from conspiracy to obstruct justice to making false statements.\nAlso charged alongside him are his personal aide Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira, a property manager at Mar-a-Lago. Both men have also pleaded not guilty.\nDefence lawyers and prosecutors have repeatedly tussled in court over what classified evidence can be presented at trial, prompting a series of delays.\nSome legal commentators have also suggested that Judge Cannon, who has often sided with Mr Trump's arguments, is deliberately slow-walking the case on behalf of the man who appointed her to the court.\nIn her Tuesday filing, the judge scheduled additional hearings over pending concerns, including one in late July, and declined to set a new date for the trial to begin.\nFinalising a trial date at this juncture, she wrote, \"would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court\".\n\"The Court therefore vacates the current May 20, 2024, trial date (and associated calendar call), to be reset by separate order following resolution of the matters before the Court,\" she added.\nCarl Tobias, a law expert at the University of Richmond, said that Judge Cannon had failed to act to limit the \"delay tactics\" of Mr Trump's team. \n\"Some complications and delays may have been inevitable... but the judge's failure to take control and move the case, or to request help is surprising,\" he said.\nMr Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, is facing dozens of charges across three other criminal cases and is currently on trial in New York.\nBut he is also awaiting a Supreme Court ruling on his claims of presidential immunity, a decision he has argued could influence all the criminal cases against him.",
    "Euan McDougall was just 16 when he died from Aids in 1994 after being infected with HIV by blood products used to treat haemophilia.\nUnder the care of doctors at Yorkhill Children\u2019s hospital, he became one of the thousands of victims of what has been called the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS.\nHis mum Kate died earlier this year, exactly 30 years after her son.\nAccording to her ex-husband John, she is another victim of the scandal as she never got over her unwitting role in causing Euan\u2019s illness.\n\"The exceptional pressure ate away at her for decades, which saw a long, slow deterioration in her health,\" John says.\n\"She never got over what happened to Euan.\"\nLater this month, five years after it began taking evidence, a public inquiry into the infected blood scandal will publish its findings. \nJohn says he needs to make sure both Euan and Kate are remembered after it ends.\nEuan was born with haemophilia, a hereditary condition \u2013 of which Kate was a carrier \u2013 which put him at risk of life-threatening bleeds and restricted his life. \nBut in the late 1970s a new treatment regime was introduced which involved preventative injections of the blood-clotting agent Factor VIII.\nEuan was one of a group of more than 20 boys treated at Glasgow's children's hospital in Yorkhill, under the care of lead clinician Dr Michael Willoughby, then seen as a pioneer in his field.\nThe difference it made to Euan's life was phenomenal, his dad says. \n\"He learned to cycle \u2013 the little stabiliser wheels soon disappeared and he was cycling all over the place, playing in the garden, climbing trees,\" he says. \nBut then it all went tragically wrong.\nSome of the blood used to make Factor VIII was sourced from UK donors but often it was imported from the United States where donors were paid.\nThroughout the early 1980s there was growing evidence that some of the blood products were contaminated with HIV or Hepatitis C.\nEuan was not quite eight years old when he tested positive for HIV in 1985.\nFour years later, John and Kate were called to the hospital to be told the virus had \u201cactivated\u201d into full-blown Aids.\nBy September 1990, John says there had been a rapid change in Euan.\n\u201cHe shrunk in every direction, he just got smaller and smaller, thinner and thinner, skin and bones,\" he says. \n\"From being second tallest in his class he became the smallest. He used to be outgoing and he became more shy. It was physically obvious.\u201d\nNow 75, John still has the notebook where his wife logged all the hundreds of Factor VIII injections she gave Euan and the notes alongside them. \nAt least one of them \u2013 and probably many more \u2013 were the source of Euan\u2019s HIV infection. He says this always played on her mind.\n\u201cIt was an endless strain on Kate,\" he says. \n\u201cI remember after Euan died Kate said, \u2018I wish it was you\u2019. And then she said, \u2018I wish it was me. I wish it was anyone\u2019.\"\nJohn says doctors at Yorkhill never explained the risks of the blood products. \nHe says he found out in other ways. \nHe recalls a newspaper article stating that each batch of Factor VIII included blood from thousands of donors \u2013 making it so high risk that statistically all haemophiliacs were likely to become infected with HIV, and eventually die of Aids.\nIt left him with a sense of dread.\n\u201cAs parents we knew a bit about it,\" he says. \n\"The doctors knew a thousand times more than that. \n\"Haematology doctors were professionals in that field. We were very concerned. But the doctors were saying it was all ok \u2013 it\u2019s not a problem.\u201d\nWhile they were being reassured by the doctors at Yorkhill, the McDougalls were hearing first-hand warnings from Terry McStay, Kate\u2019s brother, who was also a haemophiliac and was being treated in Newcastle, where he lived.\nFrom the end of 1983 he had fallen ill, and was contacting the family every couple of months to tell them not to allow Euan to receive the American Factor VIII concentrate he'd been treated with.\nIn 1984, Kate's family went down to Newcastle to bring Terry home to Wishaw. A bed was made up for him downstairs in the living room beside the television, so the family could all sit together.\nTerry was the first haemophiliac to die of AIDS in Scotland, in November 1984, and it was front page news.  \nA year earlier the government had insisted there was no \"conclusive proof\" that HIV could be transmitted in blood but by the end of 1985, all Factor VIII products were heat-treated to kill the HIV virus.\nBy the time of Terry's death, Euan had been receiving Factor VIII for almost five years.\nIt was not until five weeks after her brother's death that Kate's log of treatments shows that Euan received \"heat-treated\" products for the first time. \nTerry had always insisted that this process was the only way to kill off any viruses in donated blood.\nBut it was too late. \nSix months later, at a regular appointment in April 1985, Kate was informed that Euan was HIV positive.\nAt that clinic, at least two other parents were given the same news.\nJohn",
    "A Ukrainian family living in the UK say they cannot return home after the theft of their passports on holiday.\nThe Buchko family, who have lived in Britain for two years, were in the Canary Islands last month but now do not have visas to get back to the UK.\nBohdan, who is about to sit his GCSEs, and siblings Daryna and Orest have been in Ukraine waiting for documents to gain entry and return via Poland.\nThe Home Office said it did not routinely comment on individual cases.\nWithout travel documents, Bohdan, 16, Daryna, 15, and Orest, nine were forced to return to Ukraine on emergency Ukrainian passports. Mum Mariana Buchko did not lose her passport and so was able to return to the UK. \nThey have since been issued new Ukrainian passports but Mariana says the Home Office has told her that issuing them with new visas to return to the UK could take up to eight weeks. \nShe is asking the UK government to speed up the process so that Bohdan can sit his GCSE exams, which begin this Friday.\nThe children need to get a new BRP visa, which lets you re-enter the UK once only, from Warsaw - a process handled by the Home Office - and then apply for the replacement visas once they are back in the UK.\nThe children's father, Vasyl Buchko, lives in Ukraine while his wife and children moved to Hertfordshire in April 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nVasyl has fought in the war. After sustaining an injury, he was given leave from the army and decided to surprise his children by taking them on holiday to Tenerife - their first in years. \nBut the holiday turned into a nightmare following the theft on 11 April.\n\"My children's passports and residency permits were stolen,\" Mariana Buchko told the BBC. \n\"This has caused havoc [for] our family as there is no procedure for quickly reissuing children's visas.\" \nShe said the nearest Ukrainian consulate was in Malaga - on the Spanish mainland - which they managed to get to after several days.\nThe consul could only issue them with emergency white passports for return to Ukraine. This meant her husband and children flying to Poland and catching three trains to Ukraine on 19 April. Vasyl has remained in Ukraine to fight.\nShe says she has been trying for weeks to get her children back to the UK. After being issued with new Ukrainian passports, they are now waiting to be issued new UK visas. But Mariana says she has been told the process could take weeks, meaning Bohdan will miss many of his GCSE exams, including Biology this Friday. \nIn the meantime, the children are staying with relatives in the capital, Kyiv, which Mariana says is causing them stress and anxiety. \n\"My children are currently in a war zone without their mother and isolated from their friends.\"\nAccording to Mariana, in Kyiv they hear air raid sirens up to five times a day and regularly spend time in shelters. \nRussia regularly targets the capital with cruise missiles and drones.\nDaryna Buchko recently spent her 15th birthday in Kyiv without her parents. \n\"My children feel sad and anxious without me,\" Mariana said. \nMonk's Walk school in Hertfordshire confirmed the two older children, who would usually be in attendance at the school, are believed to be in Ukraine.\nBeverley Piggott, of Welwyn, Hertfordshire, hosted the Buchko family for six months when they first moved to the UK. She says the process of sponsoring them to move to the UK in 2022 was much quicker.\nShe said she had spent the past three weeks attempting to get the family back to the UK. \n\"I have made hundreds of phone calls and sent hundreds of emails to our local MP, the Ukrainian embassy, British embassy, Home Office, Foreign Office and so-on.\n\"I am desperate to get these children back to the UK with their mother.\n\"It is absolutely heartbreaking.\"",
    "Children given everyday foods to treat milk and peanut allergies are showing dramatic signs of improvement, according to early trial results.\nFive NHS hospitals have joined a \u00a32.5m trial, thanks to funding from the Natasha Allergy Research Foundation.\nNatasha Ednan-Laperouse, from Fulham, west London, died in 2016 after suffering a severe allergic reaction to sesame baked into a Pret baguette.\nHer parents set up the foundation hoping to cure allergies with research.\nNadim and Tanya Ednan-Laperouse have also campaigned for a change in food laws.\nThe new clinical oral immunotherapy (OIT) trial is using everyday foods to build up an allergy patient's tolerance over time.\nFoods are given under medical supervision and the trial is also training NHS staff to offer OIT treatment.\nSibel Sonmez-Ajtai, paediatric allergy consultant and principal investigator at Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust, said: \"This study is enabling us to do something we would never have dreamed of doing before - giving patients the foods we know they are allergic to.\n\"This treatment is not a cure for a food allergy, but what it achieves is life-transforming.\n\"To have a patient who has had anaphylaxis to 4mls of milk to then tolerate 90mls within six to eight months is nothing less than a miracle.\"\nThomas Farmer, 11, was diagnosed with a severe peanut allergy when he was one. He can now eat six peanuts a day after joining the trial in Southampton.\nHis mother Lauren said joining the trial has \"taken away so much anxiety around food\".\n\"For Thomas to be able to achieve all this with no medicine, just off-the-shelf foods, is amazing,\" she said.\nSince joining the trial in Newcastle, Grace Fisher, five, who has a milk allergy, is now drinking 120ml milk a day. \nHer mother Emma said: \"Grace is over six months into this journey and is doing amazing.\n\"She is currently on 120ml of milk and loves her daily hot chocolates.\"\nTo date, 139 people aged two to 23 with allergies to peanuts or cow's milk have started treatment.\nThe trial is being run at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust.\nIt will shortly start in Scotland, with plans for Bristol and Leeds to also join.\nIf successful, the three-year trial could provide more evidence for everyday foods treatment to be made available on the NHS.\nAt the moment, one treatment paid for by the NHS is Palforzia - peanut powder capsules which build tolerance to peanuts.\nMrs Ednan-Laperouse said: \"If Natasha were alive today, this is exactly the type of research she would have loved to be part of.\n\"This is a major first step in our mission to make food allergies history. We look forward to seeing the final results.\"\nProfessor Arshad, head of the asthma, allergy and clinical immunology service at University Hospital of Southampton, said: \"The Natasha trial aims to do better for people living with food allergies.\n\"Our ultimate aim is a life without the risk of allergic reactions - reactions which for some can be severe and life-threatening.\"\nThe Natasha Allergy Research Foundation is funding the trial through donations made to the charity from firms including Pret, Lidl, Leon, Uber Eats, Greggs, Tesco, Just Eat, Co-op, Morrisons, KFC, Sainsbury's, Costa, Burger King, Domino's, Kellogg's, M&S, Muller and Waitrose.\nThe full results are expected in 2027.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Vaughan Gething told ministers during the pandemic that he was deleting messages from a group chat, it has emerged.\nThe now-first minister and then-health minister warned colleagues in 2020 that the messages could be captured by the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act.\nDespite admitting sending the message, Mr Gething told BBC Wales he never deleted any texts from his own phone, because he would not have the time or inclination.\nOpposition parties accused Mr Gething of potentially misleading the Covid inquiry over how the Welsh government retained information.\nIn a ministerial group chat on August 17 2020 Mr Gething wrote: \"I'm deleting the messages in this group.\n\"They can be captured in an FOI [Freedom of Information request] and I think we are all in the right place on the choice being made.\"\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies told the Welsh Parliament the messages were sent on iMessage - the Apple iPhone text messaging system. \nBBC Wales was told that the message, first reported by Nation.Cymru, was sent on a phone provided by the Senedd to Mr Gething.\nIn an interview on Tuesday he told the BBC he had \"not deleted messages that relate to decision making, and in fact I never deleted any text message from my phone, because I never had the time or inclination\".\nIn the Senedd chamber, Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth asked whether Mr Gething had perjured himself in his inquiry evidence.\nMr Gething asked Mr ap Iorwerth to withdraw the accusation, which he called \"obnoxious\".\nThe first minister suggested the message sought to avoid embarrassing comments between ministers coming to light.\nMeanwhile the Covid inquiry said it would be considering whether to take more evidence from Mr Gething.\nBoth opposition parties have written to the inquiry asking it to recall Mr Gething.\nIn First Minister\u2019s Questions Mr Gething told the Welsh Parliament that the message had been published \"without the context of the discussion\".\nMr Davies accused Mr Gething of trying to \"circumnavigate\" the FOI act and being in breach of the law and any commitments to public inquiries.\nMr Gething said Mr Davies was misreading the act, and said the messages related to a conversation between ministers about a Labour group meeting in August 2020.\n\"It is not about decision making to do with the pandemic. It's about comments that colleagues make to and about each other.\n\"It's about ensuring that we don't provide things that are potentially embarrassing,\" he said.\nMr ap Iorwerth quoted Mr Gething\u2019s evidence at the Covid inquiry where he said: \"I understood that we'd kept and maintained all the information that we should do\".\nPlaid Cymru's leader continued: \u201cDoes the first minister understand why people are asking today whether he committed perjury in giving that evidence under oath?\u201d\nMr Gething said the message related \"to a discussion within the Labour group, and about how people do and don't talk to each other\u201d.\n\u201cI reject completely the suggestion that I have not been honest with the Covid inquiry.\u201d\nLater he said he was \u201centirely relaxed\u201d about a screenshot of the message being seen by the inquiry, and said a unredacted version would be shared with the inquiry.\nMr ap Iorwerth, referring to the scandal surrounding Mr Gething\u2019s leadership donations, said: \u201cSadly the Senedd on all benches is losing faith in this first minister's ability to lead without distractions. Seven weeks in and his leadership is about survival.\u201d\nMr Gething said later: \u201cI hope that when the member has a fuller picture of events, he will withdraw the obnoxious accusation he has made.\u201d\nHe added: \"I say again: I have provided all of the information available to me. I have not deleted information by text or WhatsApp to try to avoid scrutiny.\"\nAt the Covid inquiry, on 11 March this year, Mr Gething said: \"I understood that we'd kept and maintained all the information that we should do, and it would be made available to this inquiry.\"\nIn a statement he had told the inquiry he had two Senedd phones. The first he had stopped using in July 2021 and which had its data transferred to a second phone.\nThe phone was returned for maintenance, he said in a witness statement, in June 2022, and was wiped.\nThe contents of the phone was backed up with the exception of text messages. \"I did not realise that at the time,\" he said.\nA spokesperson for the UK Covid-19 Inquiry said: \"These reports have been brought to the attention of the inquiry this morning. \n\"The inquiry is considering the information available and whether it is necessary to seek further evidence from Mr Gething.\"",

    "The Daily Telegraph leads with the proposed introduction of tougher age checks for users of sites such as Facebook and Instagram and says the firms risk being fined if they fail to comply. The paper carries an article by Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan, in which she says the government will no longer tolerate a \"wild west\", where children are \"force fed\" violence and harmful online content. In an editorial, the Times questions how effective the policy will be but it congratulates the government and the regulator for putting in place what it describes as the most thorough and balanced regime anywhere, to tackle the issue.\nThe i reports that the firm at the centre of a cyber attack on the Ministry of Defence has contracts with several other government departments, as well as the Metropolitan Police. The Times says the company provides both the Home Office and the Cabinet Office with payroll and HR functions. According to the paper, Whitehall sources say there's no evidence to suggest that the suspected Chinese hackers have data from other departments.\nThe Sun is one of several papers to highlight a report from a think tank, which claims that migration is to blame for almost 90% of housing shortfalls. The paper asks if politicians will ever \"wake up\" to the pressure caused by mass immigration, but also says too many MPs whine about property prices and then block all development. The Daily Express describes the report - by former minister Robert Jenrick - as \"hard-hitting\". It quotes him as saying the government must undo what he calls \"the disastrous post-Brexit liberalisations that betrayed the wishes of the British public for lower immigration\". \nThe Daily Telegraph reports that the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is being withdrawn worldwide. It mentions a legal document from earlier this year, in which the pharmaceutical giant admitted the vaccine could cause a rare and dangerous side effect. According to the paper, AstraZeneca insists the decision to withdraw the jab is not linked to the court case and has been done for commercial reasons. \nThe Times reflects on the Garrick Club's decision to allow female members for the first time in its 200-year history. The paper says the actors Nigel Havers and Stephen Fry were among members who spoke in favour of the change at a meeting last night. It quotes a supporter of the move saying that \"a remarkable club will become more remarkable\".\nThe Daily Mail says an announcement that the King is too busy to see Prince Harry on his visit to the UK will come as a ''crushing blow'' for the Duke of Sussex.

    "For years, Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump have been locked in a public battle over an alleged sexual encounter, a hush-money deal paid by the former president's fixer, and their respective efforts to own the very public narrative.\nThose tensions - and the salacious details that surround them - spilled out in court on Tuesday when Ms Daniels took the stand in Mr Trump's criminal trial to face him in court for the first time. \nThe former adult-film star, wearing loose-fitting black clothes and her hair pinned back, did not look at the former president for most of the day, except when she noted his dark blue suit after she was asked to point him out. \nShe spent much of her time on the stand recounting the sexual encounter that she claims to have had with the defendant - an act that sparked the allegations at the heart of the case - and pushing back at his legal team's scathing questions.\nMr Trump, meanwhile, spent parts of her evidence cursing and shaking his head. That prompted a warning from the judge, according to court transcripts published at the end of the day. \nThe former president faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. The charges stem from an alleged attempt to conceal a $130,000 payment to Ms Daniels aimed to keep her quiet about the purported tryst. \nHe has pleaded not guilty and denies any sexual encounter with her, though he has acknowledged that his ex-lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid her a sum to keep quiet about her claims.\nAs the woman who received the money, Ms Daniels was expected to appear in court at some point. But her testimony on Tuesday brought the most dramatic day of the trial yet.\nShe provided such lurid details about her encounter with Mr Trump that his lawyers called for a mistrial. Justice Juan Merchan acknowledged \"there were some things that would have been better left unsaid\" and warned prosecutors not to ask for specifics of such a personal nature. \nThe details, which she has previously shared, included her claim that they did not use a condom, that she spanked Mr Trump with a magazine, and the answers she allegedly elicited from the former president about his wife. \nThe trial has already dredged up an underworld of tabloid publishers and Hollywood lawyers, one of whom was employed by Ms Daniels to broker the hush payment. Her testimony on Tuesday appeared to be a step too far for the judge as well as Mr Trump's defence team, however. \nEarly in the day, Mr Trump's lawyers sought to have Justice Merchan limit what prosecutors could ask Ms Daniels about their alleged sexual encounter in 2006, and the pair's two subsequent meetings. \nThe prosecution argued that they needed to ask Ms Daniels about it to establish intent for the pay-out. Despite tighter parameters, her scandalous details still spilled out in unusually long answers. \nThis is not the first time Stormy Daniels has shared the details of her alleged sexual encounter with Mr Trump. Since the deal came to light, she has told her story on national television, in a self-titled documentary, to America's most famous broadcast journalist and in her book, Full Disclosure.\nBut this was the first time she shared it while the man she claims to have had sex with sat just a few feet away.  \nIn the morning session, Ms Daniels appeared nervous, speaking at such a brisk pace that both the prosecutor, Susan Hoffinger, and Justice Merchan asked her to slow down. \nAt times, it also appeared that her evidence got away from Ms Hoffinger, who received a stern warning from the judge to better control her witness.\nThe adult-film star kept her eyes on the jury while taking the court back to 2006, when she first encountered Mr Trump decked out in golf attire at a celebrity tournament. He asked her to join him for a meal, she recalled. \nMs Daniels told the court that she initially did not want to have dinner with him, but her publicist encouraged her, saying \"'What could possibly go wrong?'\" The line drew laughs from some in the courtroom.\nBBC News reporters are in the Manhattan courtroom covering the historic first criminal trial of a former US president. You'll find their updates and analysis on the BBC news website and app, and across TV, radio and podcasts.\nShe then described arriving at Mr Trump's suite later for dinner, where she said he met her at the door wearing silk pyjamas. \nMs Daniels told the court that she later went to the bathroom and, after coming back out, found Mr Trump lying in bed wearing only boxer shorts and a t-shirt.\nThey had sex, she said, and maintained that there was consent. Still, she told the court, the encounter had left her disoriented.\nMr Trump's lawyers objected multiple times to the prosecutors' line of questioning before they cross-examined Ms Daniels. \nProsecutors had ensured that guardrails the court had imposed on Ms Daniels' testimony had flown off, attorney Todd Blanche said. Her details about Mr Trump were \"unduly prejudicial\" to the point that they did not believe they could be fixed during",
    "A town in Surrey could soon lose its fire station, while others could face service changes, the county's fire service has said.\nChief fire officer Dan Quin said Banstead fire station was \"no longer fit-for-purpose\" and the service was looking at moving its engine and crew to Godstone - nine miles away.\nBanstead resident Chris Bourner told BBC Radio Surrey the plans made him feel vulnerable.\nBut Mr Quin said he could \"assure\" residents that response times would still not exceed a 10-minute target.\nThe average response time to critical incidents in Reigate and Banstead is seven minutes and 23 seconds. \nIt would increase to eight minutes and three seconds if the move goes ahead, Surrey Fire and Rescue Service\u2019s draft community risk management plan (CRMP) said.\nThe figure for Tandridge is currently eight minutes and 42 seconds, which would be cut by 10 seconds under the plans.\nHowever, local resident Mr Bourner said: \"You can't expect the poor [crews] to meet the time [targets]... if it's going to move away.\"\nBut Mr Quin said Banstead did not have adequate facilities for its crew, which already visited neighbouring stations to carry out training.\nMeanwhile, the lease on Banstead fire station cannot be renewed past 2025, according to the CRMP.\nThe service is also proposing changes to staffing at five other stations.\nMr Quin said the number of incidents did not fluctuate per day of the week, but there were five more engines available during the day at weekends than during the week. \nThe plan is to scrap weekend daytime on-call fire engines in Chobham, Dunsfold, Gomshall, Guildford and Lingfield.\nStaff who are usually on-call at weekends would then be available during the night instead, which is when they are most needed, the fire service said.\nMeanwhile, Camberley's daytime fire engine and crew would be moved Elmbridge or Spelthorne to cover night shifts, as the CRMP said Camberley was over-staffed.\nCamberley will still have a 24-hour fire engine.\nIn summer months however, it said additional resources would be put into Camberley to address the risk of wildfires.\nA public consultation on the proposals lasts until 31 July, with a decision made by the fire authority in January.\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, and on X.

    "Police in India have opened a case against senior leaders of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over a social media post that opposition leaders say \"demonises Muslims\".\nThe animated video depicts senior Congress party leaders granting benefits to Muslims at the expense of marginalised castes and tribespeople.\nHours after the police case opened, the Election Commission asked X (formerly Twitter) to remove the video.\nIt said the post violated Indian law.\nThere was no immediate response from X or the BJP.\nIn its order, the Election Commission says its chief electoral officer in Karnataka (the video was posted by the BJP's Karnataka state unit) had \"already directed\" X to take down the post on Sunday, but that this hadn't been done yet. Voting in Karnataka was held on Tuesday and ended in the early evening local time.\nThis is the second such video the BJP has posted online in the past two weeks. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also made similar claims about the opposition favouring the Muslim minority over other social groups at election rallies.\nIndia is several weeks into a general election that ends in June, and according to the model code of conduct, parties and leaders are barred from using religious issues to seek votes.\nBut opposition leaders and political commentators say PM Modi, who's seeking a rare third term in a row, and other leaders from his Hindu nationalist party are resorting to blatant Islamophobia. They have also criticised the Election Commission (EC) for not taking timely action against them.\nIndia's 200 million Muslims are the largest minority group in the country. Anti-Muslim hate speech has surged in the country since the BJP came to power in 2014.\nThe video, posted on the BJP's social media page in Karnataka on 4 May, is captioned \"Beware... Beware... Beware...!\" in Kannada language which is spoken in the southern state. It has been viewed more than nine million times on X.\nIt shows caricatures of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Karnataka Chief Minister K Siddaramaiah, who belongs to the same party, placing an egg marked \"Muslims\" in a nest next to three eggs marked \"SC\" and \"OBC\" (referring to marginalised castes) and  \"ST\" (referring to marginalised tribes).\nWhen the eggs hatch, Mr Gandhi is seen feeding \"funds\" to the chick which is wearing a skullcap and has a menacing expression. The chick then grows bigger and edges out the others from the nest.\nThe Congress lodged a complaint against the video with the EC on Sunday, following which the Karnataka police registered a case against BJP President JP Nadda, its party chief in Karnataka, BY Vijayendra and the party's IT department head, Amit Malviya.\nIn a post on X, Congress party MP Manickam Tagore criticised the video, saying that the \"blatant demonisation of minorities by BJP is unacceptable\". \n\"The Election Commission must wake up to its responsibility and address the divisive tactics of the BJP. Unity, not division, should be the goal for a thriving democracy,\" he wrote.\nProfessor Nitasha Kaul, a British academic of Indian origin who teaches politics at the University of Westminster, described the video on X as \"a straightforward 1930s Germany-style cartoon\" and called it a violation of election rules.\nSeveral opposition leaders and civil society groups have flagged campaign videos and speeches by BJP leaders, particularly the prime minister, as \"unacceptable\" and \"divisive\".\n\"Shame is an understatement. This election officially has no rules left anymore for BJP or Modi,\" Saket Gokhale, an MP from the Trinamool Congress party, wrote on X.\nCongress leader Salman Anees Soz said the BJP's \"hatred of us Muslims has never been more blatant\".\nLast week, an animated video posted by the BJP on Instagram falsely accused the Congress of wanting to take wealth from non-Muslim Indians to distribute it to the Muslim community.\nIt garnered over a million views and remained online for at least 48 hours before it was taken down. Several users who reported the video later shared a notification from Instagram saying it had been removed.\nThe video was released just a week after opposition parties accused Mr Modi of making Islamophobic remarks for referring to Muslims as \"infiltrators\" and \"those who have many children\" in a campaign speech.\nBeginning and ending with a call to support Mr Modi, the video showed an animated version of Rahul Gandhi holding a copy of the Congress manifesto, which then morphs into Pakistan's national flag.\n\"The Congress manifesto is nothing but the Muslim League's ideology in disguise,\" an accompanying voiceover says, adding that Mr Modi alone can stop this from happening.\nThe video also refers to a 2006 speech by former prime minister Manmohan Singh - of the Congress party - in which he speaks about empowering minority communities in the country.\nMr Modi had referred to the speech during his election campaign in Rajasthan state last month. \"Their earlier [Congress] government had said that Muslims have the fir",
    "State involvement cannot be ruled out in a hack of an armed forces payroll system, the defence secretary has said. \nGrant Shapps told MPs the government had reason to believe the hack \"was the suspected work of a malign actor\" - and the BBC understands that ministers suspect China was responsible.\nThe system used by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) includes names and bank details of armed forces personnel.\nChina described the suggestion as a \"fabricated and malicious slander\".\nLabour's shadow defence secretary John Healey has alleged that the external contractor in charge of the hacked system was Shared Services Connected Ltd (SSCL).\nThe payroll system holds \"personal HMRC-style information\" for current regular, reservist and former members of the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force over a period of several years. In a very small number of cases, the data may include personal addresses.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak, while stopping short of naming the country responsible, said a \"malign actor\" had compromised the payroll system.  \nDowning Street said it was reviewing the security of the unnamed contractor's operations.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Mr Shapps criticised the contractor-operated system, saying there was \"evidence of failings\" by them and that it was totally separate to the core MoD network. \nMr Shapps apologised to the servicemen and women affected by the data breach and detailed an eight-point plan which included a specialist support helpline.\nHe told MPs the incident was \"further proof that the UK is facing rising and evolving threats\".\n\"For reasons of national security, we can't release further details of the suspected cyber-activity behind this incident\", Mr Shapps said.\n\"However, I can confirm to the House that we do have indications that this was the suspected work of a malign actor and we cannot rule out state involvement.\"\nThe government became aware of the data breach in recent days, and has not found evidence hackers removed data but is continuing to investigate. \nSources have told BBC News the investigation into who was behind the breach, which will be seen as embarrassing for the MoD, is at an early stage. \nIt can take months, sometimes years, to gather enough evidence to publicly accuse - so China is unlikely to be officially named today.\nHowever, that does seem to be where suspicions are pointing towards, especially in light of Beijing's track record of targeting these kind of data sets.\nWhen pressed on why the government is not naming China as responsible, the prime minister pointed to \"very robust\" government policy that means the UK can protect itself against the risk from China, and that defence spending had increased. \nService people affected by the hack will receive further information from the government about the breach and will be told any concerns are more about fraud risks rather than personal safety. \nIn an email sent to people affected on Tuesday, personnel were told they were confident May salaries will not be affected, but there may be slight delays to payments of routine expenses. \nIn response to the breach, Conservative MPs have raised concerns about the threat from China. \nTobias Ellwood, former chairman of the Commons Defence Committee, told BBC Radio's 4 Today programme: \"Targeting the names of the payroll system and service personnel's bank details, this does point to China because it can be as part of a plan, a strategy to see who might be coerced.\"\nHe pointed to China previously trying to gain information from ex-RAF pilots. \nIain Duncan Smith said the government must admit China poses a threat to the UK. \n\"No more pretence, China is a malign actor, supporting Russia with money and military equipment, working with Iran and North Korea in a new axis of totalitarian states,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, Labour's Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey said there were \"serious questions\" for Mr Shapps and \"any such hostile action is utterly unacceptable\".  \nIn a statement, the Chinese embassy in the UK said it strongly opposed the suggestion China was responsible and it had no need to \"meddle in the internal affairs of the UK\".\n\"We urge the relevant parties in the UK to stop spreading false information, stop fabricating so-called China threat narratives, and stop their anti-China political farce,\" a spokesman said. \nLast year, the government published an updated version of its long-term defence strategy which said the use of \"commercial spyware, ransomware and offensive cyber capabilities by state and non-state actors has proliferated\".\nIn March, the government publicly accused China of being behind an August 2021 hack targeting the details of millions of voters held by the Electoral Commission. \nIn December 2023, the National Cyber Security Centre said Russian intelligence was behind a \"malicious cyber activity attempting to interfere in UK politics and democratic processes\".\nPublic institutions and private firms have also been targeted by hackers demanding ran",
    "Manx politicians have given their support to a proposed laws that would lead to making period products free for those who need them being drafted. \nJoney Faragher MHK asked for permission to introduce a private member's bill in the House of Keys on Tuesday.\nIt follows a call by campaign group the Manx Menstrual Movement for the island to follow Scotland in making products free.\nThe Douglas East MHK told politicians research in the UK had found that \"one in four women\" with lower incomes had missed at least one day from work due to being unable to afford period products.\nMs Faragher said there was a \"toxic trio\" of factors that fueled period poverty, namely a lack of education around periods, stigma or shame and the cost of products. \nShe said: \"Menstruation is just health, it is a normal part of life and products should be as available in public facilities as toilet roll.\"\nThe bill would ensure periods could be managed \"with dignity and without financial strain\" to avoid some people are having to make the choice between spending money on period products and food, she said.\nAlongside seeking free period products, Ms Faragher said that better education was needed to help remove the stigma around periods. \nHealth and Social Care Minister Lawrie Hooper said that while he was supportive of Ms Faragher having leave to introduce the bill, he raised concerns about the level of work being expected from the his department, \nThe proposed legislation would be the fifth private member's bill that would directly affect his department, and \"the priority work for the department will remain what is set out in the island plan\", he added.\nCabinet Office Minister Kate Lord-Brennan said, given that taxpayers would be funding the matter, she needed more information about the scheme before she could support it to ensure it reached those most in need.\nSeveral members also suggested that work could be done with the third sector to reach Ms Faragher aim without the need for primary legislation. \nThe vote to grant leave to introduce the bill was backed by 20 of the 24 MHKs.\nWhy not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook, external and X, external?

    "Up until about 70 years ago, herring fishing provided a livelihood to hundreds of Scottish women.\nThey were dubbed the Herring Girls, and between June to September travelled from port to port following fleets of boats to gut and pack fish into barrels for export.\nWick, nicknamed the herring capital of Europe due to the volume of fish landed there, was one of the fish gutters' key destinations.\n\"They were called Herring Girls, even though many were adult women,\" says Ian Leith of history group The Wick Society\n\"Maybe it sounded a bit better than gutters.\n\"Gutting fish was a tough job. It was a mucky job.\"\nThe women worked in curing yards at long troughs called farlins. The work stations, along with the women's clothes, quickly became covered by smelly, slimy fish innards. \nThe gutters had to work fast because they were paid by how many barrels they could fill.\nIan says: \"They were gutting fish at a speed of 40 to 50 a minute - with a sharp knife.\"\n\"From anything I have seen and heard told of the herring gutters there was a social side to the work too,\" says Ian.\n\"The women worked in teams of three or five, and sometimes they were from the same family.\n\"If it was a team of three you had two gutting and one packing fish into barrels.\"\nIn Wick, the work was focused on Lower Pultneytown, a part of Wick designed in the 19th Century by famous Scots engineer Thomas Telford to support Britain's booming fishing industry.\nIan says: \"Millions of fish would come through Wick. \n\"It is said the population of the town would grow by three times during the herring season.\"\nBut with no fishing on Sundays, in observation of the Sabbath, Saturday nights offered a rare chance of some time off for fishermen and gutters.\n\"At one point there were 43 pubs just in the Lower Pultney area,\" says Ian.\nFrom Wick, the gutters followed the fishing boats on the trail of herring as they migrated south down Scotland and England's coasts. \nMany of the gutters finished the season in Yarmouth on England's south east coast.\nThe women travelled by train, and there are accounts of carriages filled with the singing of hymns and Gaelic songs and the gutters making tea on small stoves.\nTheir personal possessions were packed into a wooden box called a kist, and the women would take home sticks of rock from English seaside towns as a treat for their families. \nWick celebrated its close connection to the industry through its Herring Queen Festival. \nIt was started in the 1930s and local schoolchildren chose a girl to be the queen.\nOn the big day the queen, along with her attendants, would sail into Wick harbour in a fishing boat.\nRay Richard was 17 when she was crowned Herring Queen in 1949, the first year the festival was held in 10 years due to the impact of World War Two. She was Ray Mackay at the time.\nNow 92, she remembers how when she was young a girl she would play with her best friend in the Stewart's curing yard in Wick. Her grandfather had been a fisherman from Island Roan in Sutherland.\n\"I would watch the gutters and packers and think 'I hope I don't have to do that',\" she says. Instead she went on to have a long career in the NHS.\n\"My brother and other boys would collect fish that dropped to the ground as they were brought ashore,\" she recalled.\n\"They would then go round doors selling them.\"\nRay's Herring Queen white dress and blue velvet cloak was handmade by a previous holder of the crown, Isobel Cormack.\n\"It was such a lovely day,\" says Ray of her big day.\n\"The queen's boat came right into the harbour and the other boats were blowing their horns.\"\nBut the herring boom was not to last.\nThere were periods of disruption caused by the two world wars, with many fishermen joining the merchant or Royal Navy.\nBut the biggest factor was overfishing and the herring boom in Scotland finally came to an end in the 1960s.\nWick's last Herring Queen was crowned in 1953.\nToday, many of the old buildings in Lower Pultneytown have protected status.\nLittle fishing is done from its harbour, but new employment has been created around the offshore renewables sector.",
    "A man accused of killing and dismembering a man's body said he did it in self-defence, a court heard. \nBenjamin Atkins, 49, and Debbie Pereira, 39, from Bournemouth, Dorset, are on trial for the murder of Simon Shotton.\nThe 48-year-old's legs were found in packages on the Manor Steps Zig Zag footpath on Boscombe seafront in Bournemouth in August 2023.\nBoth deny murder.\nWinchester Crown Court was previously told a member of the public was sheltering under a tree when a package containing human remains landed beside her.\nGiving evidence, Mr Atkins said he first met Mr Shotton to buy drugs and that Mr Shotton would then provide drugs in lieu of paying rent. \nHe said they were \"never pals\" and he began to get frustrated with Mr Shotton for \"treating our house like a hotel, very disrespectful\".\nMr Atkins said he received a \"threatening\" message from Mr Shotton saying he owed \u00a3270 and on 18 August, Mr Shotton showed up at the house to confront Mr Atkins and Ms Pereira.\nMr Atkins said: \"He had a knife in his hand, he poked me in the stomach with it a couple of times.\n\"He was going to kill me, there was no doubt about it. \n\"The only way I can describe it is terror.\"\nMr Atkins told the court he attempted to defend himself by stabbing Mr Shotton with the end of a plastic hairbrush until it snapped and hitting him over the head several times with a speaker.\nHe said that he went with Ms Pereira to sell Mr Shotton's phone at a Cash Creators shop, and added that was his co-defendant's \"only involvement\".\nDescribing his actions to dismember the body, Mr Atkins, a father-of-two, said he used \"copious amounts of various drugs\".\nHe told the court: \"I wouldn't have done that if I wasn't under the influence, I wouldn't have cut him up.

    "A mother who lost her seven-year-old to cancer who now has her own terminal diagnosis has shared her support for assisted dying.\nAntonya Cooper, 77, from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, wants to legalise assisted dying so human death is not \"so intolerably inhumane\".\nThe government remains neutral on the issue.\nMs Cooper's son Hamish died in 1981 aged seven years old after being diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma.\nNeuroblastoma is a rare cancer that mostly affects children.\nAssisted suicide - intentionally helping another person to end their life - is banned in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.\nOpponents to changing the law say it is to protect the vulnerable and ensure that nobody is pressured into dying sooner than they might otherwise.\nMs Cooper, who helped launch Neuroblastoma UK, said Hamish was five-years-old when diagnosed, and given a prognosis of three months.\nHe subsequently underwent 16 months of treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) which \"ruined parts of his body\" but extended his life, she said.\nSeeing the side effects of the \"beastly treatment\" was heart-breaking, but she said GOSH staff were \"so embracing\" and supportive.\nMs Cooper said Hamish's death was like an \"amputation\" that she would \"never get over\", but helping launch the neuroblastoma charity helped her cope.\nFour decades after Hamish's death she has been diagnosed with breast cancer, and more recently pancreatic cancer, which has spread to her liver and is incurable. \nShe said she was \"realistic about the probability of dying\" but that Hamish's suffering and her own diagnosis had cemented her feelings on assisted dying.\nMs Cooper, who has had four more children, has since joined Swiss assisted dying organisation Dignitas, organised her own funeral, and selected the plot where she wants to be buried.\nMPs recently carried out a parliamentary debate on assisted dying, discussing whether a change in the law is necessary.\nIn response Ms Cooper said: \"The whole point of assisted dying is to be able to seek a kind end for yourself if you know you're going anyway, and not to be wracked with pain and not to be testing the facilities of some local loving hospice.\"\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this story, the BBC Action Line has links to organisations which can offer support and advice\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

    "A West Yorkshire hospital has become the first in the UK to use new geospatial software to help pinpoint high-risk crumbling concrete panels.\nMore than 80% of floors, walls and ceilings at the Airedale Hospital, in Keighley, are made of Raac, or reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete, which has a lifespan of about 30 years.\nThough due to be rebuilt before 2030, in the meantime the hospital operates a rolling inspection programme to monitor more than 20,000 Raac planks across 52 departments.\nEstates Project Manager Richard Burgin said the new software allowed his team to instantly identify potential problems and help minimise disruption.\nPreviously, inspections relied on hand-written surveys to record defects, including cracks, movement or moisture, which were then transferred into a spreadsheet. \nPhotos were uploaded manually and separate paper floor plans updated to show the changes to risk across each ward. \nThe new Geographic Information System (GIS) collects information on iPads, reducing the risk of human error, and allows the survey team to run complex scenarios to help spot patterns of deterioration.\nMr Burgin said: \"The existing manual survey process was not capable of dealing with the sheer volume of work.\n\"It became obvious the hospital needed a single, joined-up view of Raac risk to generate the inspection frequencies and the ongoing programme of remediation works.\n\"The GIS has given us a more robust and resilient process, with a reduced risk of human error that instantly shows different levels of risk so we know where to focus.\n\"Raac has a major operational impact, sometimes disturbing clinical and operational functions so surveys and mitigation work needs to be accurate and fast and the system underpins that.\u201d\nDuncan Booth, from software developer Esri UK, said: \u201cGIS has made previously difficult to share data easily accessible, enabling the hospital to improve operational efficiency and make accurate decisions.\u201d\nIn May 2023 the government announced Airedale Hospital would be rebuilt as part of its New Hospital Programme, a \u00a320bn scheme to build or replace 40 hospitals.\nSpeaking at the time the chief executive of Airedale NHS Foundation Trust Foluke Ajayi said: \"I know I speak for all our incredible staff, patients, governors, volunteers and wider supporters when I say that this is the news that we have been waiting for.\"\n\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter)\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

    "Heavy rain during a thunderstorm led to flash flooding on Bank Holiday Monday in Leeds, as drivers abandoned cars and several roads were closed. \nA section of Low Lane in Horsforth between King George Road and St James Drive has shut \"until further notice\" due to a sink hole, the council said.\nWater was seen pouring onto the tracks at Horsforth railway station, with a wall on the platform left damaged. \nFlood warnings which were put in place have since been lifted. \nLeeds City Council said some drivers abandoned their cars on the A6120 ring road, with the weather closing the route between Weetwood Lane and King Lane. \nThe Environment Agency had issued flood alerts for several areas including Meanwood Beck, Wortley Beck and Oil Mill Beck at Horsforth Woodside. \nIt said surface water following the thunderstorm was likely to affect low spots on roads.\nThe local authority said a footpath had to close near Horsforth train station and the Fox and Hound pub due to weather damage. \nA Leeds City Council spokesperson said: \"During thunderstorms on Monday afternoon, parts of Leeds experienced close to a month's worth of rain in under three hours, and in some places over an even shorter period of time. \n\"Flash flooding has occurred across the city, with areas in the north and north-west particularly affected. There are a number of road closures as a result of the flooding, whilst the damage caused is assessed and repaired, with some bus routes affected.

    "Huddersfield Carnival will not be returning to mark its 40th anniversary year due to a lack of funding.\nThe event, which celebrates Caribbean culture, made a comeback in 2023 after a five year absence, with thousands of people watching the parade.\nHowever, organisers said it had failed to attract sufficient funds to enable it to go ahead this year.\nThey said Kirklees Council had been unable to offer any support due to financial pressures.\nOrganisers said they were dependent on grants and sponsorships to make the event a reality, but had only received the backing of one organisation this year, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. \nIn a statement on social media, the Huddersfield African Caribbean Cultural Trust and its subgroup Huddersfield Carnival Management Committee said the team were \"so proud of the hugely successful event in 2023\" but that 2024 had been \"significantly challenging\". \nThey said \"As communicated to you all, there has been no support from the council given the current financial pressures. Despite our best efforts contacting many local and national companies and businesses, we only secured funds from one local organisation.\"\nThe groups said they were unable to make a profitable income from last year's carnival \"due to restrictions on the Arts Council England funding received\".\nThe statement continued: \"Monies made from the bar and fairground went to the council as reimbursement towards their financial support.\n\"We have reached out to the community through social media, via WhatsApp, posters and radio, however, our fundraiser has not garnered the support we needed.\n\"Sadly, without the financial support of the Huddersfield and wider carnival community, we have been unable to raise the funds needed.\"\nOrganiser said they were going to take a \"much-needed but very short break\" before starting to plan for the 2025 carnival and any funds donated would go towards that.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "John Swinney will become Scotland's seventh first minister after being nominated by parliament.\nThe SNP leader is to succeed Humza Yousaf, who resigned from office earlier on Tuesday. \nMr Swinney was backed by 64 MSPs, while the Scottish Green cohort of seven MSPs abstained, guaranteeing him the required majority.\nHis appointment will be rubber-stamped by the King before he is officially sworn in at the Court of Session on Wednesday. \nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak posted on X that he looked forward to \"working constructively\" with the new first minister, \"focusing on the real issues that matter to families \u2013 delivering jobs, growth and better public services for people across Scotland\". \nMr Swinney, who has 16 years' cabinet experience and led the SNP between 2000 and 2004, will take office in the week the Scottish Parliament marked 25 years since devolution. \nHe was appointed SNP leader unopposed on Monday after potential rival Kate Forbes opted not to run. She has been pledged a \"significant\" role in Mr Swinney's government. \nA leadership contest was avoided after veteran SNP activist, Graeme McCormick, withdrew a rival bid following talks with Mr Swinney.\nIn his pitch to MSPs, Mr Swinney aimed to strike a conciliatory note, praising the achievements of other major parties in the devolved parliament.\nHe said he would listen to the views of those who voted for a pro-independence parties in the 2021 election, and those who voted against. \nHe would engage in \"the lifeblood of democracy, persuasion based on evidence, while respecting honest and honourable differences,\u201d he said.\nMr Swinney added his government would focus on the economy, the NHS and other public services, as well as \u201ca drive to lift children out of poverty\u201d.\nHe said it was \u201csomething of a surprise\u201d but an \u201cextraordinary privilege\u201d to become first minister having stood down from cabinet last year.\nThe SNP leader said the decision to run for the position had been made with his family, expressing \u201ceternal gratitude\u201d to his wife Elizabeth Quigley, who has multiple sclerosis and relies on him for support.\nHe pledged to be the \u201cfirst minister for everyone in Scotland\u201d, adding: \u201cI am here to serve you, I will give everything I have to build the best future for our country.\u201d\nEarlier Mr Yousaf told parliament it had been \"an honour and a privilege\u201d to lead the country.\nA son to Pakistani parents and the first Muslim to lead a country in western Europe, Mr Yousaf said he had been regularly told to \u201cgo home\u201d throughout his life.\n\"I have no other home than this one. I never will, I never have. My heart will forever belong to Scotland,\" he told MSPs. \nHolyrood's presiding officer will recommend to the King that Mr Swinney is appointed as first minister.\nHe is expected to be sworn in at the Court of Session on Wednesday.\nIn a final statement to parliament as first minister, Mr Yousaf said he had been \u201cblessed\u201d to hold the role.\nMr Swinney was challenged in the parliamentary vote by Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross, Labour leader Anas Sarwar and Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton - none of whom had a realistic chance of winning. \nMr Ross said the SNP had replaced \"one continuity candidate with another\".\nHe added after the result: \"Scotland waits to see whether he will be a nationalist leader, like his predecessors, or a national leader that Scotland needs to take our country forward.\"\nMr Sarwar told MSPs: \"Scotland needs a first minister who is focused on the future, not defending a record of failure or focused on the past.\" \nMr Cole-Hamilton accused the SNP of foregoing \"democratic process\" in its leadership contest and said Scotland needed \"new hope in our politics\". \nThe Scottish Greens, whose sudden departure from government sparked the change in first minister, abstained from the vote. \nCo-leader Lorna Slater said the SNP has the right to form a government, but \"does not have an automatic right to our votes\". \nShe told MSPs: \u201cIf our parties can continue to work towards a shared vision of a fairer, progressive, independent Scotland which takes its responsibilities to future generations seriously, our door remains open.\u201d\nLittle over a week ago, Mr Swinney's frontbench career had looked definitively over. \nHe stepped down from the cabinet in 2023 after 16 years in key roles under both Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon. \nIn the leadership contest that followed Ms Sturgeon's resignation, Mr Swinney took a back seat to \"create the space for a fresh perspective to emerge\".\nBut the implosion of Mr Yousaf's premiership, sparked by his decision to tear up the SNP government's power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens, triggered a search for a new SNP leader who could unite the party.\nAlmost immediately, Mr Swinney was publicly urged to stand by senior party members, including SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn, deputy party leader Keith Brown and several cabinet members.\nAddressing supporters on Monday, Mr Swinney said his decision to accept such calls w",
    "The author of a major review into gender services for under-18s in England has told MSPs that Scotland could benefit from adopting a more \"holistic\" approach to children's services. \nGiving evidence to Holyrood's Health, Social Care and Sport Committee, Dr Hilary Cass said young people with \"gender distress\" also often had struggles with mental health, neurodivergence or family issues.\nFollowing the publication of her review, Scotland's NHS paused prescribing puberty blockers to children referred by its specialist gender clinic.\nThe Scottish government said it was considering the review's findings. \nDr Cass told the committee that young people questioning their gender deserved the same standard of evidence as is applied in other areas of children's medicine, but there was insufficient evidence into the potential adverse effects of prescribing puberty blockers.\nShe said there had been \"significant misinformation\" circulated about evidence gathered on the efficacy of puberty blockers.\nMSPs heard Scotland could benefit from becoming a regional UK centre were research and data could be shared, while improving services that focus on mental health or anxiety would help children.\nDr Cass said it was not for her to comment on any political opinion in Scotland about her review but only to answer questions on the conclusions she had made.\nIt came after Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie refused to accept the Cass Review as a valid scientific document. \nThat contributed to a build up in tension with the SNP, which ultimately led to the collapse of the Bute House power-sharing agreement and the end of Humza Yousaf's reign as first minister. \nMr Yousaf said Mr Harvie's response was not \"not necessarily\" a factor in his decision to end the Bute House agreement.\nDr Cass said the \u201csingle most important take away\u201d from her review was that options should not \u201cforeclosed too soon\u201d for young people who are questioning their gender identity. \n\u201cA small number of these young people are going to benefit from a medical pathway for their gender distress,\" she told MSPs. \n\u201cBut equally for probably a larger number their gender distress is going to be solved in myriad other ways \u2013 whether that is has been a sort of developmental questioning period that spontaneously resolves or whether they resolve uncertainty about their sexuality and then their gender questioning resolves.\n\u201cOr whether they find that they don\u2019t want a very rigid medical pathway but just remain gender fluid or gender non-conforming in the longer term.\u201d\nDr Cass also warned gender questioning children experiencing \"distress\" were being passed to identity clinics because many doctors were \"fearful\" of the toxic debate about the issue. \nDr Cass said the review found that masculinising and feminising hormone treatments were appropriate for some young people, but that evidence was much less clear for puberty blockers.\n\u201cThere is no evidence that it buys time to think,\u201d she said, adding that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of those who go on puberty blockers do then go on to hormone treatment.\n\u201cSo it may be that it is altering the trajectory and making it less likely that once you start you will reconsider the options because you haven\u2019t gone through your own puberty, you haven\u2019t gone through that psycho-sexual pathway,\u201d Dr Cass said.\nShe told the inquiry there was no evidence that puberty blockers improved self-body image. She said one Dutch study had found \u201cweak evidence\u201d that they improved mental wellbeing, but no other study had \u201creally replicated that\u201d.\nShe said the one indication her review found was that they may be helpful, particularly for birth-registered males to prevent irreversible changes.\nHowever, she told MSPs a drawback of puberty blockers, which she said had become \u201calmost totemic\u201d as the route to get on to a treatment pathway, was they stopped an examination of other ways of addressing young people\u2019s distress \u2013 including \u201cevidence based\u201d treatment such as psychological support or medication.\nGreen MSP Gillian Mackay cited concerns that the review suggested a gender transition was the \"worst outcome\" for young people.\nDr Cass said a medical transition was a really important option for people who were going to have a long-term trans identity. \u201cAnd one from which many people do benefit.\u201d\nBut she warned the \u201crisk\u201d of starting that transition at a point when someone is still in the process of development is you give treatment to wrong person. \n\u201cThe reason that is a negative outcome is because medical transition does not come without costs in terms of effect on sexual function, fertility, knowns and unknowns about long-term bone health risk, the limitations of surgery.\n\u201cAll those costs which are well worthwhile if you have a long-term, stable trans identity but it\u2019s a high cost to pay if, in the longer term, you don\u2019t.\u201d\nShe said picking the \u201csweet point\u201d where medical professionals have a high level of certainty they are giving the treatment to the right people is \u201cvery",

Dr Gwyn said he was \"very much a free man\" and was able to move from job to job. \nHis natural ability in horticulture meant he was never short of work.\nIn 2021, a new rose, believed to be the first of its kind, was named in Ystumllyn's memory. \nHamilton also revealed that a poem has been stitched into the inside of his Burberry jacket by Children's Laureate Wales poet Alex Wharton.\nThe poem, titled The Gardener, is inspired by Ystumllyn's life after arriving in Wales. \n\"I hope the sun pours light upon our skin.

    "A panel leading a review into the cause of disorder in Leicester has appealed for people with evidence to contact them in confidence.\nDozens were arrested after days of vandalism, assaults, and attacks on property in the east of the city in September 2022. \nFormer Labour MP Lord Ian Austin was appointed to lead the review when it launched in 2023.\nThe panel is aiming to publish its findings in October. \nThe unrest followed tensions involving mainly young men from Hindu and Muslim communities, which culminated in large-scale disorder.\nLord Austin told the BBC on Tuesday that the Independent Leicester Review Panel had already heard from \"hundreds of local people\" as well as voluntary organisations, political leaders, the police, the city council and more. \nThe review was commissioned last year by the Secretary of State for the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, Michael Gove, in May 2023.\nThe government's decision to appoint Lord Austin was criticised by some Muslim organisations over comments he has made in the past.\nHe said he had spent a lifetime fighting prejudice and asked to meet communities in the city.\nLord Austin said: \"We have spoken to some people from the Muslim community. \n\"If people don't want to talk to me, they can speak to the other panel members and they can certainly take part in the online survey.\"\nBy Jeremy Ball, BBC East Midlands Today social affairs correspondent\nThe big question for the Leicester review is: Why did tensions erupt so badly?\nHow much was it about religion? How was it linked to changing patterns of immigration? \nHow much was it about different perceptions of anti-social behaviour? \nAnd, how was fear fuelled by misinformation that spread like wildfire online?\nThe panel also wants to hear suggestions about how to prevent future unrest in Leicester and across the country.\nIts recommendations will be for both the city and national government.\nSince the review launched, Lord Austin said the panellists had visited Leicester 15 times and had also held about 15 meetings online.\nThe call for evidence will be open until 4 June, and evidence can be submitted on the government website.\nAll responses to the appeal will be treated confidentially unless respondents state otherwise, the panel said.\nThe panel will also be speaking to local authorities and police forces in other parts of the country, and is speaking to experts about the role social media played. \nLord Austin added: \"In the end, if we're producing the report, it obviously makes sense for everybody to have their voice heard and this is going to make recommendations to the government, so why would you not want to?\"\nThe final report will share recommendations, with the aim of preventing the events in Leicester from happening again, in the city and elsewhere across the country. \nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "When Carol Alexander fell victim to an \u00a380,000 fraud, the \"huge trauma\" of it left her in shock for days.\nCarol had the money stolen from two accounts - one with a bank and one with an electronic money institution (EMI).\nBut while the bank refunded her within 24 hours, it took her 18 months and a ruling from the financial ombudsman to get a full refund from the EMI.\nNew regulations due to come into effect in October will offer far stronger protections to most victims of fraud.\nWith less than six months to go, the financial watchdog, the Payments Systems Regulator, is warning smaller firms, including EMIs, to make sure \"their houses are in order\".\nEMIs are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, but cannot describe themselves as banks because they do not have a banking licence.\nSome of the biggest and most well-known EMIs include Revolut and Wise.\nIn October 2022, Carol was targeted by criminals using the so-called \"energy rebate scam\", which exploited people's concerns in the run-up to a sharp rise in the cost of energy.\nBy innocently responding to a text message, Carol unwittingly gave scammers just a handful of personal details, which they then used to manipulate and trick her into thinking her money was at risk.\nFollowing up with phone calls purporting to be from her bank's specialist fraud team, the criminals groomed Carol and took control of her accounts.\n\"I was thinking about it all the time and I couldn't sleep at night,\" says Carol, who is from Hove, East Sussex.\nShe had nearly \u00a317,000 stolen from her Santander account and \u00a363,000 taken from her account with Tide, an EMI.\nIn Carol's case, she says the difference in how she was treated by her bank, Santander, and her EMI, Tide, could not have been more stark.\n\"The difference... was like night and day,\" says Carol. \"The bank was professional, they sent me details of remote access scams, they said that's what had happened. [It felt to me like] the EMI basically had no systems in place.\"\nSantander refunded the money the next day and apologised.\nAfter six weeks Tide refunded \u00a313.10, saying that was all it had been able to recover, and closed the case. \nIt recovered a further \u00a320,000 two months later but only refunded the remaining \u00a343,000 in April this year - 18 months on from when the fraud took place - after Carol took her case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, which ruled in her favour and ordered Tide to refund the money, plus thousands of pounds in interest.\nCarol's experience is exactly why the Payment Systems Regulator is bringing in changes this October under the Mandatory Reimbursement Requirement.\nClaire Simpson from the watchdog told the BBC these new rules will mean victims of fraud are all treated the same, a so-called \"equivalence of service\", regardless of where they keep their money.\n\"This is really big. We think this is a really, really significant step in both protecting customers from becoming victims of fraud in the first place by making sure that [firms] are incentivised to protect their customers, but also to ensure that when customers do become victims of fraud they are reimbursed in all but exceptional circumstances.\"\n\"This is a complete change in the landscape. It's incentivising these firms to stop fraud before it happens to us,\" said Arun Chauhan, a solicitor and trustee of the Fraud Advisory Panel.\n\"The smaller firms (EMIs) are growing very quickly, they have some great products. But the people who look at the fraud - there aren't enough of them - so that's where they're having to up their game.\n\"One thing about the smaller firms though is they are more nimble, they can change quickly and that's what we're seeing - they're sprinting to get ready [for the changes].\"\nTide said it was sorry for the stress Carol suffered in her case, that it was always enhancing its anti-fraud systems, and had further improved its fraud prevention capabilities in the time since Carol's case.\nUK Finance, which speaks for hundreds of financial firms, said: \"Different firms will be at different stages, but everyone is working hard to be ready.\"\nIt added: \"We need to continue the focus on stopping fraud in the first place and other sectors, who bear no cost of reimbursement, need to do much more to stop the fraud that is starting on their platforms and networks.\"\nYou can listen to the latest episode of Money Box here.\nFollow Money Box or Dan on X (formerly known as Twitter).",
    "The US has repatriated 11 of its citizens and six Canadian children from camps in north-eastern Syria, the state department announced. \nTen of the US citizens are reportedly members of a single family. The six Canadians are all children. \nFour Dutch citizens and a Finnish citizen were also repatriated by the state department, it says.\nAbout 30,000 people from 60 countries - most of them children - remain stranded in two overcrowded camps in Syria. \nThe camps, Al-Hol and Roj, are run by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which battled the Islamic State group for years until the fall of its so-called caliphate in early 2019.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it was the single largest repatriation of American citizens from camps in Syria to date. \nA nine-year-old non-US citizen sibling of one of the American children was also resettled in the US, the statement added. \nWhile the Americans were not named by the state department, US media have identified one of them as a Massachusetts-born woman, Brandy Salman, and her nine children now ranging in age from about seven to 26.\nThey arrived back in the US on Tuesday morning and Ms Salman will live initially with her mother in New Hampshire, according to National Public Radio.\nMs Salman's Turkish-American husband reportedly took the family to Syria in 2016. He was killed and the family was eventually taken into custody by the SDF. \nIt is unclear where Ms Salman and her family will be resettled, or whether she could face criminal charges. \nSome other US citizens who allegedly became members of the Islamic State group have faced charges of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorism, among other charges. Others have not been charged. \nThe New York Times has reported that two of the children being brought to the US - an American and his non-citizen adopted brother - are the sons of a Minnesota man named Abdelhamid Al-Madioum. \nAl-Madioum - a Moroccan-born American - travelled to Syria to join the Islamic State group in 2015. \nAfter being captured by the SDF in 2019, he was returned to Minnesota. In 2021, he pleaded guilty to charges of supporting terrorism. \nTo date, the US has repatriated 51 of its citizens from Syria. \nWhile Global Affairs Canada has acknowledged that six of its citizens, all minors, had been repatriated, it declined to give any further details, citing privacy concerns. \n\"The focus is now on protecting the children's privacy and ensuring they receive the support and care needed to begin a new life here in Canada,\" Global Affairs said in a statement. \nA Canadian lawyer working on their file, Lawrence Greenspon, told the BBC on Tuesday that the six are siblings and have been settled together with one family in Canada for the time being. \nLast year, Canada offered to repatriate the six children without their mother, which she refused. \nMr Greenspon said their mother is now out of the Islamic State camp in north-eastern Syria where she was at the time and is again seeking authorisation to return to Canada to be reunited with her children.  \nAbout 30,000 people from dozens of countries remain in the Al-Hol and Roj camps, where human rights groups have reported abuses and poor conditions. \nOthers have warned that children raised in the camps are vulnerable to radicalisation from Islamic State militants. \nSome countries, however, have resisted repatriating their citizens. \n\"The only durable solution to the humanitarian and security crisis in the displaced persons camps and detention facilities in north-east Syria is for countries to repatriate, rehabilitate, reintegrate and, where appropriate, ensure accountability for wrongdoing,\" Mr Blinken said in Tuesday's statement.

    "Labour's Andy Burnham wants to press pause on the Right to Buy scheme after claiming it was the reason the housing crisis had got \"worse every year\".\nHe has called on the government to \"suspend\" the Right to Buy housing scheme to allow for more social homes to be built across the county.\nMr Burnham has pledged to build 10,000 homes across Greater Manchester after he was elected for a third-term in the mayoral elections.\nThe Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) said it remained committed to Right to Buy, which had \"helped over two million social housing tenants to become homeowners\". \nRight to Buy allows most council tenants to buy their council home at a discount and supporters have said the scheme has helped people climb the housing ladder and secure their families' financial futures.\nHowever, Mr Burnham said the housing crisis was \"getting worse every year\" because of it.\nSpeaking on BBC Breakfast, he said: \"We lose social homes every year, and across Greater Manchester for the last year 500 social homes were lost. \n\"I'm saying to Whitehall and Westminster - you need to allow us to suspend Right to Buy from the new homes that we are building because if we don't, trying to solve the housing crisis is like trying to fill a bath but with the plug out because you try and build new homes but you lose them at the other end.\"\nMr Burnham hoped to solve the housing crisis in Greater Manchester within a decade by calling on the government to suspend, \"not end\" Right to Buy. \nIt formed part of his pledge to build 10,000 homes across the county, with at least 1,000 in every borough.\nBy working with public bodies to \"release brown field land\", he said the social homes would be a \"new generation of council homes which will be cheaper to run\". \n\"There is no solution to the housing crisis without building homes that people can truly afford,\" he added. \nMark Slater from Greater Manchester Tenants Union said the housebuilding plan was a \u201cstart\u201d for a region where new homes were desperately needed.\n\u201cIn Rochdale, for example, we have between 23,000 and 24,000 people on waiting lists, some of who have been waiting for five years, so to call it a crisis is putting it mildly.\u201d\nHe also backed calls to suspend right to buy, which Mr Salter said had reduced the stock of social housing \u201cquite dramatically\u201d.\nA DLUHC spokesman said: \"Local authorities oversee this [Right to Buy] process and can use money from sales and preferential borrowing rates to build new homes.\n\u201cThrough our long-term plan for housing we are building the homes the country needs, including additional social housing, and we have delivered over 696,100 new affordable homes, of which over 172,600 are for social rent, since 2010.\u201d\nAs part of his four-year term as mayor, Mr Burnham also wants to bring in a Greater Manchester Good Landlord charter to improve standards in the private rented sector. \nHe said: \"We are going to give our residents the right to request a property check if they are concerned their home is unfit or unsafe.\"\nThe mayor of Greater Manchester has the most powers of any elected mayor outside London and oversees decisions in relation to areas including public transport, strategic planning and housing, productivity and skills, economy and innovation, and the environment.\nThey also fulfil the role of police and crime commissioner as well as hold responsibility for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "A man who was shot dead outside a petrol station in Waringstown, County Down, was struck by at least six bullets whilst he sat in his BMW, Belfast Crown Court has heard.\nMalcolm McKeown was shot six times at close range in the head and body in August 2019.\nThe court heard a forensic expert who examined the scene after the murder concluded that at least 16 cartridges were fired from a minimum of two guns.\nThe four accused are 29-year-olds Jake O'Brien from Rectory Road in Lurgan and Andrew Thomas Kenneth Martin from Bridge Street in Banbridge, 35-year-old Stevie Lee Watson, from Princeton Avenue in Lurgan and 34-year old Simon Smyth from Hazelgrove Avenue in Lurgan.\nAll four have denied murdering 54-year-old Mr McKeown and of possessing firearms and ammunition, two firearms, and assorted bullets and cartridges, with intent to endanger life on the same date.\nCiaran Murphy KC told the court Mr McKeown was released from custody 12 days before his murder. \n\"Mr McKeown would, considering his background, have been wary of being attacked by other criminals,\" he said.\n\"He had been shot and seriously wounded in the past and he had received warnings from police about being under threat.\"\nThe court heard Mr McKeown was last seen alive at 19:19 BST on 19 August, when he walked out of Dewart's garage and got into his BMW, which was parked at the rear of the petrol station.\nLess than a minute later, a navy Volkswagen Passat was seen speeding away from the scene.\nIt was later found burned out in Lurgan.\nA sales assistant in the garage heard several loud bangs and assumed it was either fireworks or bangers, and when police arrived at the scene shortly after 21:00, Mr McKeown was found slumped over the driver's seat of the BMW.\nA post mortem examination found death was caused by bullet wounds to the head and body and that Mr McKeown has been \"struck by at least six bullets\".\nAfter the murder, items recovered from the burned-out Passat were forensically examined along with cartridges found beside Mr McKeown's car.\nThe court heard Mr O'Brien's DNA was found on a black disposal glove and a boiler suit found near the Passat, and he was also identified as one of two men running into a cul-de-sac close to where the Passat was dumped and set on fire.\nMr Martin was identified as the second man in the footage.\nThe court heard that in the days before the murder, Mr Martin had conducted searches about Mr McKeown on his phone and searched \"the act of killing aftermath\".\n \"This material evidences a distinct interest in Mr McKeown in the period before his death and is consistent with preparations for the killing,\" the prosecution barrister said\nHe said it was the Crown's case that all four accused \"had a role to play\".\nHe said when all the evidence had been presented, it would indicate \"all the accused were jointly responsible for the murder of Malcolm McKeown\".\nThe trial continues.",
    "The Ukrainian security service (SBU) says it has foiled a Russian plot to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelensky and other high-ranking Ukrainian officials.\nTwo Ukrainian government protection unit colonels have been arrested.\nThe SBU said they were part of a network of agents belonging to the Russian state security service (FSB).\nThey had reportedly been searching for willing \"executors\" among Mr Zelensky's bodyguards to kidnap and kill him.\nEver since Russian paratroopers attempted to land in Kyiv and assassinate President Zelensky in the early hours and days of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, plots to assassinate him have been commonplace. \nThe Ukrainian leader said at the start of the invasion he was Russia's \"number one target\".\nBut this alleged plot stands out from the rest. It involves serving colonels, whose job it was to keep officials and institutions safe, allegedly hired as moles.\nOther targets included military intelligence head Kyrylo Budanov and SBU chief Vasyl Malyuk, the agency added. \nThe group had reportedly planned to kill Mr Budanov before Orthodox Easter, which this year fell on 5 May.\nAccording to the SBU, the plotters had aimed to use a mole to get information about his location, which they would then have attacked with rockets, drones and anti-tank grenades. \nOne of the officers who was later arrested had already bought drones and anti-personnel mines, the SBU said. \nSBU head Vasyl Malyuk said the attack was supposed to be \"a gift to Putin before the inauguration\" - referring to Russia's Vladimir Putin who was sworn in for a fifth term as president at the Kremlin on Tuesday. \nThe operation turned into a failure of the Russian special services, Mr Malyuk said.\n\"But we must not forget - the enemy is strong and experienced, he cannot be underestimated,\" he added.\nThe two Ukrainian officials are being held on suspicion of treason and of preparing a terrorist act.\nThe SBU said three FSB employees oversaw the organisation and the attack. \nOne of them, named as Dmytro Perlin, had been recruiting \"moles\" since before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nAnother FSB employee, Oleksiy Kornev, reportedly held \"conspiratorial\" meetings \"in neighbouring European states\" before the invasion with one of the Ukrainian colonels arrested.\nIn a released interrogation with one of the suspects, they can be heard describing how they were paid thousands of dollars directly by parcels or indirectly through their relatives. It is not clear whether he was speaking under duress or not. \nInvestigators insist they monitored the men throughout. We are unlikely to know how close they came to carrying out their alleged plan. \nThe plot may read like a thriller but it is also a reminder of the risks Ukraine's wartime leader faces. \nLast month, a Polish man was arrested and charged with planning to co-operate with Russian intelligence services to aid a possible assassination of Mr Zelensky. \nAt the weekend Ukraine's president appeared on the Russian interior ministry's wanted list on unspecified charges. \nThe foreign ministry in Kyiv condemned the move as showing \"the desperation of the Russian state machine and propaganda\", and pointed out that the International Criminal Court had issued a warrant for Vladimir Putin's arrest.",
    "It's not just paparazzi waiting for celebrities on the red carpet.\nThe Glambot - a camera that captures glamourous slow-motion videos of A-listers - has captured hearts on social media.\nIt's also made a star of its operator, director Cole Walliser, and the pair have become a regular sight at industry events.\nBut any fans hoping to see looks from the Met Gala through its lens will have been disappointed by its absence.\nThe motion-controlled high-speed camera works by moving while it shoots thousands of images per second, giving a slow-motion effect.\n\"Together, you get this dynamic combination of these two types of camera tricks that make this really surreal, glamorous, gorgeous effect,\" says Cole.\nThe effect has been used for years in advertising but Cole says he was the first to bring it to the red carpet.\nCole has previously explained to his followers that the nature of the Met Gala, where celebrities climb dozens of steps straight from the street, makes it impossible to install the equipment. \n\"It's a camera that's on this giant robotic arm that moves very quickly,\" he told the BBC, in an interview recorded before the event.\n\"There's a safety component as well,\" he says. \"It's relatively close to talent.\"\nAnd the Metropolitan Museum in New York, which hosts the event, doesn't have the room outside. \nBut if Glambot couldn't come to the Met Gala, Cole suggested a plan B for A-listers - although not many rose to the challenge.\nIn an Instagram post Cole and E! Entertainment, which runs the Glambot, came up with a possible solution: \"A DIY Glambot in the Met bathrooms\".\nCole told the BBC he's seen a growing trend online of people trying to recreate the Glambot's shots on their phones.\n\"I think it's so awesome,\" he says.\n\"This thing that I've been doing for years is now a trend at home because of technology and phones and accessibility. \n\"It's just so cool to have people doing the thing that they see at home. I'm honoured and flattered.\"\nHe does admit though that he's seen \"varying levels of like success\" with the DIY videos online.\nCole has some tips for anyone trying to recreate the look.\n\"The best way to do it is to use slow-mo on your phone,\" he says.\nOpt for that over slow-mo settings in editing apps like TikTok, Cole advises, saying you'll get the smoothest results using your camera.\n\"Part of the reason why the Glambot's so good is we shoot at 1,000 frames a second. \n\"Obviously, a phone can't do that but newer phones can do like 240 [frames] which is pretty slow.\"\nThe next thing you're going to need is good lighting, he says, and once that's sorted, it's time to work on poses.\nSome of the Glambot's most popular shots include a hair flip from Anya Taylor-Joy and Ariana Grande twirling her dress.\n\"The more you move, kind of the better,\" says Cole. \"So I always push for movement.\n\"But sometimes talent does almost nothing and it's like the most gorgeous Glambot ever,\" he adds.\n\"Billie Eilish one year just put her hand on her face, she didn't really move otherwise and it was stunning.\"\nSo if you're trying at home - or in the Met's bathrooms - Cole says pose however you feel most comfortable.\n\"If you move in a way that's very natural to you, and you like feel good as you do it, this is most likely going to be a great Glambot,\" he says.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "Three large new electricity substations could be built on over 30 acres of farmland in west Wales.\nNational Grid Electricity Transmission have drawn up initial plans for a 400kV station and two 132kV stations for National Grid customers at the same site, occupying 12 fields.\nBut one local councillor has claimed that the development near the village of Llandyfaelog in Carmarthenshire is \"too big for the area\".\nNational Grid said its new substation is needed to \"strengthen the network and connect clean energy in the area\".\nThe proposed transmission station at Llandyfaelog will be for National Grid Electricity Transmission (NGET). \nThe two smaller substations will be for Green Gen Cymru, part of Bute Energy, who want to build a number of wind farms in Mid Wales, and the other will be for National Grid Electricity Distribution, which is the local network operator in the region. \nIn documents provided to Carmarthenshire council, National Grid indicate the total footprint of the site will cover 13.84 hectares, which is equivalent to roughly 34 acres.\nBBC Wales understands that the three substations could be built by the end of 2028. All three substations will be subject to individual planning applications, to be determined by Carmarthenshire council.\nRachel Evans, director for Wales, Countryside Alliance, said the development of windfarms and the associated infrastructure was leading to the \"industrialisation of rural Wales\".\n\"We're already losing a huge amount of land, thousands of acres under tree planting, and now it seems we're going to lose even more for the purpose of green energy,\" she said.\n\"I'm concerned this will have an affect on our food security here in Wales and reduce the number of livestock those farmers will keep. \n\"I understand the need for the infrastructure, but what I would prefer to see is projects on a smaller scale that won't have such a huge impact on communities like Llandyfaelog.\"\nThe scale of the development has caused concern for local councillor Meinir James, who said: \"We're talking here about a massive site. National Grid themselves say it will cover 12 agricultural fields, and will also border with 15 others. \n\"We're talking about 30 acres of land, affecting three farms primarily. It could affect the future of one farm and a young farmer who wants to stay in the area.\n\"We need clean energy,\u00a0but I think this development is too big for this area. It's better suited to a post-industrial site.\"\nLandowners declined to speak to BBC Wales, but Ms James said they too were \"worried and shocked\" by the proposals.\nA spokesperson for Green Gen Cymru said their new 132kV substation will connect renewable energy projects at Nant Mithill, Aberedw, Bryn Gilwern and Lan Fawr to the transmission network, \"with the potential to connect to other renewable energy projects in the area.\" \nThe substation will be located next to the proposed new National Grid\u00a0substation to \"reduce the amount of land required.\"\nA public consultation will launch later this year, and National Grid declined to be interviewed before the start of that consultation.\nA spokesperson for National Grid said that \"siting studies have been carried out and this was identified as the most suitable location\u201d and \u201cthe site is near the existing overhead line so it can connect directly to the network reducing the need for new pylons\u201d.\nNational Grid said it had a \"legal obligation to connect projects to the network\" and that it was \"committed to upgrading Wales' electricity infrastructure\".\nIt anticipates that annual electricity demand in the UK will grow almost 30% by 2035 and over 70% by 2050.\nIt added it couldn't say how many new substations will be needed across Wales to meet demand.",

I don't think people in government know what real people are going through.\"\nThe government has launched a consultation on proposals to move away from fixed cash benefit system towards tailored support.\nMinisters said it is needed after more than 2.6m people of working age are now receiving PIP - with monthly new claims almost doubling since 2019.\nGovernment spending on PIP - a benefit for those who work as well as those who do not - is expected to grow by 52% from 2023-24, to \u00a332.8bn by 2027-28, driven in part by a rise in claimants with mental-health conditions.\nMr Sunak continued: \"It is part of our plan to make the benefits system fairer to the taxpayer, better targeted to individual needs and harder to exploit by those who are trying to game the system.\n\"We\u2019re inviting views from across society to ensure everyone has a chance to make their voices heard and shape our welfare reforms.\"\nUnder the proposals, PIP claimants may no longer require a formal diagnosis by a medical expert. It is claimed this make it \"easier and quicker\" for people with severe or terminal conditions to receive support.\nThe plans are subject to a 12-week consultation, ending on 23 July.\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Sizewell C in Suffolk has been granted a nuclear site licence, a step described as a \"huge milestone\" for the planned power plant.\nThe Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) issued the licence after it said \"outstanding matters\" had been resolved. \nFunding for the project still needs to be secured, with a final investment decision due in 2024. \nCampaigners said they were \"appalled\" and safety matters remain \"unresolved\". \nAccording to the ONR the granting of the licence was a \"significant step\" but does not mean \"nuclear-related construction\" can start.\nThe regulator said the two issues that had been resolved \"related to the shareholders' agreement and ownership of land at the site\". \nSizewell C will now have to ask permission to start future construction and commissioning stages. \nMina Golshan, Sizewell C's safety, security and assurance director, said: \"Securing a nuclear site licence is a show of confidence from our nuclear regulator that we have a suitable site, that we can achieve a safe design replicated from Hinkley Point C, and that we have a capable organisation ready to begin major construction work. \n\"It's a huge milestone and demonstrates that this project is firmly on track.\"\nThe government has invested billions of pounds in Sizewell C. Andrew Bowie, Minister for Nuclear and Renewables, said: \"Sizewell C will be the cornerstone of the UK's clean energy transition, supplying six million homes with green energy for decades.\n\"Obtaining a nuclear site licence is a significant achievement and should instil further confidence from investors - bringing us another step closer towards reaching a final investment decision this year.\" \nAlison Downes, from the campaign group Stop Sizewell C, said:\"Stop Sizewell C is appalled that a nuclear site licence has been issued when matters critical to the future safety of the site remain unresolved. \n\"There isn't even a final design of the sea defences, which will be necessary to keep this vulnerable site safe for the next century and a half, at the very least. \n\"This seems to us like kicking the can down the road, on the assumption that some future generation will be able to clear up the mess.\" \nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "President Joe Biden warned against what he called a \"ferocious surge\" of antisemitism in the US and around the world during a Holocaust remembrance event on Tuesday.\nHe said too many people had been \"denying, downplaying, rationalising the horrors of the Holocaust\". \nMr Biden, 81, also condemned those who he said had forgotten the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel.\nIt was some of his most pointed criticism of Hamas since the attack.\n\"It was Hamas that brutalised Israelis,\" Mr Biden said. \"It was Hamas that took and continues to hold hostages. I have not forgotten.\"\nThe president also criticised what he characterised as lawless behaviour and hateful rhetoric directed at Jewish people by some pro-Palestinian protesters on US university campuses in recent weeks.\nHe said that \"scapegoating and demonising a minority\" threatens all minorities.\nThe speech followed police interventions to dismantle several protest camps at colleges around the country. The demonstrators have faced complaints of intimidation and hate speech, which organisers have denied.\nAt the same time they say they have been subject to Islamophobic and racist remarks by counter-demonstrators.\nAhead of the speech, the White House announced new measures aimed at countering antisemitism, expanding on a national strategy first published in June. They include the creation of online resources \"to ensure that colleges and universities do a better job of protecting both Jewish students and all of their students\", as well as new guidance for schools.\nSince the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas militants and the subsequent Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, Jewish students in the US have reported an increase in antisemitic incidents. According to the Anti-Defamation League, a leading Jewish advocacy group, incidents spiked nationally in the final three months of 2023, and rose 321% on university campuses.\nOne Jewish student at Columbia University - where a protest encampment sparked a wave of pro-Palestinian demonstrations - previously told the BBC that she had been called a \"murderer\" and told to \"go back to Poland\".\nWhile the protesters have said they were demonstrating peacefully for a ceasefire in Gaza, several encampments in university buildings have been shut down by police over concerns about escalating violence. Others have been allowed to continue on the proviso they remain peaceful.\nIn the six months since the Israel-Hamas conflict began, the Biden administration has attempted to balance support for Israel with addressing growing domestic dissent over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. \nBut while some have accused Mr Biden of not doing enough to end the fighting, he has faced criticism from Republicans for publicly seeking to limit Israel's actions and not speaking about the protests sooner.",
    "A Victorian church has been removed from at-risk register after about \u00a3220,000 was spent on restoration work. \nHistoric England (HE) said its project with National Highways (NH) at the Grade I listed Parish Church of St Anne in Denton, Tameside, had seen improvements to safety and public access as well conservation work.\nThe church, which was built in the 1880s, was added to the organisation's register in 2022 over concerns about potential damage caused by \"vibrations from the nearby M67\".\nThe church's priest, the Reverend Jules Mambu, said the work would have a \"huge impact for both the church and the local community\".  \nHE said the church was added to its Heritage at Risk Register in April 2022 following \"concern about settlement around the font and central nave walkway due to vibrations from the nearby motorway\".\nAt the time, it described the building, which was designed by architect Medland Taylor and brought together Victorian architecture with Elizabethan and Scandinavian influences, as \"a monument of creativity, individuality and opulence\".\nNH project manager Betty Wilson said it was becoming unsafe for the \"large community\" who used it, including the nearby school.\n\"In 2021, there were concerns raised by the Diocese of Manchester about the interior brickwork cracking and settlement cracks around the base of the font,\" she said.\nBetween May and September 2023, contractors stabilised the building's foundations by injecting a levelling screed, a technique also used to level airport runways. \nEngineers re-levelled the west end church font and supporting steps and re-enforced various settlement cracks in the masonry walls.\nRepairs were also made to the wooden lychgate at the entrance of the churchyard.\nThe work was funded by a grant from NH and carried out in partnership with HE.\nMs Wilson said NH were \"so pleased we could provide funding to support the restoration of this important building\", which was \"a piece of the area\u2019s fascinating history\".\nHE architect Peter Barlow said it had been a \"pleasure\" to work on the \"magnificent building\".  \n\"The specialist heritage skills that have been employed here, including the repair of the intricate terracotta tiles and the gilded wall mosaics, have produced first class results,\" he added.\nFather Mambu said the work would have a \"huge impact for both the church and the local community\".  \n\"We really appreciate the generosity and the commitment for helping us to achieve our goals,\" he said.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Plans for a food village showcasing local produce and traders in the grounds of a church during the Isle of Man TT race festival have been thrown out.\nThe idea was put forward by the Manx Food Market Traders Association, which organises food markets on North Quay.\nIt would have been held in the grounds of St Ninian\u2019s Church in Douglas between 27 May and 8 June.\nBut the planning committee rejected the application amid concerns over increased traffic, parking issues, noise, odour and the effect on the existing food offering at the grandstand during the period.\nThe association had put forward plans for one-sided marquees, food trucks and street food vendors accompanied by musical entertainment, with a pop-up fine dining restaurant in the eaves of the church in the evening.\nIn its objection to the plans, the Department for Enterprise said there was already due to be \u201csignificant food offerings\u201d at the grandstand during the festival but would have supported the village had it been in the town centre.\nThe DfE also said traffic would be \u201cdirected along and away\u201d from the area to alleviate the issues raised by residents previously, but holding the food festival may exacerbate the problem.\nConcerns were also expressed over the effects of the noise and smell of the festival, and potential issues with parking and access to the area for residents of a nearby retirement complex.\nBut the planning committee heard there had been no concerns raised by environmental health about the smells, and the highways authority had \u201cbottomed out\u201d its concerns over traffic with the organisers.\nOrganisers had also said they would provide parking at a separate site for up to 200 motorcycles, and music would be acoustic rather than amplified.\nAlthough the planning officer had recommended the application be approved, the committee unanimously refused it, citing concerns over the impact on amenity for local residents, the existing offer at the grandstand, and traffic in the area.\nWhy not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook, and X?

    "Among those still trapped under rubble after a five-storey building collapsed in South Africa is Delvin Safels, who was on one of the lower floors when the structure collapsed, his father Dion told the BBC. \nRescuers have traced Delvin's location but are struggling to reach him. \nThe 29-year-old has been sending voice notes to his parents and girlfriend, telling them how much he loves them.\nHe is in pain, with an arm and a leg pinned down, and it is cold and dark. \n\"I believe my son will come out alive,\" his father Dion said.\nHe has been camping nearby since Monday, hoping that his son would emerge. He vacillates between despair and hope.\n\"He is a strong boy, I think he will be rescued tonight or soon.\"\nMore than a day after the apartment building collapsed, rescuers are still searching for 41 people still unaccounted for in the southern coastal city of George. \nAt least 34 people have so far been removed from the rubble, seven of whom have been confirmed dead. \nSurvivors and loved ones of other people still trapped also remain at the scene.\nOne man who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity recounted his escape. He was on the top floor when the building collapsed but only suffered a small cut to his hand. His friend is missing.\n\"I saw one guy was working and then 'boom' and I saw the whole building collapsed... I'm also traumatised.

    "Students living in housing with mould, bed bugs and rats are still seeing their rents go up, as campaigners call for controls on how much landlords can charge tenants.\n\"We had bedbugs, which we paid to have fumigated ourselves out of our own pocket, because it was unliveable and we couldn\u2019t move in until they were gone,\" Cardiff student Megan Haf said.\nCampaigners said rent controls in Wales would ensure people were not being \"ripped off\" by those who supply accommodation.\nThe Welsh government said it was considering introducing new legislation on fair housing, and said there was a \"need for better data on rents and affordability\".\nAlthough house prices in Wales have fallen slightly over the past year, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed average rental prices in Wales increased by 9% over the same period.\nAnd the capital has seen rental prices rise by an average of 13% in just a year, with a warning that student housing may be particularly vulnerable to price rises and poor living conditions.\nAverage rents in Cardiff are now more than \u00a31,000 a month for the first time.\nMegan, 21, lives with four other Cardiff University students in Cathays, and said they have had numerous issues with their house since moving in September.\n\"Come Christmas time we noticed that mould had started to appear [which has] worsened quite rapidly, especially in our bathroom where there\u2019s no window,\" she said.\nTheir most recent problem has been rats, and Megan said there had been a \"lack of urgency\u201d from their landlord in dealing with the issue.\n\"Nobody wants to be in the house, and we\u2019re constantly having to find places outside the house to work, or even to eat now,\" she added.\nMegan and her housemates will now be moving to a more expensive rental property in the summer.\n\"But at this point I don\u2019t mind \u2013 they can take my money, as long as I get a nicer house,\" she said.\nBBC Wales contacted Kingstons Residential for comment regarding the issues raised by Megan.\nElin Griffiths, 20, is another Cardiff University student who said her accommodation had been affected by bathrooms leaks and mouldy walls.\n\"It is really frustrating,\" said the third-year medical student.\n\u201cWe\u2019re finding it really difficult to live in these conditions, especially in the winter when we\u2019ve been getting chest infections.\u201d\nHaving lived in the same house for two academic years, they were also aggrieved to see their rent go up last year without improvements being made.\n\"We\u2019re paying more than last year, and the standard of the house has just got worse and worse,\" said Elin.\n\"It just seems like they\u2019re not taking our problems seriously at all.\"\nHaving found a new place to move later this year, Elin and her housemates also noticed rising rental prices.\n\"Most of the houses now are around \u00a3500 per person, and a lot of these houses are six to eight people as well,\" she said.\nIn response, CPS Homes said \"the landlord, together with his contractors, haven\u2019t been quick enough or effective enough\" in responding to issues at the property.\nThe letting agent added it had only recently been given the go-ahead to make improvements on the landlord\u2019s behalf, which had now resulted in \"a great deal of work\" being completed.\nThe landlord has been approached for comment. \n\nDeio Owen, vice-president of Cardiff Students' Union, said it was \"nothing new that student housing isn\u2019t the best quality\", but complaints were often not taken seriously\".\n\"Research we\u2019ve done in the last year has shown that rents are way too high, the quality is way too low, and students are struggling financially, mentally, physically,\" he said.\n\"It\u2019s having an impact on their academic performances, which shouldn\u2019t be happening in this day and age.\"\nThe Welsh government passed legislation in 2016 which set standards for landlords who lease their properties, and are currently considering a new law on fair rents.\nCommunity and tenants union Acorn Cardiff are among the organisations who responded to a consultation on the topic last year, and are calling for rent controls being introduced.\n\"People are getting ripped off because they\u2019re paying more than ever for these houses that aren\u2019t suitable for them to be living in, or have got major issues and need repair,\" said Holly Firmin from the union.\nShe added: \"[Rent control] is not going to solve all of the problems with the private rented sector.\n\"But introducing some kind of emergency rent control measure is at least going go some way to dealing with that immediate issue.\"\nThe Welsh government said: \"The evidence submitted to the Green Paper clearly identified a need for better data on rents and affordability, and this is being considered as part of a White Paper planned for publication later this year.\n\"In Wales, we have put measures in place that limit rent increases to once in a 12-month period, provided two months' notice has been given and the landlord is in compliance with all requirements under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act.\"",
    "An artist's daughters have supported a campaign to save her herd of steel dinosaurs.\nGenevieve Glatt created sculptures at the heart of Middlesbrough's Teessaurus Park, which opened in 1979.\nA campaign to save her dinosaurs began when Middlesbrough Council said they could be relocated to accommodate Gypsy or traveller pitches, which it said were needed to meet government targets.\nA bid has been submitted to have the dinosaurs listed and Mrs Glatt's daughters said the dinosaurs were created to reflect their industrial setting and should remain \"cherished\" at the site.\nJude Keenan and Susie Glatt visited the park on Tuesday, en route to a meeting at Teesside Archives, where they handed over dinosaur blueprints and other artefacts from their mother's career.\nThey clambered on Mrs Glatt's trio of triceratops as they reminisced about childhood memories and the importance of the steel creatures to their family, and Middlesbrough more widely.\n\"Mum's very proud of them,\" Mrs Glatt said.\n\"She is in a home now, but if she has a down day, the staff use the dinosaurs to cheer her up.\"\n\"They've been here forever,\" Mrs Keenan said.\n\"They were almost forgotten but the interest in them now is heartwarming and incredible to see.\n\"They're part of people's backgrounds and lives, people came here as kids and now bring their own kids.\n\"It's bonkers, it's brilliant.\"\nThe sisters also met volunteers who care for the site and have helped lead the campaign to save Teessaurus Park.\nThousands of people have signed a petition to keep the dinosaurs in their current home on the banks of the River Tees.\nThe campaign was boosted last week when the 20th Century Preservation Society submitted a bid to Historic England to have Mrs Glatt's dinosaurs listed.\nMiddlesbrough Council then said it would engage with the process and was considering the results of a public consultation into its draft local plan, which earmarked the land for 14 Gypsy or traveller pitches.\nThe proposals, which set out a policy for development in the town until 2041, said the collection of dinosaurs would remain publicly accessible, but not necessarily at the same site.\n\"I'm not happy about the idea of them being relocated,\" said Miss Glatt.\n\"When mum came here, she saw the industry across the river, the shipbuilding, the cranes, the Transporter Bridge and felt it needed monsters, to sit well with it all.\n\"Her immediate thought was dinosaurs - they were conceived because they married with the Transporter, and that backdrop.\"\nThe listing bid has been welcomed by Mrs Glatt's family.\n\"They deserve listing, they're unique,\" said Mrs Keenan.\n\"This park represents Middlesbrough's heritage, and it's such an unusual thing to come across walking along the river.\n\"It belongs to Middlesbrough, they should definitely cherish it.\"\nMiss Glatt added: \"We've always called it mum's park, but we've come to realise it's Middlesbrough's park, it's Teessaurus Park.\"\nFollow BBC Tees on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Two Australian brothers were on the \"trip of a lifetime\" with an American friend when they were murdered in a suspected carjacking in Mexico. \nThe brothers, Jake and Callum Robinson, were near the town of Ensenada when they disappeared on 27 April. \nThe third victim has been identified as Jack Carter Rhoad from San Diego, California. He was due to get married.\nTheir bodies were found with gunshot wounds to the head and at the bottom of a deep well. \nA fourth set of human remains discovered in the well were believed to be unrelated to the incident in the northern Mexican state of Baja California, a popular tourist destination that is also plagued by cartel violence. \nRelatives of the three men identified their bodies on Sunday after travelling to Mexico. \nOn X, formerly Twitter, Australian ambassador to Mexico Rachel Moseley said Australian diplomats and federal police were \"giving all possible support\" to the Robinson family. \nA GoFundMe page set up by a US-based friend of the family estimated the total cost of repatriating their remains - along with flights, funeral costs and attorneys - was expected to top $130,000 (\u00a3103,000). So far, nearly $300,000 has been raised in both the US and Australia. \nThree people have been detained in connection with their deaths. Mexican authorities believe they attacked the victims after they resisted the theft of their pickup truck. \nHere's what we know about the victims. \nThe eldest of the victims, Callum Robinson was a member of Australia's national lacrosse team and a resident of San Diego, just across the US-Mexico border from Baja California. \nHe graduated from Stevenson University in Maryland in 2015.  \nCallum was also diabetic, noted his mother, Debra Robinson, while appealing on Facebook for help to find her missing sons.\nHis girlfriend, Emily Horwath, posted several images of the couple on Instagram after his death was announced. \n\"My heart is shattered into a million pieces,\" she wrote. \"I don't have the words right now.\" \nIn a statement posted online, Stevenson University athletics director Brett Adams wrote that Callum was \"a stellar student, a stellar athlete and an even better friend\". \n\"We are all so thankful that he was a part of our lives,\" his former coach, Paul Cantabene, said in the statement. \"He lived an extraordinary life, but what is most impressive about Callum is what a loyal friend he was. Once you were his friend, you were friends for life.\" \nA friend of Callum, Hayley Jacobs, told Australia's Nine News that he \"lit up a room\", adding that he eventually hoped to return to Australia. \n\"I asked him what his goals were in life and he just said that he wanted to go back to Australia and raise a family and grow,\" she added. \nMs Jacobs said she grew concerned after not hearing from Callum once his Mexico trip began. She saw him the day he left. \n\"I don't know what's going on but I think he's mad at me,\" she remembered thinking. \"Like something doesn't seem right.\" \nCallum's younger brother, Jake, left Australia about two weeks before the incident.

The pair had announced their engagement in July last year, with Ms Wiertz celebrating her hen do only last month. \nOn a GoFundMe page, a friend of the Rhoad family, Aubrey Byers, wrote that Mr Rhoad's relatives and Ms Wiertz were going through \"an unimaginably difficult time\".\n\"Their presence brought immeasurable joy, love, and kindness to those around them, leaving a mark on our lives,\" Mr Penland wrote of the three men. \nSo far, nearly $58,000 has been raised, some of which will go to \"scholarships and donations he felt passionate about.\" ",
    "A group of breast cancer survivors dazzled in a charity fashion show at Browns department store in York.\nThe \"empowering\" event raised money for charity Breast Friends as it showcased the shop's latest fashion collection.\nLast Thursday's sold-out show saw survivors celebrate their \"new normal\", while being cheered on by friends and family who were urged to sing along.\nOrganisers said the event raised \u00a32,000 for the charity which offers peer support to people with breast cancer.\nSpeaking ahead of the event, organisers Sara Murphy and Zoe Bounds told BBC Radio York how the idea for the York show came about.\nThe pair - who have both previously received a breast cancer diagnosis - met on a course in 2019. \nSara recalls the group being told they could enter a draw to be picked to model in a breast cancer survivor fashion show in London. \n\"I looked at Zoe and said, 'but look at all of these fabulous women in this room - we don't need to go to London'.\" \nSara, who previously worked in the lingerie department at Browns, already had friends in the retail industry and was able to get in touch with a former colleague at the department store and organise the show, which has taken place since 2019 during York Fashion Week.\nNearly all the models come from Breast Friends, a peer support group which brings together people who have received a diagnosis of breast cancer at some point in their lives.\n\"We just support each other,\" explains Zoe. \n\"We have all been there and heard the words 'you've got cancer'.\"\n\"So, we've got people that have had a lot of treatment, we've got people who have just had surgery - it doesn't matter what treatment you've had, it's that you've heard those words.\"\nSome of this year's models were newcomers to the fashion runway, while others are modelling for the second time.\n\"It's just amazing,\" said Sara. \"Last year one girl nearly vomited before she went on and thought she couldn't do it, but this year, when I put the plea out, she was one of the first people who said they wanted to do it. \n\"So she will have a completely different experience to what she had last year. It's just great.\"\nThe show is intended to show normal women celebrating their bodies after cancer. \nZoe believes those who try to go back to being exactly the same person they were before a cancer diagnosis are \"probably going to be disappointed\".\n\"I get to see these women who have been through so much - their bodies have changed, the control has been taken away from them and they're trying to find a new normal,\" she said. \n\"Once you've heard those words, you can't go back to normal.\"\nAll the money raised will fund Breast Friends - jokingly dubbed \"the best support group you never wanted to join\" by Zoe and Sara - to ensure that anyone with a breast cancer diagnosis can enjoy meeting up with women in a similar position, no matter their financial status. \nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "After months of on-off hard talking between belligerents and mediators, the time has come for hard decisions. \nHamas has agreed to a draft ceasefire deal, which is \"far from meeting Israel's demands\", according to Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He has still felt it necessary to dispatch a delegation to discuss it. \nIsrael agreed to a ceasefire offer at the end of April. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it was \"exceptionally generous\". \nA big challenge for the negotiators in Cairo is closing the gap between Israel's version and the one accepted by Hamas. Diplomatic sources in Qatar, which is part of the mediation effort with Egypt and the United States, told me \"it is broadly the same as Israel's proposal. Just minor wordings changed and details\".\nIsrael may decide that the differences are not minor. One major sticking point has been that Hamas wants a ceasefire to be permanent, not temporary, and to be followed by an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. \nIf the US delegation, led by the CIA chief William Burns, believes the gaps can be bridged, Mr Netanyahu can expect pressure from Washington to agree. \nUntil Monday evening, Israel's working assumption was that Hamas would not accept a ceasefire proposal. Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, like most foreign observers, were blindsided when Hamas announced its decision.\nThere are two ways of looking at the Hamas gambit. It can be seen as a desperate move by an organisation badly bloodied and almost broken by Israel's long offensive. \nOr it was an adroit political move, which has turned the pressure back on Mr Netanyahu. That explanation is more credible, as Israel's plans and assumptions were upended by the offer. \nWe know that Israel was basing its moves in the next phase of the war on an assumption that Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas chief in Gaza who has been in hiding since 7 October, would never accept a ceasefire. \nIsrael used the absence of a ceasefire offer from Hamas as an explanation for its decision to launch a military operation in Gaza. The US is very clear that it is against any ground operation in Rafah that could threaten the lives of more Palestinian civilians. \nAs Israel warned around 100,000 Palestinians to leave their homes at first light on Monday, its defence minister Yoav Gallant told his US counterpart that there was no alternative to a Rafah assault. \nThat, he said, was because Hamas had rejected every proposal for a temporary ceasefire and a release of hostages. Only a few hours later, Hamas made its announcement, calling Israel's bluff.\nMr Netanyahu is in a political bind. His governing style over more than 16 years as Israel's leader has been characterised by a habit of putting off difficult choices. \nBut now he is under severe pressure, from all sides, and however tempting it might be to play for time, this is a moment for decisions. \nThe most intense pressure comes from two ultranationalist Jewish extremists in his cabinet - finance minister Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, minister for national security. \nMr Netanyahu needs their votes to keep his coalition in power. They want Israel to occupy Rafah and have threatened to topple the government if he does not make it happen. For them, a ceasefire equals surrender. \nAt the same time, families and supporters of Israeli hostages have been demonstrating, blocking major roads to demand that Israel makes a deal to get them back home. \nThe hostage families have support in the war cabinet from Benny Gantz and Gabi Eisenkot, two opposition leaders who joined the cabinet after the 7 October attacks. They might leave the government if, in the absence of a ceasefire, the hostages stay put. \nThe Americans also want a deal. President Biden's support for Israel, even as its army killed huge numbers of Palestinian civilians, is costing him political support. \nIf Mr Biden decides that there is an acceptable version of a ceasefire to be had, he will push Benjamin Netanyahu to support it. \nThe Israeli leader would have to choose between his government's survival and the vital support the US president has given him in recent months. \nIt is widely believed in Israel that Mr Netanyahu wants to prolong the war to put off the moment of reckoning for his own part in the mistakes that gave Hamas its opportunity on 7 October to kill around 1200 people, mostly Israelis and take 240 hostages into Gaza. \nA ceasefire would also mean that Benjamin Netanyahu has not achieved \"total victory\" over Hamas - one of his two main war aims. The other is freeing the hostages, which he has not achieved either. \nThis war is showing, once again, how hard it is for powerful countries like Israel to defeat much weaker organisations like Hamas. For Hamas, survival means victory, and Benjamin Netanyahu knows that, for him, would be a defeat. ",

    "The Israeli military says its troops have taken \"operational control\" of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt.\nRafah has been a key entry point for aid and the only exit for people able to flee since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in October.\nA tank brigade moved in to the crossing area after a night of intense strikes.\nWith Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing also closed, the UN warned Gaza's two main aid arteries were now choked off.\nOn Tuesday, the White House said it had been told Kerem Shalom would reopen on Wednesday. \nOn Monday, the Israeli military ordered tens of thousands of civilians to begin evacuating nearby eastern parts of Rafah city, ahead of what it called a \"limited\" operation to eliminate Hamas fighters and dismantle infrastructure.\nHamas said Israel's incursion and seizure of the Rafah crossing was aimed at undermining attempts by regional mediators to secure a new ceasefire deal.\nThe Palestinian armed group said on Monday that it had accepted a proposal from Egypt and Qatar, the basis of which is a weeks-long pause in the fighting and the release of several dozen hostages still held in Gaza. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that Hamas's announcement was \"very far from Israel's necessary requirements\" and that it was a failed attempt to \"disrupt the entry of our forces into Rafah\" .\nHe said he had instructed the mid-level Israeli delegation sent to Cairo on Tuesday to \"stand firm\" on the conditions required for the return of the hostages and on \"vital requirements for ensuring Israel's security\".\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told troops on the Gaza border: \"We will not cease operating in Rafah until Hamas is destroyed, or until the first hostage returns home.\"\nUN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said a deal between Israel and Hamas was \"essential to stop the unbearable suffering of Palestinians in Gaza and of the hostages and their families\".\n\"I reiterate my appeal for both parties to show the political courage and spare no effort to secure an agreement now,\" he added.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 34,780 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. \nA deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel says 128 hostages are unaccounted for, 34 of whom are presumed dead.\nIsrael has long insisted that it must eliminate the remaining Hamas battalions in Rafah to achieve victory in the war. \nBut with more than a million displaced Palestinians sheltering there, the UN and Western powers have warned that a major ground offensive could have devastating humanitarian consequences.\nOn Monday night, flares lit up the skies over the city and witnesses said there was continuous Israeli bombardment.\nPalestinian news agency Wafa cited medical sources at the local Kuwait Specialised Hospital as saying that 20 people were killed and dozens injured.\nRaed al-Derby said his wife and children were killed in an strike that levelled their family home in the western Tal al-Sultan neighbourhood.\n\"We're patient and we will remain steadfast on this land...

    "Firefighters will be allowed more time to get to Northern Ireland's most serious fires if proposed changes to response time targets are approved.\nThe fire service wants crews to attend some emergencies within eight minutes - two minutes slower than the current six-minute target. \nIn a video, seen by BBC News NI, it said the proposal will not change \"our response to you when you dial 999\".\nHowever, a DUP assembly member said the plan was a huge concern.\n\"We're told that every minute counts when it comes to serious fire incidents so what does this mean in terms of threat to life, serious injury and indeed property?\" said Jonathan Buckley.\nThe Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) told BBC News NI it would be premature to comment on the proposals until they have gone to public consultation. This is expected in the coming months.\nEmergency calls relating to fires that happen at home are categorised into high, medium and low risk categories. \nIt has a target of attending at least 75% of these incidents within six, 12 and 21 minutes respectively. \nHowever, the fire service's latest published annual report shows that, on average each month in 2022/23, it managed to attend 44% of the most serious fires within six minutes.\nThis is down from about 46% in the previous two years.\nThe figures also show it has failed to meet the 75% target for medium-risk fires in the same three-year period, though it has met the target for low-risk calls. \nFire services across the UK each have different targets for responding to emergencies.\nThe average response time for fires at homes in England last year was eight minutes, according to the Home Office.\nUnder the new proposals, 999 calls relating to fires will be divided into five categories with the highest risk having a targeted response time of eight minutes and the lowest risk a targeted response time of 20 minutes.\nA video by the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service, which was shared with senior employees and has been viewed by BBC News NI, outlined some of the planned changes. \nIn it, the fire service said: \"Our proposals won't change the current service or our response to you when you dial 999.\n\"Based on risk, some areas will see a slightly improved target time and some will see a slightly slower target time.\"\nDUP assembly member Jonathan Buckley, a former member of Stormont's health committee, told BBC News NI he was worried about the proposal, adding that he would \"like to know whether this is code for a reduction in deterioration in service provision\". \n\"We have already seen fire stations removed from local communities and there is a fear and an anxiety around what that means for response times,\" he said.\nSDLP assembly member Colin McGrath, who currently sits on Stormont's health committee, said the important thing was not to use \"these targets as a target time\".\n\"I think we should be getting to fires and other incidents as quickly as possible.\n\"That's more an issue of resources and we need to make sure that we have the proper resources available so that our firefighters can do the work that they need to do in a timely manner.\"\nThe current standards have been in place for 18 years and only measure response times for fires at homes - the new proposed categories will also include other types of building fires but not road crashes or other incidents requiring the fire service.\nBoth Mr Buckley and Mr McGrath said they were concerned the proposed new standards do not extend to all emergencies.\nThe fire service is also seeking to change how it reports this information, from a target percentage figure to a median figure.\nIn other parts of the internal video, it said the current measurement provides \"limited performance management information\" and that a median figure will offer \"a consistent measurement of performance and improved data information\".\nIt added: \"We believe these changes will help us deliver a more effective, community risk focused, emergency response across Northern Ireland.\"",
    "The UK government has been urged to extend the deadline for a Troubles victims payment scheme.\nThe Troubles Permanent Disability Payment (TPDP) scheme is open for applicants until August 2026.\nIt offers payments to those who suffered physical or psychological injuries in the Troubles in Northern Ireland.\nHowever, an element of the scheme - a one-off, tax-free payment backdated to 2014 - will soon close for applicants.\nA sunset clause in legislation means that to get the backdated lump sum, applications have to be submitted by the end of August this year.\nAfter that, successful applicants will only receive the monthly element of the payment scheme.\nA spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) told BBC News NI the issue of backdated payments was being considered as part of the statutory review of the scheme.\n\"We will publish a report on the operation of the scheme - and communicate a decision on backdating - as soon as is practicable,\" they added.\nFormer Northern Ireland secretary Lord Peter Hain - who introduced the amendment to the Northern Ireland Bill which established the scheme - has written to the current Secretary of State, Chris Heaton-Harris, asking him to consider extending the back payment deadline.\nIn his letter, Lord Hain highlighted reasons why the cut-off point should be extended, including backlogs caused by delays in obtaining medical records.\nHe also told Mr Heaton-Harris that there were people who were eligible to apply to the scheme who did not know of its existence.\n\"Given the scheme is due to close to new applicants at the end of August 2026, I would urge you to extend the backdating element to that date in the interests of fairness and compassion,\" Lord Hain added in the letter.\nLord Hain said it had been a \"long battle\" to secure compensation.\nSpeaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, he said the scheme was for people \"injured through no fault of their own\" during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. \nThe lump sum could be a lifeline for people, he added.\nVictims' support group the Wave Trauma Centre has called the backdated sum a \"crucial part\" of the scheme.\n\"It allows essential house repairs to be done,\" its chief executive Sandra Peake said.\n\"It allows those who are elderly and simply do not have the time to sit on seemingly endless waiting lists to get much-needed pain-relieving surgery.\n\"It would be a shame if those who are eligible to apply but for whatever reason cannot meet the August 2024 deadline were to miss out on the lump sum.\"\nThe scheme, also known as the victims' pension - was originally set up in law by the Westminster government in 2020, to provide pensions to people who suffered physically and/or psychologically during the Troubles.\nThe level of payment could range from about \u00a32,000 to \u00a310,000 per year, depending on the extent of the applicant's disability.\nThe scheme will be open in total for five years from the date it first launched on 31 August 2021.\nIt is being run by the The Victims' Payment Board, which determines each application and administers the fund.\nHowever, some victims' groups have been critical of the decision-making process and the length of time it takes.\nIn January, BBC News NI reported that more than 40 people who applied to the scheme have died before any decision was made.\nAs of December 2023, a total of 6,209 applications had been received by the board.\nOf these, 955 determinations were made, with 630 applicants deemed eligible to receive a payment and 325 ineligible.\nThe board said it prioritises applications from those who are terminally ill or those who are over 80 years old, and works \"as quickly as possible\".\nThe board has previously issued guidance that some paramilitary-style attacks do not fall within the definition of a Troubles-related incident.\nIt determined that members of a paramilitary group acting as vigilantes against \"a person who was engaged in or was perceived as being engaged in 'anti-social behaviour' or crime\" should not fall within its remit.",

    "Many of us of a certain age will remember the Alan Partridge scene where he is pitching to a TV executive in a bid to get a new series commissioned.\nGetting ever more desperate, the fictional British TV presenter suggests shows such as Inner City Sumo, Youth Hostelling With Chris Eubanks, and finally, Monkey Tennis. All were perhaps unsurprisingly rejected. \nMaybe Partridge, played by comedian and actor Steve Coogan, would have had better luck if he had let an artificial intelligence (AI) computer system pick the ideas.\nThat may initially sound like a highly fanciful idea, but a number of TV production companies have already announced that they are using AI to help them dream up new programmes.\nThese include RTL Group, whose subsidiaries make everything from The X Factor, to The Apprentice, Grand Designs and QI. It said last year that it had \"started to support content creation with generative AI.\"\nMeanwhile, Banijay, which makes Deal or No Deal and Keeping Up with the Kardashians, now has a fund to back AI-created content. Announcing this last year, it said: \"While human creativity will always prevail, it's important to work alongside the tools which are available to contribute to the future of ground-breaking entertainment.\"\nWhile neither firm has yet to unveil a new TV series whose idea came from an AI system, I decided to put one to the test.\nSo I logged into an AI chatbot, and typed in what I was looking for. I wrote: \"I am trying to think up a new TV format. A series with contestants.\n\"Maybe they would be learning a new skill, like dancing, or perhaps they are trying to compete in communities to have the most sustainable environment. Can you help me with some ideas?\"\nThe AI confirms that this could be an exciting endeavour. And instantly comes up with six ideas.\nI like its first suggestion - Skills Mastery Showdown - where contestants would be paired with skilled mentors, and have a limited time to master a specific new skill, such as dancing, cooking or painting. \nBut what do TV industry experts think about the use of AI in coming up with future content? I ask Dan Whitehead, who is a senior consultant at K7 Media, a Manchester-based research firm that reports on the TV business.\n\"The idea of a machine that you can type a request into, in normal conversational language, and have it spit out something close to what you asked for, still feels pretty magical,\" he says. \"So it's understandable that people are drawn to it.\n\"Can something like [AI chatbot] ChatGPT generate ideas for a TV show? Of course, but then ideas for TV shows have never been in short supply. The big problem for most production companies is the uncertainty - which ideas are best, which ones are worth investing in?\" \nMr Whitehead argues that AI can give people false confidence, giving them the sense that if it - with access to billions of data points - can come up with these ideas, they must somehow be better.\nI look back at Skills Mastery Showdown. Maybe it's not that innovative after all.  Mr Whitehead says that AI is better used in a much more nuanced, background way.\n\"The BBC's Springwatch and Winterwatch use a bespoke AI system that monitors live camera feeds, and has been trained to recognise, record and log different species of animals and birds as they appear in the frame,\" he says. \"It can then tell the production team how often they appear, give behavioural insights, and generally do something that would eat up hours of human production time.\"\nEline van Der Velden, founder and chief executive of London-based TV production firm Particle 6, is more positive about using AI to both help come up with ideas for new programmes, and to write scripts.\nShe says that recently she had two versions of a script ready for a client, one edited by humans, and the other by Chat GPT. \"We gave them both versions, and they preferred the ChatGPT one,\" she says.\nMs van Der Velden adds that she wants her producers to know how to use AI to help them do their job. \"[Otherwise] it's like having someone who doesn't know how Microsoft Word works,\" she says. \"It speeds everything up.\"\nShe also says that AI isn't replacing jobs in TV, or at least not all of them. \"It's like when accountants thought they'd be out of work with the advent of Excel.\n\"You still need a creative director, but this is a tool that programme makers should use. It will enable us to reach the next level of our full potential.\"\nRead more stories on artificial intelligence\nI still want to see if AI can help me make a hit TV programme? What about a drama series instead?\nMr Whitehead reminds me that AI is not human, that it will never have an emotional response to any requests or prompts that I give it.\nUndeterred, I asked my AI chatbot for ideas for a new TV show about the Post Office scandal. It comes back with a six-part series called \"Broken Trust\", which will combine drama and documentary elements to \"engage viewers emotionally, while providing factual insights into the larger issues ",
    "Saudi authorities have permitted the use of lethal force to clear land for a futuristic desert city being built by dozens of Western companies, an ex-intelligence officer has told the BBC.\nCol Rabih Alenezi says he was ordered to evict villagers from a tribe in the Gulf state to make way for The Line, part of the Neom eco-project.\nOne of them was subsequently shot and killed for protesting against eviction. \nThe Saudi government and Neom management refused to comment.\nNeom, Saudi Arabia's $500bn (\u00a3399bn) eco-region, is part of its Saudi Vision 2030 strategy which aims to diversify the kingdom's economy away from oil. \nIts flagship project, The Line, has been pitched as a car-free city, just 200m (656ft) wide and 170km (106 miles) long - though only 2.4km of the project is reportedly expected to be completed by 2030.\nDozens of global companies, several of them British, are involved in Neom's construction.\nThe area where Neom is being built has been described as the perfect \"blank canvas\" by Saudi leader Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman. But more than 6,000 people have been moved for the project according to his government - and UK-based human rights group ALQST estimates the figure to be higher.\nThe BBC has analysed satellite images of three of the villages demolished - al-Khuraybah, Sharma and Gayal. Homes, schools, and hospitals have been wiped off the map.\nCol Alenezi, who went into exile in the UK last year, says the clearance order he was asked to enact was for al-Khuraybah, 4.5km south of The Line. The villages were mostly populated by the Huwaitat tribe, who have inhabited the Tabuk region in the country's north-west for generations.\nHe said the April 2020 order stated the Huwaitat was made up of \"many rebels\" and \"whoever continues to resist [eviction] should be killed, so it licensed the use of lethal force against whoever stayed in their home\".\nHe dodged the mission on invented medical grounds, he told the BBC, but it nevertheless went ahead. \nAbdul Rahim al-Huwaiti refused to allow a land registry committee to value his property, and was shot dead by Saudi authorities a day later, during the clearance mission. He had previously posted multiple videos on social media protesting against the evictions.\nA statement issued by Saudi state security at the time alleged al-Huwaiti had opened fire on security forces and they had been forced to retaliate. Human rights organisations and the UN have said he was killed simply for resisting eviction. \nThe BBC was not able to independently verify Col Alenezi's comments about lethal force. \nBut a source familiar with the workings of the Saudi intelligence directorate told us the colonel's testimony - regarding both how the clearance order was communicated and what it said - was in line with what they knew about such missions more generally. They also said the colonel's level of seniority would have been appropriate to lead the assignment.\nAt least 47 other villagers were detained after resisting evictions, many of whom were prosecuted on terror-related charges, according to the UN and ALQST. Of those, 40 remain in detention, five of whom are on death row, ALQST says.\nSeveral were arrested for simply publicly mourning al-Huwaiti's death on social media, the group said. \nSaudi authorities say those required to move for The Line have been offered compensation. But the figures paid out have been much lower than the amount promised, according to AlQst. \nAccording to Col Alenezi, \"[Neom] is the centrepiece of Mohamed Bin Salman's ideas. That's why he was so brutal in dealing with the Huwaitat.\"\nA former senior executive of Neom's ski project told the BBC he had heard about the killing of Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti a few weeks before leaving his native US for the role in 2020. Andy Wirth says he repeatedly asked his employers about the evictions, but was not satisfied with the answers. \n\"It just reeked of something terrible [that] had been exacted upon these people\u2026 You don't step on their throats with your boot heels so you can advance,\" he said. \nHe left the project less than a year after joining it, disenchanted with its management.\nA chief executive of a British desalination company who pulled out of a $100m (\u00a380m) project for The Line in 2022 is also extremely critical.\n\"It might be good for some high-tech people living in that area, but what about the rest?\" said Malcolm Aw, the CEO of Solar Water PLC.\nThe local population should be seen as valuable assets, he added, given how well they understand the area. \n\"You should seek that advice to improve, to create, recreate, without removing them.\" \nDisplaced villagers were extremely reluctant to comment, fearing that speaking to foreign media could further endanger their detained relatives. \nBut we spoke to those evicted elsewhere for another Saudi Vision 2030 scheme. More than a million people have been displaced for the Jeddah Central project in the western Saudi Arabian city - set to include an opera house, sporting distr",
    "It is a spring evening in Germany's eastern city of Cottbus, and dozens of people have crowded into a small venue to hear a man who once dubbed himself the \"friendly face\" of National Socialism (Nazism).\nTwo other men with prior links to extremist groups are also in the room, including a candidate for forthcoming state elections. \nThey're all there to hear Matthias Helferich at a youth event organised by members of the prominent far-right party, Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD).\nThe AfD has repeatedly rejected accusations of extremism.\nHowever, by investigating the past of these three men, the BBC has found a clear crossover between AfD figures and far-right networks, some of which are classed as anti-democratic or racist by German authorities.\nStephan Kramer, a regional spy chief in eastern Germany, has told the BBC the AfD now poses a danger to the \"roots\" of democracy, as the party eyes electoral gains in three states in the east this autumn: Saxony, Thuringia and Brandenburg.\nAhead of next month's European elections the AfD, beset by extremism and corruption allegations, has dipped in the polls but still consistently places second nationwide.\nIt remains strong in Germany's post-communist communities. \nMatthias Helferich's speech in Cottbus was all about \"remigration\" - a burgeoning concept within Europe's far right about mass \"returns\" or deportations. The BBC asked to attend his talk but was told there wasn't space. \nElected to Germany's Bundestag in 2021, he was effectively barred from joining the AfD's parliamentary faction, after damaging Facebook exchanges came to light dating back to 2016-17.\nIn leaked remarks Mr Helfrich mentions Nazism several times, including an apparent description of himself as the \"friendly face\" of National Socialism and as a \"democratic Freisler\" - a reference to Nazi-era judge, Roland Freisler.\nMr Helferich told the BBC he didn't seriously call himself the friendly face of Nazism at all but was merely \"parodying\" left wingers online.\n\"If you are confronted with Nazi accusations as frequently as AfD politicians, you compensate for that in private spheres. You ridicule it.\" \nHe continues to hold AfD roles at a local level and, as Cottbus shows, is welcomed within some party circles as an unapologetic proponent of \"remigration\".\nMany view the term as little more than a euphemism for the large-scale expulsion of people with migrant backgrounds, brought about by force or political pressure. \nMatthias Helferich is outspoken about his hopes of \"remigrating\" millions in response to the \"mass influx\" of migrants from Africa and the Middle East.\nBut he claims that no-one who's legally in Germany would be forced to leave - though some could be offered the chance to return to their \"home country\" and \"culture.\"\n\"This is not about downgrading people or deporting them for racist reasons. It is about preserving Germany as the land of the Germans,\" he said.\nMr Helferich also spoke at a \"summer party\" last year hosted by the Institut f\u00fcr Staatspolitik (IfS), which months earlier had been designated as right-wing extremist by the federal domestic intelligence - which said the IfS was striving for an ethnically \"homogeneous\" nation.\n\"I don't share the view of the intelligence service that it is a right-wing extremist organisation,\" says Mr Helferich. \"I decide for myself where I speak.\"\nAfD figures accuse domestic intelligence, the Verfassungsschutz, of being a body stuffed with government appointed officials, unfavourable to their cause. \nMore than \"50 young patriots\" came to hear the Cottbus speech, says one of its organisers, Jean-Pascal Hohm. \nMr Holm has held numerous roles in the AfD and is now running in September's Brandenburg state elections. That is despite having been involved with - or linked to - a string of groups that went on to be classified as right-wing extremist. \nThey include the Ein Prozent (One Percent) association, Zukunft Heimat (Future Homeland) and Identitarian movement, which has been known to promote the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy theory. \nThat's the far-right idea that global elites are deliberately plotting to change the demographics of Western countries.\nMr Hohm is unapologetic in his belief that \"population replacement\" is going on in Germany and Europe - something he describes as \"the main theme of our times\".\n\"I do not say that this is organised from up high, I say it is happening.\"\nIn 2017, Jean-Pascal Hohm was spotted among the crowd when a group of football fans chanted antisemitic slogans. Some even gave what appeared to be the Hitler salute.\nHe insists he was \"on the fringe\" with his father: \"This was a Cottbus away game, I am a Cottbuser.\"\n\"It's not my fault that some lunatics use this as a stage to do things which I expressly do not support,\" he tells me. \nPictured smiling in the audience for Matthias Helferich's talk in March was a man called Benedikt Kaiser, who works in parliament for J\u00fcrgen Pohl, an AfD MP in Thuringia.\nAn investigation by D",
    "The Olympic torch has arrived in France, ahead of the start of the 2024 Paris Games, in July. \nThe organisers say the event will be protected by an \"unprecedented security operation\". \nThe summer Olympics are from 26 July to 11 August, with 10,500 athletes competing in 329 events. \nThe Paralympics run from 28 August to 8 September, featuring 4,400 athletes in 549 events.\nThere will be 206 countries represented at the Olympics, and 184 at the Paralympics.  \nMore than 15 million tourists are expected in Paris during the Games. \nThe main athletics events will be held at the Stade de France, on the northern outskirts of Paris.\nHowever, there will be 15 Olympic and 11 Paralympic venues in the city centre. For example, the Pont d'Iena will host cycling events and the start and finish points for the marathon will be at the Hotel de Ville and Les Invalides.\nGames venues in the centre of Paris will be cordoned off to the public and there will be extensive traffic restrictions.\nA number of Metro stations and railway stations will also be closed for part or all of duration of the Games.\nSwimming events are due to take place in the Seine in central Paris, but some could be delayed or even cancelled if heavy rain affects the river's water quality. \nWorried about threats such as a drone attack, the government has cut spectator numbers for the Olympic opening ceremony. \nThe event is expected to see the national teams parading in boats along a 6km (3.8 mile) stretch of the River Seine through the centre of the capital.\nThe original plan was to give free tickets to 600,000 members of the public to watch from the banks. Now, however, tickets will go to only 300,000 invited guests.  \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said the ceremony could be moved from the Seine altogether if the security risk seems too great.\nInstead, the entire event could be held in the Trocadero Gardens or the Stade de France.\nThe French government is using about 20,000 soldiers and more than 40,000 police officers to provide security. It will also have support from about 2,000 troops and police officers from other countries.\nSecurity services have been screening one million people involved in the Games, including athletes, residents living close to the Olympic venues, medical staff and volunteers.\nFrench Prime Minster Gabriel Attal said intelligence services uncovered two plots against the country by suspected Islamic militants in early 2024. \n\"The terrorist threat is real, it's strong,\" he said. \nOfficials said 6,000 police officers, dog units and snipers would patrol Marseille as the Olympic flame sailed into the city.\nThe head of the Paris 2024 Organising Committee, Tony Estanguet insisted that the \"unprecedented\" security operation in place means that participants and spectators \"can have confidence\" in the Games.\nNeither Russia nor Belarus are allowed to send teams, because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Belarus's support for it.  \nCompetitors from those countries will only be allowed to take part as neutral athletes. \nThey will not be allowed to parade in the opening ceremony and will not have their national anthems played, or their national flags raised, if they win medals.  \nRussia has said it is \"outraged\" at its athletes' treatment and has announced a \"World Friendship Games\" in Moscow and Yekaterinburg in September. \nThe Soviet Union held a similar event in 1984, after boycotting the summer Olympics in Los Angeles.\nPresident Macron said that Russia has also been conducting a propaganda campaign to undermine the Paris Games, including claims that they are being badly organised.\nRussian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov criticised the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for not also barring Israel from taking part, because of its military operation in Gaza.\nHowever, IOC president Thomas Bach rejected the demand and confirmed Israel's participation. \nOne opinion poll suggested that 44% of Parisians think hosting the Olympics is a \"bad thing\", with many planning to leave town.\nBus and metro fares will double in the capital during the Games. \nThe Olympic and Paralympic Village and a new aquatics centre are in a region north of Paris called Seine-Saint-Denis - one of the poorest parts of France. \nCharities complained after hundreds of squatters were evicted from buildings close to the new sites. \nMany Parisians are irritated at the security restrictions which will be imposed in the city centre.\n\"Paris will be unbearable,\" one resident told the BBC. \"Impossible to park; impossible to move around; impossible to do anything.\"",
    "On our arrival in Nigeria's self-proclaimed capital of twins to investigate the proliferation of multiple births in the small rural town of Igbo-Ora, we are greeted by the news that a woman has just delivered a healthy pair of babies at the local clinic.\nTheir mother is a twin - her twin brother is in the ward taking photos of the new arrivals, his nephew and niece. Surrounding the bed are the babies' grandmother, who is herself a twin, and their great-grandmother, who has given birth to two sets of twins.\n\"That's how we do it here. We give birth to twins. It makes our town special,\" the five-hour-old twins' grandmother tells the BBC.\n\"It makes us proud and we love them. We love our twins. They bring us success,\" she says.\n\"People are disappointed if they don't give birth to twins.\"\nIt is true that Igbo-Ora, in south-western Nigeria, appears to have a higher-than-usual number of twins - walking through the town it is easy to spot younger sets of twins, who tend to wear matching clothes. \nThe global average birth rate for twins is around 12 per 1,000 births, but in Igbo-Ora it is reported to be about 45 per 1,000. \nIn Yoruba culture, which predominates in the south-west of the country, twins are a blessing and their names are predestined.\nIrrespective of gender, the older twin is called Taiwo, meaning \"the one that tests the world\", the younger is called Kehinde, meaning \"the one that came after\".\nThe next day, at Igbo-Ora's high school we find out that these names tend to dominate roll-call. When we ask a group of around 1,500 students during morning assembly to raise their hand if they are a twin, or have a twin in the family, nearly everyone's arm shoots up.\nSo why are there so many twins in the area?\nAccording to oral folklore, the village was founded in the 14th Century by an exiled prince of the Oyo Kingdom, who was told to make specific offerings to the Yoruba gods in pairs and in return, the village was blessed with twins. \nMany locals though put their fertility down to a dish called \"ilasa\", made from okra leaves. These spinach-like leaves are added to a pot of boiling water along with salt and spices, locust beans and melon seeds. \nThe reason behind Igbo-Ora's multiple births is a genuine subject of study in Nigeria.\nOnly a minority of the twins born in Igbo-Ora are identical - when one egg is fertilised and then divides.\nThe majority are non-identical, meaning multiple eggs are released and fertilised at the same time. \nResearchers are investigating whether natural chemicals in the local food, like ilasa or perhaps even the local yams, might make women produce multiple eggs. \nProf Akinola Kehinde Akinlabi, rector of the Oyo State College of Agriculture and Technology based in Igbo-Ora, thinks genetics may have more to do with it.\nThe academic, who is himself a twin - and father of twins, says someone born a twin in these parts will not find it hard to find a wife or husband.  \n\"Twins are venerated almost as deities who bring good fortune and protection. People present twins and their families with gifts, money and offers of help. All that encourages people to marry those from twin-producing families,\" he tells the BBC.\nThe traditional ruler of the town, known as an oba, is eagerly awaiting the results of scientific studies.\nJimoh Olajide hopes that in a country with a love of setting Guinness World Records, Igbo-Ora will soon be officially recognised for its phenomenal fertility - given nearly every home in town has at least one set of twins.\n\"My vision for this town is to see us holding the world record for highest multiple births in the whole world,\" says Oba Olajide, who is of course a father of twins.\n\"Things that will follow will be tourism, hotels.\"\nWith this in mind, the town launched an annual international twin festival several years ago.\nProf Akinlabi hopes the focus on twins will also lead to investment for the broader community to tackle things like its poorly equipped and old health centres.\nSuch is the status of twins that despite the adoption of Islam and Christianity in this area the traditional Yoruba worship of them is still prevalent.\nKehinde Adeleke, our local guide and a younger twin, takes us to witness a ritual offering, including palm wine and beans, to the twin gods at a shrine in her family's community.\n\"I feel specially blessed as a twin,\" says Ms Adeleke who has two children, but no multiple births as yet.\n\"I will be disappointed if I don't have twins - it's the twins I need,\" she admits amid the drumming and singing at the ceremony.\nSuch attitudes were a complete anathema for some members of the minority Bassa-Komo community near the capital, Abuja. Twins for them have been a source of fear.\nIn the mid-1990s, Nigerian missionary Olusola Stevens heard the villagers in this remote and poorly developed area thought twins were evil and that they were mysteriously dying.\nSuch beliefs were not unheard of in Nigeria - especially in the south-east of the country where differen",
    "A man charged over the disappearance of three tourists on a surfing trip in Mexico confessed to killing them, a court has heard.\nAustralian brothers Jake and Callum Robinson and their American friend Jack Carter Rhoad disappeared on 27 April near Ensenada.\nKnown as \"El Kekas\", the suspect appeared in court on Wednesday on kidnapping charges, but officials say murder charges will soon be laid.\nHe is yet to enter a plea.\nBaja California state officials have said the three tourists - all in their early 30s - were probably killed while trying to stop the tyres of their pickup truck being stolen. \nTheir bodies were found dumped in a cliffside well six days after they disappeared, each with a gunshot to the head, according to local authorities. A fourth body was also found in the well but had been there longer and was unconnected to the case, they added.\nThe suspect, who can only be described under Mexican law by his first names, Jes\u00fas Gerardo, has been charged with \"forced disappearance\" and his girlfriend Ari Gisel and another man have been detained for their suspected involvement. Their surnames have been suppressed by the courts.\nDuring Wednesday's court appearance, prosecutors named Ari - who has not been charged over their disappearance - as one of their witnesses. \nThe court heard the 23-year-old told investigators Jes\u00fas had turned up at her house on 28 April, telling her he had done something to \"three gringos\".\nShe asked what he meant, to which he replied \"I killed them\", the hearing was told.\nHe then showed her he had fitted out her car with new tyres, that were allegedly stolen from the slain surfers, prosecutors alleged.\nThey also told the court they believed other people were involved in the killings.\nEarlier this week, Jake and Callum Robinson's parents travelled from Perth to Mexico to identify their bodies.\nIn an emotional tribute on Tuesday, Debra Robinson said: \"Now it's time to bring them home to family and friends and the ocean waves in Australia.\"\nThe killings have sparked fear and anger in Baja California.\nIt is one of Mexico's most violent states, as local drug gangs fight turf wars.\nBut the Ensenada area, about 120km (75 miles) south of the US-Mexico border and known for its surfing conditions, is considered safer and has long attracted tourists from California.\nScores of protesters marched through the city on Sunday, carrying surfboards plastered with slogans demanding safe beaches. \nA group of surfers later performed a \"paddle-out\" ceremony, an ocean vigil to honour the trio.",
    "Australia has announced it will ramp up its extraction and use of gas until \"2050 and beyond\", despite global calls to phase out fossil fuels.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese's government says the move is needed to shore up domestic energy supply while supporting a transition to net zero.\nBut critics argue the move is a rejection of science, pointing to the International Energy Agency (IEA) call for \"huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas\" to reach climate targets.\nAustralia - one of the world's largest exporters of liquefied natural gas - has also said the policy is based on \"its commitment to being a reliable trading partner\". \nReleased on Thursday, the strategy outlines the government's plans to work with industry and state leaders to increase both the production and exploration of the fossil fuel. \nThe government will also continue to support the expansion of the country's existing gas projects, the largest of which are run by Chevron and Woodside Energy Group in Western Australia. \nIt argues these moves are needed for Australia's domestic energy supply as it tracks towards its targets of delivering 82% renewable energy to the grid by 2030, and achieving net zero emissions by 2050. \nCurrently gas accounts for 27% of the country's existing energy needs. But the bulk of what is produced domestically is exported to countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea.\nGas is responsible for roughly a quarter of Australia's total emissions, according to government data. \nThe policy has sparked fierce backlash from environmental groups and critics - who say it puts the interest of powerful fossil fuel companies before people. \n\"Fossil gas is not a transition fuel. It\u2019s one of the main contributors to global warming and has been the largest source of increases of CO2 [emissions] over the last decade,\" Prof Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics and author of numerous UN climate change reports told the BBC.\nIndependent Senator David Pocock lashed it as \u201cmorally bankrupt, negligent and just plain stupid\u201d in a statement on Thursday.  \nSuccessive Australian governments have touted gas as a key \"bridging fuel\", arguing that turning it off too soon could have \"significant adverse impacts\" on Australia's economy and energy needs. \nBut Prof Hare and other scientists have warned that building a net zero policy around gas will \"contribute to locking in 2.7-3C global warming, which will have catastrophic consequences\". \nIn 2015, world leaders promised to try to limit long-term temperature rises to 1.5C, which is seen as crucial to avoiding the most damaging impacts of climate change.\nThat limit was recently exceeded for the first time - from February 2023 to January 2024, according to the EU's climate service. \n",
    "Former England cricketer Monty Panesar has quit George Galloway's party - just one week after being unveiled as a candidate.\nMr Panesar was the highest-profile recruit among dozens the Workers Party of Britain unveiled last week.\nHe had said he wanted to \"represent the working class people of this country\" at Westminster.\nBut, writing on social media, he said he needs more time to \"find my political home\".\nMr Panesar, who was part of the side that won the 2009 Ashes series, said he had wanted to \"do my bit to help others\" but recognised he was \"still learning about how politics can help people\".\nHe said: \"So today I am withdrawing as a general election candidate for The Workers Party.\n\"I realise I need more time to listen, learn and find my political home, one that aligns with my personal and political values.\n\"I wish The Workers Party all the best but look forward to taking some time to mature and find my political feet so I am well prepared to deliver my very best when I next run up to the political wicket.\"\nThe Luton-born spin bowler had been planning to stand to become MP in West London's Ealing Southall constituency, where Labour's Virendra Sharma currently holds a 16,000 majority.\nSpeaking last week, Mr Panesar admitted he'd never voted before but said he'd been impressed by Workers Party policies, such as a wealth tax to boost the NHS, and had been encouraged to become a candidate by a friend.\nHe said he had not considered joining the Labour Party, as he felt it no longer represented working class people. \nBut he confessed he was \"not an expert on foreign policy\" when questioned about Workers Party policies on Gaza and withdrawal from Nato.\nThe news will be a blow to Mr Galloway, whose fledgling party is aiming to stand candidates in 500 constituencies at the general election.\nWhen contacted for comment about Mr Panesar's departure, a Workers Party spokesman said: \"Monty has been very open in the past about his own personal struggles.\n\"It is in Monty's best interests at this time to withdraw as a candidate, and we hope for his return to the field in due course.\"\nMr Galloway, who became the Workers Party's first MP in February after winning the Rochdale by-election, has said Labour was his party's \"number one enemy because we seek to replace them\".\nHe claimed last week to be in talks with Labour MPs and a Labour peer about potentially defecting to his new party, although nobody has been announced yet.\nAmong the other Workers Party candidates, who will be expected to cover the \u00a3500 deposit for standing in a general election out of their own pocket, are former UKIP MEP Amjad Bashir, who defected to the Conservatives in 2015 and two former British ambassadors, Peter Ford and Craig Murray.",
    "A 28-year-old man who died from a vaccine-related blood clot was wrongly offered the jab due to a clinical error by a GP surgery 17 years earlier.\nWhen he was 11, Alex Reid's weight was wrongly recorded as 22st 11lb (145kg) - suggesting he had a BMI of almost 69.\nHis parents, who say his death has \"destroyed\" them, said this put him in the \"vulnerable\" category eligible for an early AstraZeneca shot.\nThe GP surgery said it sent \"sincere sympathies\" to the Reid family. \nMr Reid received his first dose of the vaccine in March 2021, but weeks later an official recommendation said under 30s should be offered an alternative due to an extremely rare chance of blood clots.\nThose who had already received the AstraZeneca jab as their first vaccination were advised to receive it as their second, with Mr Reid having his in May 2021.\nHe died on 29 June 2021, with the medical cause of death being Covid-19 vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, a prevention of future deaths report said.\nHis family said he had called Moorfield House Surgery in Garforth, Leeds, to query why he was being invited for an early vaccine.\nHis mother, Halina Reid, told the BBC: \"Surely this one call from Alex should have raised alarm bells since most of the calls the surgery was getting were from people asking why they had not been called.\n\"The person who took the call said she did not know, made no attempt to find out and just said, 'count yourself lucky'.\"\nShe continued: \"After Alex's death, we knew something was not right - it has taken two years and five months to get answers.\"\nMr Reid's weight had been incorrectly entered in 2004 during a routine appointment for asthma when he was 11, his family said. \nAt no point over the next 17 years was it flagged up as being unusual that a 4ft 9in (145cm) boy had a BMI of nearly 69, with a healthy BMI being between 18 and 25, they added.\n\"The error was so serious that a safeguarding concern should have picked it up,\" his mother said. \n\"It would be almost impossible for a child to weigh that much - they had opportunities to rectify this mistake over the course of his life.\"\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine, which is being withdrawn due to shifting demands, was estimated to have saved millions of lives during the pandemic but also caused rare, and sometimes fatal, blood clots.\nThe prevention of future deaths report, prepared by coroner Oliver Longstaff, called for \"validation rules in general practice IT systems\" for when data is entered or a function that \"challenges\" potential errors. \nHe wrote: \"If the obviously erroneous BMI had not been recorded or had been challenged at the point of entry by the relevant IT system, Alex would not have been classed as vulnerable... and would not have died when he did.\"\nHis report was sent to NHS England, the British Medical Association and the Royal College of General Practitioners as well as EMIS and TPP - healthcare technology companies used by GPs. \nAll have been contacted for comment by the BBC. \nAn NHS England spokesperson said: \"We extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Alex Reid.\n\"We are carefully considering the prevention of future deaths report sent to us by HM Coroner and will respond in due course.\" \nMrs Reid said she was alerted to the BMI error in July 2021 during a phone call with one of the surgery doctors, who suggested her son's weight may have been incorrectly inputted. \nBut the surgery was \"not forthcoming with the truth\" and failed to disclose the error when replying to two coroner's letters about the matter, she said. \nIn response to a further letter, the surgery stated in February 2023 a raised BMI on its system could have triggered the early vaccine invitation, she added. \nThe surgery has since apologised to Mr Reid's parents, but his mother called it an \"insult\".\n\"It is gobsmacking they were so blatant in trying to blame others, when it was one fatal mistake they made,\" she said.\nAlex loved aviation and music, his family said, and described him as \"their world\".\nHis father, Antony Reid, said: \"We feel we have been destroyed. He was my best friend.\n\"It's a nightmare we are living every single day - we've followed every avenue to get the truth and some justice for him but it will not bring him back.\"\nHe added: \"The last three years have been horrendous, not only grieving him but fighting for justice he deserves.\"\nMrs Reid said she hoped the coroner's report would cause \"real change\" in how medical records were kept. \nIn a statement, the surgery said: \"We are very sorry about the death of Mr Reid and send our sincere sympathies to his family and friends. \n\"The practice gave evidence at the inquest hearing, however we are unable to comment further because of our duty of patient confidentiality.\"",
    "A criminal investigation has been launched by authorities in Egypt following the fatal shooting of an Israeli-Canadian businessman.\nThe incident happened in the northern coastal city of Alexandria on Tuesday. \nThe victim has been named by Israeli and Arabic media as Ziv Kipper - the head of an Egyptian food exporter. \nA previously unknown group has said it was behind the shooting.\nIt has called itself the Vanguards of Liberation - the Martyr Mohammad Salah group - an apparent reference to an Egyptian police officer who was killed after shooting dead three Israeli soldiers last year. \nIn a statement, the group described Mr Kipper as an Israeli agent and said his killing was in retaliation for what it called massacres in Gaza and Israel's seizure of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, which also happened on Tuesday. \nA security source told Reuters they had no information about the existence of such a group and whether it had been involved in Tuesday's attack. \nNeither Israel nor Egypt have yet officially named the man who was killed. \nHowever, the Israeli foreign ministry confirmed that the victim was a businessman with dual Canadian-Israeli citizenship. \nIt added that the Israeli embassy in Cairo was in contact with the Egyptian authorities.\nEgypt's interior ministry, meanwhile, said in a statement that the man had been \"residing permanently\" in the country.\n\"Legal action has been taken,\" it said, without providing further details. \nJames Emmanuel Wanki, a spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada - the government's diplomatic department - said they were aware of the death of a Canadian citizen in Egypt and  \"express our deepest condolences to the family\". \n\"Consular officials are in contact with local authorities and available to provide consular assistance to the family,\" he said.\n\"Due to privacy regulations, no additional information can be disclosed.\"\nMr Kipper is listed online as the CEO of OK Group, which was founded in 2008 and exports frozen fruits and vegetables. Its headquarters is in Alexandria. ",
    "The US government says it has revoked some licences that allowed US chip makers to export certain goods to Chinese technology giant Huawei.\nThe Department of Commerce did not specify which permits were cancelled but US chip giants Intel and Qualcomm said they had been informed that some export licenses have been revoked.\nHuawei did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.\nSince 2019, the US has restricted technology exports to Huawei, citing alleged ties to the Chinese military but companies like Intel and Qualcomm were granted some exemptions.\nBeijing condemned Washington's moves against its companies.\nThe US was \"over-stretching the concept of national security and abusing export controls to suppress Chinese companies without justification,\" the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement.\nSome US lawmakers had criticised the administration of President Joe Biden following the launch last month of Huawei's MateBook X Pro laptop.\n\"Make no mistake, the Biden Administration would not have taken this action if Republicans in Congress were not holding them accountable,\" said Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik in a social media post.\nHuawei has been hit hard by US trade restrictions but more recently appeared to mount a comeback.\nThe Chinese company has enjoyed a resurgence particularly after the launch of the Mate 60 Pro smartphone in August.\nIn 2019, during the presidency of Donald Trump, US officials added Huawei to a so-called \"entity list.\"\nIt means that US companies need to obtain a licence from the government to export or transfer some technologies, especially over concerns that they will be used by the Chinese military.\nHowever, in that time licences have been granted to some US companies, including Intel and Qualcomm, to supply Huawei with technology that was not related to 5G.\nThe US has imposed restrictions on several Chinese technology firms in recent years, as tensions between the world's two biggest economies intensified.\nEarlier this month President Biden signed a law that could ban the video app TikTok in the country unless it is sold by its Chinese parent company. TikTok filed a lawsuit on Tuesday to block the legislation.",
    "Reigning Miss USA Noelia Voigt has resigned her title, citing mental health challenges. \nMs Voigt, who won the annual competition in September, said she believed in making decisions \"that feel best for you and your mental health\". \n\"Never compromise your physical and mental wellbeing,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"Our health is our wealth.\" \nThe Miss USA organisation said it supported her decision and would announce a successor.\nThe 24-year-old Venezuelan-American, of Utah, said that she hoped to \"continue to inspire others\" as she started \"a new chapter\" in life.\n\"Prioritise your mental health, advocate for yourself and others by using your voice and never be afraid of what the future holds, even if it feels uncertain,\" she said.\nShe expressed her gratitude for her seven months as Miss USA, which she said gave her a \"platform ... to make a difference\" as well as realise a \"lifelong dream\" and meeting \"people all over the world.\" \nMiss USA thanked Ms Voigt and said on Instagram that \"the well-being of our titleholders is a top priority\".\nThe organisation said it was reviewing plans for the \"transition of responsibilities to a successor\". \nSavannah Gankiewicz of Hawaii came second to Ms Voigt in last year's competition. The New York Times reported Ms Gankiewicz has already been offered the title.\nWhile health professionals praised the decision to step down, fans have speculated about her motivation to renounce her crown little over seven months into the role.\n\"When mental illness gets in the way of someone's ability to go about not just their day-to-day activities, but to actually do their job, it is as life-threatening and as severe as untreated diabetes [and] uncontrolled high blood pressure,\" Dr Jen Ashton, an American health correspondent, told Good Morning America in reaction to the news.\nMs Voigt's resignation came three days after Miss USA's social media director, Claudia Michelle, announced her own resignation from the brand, citing alleged \"workplace toxicity and bullying\" and saying that titleholders \"should be heard and not silenced\".\n\"I have had the privilege of getting to work with Noelia closely and unfortunately seen a decline in her mental health since we first met,\" Ms Michelle wrote in a statement.\nMs Voigt's \"ability to share her story and her platform have been diminished\", she claimed.\nMiss USA told USA Today that Ms Michelle's statement contained \"false accusations\", and said the organisation was \"committed to fostering a safe, inclusive and supportive environment, and we take these allegations seriously. \n\"Indeed, we have and will continue to prioritize the well-being of all individuals involved with Miss USA.\"\nBut fans on social media noticed that the first letter of each sentence of Ms Voigt's lengthy resignation statement spelled out \"I AM SILENCED\" - though the final three sentences spelled \"HIP\". Beneath her resignation statement posted to Instagram, dozens of fans commented on the apparent connection. \nThe BBC has approached Miss USA for further comment.\nMiss USA has previously courted controversy over the treatment of contestants. The year before Ms Voigt was crowned, the pageant faced allegations of rigging the 2022 contest in favour of winner B'Roney Gabriel, who had ties to sponsors - including one owned by the then-president Crystle Stewart. \nMs Stewart was suspended from her role, though she, Miss USA and Ms Gabriel denied the rigging claims. It was later revealed that Ms Stewart's husband, Max Sebrechts, a Miss USA vice-president, resigned his role after multiple contestants alleged he had sexually harassed them in 2021.",
    "People in several regions of Ukraine have been experiencing power blackouts after the latest wave of Russian attacks on the country's energy infrastructure. \nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said there had been missile and drone attacks on critical energy facilities in seven regions.\nBBC Verify has been tracking Russian strikes on energy targets in the past months and industry experts have said Russia has been shifting its strategy  - increasingly targeting power plants to try to disrupt energy supplies to Ukrainians. \nIn posts on social media, Mr Zelensky said more than 50 missiles and 20 drones had been fired by Russia on Tuesday, hitting facilities in the Lviv, Vinnytsia, Kyiv, Poltava, Kirovohrad, Zaporizhzhia, and Ivano-Frankivsk regions.\nUkraine's national electricity company, Ukrenergo, said there were new blackouts in nine regions and warned of possible power cuts across the country on Wednesday evening as a result of the new damage and ongoing fighting. \nBefore the most recent Russian attacks, our analysis verified damage to 12 facilities and Ukrainian authorities have reported at least a dozen more hit - with the impact ranging from them running at significantly reduced capacity to being taken entirely out of commission.\nOn 22 March, a series of air strikes hit power plants across Ukraine.\nOne thermal plant in Kharkiv was destroyed, according to government-run energy company Centrenergo. An image of it, which we have verified, shows a hole blown in the centre of the building that served Ukraine's second-largest city. \nRussia also hit the two power plants run by private firm DTEK - one in Ladyzhyn in central Ukraine and another in Burshtyn in the west. DTEK said at the time, without specifying which, that some of its facilities had been destroyed totally and others were running at around 50% capacity.\nYou can see the extent of the damage to the Ladyzhyn plant in satellite images from before and after the strikes. \nOther key facilities we have verified as being hit on this day include Ukraine's largest hydroelectric power station in Zaporizhzhia, where a fire broke out at the facility on the vast dam spanning the Dnipro river.\nStrikes on three different hydroelectric plants followed a week later. \nFootage posted on social media on 29 March showed two big explosions at the Kremenchuk Hydroelectric Station in central Ukraine, although satellite imagery of it is not conclusive about the level of damage. \nA third wave of attacks came on 11 April, including the destruction of the Trypillya power plant in Kyiv. Footage of it on fire went viral on social media and received significant media coverage.\nThis is the only strike BBC Verify has been able to corroborate from that night, but Ukrainian authorities also reported damage to plants in Sumy, Zaporizhzhia and Odesa.\nMore hits were reported on 27 April and then again on 8 May, though we have not been able to find any verifiable footage of these so far. \nThis is largely because the publishing of images or videos of strikes on key infrastructure is banned under martial law in Ukraine.  \nRussia has carried out frequent and widespread attacks on Ukraine's power infrastructure since the beginning of its full-scale invasion in 2022, but one expert told BBC Verify that its tactics have changed in recent months.\nVolodymyr Omelchenko, director of energy programmes at the Ukraine-based Razumkov Centre think tank, said Russian forces have been targeting larger energy generation infrastructure over smaller substations -  as power plants take longer to fix.\nAs of mid-April, he said Ukraine had lost more than 80% of all thermal generation capacity, on top of the destruction of Ukraine's largest hydroelectric power station.\nMr Omelchenko added he believes the attacks are aimed at creating a \"socio-economic collapse\" in Ukraine, rendering the country essentially impossible to live or run a business in.\n\"Moscow hopes that the collapse of the energy sector will force millions of people to emigrate,\" he warned.\nAnother energy industry expert told BBC Verify the focus on thermal and hydroelectric generation plants was also intended to reduce the flexibility of Ukraine's grid, as they can supply power regardless of the time of day or weather conditions.\nThe damage to the facilities, according to Olena Lapenko from the DiXi group think tank, means Ukraine's national energy company has been forced to import power from neighbouring countries to meet peak demand in the evening.\nShe believes the missiles have been targeting turbines and generators - elements which are the most complex to fix and expensive to replace.\n\"The goal of the Russians is obvious - to plunge Ukraine into darkness and leave the Ukrainian economy without electricity, undermining defence capabilities.\"\nThe Ukrainian military has also responded with its own series of drone strikes on Russian oil depots and refining facilities in recent months, which BBC Verify has looked at previously. \nAdditional reporting by Paul",
    "Hong Kong's government will be able to proceed with making a protest song illegal under the city's national security laws after winning a court challenge.\nThe High Court had last year rejected the government's request for Glory to Hong Kong to be banned, saying it would have \"chilling effects\" on free speech. \nBut on Wednesday an appeal court overturned that ruling.\nThe move is likely to deepen concerns about freedoms being further eroded in the city.\nAmnesty International said the government's ban was \"as ludicrous as it is dangerous\".\nThe US, meanwhile, said it was \"the latest blow to the international reputation\" of the city.\nIn the court's ruling on Wednesday, it said that the song can still be used for \"academic\" or \"news\" activities.\nBut its melodies and lyrics can not be broadcast, performed, shared or reproduced in any setting where the user intends to \"incite others to commit secession\" or is used \"with seditious intention\" against the Hong Kong government. Those convicted of breaching the ban on the anthem could face up to life imprisonment.\nIt is also illegal for people to use the song to advocate for Hong Kong's separation from China, and to present it as the anthem of the territory.\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokesman on Wednesday said banning the song was a \"necessary measure by (Hong Kong) to fulfil its responsibility of safeguarding national security\". \nAmnesty's China Director, Sarah Brooks said: \"Banning \u2018Glory to Hong Kong\u2019 not only represents a senseless attack on Hong Kongers\u2019 freedom of expression; it also violates international human rights law.\n\"Singing a protest song should never be a crime, nor is it a threat to \u2018national security\u2019.\"\nHong Kong is part of China, but has had some autonomy since the end of British rule in 1997. Campaigners say that democratic freedoms have been gradually eroded since then.\nThe song Glory to Hong Kong - sung in the territory's native dialect Cantonese - emerged during pro-democracy protests in 2019 against a controversial extradition law and later became the unofficial anthem of the movement.\nIts lyrics include lines such as \"Liberate Hong Kong\" and \"Revolution of our times. May people reign, proud and free, now and evermore. Glory be to thee Hong Kong\".\nWhile the new ban will specifically codify when the song's use is illegal, people in Hong Kong had already been punished under national security laws for playing it.\nIn 2022, a harmonica player was arrested for playing the song outside the British consulate in Hong Kong to mourn the death of Queen Elizabeth II.\nThe song has been banned in schools since 2020.\nOfficials had also petitioned internet giants like Google to remove the protest song from their search results and video platforms - something the sites refused to do.\nThe song has also at times been mistakenly played as the city's anthem at official events like international sporting matches, something that has angered authorities. \nOn Thursday, the appeal court said pursuing a ban on the song's use in political contexts fell within the remit of current national security laws.\nIt said that because it was hard to prosecute individual criminal acts, \"a more effective way to safeguard national security was to ask\" would be to ask internet platforms to \"stop facilitating the acts being carried out on their platforms\".

    "The US last week paused a bomb shipment for Israel over concerns it was going ahead with a major ground operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, a senior US administration official said. \nThe shipment consisted of 1,800 2,000lb (907kg) bombs and 1,700 500lb bombs, the official told the BBC.\nIsrael has not \"fully addressed\" US concerns over the humanitarian needs of civilians in Rafah, they added.\nAn Israeli military official appeared to play down the US move.\nThe delayed arms shipment comes as US President Joe Biden faces mounting domestic pressure - from Democratic lawmakers and some parts of the US public - to rein in Israeli operations in Gaza amid rising civilian deaths and a worsening humanitarian situation. \nDespite firm and vocal US opposition, Israel appears poised to mount a large-scale invasion of Rafah, a congested part of southern Gaza that is Hamas' last major stronghold in the territory. \nUS officials have warned that an operation in the city - where the population has swelled with refugees from other parts of Gaza - could lead to extensive civilian casualties. \nIDF spokesman Daniel Hagari told a news conference that the US had provided \"unprecedented\" security assistance since the beginning of the war, adding that disputes between the allies were resolved \"behind closed doors in a matter-of-fact way\".\nBut a leading member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party in Israel told BBC's Newshour on Wednesday that he believes US domestic political considerations are behind the decision to halt the delivery of bombs.\n\"I totally disagree that the American election has nothing to do with it,\" said Boaz Bismuth, a member of the both the Israeli parliament and the foreign affairs and defence committee. \nThe weapons being held back by the US are related to a future delivery, so it is unlikely to have any immediate impact. But given the rate at which Israel is bombing it will likely affect future strikes fairly soon. \nOvernight, there were more Israeli air strikes in the Gaza Strip, hours after Israeli forces took control of the Palestinians side of the Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt.\nThe Israeli bombardment was particularly intense around Rafah. Local medics said seven members of one family were killed.\nRafah has been a key entry point for aid, and the only exit for people able to flee, since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas last October.\nThe crossing remained closed on Wednesday morning, but the Israeli military said it was reopening the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing, which had been closed for four days because of Hamas rocket fire.\nOn Monday, the Israeli military ordered tens of thousands of civilians to begin evacuating eastern parts of Rafah city, ahead of what it called a \"limited\" operation to eliminate Hamas fighters and dismantle infrastructure.\nMeanwhile, efforts continue to reach a ceasefire, alongside the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. In Cairo, delegations from Israel and Hamas have resumed negotiations through mediators. \nAfter refusing to confirm or deny reports of delayed weapons shipments, a US official on Tuesday finally confirmed that at least one shipment of bombs was delayed this week. \n\"The US position has been that Israel should not launch a major ground operation in Rafah, where more than a million people are sheltering with nowhere else to go,\" the senior US administration official said.\nThe official added that talks with Israel are \"ongoing and have not fully addressed our concerns\" and the US had been reviewing its weapons transfers to Israel since April.\n\"We are especially focused on the end-use of the 2,000lb bombs and the impact they could have in dense urban settings as we have seen in other parts of Gaza,\" the official said.\nThey stressed that the shipments were unrelated to last month's landmark $17bn military aid package, but had been drawn from \"previously appropriated funds\". \nThe larger 2,000lb bombs are most likely to be Mk-84s or possibly BLU-109s - or both. \nThe former is a cheap, general purpose munition and the latter a penetration bomb designed for use against hardened or underground targets. Both can be fitted with JDAM kits that deliver precision capability using satellite navigation. Laser guidance kits can also be fitted.\nThese bombs can be made to be very accurate, down to just a few metres. But in a dense, urban environment like Gaza the risk of so-called \"collateral damage\" is high. And that is where the concern lies. The smaller 500lb bombs can also be fitted with guidance units dropped from jets.\nWe do not know exactly how Israel uses these weapons, but media posts from the Israeli Air Force frequently show F-16 and F-15 jets loaded with JDAM [Joint Direct Attack Munition] kits for strikes. \nIt is worth remembering that such weapons would not just be used in Gaza but also targets in southern Lebanon belonging to the Iran-backed group Hezbollah, which has been involved in almost daily cross-bord",
    "Hundreds of Gaza's water and sanitation facilities have been damaged or destroyed since Israel began military action against Hamas, satellite analysis by BBC Verify has found.\nDamage to a major supplies depot has also severely disrupted repairs.\nThe lack of clean water and flows of untreated sewage pose a serious threat to health, say aid agencies. \nThe Israel Defense Forces told the BBC that Hamas cynically exploits civilian infrastructure for terror purposes.\nThe destruction comes despite Israel's duty to protect critical infrastructure under the rules of war, unless there is evidence sites are being used for military reasons, say human rights lawyers.\nClean water has always been a limited resource in Gaza and the territory has largely relied on a system of boreholes and desalination plants for its supply.\nOur analysis found that more than half of these vital facilities have been damaged or destroyed since Israel launched its retaliation in Gaza after Hamas attacked on 7 October. \nWe also found that four of the six wastewater treatment plants - crucial to preventing the build-up of sewage and the spread of disease - have been damaged or destroyed. The two others have shut down because lack of fuel or other supplies, according to one aid agency. \nThe plants were among more than 600 water and sanitation facilities that we analysed, using a list of locations provided by Gaza's Coastal Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU).\nIn one satellite image, of Khan Younis in the south of Gaza, two damaged large water storage tanks can be seen.\nThe destruction of water and sanitation facilities has led to \"disastrous health consequences for the population\", said Dr Natalie Roberts, executive director of Medecins Sans Frontieres UK.\n\"The rates of diarrhoeal disease have gone catastrophically high,\" she said.\nIn very severe cases, such disease can kill young children and the vulnerable. Rates of hepatitis A - found in contaminated water and particularly dangerous for pregnant women - are also high, according to the charity.\n\"This is killing people,\" Dr Roberts said. \nThere is a particular spike in disease in Rafah in the south where many Gazans have fled to, Dr Roberts said, and a risk of cholera. \nThere has been widespread damage to buildings across Gaza since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October. According to the UN, about 69,000 housing units have been destroyed and a further 290,000 damaged. \nHomes are now \"very unlikely\" to have running water, according to aid workers we spoke to.\nTo carry out this analysis we sought advice from experts at the UN and Human Rights Watch on the best approach. \nFor each site, we sourced the most recent high resolution satellite imagery and compared each shot with an image taken prior to 7 October. \nWe then marked a facility as destroyed or damaged if the closest structure to the given co-ordinates appeared to be reduced to rubble, partially collapsed, or showed other signs of damage. \nBBC Verify has not distinguished between \"destroyed\" and \"damaged\" facilities. This is because without knowing the precise outline of each facility, we cannot say whether it has been partly damaged or completely destroyed. \nWater wells usually consist of an underground borehole and electric pump, together with a small control room above ground. However, as the control room is not always visible or easily identifiable we had to rely on analysing the nearest visible buildings when assessing damage.\nOf the 603 water facilities we analysed, 53% appeared to have been damaged or destroyed since 7 October. \nA further 43 facilities were in areas that showed some damage or where solar panels had been removed, but we were unable to determine whether the water facility itself had been damaged so these were not included in our analysis.\nThe latest available satellite images were acquired in March and April, and our analysis has been ongoing since April.\nThe majority of sites identified as destroyed or damaged are in northern Gaza or in the area around the southern city of Khan Younis. \nAt one wastewater facility in Bureij, in the centre of the Strip, solar panels that power the plant had been obliterated and sewage treatment tanks appeared to have algae growing on the surface.  \nNot all damage is visible from satellite images, so our analysis may have missed some affected facilities. Some sites also may not be fully operational due to a lack of fuel.\nFor example, the Unicef desalination plant in Deir al-Balah - one of three large seawater facilities in Gaza - can only work at 30% capacity because of lack of fuel, Unicef told the BBC.\nWith most Gazans now displaced from their homes, and living in tented camps, the build-up of sewage in the streets is even more of a threat.\n\"The pumps for sewage are not operating and the streets are flooded [with it],\" said Muhammad Atallah, who works for the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights.\nThe conflict has already made water facility repair difficult for Gaza's water authority, but a ",
    "A UK girl born deaf can now hear unaided, after a groundbreaking gene-therapy treatment.\nOpal Sandy was treated shortly before her first birthday - and six months on, can hear sounds as soft as a whisper and is starting to talk, saying words such as \"Mama\", \"Dada\" and \"uh-oh\".\nGiven as an infusion into the ear, the therapy replaces faulty DNA causing her type of inherited deafness. \nOpal is part of a trial recruiting patients in the UK, US and Spain.\nDoctors in other countries, including China, are also exploring very similar treatments for the Otof gene mutation Opal has. \nHer parents, Jo and James, from Oxfordshire, say the results have been mind-blowing - but allowing Opal to be the first to test this treatment, made by Regeneron, was extremely tough. \n\"It was really scary, but I think we'd been given this unique opportunity,\" Jo told me in an exclusive TV interview for BBC Breakfast News. \nHer sister, Nora, five, has the same type of deafness and manages well wearing an electrical cochlear implant.\nRather than making sound louder, like a hearing aid, it gives the \"sensation\" of hearing, by directly stimulating the auditory nerve that communicates with the brain, bypassing the damaged sound-sensing hair cells in a part of the inner ear known as the cochlea.\nIn contrast, the therapy uses a modified, harmless virus to deliver a working copy of the Otof gene into these cells. \nOpal had the therapy in her right ear, under general anaesthetic, and a cochlear implant put into her left.\nJust a few weeks later, she could hear loud sounds, such as clapping, in her right ear.\nAnd after six months, her doctors, at Addenbrooke's Hospital, in Cambridge, confirmed that ear had almost normal hearing for soft sounds - even very quiet whispers. \n\"It's wonderful seeing her respond to sound,\" chief investigator and ear surgeon Prof Manohar Bance told BBC News. \n\"It's a very joyful time.\"\nExperts hope the therapy could also work for other types of profound hearing loss. \nMore than half of hearing-loss cases in children have a genetic cause.\nAnd Prof Bance hopes the trial can lead to gene therapy being used for more common types of hearing loss. \n\"What I am hoping is that we can start to use gene therapy in young children... where we actually restore the hearing and they don't have to have cochlear implants and other technologies that have to be replaced,\" he said.\nHearing loss caused by a variation in the Otof gene is not commonly detected until children are two or three years old, when a delay in speech is likely.\nBut genetic testing for at risk families is available on the NHS. \nProf Bance said: \"The younger we can restore hearing, the better for all children because the brain starts to shut down its plasticity [adaptability] after the age of about three or so.\"\nOpal's experience, alongside other scientific data from the trial, is being presented at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy in Baltimore, in the US. \nMartin McLean, from the National Deaf Children's Society, said more options were to be welcomed.\n\"With the right support from the start, deafness should never be a barrier to happiness or fulfilment,\" he said.\n\"As a charity, we support families to make informed choices about medical technologies, so that they can give their deaf child the best possible start in life.\"\nAdditional reporting by Nicki Stiastny and James Anderson.

    "Dozens of people have been rescued from a FedEx depot in Michigan that had partially collapsed after a tornado. \nThe rare tornado hit the small town of Portage, eight miles (13km) south of Kalamazoo, on Tuesday evening.\nOfficials said all 50 people trapped inside escaped with no serious injuries.\nSevere weather warnings are still in place from Ohio to Mississippi with a few tornadoes still expected.\nMichigan's tornadoes damaged buildings and power lines in the region, and on Wednesday, more than 56 million people remained under threat in at least 18 states.\nMore than 30,000 people are still without electricity, according to the PowerOutages US website.\nThe severe weather marks the first-ever tornado emergency - the highest level - issued for Michigan from the National Weather Service (NWS).\nOfficials said up to 16 people suffered non-severe injuries after the tornadoes ripped through nearly 200 mobile homes in the area.\n\"We found homes in the roadway, we found homes in neighbours' homes. We found large trees in homes. We found many vehicles that had been smashed by large trees or homes,\" Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller said on Tuesday.\nHe credited the low injury rate to people's awareness and readiness for the severe weather, as well as the swift and coordinated response by emergency crews.\nThe tornadoes also damaged the FedEx facility in Portage, Michigan. Officials said collapsed wires and debris had to be removed in order to reach those who were stuck inside.\nAll were safely rescued by early Wednesday, the Kalamazoo County Government said in a statement. \nLate on Tuesday, FedEx said in its own statement that it is \"grateful there were no serious injuries resulting from damage to our facility\". \nOver a dozen tornadoes were reported on Tuesday evening in Michigan, Indiana and Ohio.

    "The government's efforts to clean up England's rivers, lakes and seas have been criticised by a key environmental watchdog as \"poor\". \nThe Office for Environmental Protection (OEP), a statutory body, said targets to improve water health were going to be missed by a \"large margin\".\nIt said government plans lack detail, commitment and adequate funding.\nA government spokesperson said this government had done \"more than any other\" to restore waterways. \nThe OEP was established after Brexit to hold the government and other public bodies to account on environmental issues, given that EU oversight no longer applied. \nIn this latest report, the OEP looked at whether the laws protecting England's rivers, lakes and coastal waters from pollution were up to the job, and how they're being enforced. \n\"We found the legal framework to be basically sound. But the way that it's being interpreted and implemented is really being done poorly,\" Dame Glenys Stacey, the chair of the OEP, told BBC News.  \n\"That means that government is very unlikely to achieve its ambitions for our waters. In fact, it's very likely to miss by a large margin,\" she said.\nAt the moment, just 16% of England's waterways are rated as having Good Ecological Status. The government stated target is for that to rise to 77% by 2027. But the OEP says reaching 21% is seen as more likely. \n\"Unless things change, it's a very poor situation,\" Dame Glenys said. \nThe OEP criticised what it called the government's \"generic one size fits all\" approach to improving waterways and said that there needed to be more detail, commitment and funding. \nThe environment secretary now has three months to respond officially to the OEP report.\nBut a spokesperson provided immediate comment and said that recent years had seen greatly increased monitoring of sewage discharges and plans to invest billions of pounds in wastewater treatment infrastructure.\n\"This government has done more than any other to protect and restore our rivers, lakes and coastal waters with record levels of investment, monitoring and enforcement,\" the spokesperson said. \n\"We welcome this report's recommendations to go further and will consider them in detail.\"\nMost of the campaign groups contacted by BBC News said the report confirmed what they already knew. \n\"It is no surprise that following years of underinvestment, weak regulation and poor instruction on how to deliver plans, that the government are off track for the majority of their plans to improve the health of England's waterways,\" Louise Reddy from Surfers Against Sewage said.\n\"The long-term health of our rivers is dependent on what we do now to support them,\" Mark Lloyd, CEO of the Rivers Trust, told BBC News.\n\"This report proves our long-held suspicion that current policy and legislation is not enough - we need to change course to save our rivers.\"",
    "Sir Keir Starmer's decision to admit Tory MP Natalie Elphicke into Labour has been met with bewilderment by some of his MPs.\nThe Dover MP's surprise defection from the Conservatives has prompted reaction ranging from delight to anger by her new colleagues.\nCanterbury MP Rosie Duffield said Labour MPs were \"baffled\" by her \"really peculiar\" move to swap sides.\nBut a senior party figure hailed her switch as \"one hell of a coup\". \nAnd Sir Keir has said he is \"delighted\" with her defection, telling reporters it showed his party was \"the party of the national interest\". \nSeveral sources suggested Labour's whips, responsible for party discipline, were worried about accepting her, but Labour deny this. \nIt is the second defection to Labour for Rishi Sunak in less than two weeks, after Dr Dan Poulter also quit the Tories last month.\nNormally, when an MP switches parties, their new colleagues are almost all delighted.\nHowever, this latest defection, announced minutes before Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, has left some Labour MPs feeling upset, let down, and shocked.\nIn a blistering statement, Ms Elphicke said the Tories had become a \"byword for incompetence and division\".\nWhat Ms Duffield is willing to say publicly in reaction to the defection, many many more are saying privately.\nAlthough Ms Elphicke has made arguments in areas such as housing that are in tune with her new colleagues she has previously attacked Labour policy in a number of areas.\nShe has criticised the party for \"grabbing more in taxes\" and not being \"serious\" about stopping small boat crossings, a big issue in her Dover seat. \nAs well as her political stance, many Labour MPs are deeply uncomfortable with remarks she made about her then-husband Charlie Elphicke, whom she replaced as Dover MP in 2019.\nIn an interview with the Sun after his conviction in 2020 for sexual assault, she was reported to have said being \"attractive\" and \"attracted to women\" had made him an \"easy target\".\nShe has not commented on those previous remarks since defecting on Wednesday.\nLabour said \"all those issues have been dealt with previously both in Parliament and in public\".\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Sheffield on Wednesday, Labour MP Sarah Champion said \"some of the things Mrs Elphicke had said defending her ex-husband from the sexual abuse allegations\" did not \"sit well with me at all\".\nShe also said she would find it \"challenging\" to have former Tory MPs in the party \"when it's so close to a general election\".\n\"I think their policies and their belief systems are so far from mine but we are where we are I guess,\" she added.\nShe added the fact that Ms Elphicke, like Dan Poulter, are both planning to quit Parliament at the election created a \"bit of a mess\" because Labour already has candidates in both their seats.\nConservative MPs have also expressed surprise at Ms Elphicke's defection, with Transport Minister Huw Merriman branding her \"shameless\" and an \"opportunist\".\n\"I'm just disappointed for politics that she's done what she's done,\" he added.\nSpeaking to BBC South East, fellow Kent MP Ms Duffield said Labour backbenchers were \"really confused\" by the defection.\n\"I think it's a really peculiar decision and I think most Labour backbenchers and probably lots of Tories are really quite baffled by it, actually,\" she added.\nShe added she didn't \"believe for a second that she has suddenly transformed into a Labour MP\".\nAnd fellow Labour backbencher Mick Whitley called her move \"outrageous,\" adding Ms Elphicke did not share the \"values of the Labour movement\".\nMish Rahman, a member of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee, said that he does not welcome Ms Elphicke's defection, saying the party is getting \"grubbier\".\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight, Mr Rahman said that Ms Elphicke has \"never occupied the centre ground in her time as an MP\". \nHe described the Conservative Party as a \"sinking ship\" and said Ms Elphicke is \"swimming in the ocean\" trying to \"escape\" it. \nHe said the Labour Party should be in the business of changing the country, \"not saving the careers of Tory politicians who the British public are rejecting because of the damage they've done to the country\".\n\"She's not fit to be a Labour party member, let alone an MP,\" he added.\nJohn McDonnell, who was shadow chancellor under former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, said he was \"surprised and shocked\" by her move.\n\"I'm a great believer in the powers of conversion, but I think even this one would have strained the generosity of spirit of John the Baptist, quite honestly,\" he told LBC.\nHowever, Sir Keir will hope to keep the focus on the big picture - and argue Tory defections can personify his wider project of tempting former Conservative voters to switch to Labour.\n\"That's what matters,\" says a senior Labour figure. \n\"In the end we have recruited the Conservative MP for Dover for goodness' sake. In the middle of row about small boat crossings. That's one hell of a coup.\" ",
    "The Duke of Sussex has attended a service at St Paul's Cathedral in London during a brief visit to the UK.\nPrince Harry was speaking at the event to mark the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, the sporting competition for injured service men and women he helped found.\nMeanwhile, the King, whose cancer treatment is ongoing, met members of the public at a Buckingham Palace garden party a little over two miles away.\nThe two are not scheduled to see each other while both are in London. \nThe duke's spokesman said the King's \"full programme\" prevented any meeting.\nA crowd gathered in the sunshine outside St Paul's to greet Prince Harry, the driving force behind the Invictus Games, who smiled and waved from the steps as he arrived.\nOnce inside, he gave a warm greeting to his uncle, Earl Spencer, who was sitting behind him in the cathedral.\nSpeaking in the church where his parents were married, Prince Harry gave a Bible reading from Corinthians that emphasised different people have different gifts and strengths.\nAnother reading from Isaiah talked of stopping \u201cthe pointing of the finger, the speaking of evil\u201d.\nThere was also an emotional reading of a poem about the positive impact of the Invictus Games by Michelle Turner, captain of the UK\u2019s team in Sydney in 2018.\nThis was clearly a very personal event for Prince Harry. With the tight-knit Invictus congregation seated in a circle, under the cathedral dome, it was almost literally his circle of trust.\nWith the traditional hymns and prayers, the ranks of clergy, and no gimmicks or modern twists, you could imagine his grandmother the late Queen Elizabeth II fitting in comfortably with such a service.\nWith the mellow late afternoon sunshine coming in through the long windows, it was a surprisingly intimate celebration of a decade of helping to give a sense of purpose to individuals and families under pressure.\nIt was also shaped like a royal event, complete with cameras and cheers outside and Prince Harry shaking a few excited hands as he was leaving. \nThere was plenty of support for him in this instant crowd of passers-by and tourists.\nHe has been in legal battles over security during visits to the UK, but there were lines of City of London police here seeing him safely away.\nHowever, there was also an inescapable sense of absence, with none of his royal relations there with him. \nThe headlines have become about who wasn\u2019t there, including his father and brother. \nThis felt very much like a solo mission.\nThe duke, who now lives in California, last saw the King in person shortly after his February announcement that he was being treated for an unspecified form of cancer.\nThe King has since returned to some public duties but is continuing to receive medical care.\nOn Wednesday he was seen removing his top hat and waving it in the air as a crowd greeted him by singing the national anthem at Buckingham Palace.\nPrince Harry is also not expected to meet the Prince or Princess of Wales - who is also being treated for cancer - while in the UK.\nOn Tuesday, a spokesperson for the duke said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\"The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\nOn Tuesday, the duke attended an Invictus Games summit in London, where he told delegates: \"Sometimes you... look back and go 'Look at what we've done'.\n\"But also given the state of the world, there is so much more to do and I think a lot of uncertainty - but what we've created is a global community.\"\nPrince Harry is not being joined by the Duchess of Sussex for this visit, but his wife is scheduled to meet him in Nigeria, where he is due to travel after his stop in London.\nThe couple were invited by Nigeria's chief of defence staff after they met at the Invictus Games held last year in Germany.\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis straight to your inbox every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

    "A former Sinn F\u00e9in minister has said she accepts now that she should not have attended a controversial funeral during the Covid pandemic.\nCar\u00e1l N\u00ed Chuil\u00edn was Communities Minister from June 2020 until December that year.\nShe appeared before the UK Covid-19 public inquiry on Wednesday.\nShe was among a group of senior Sinn F\u00e9in politicians who attended the funeral of republican Bobby Storey in June 2020.\nThe gathering was criticised at the time as being in breach of Covid rules.\nShe was asked by Brenda Campbell KC, representing the Covid-19 bereaved families in Northern Ireland about her attendance at the funeral.\nMs N\u00ed Chuil\u00edn told the inquiry she was \"very sorry\" and that attending the funeral had an impact on public confidence.\nShe also said she accepted she should not have attended the funeral using her ministerial car, and had later reimbursed the costs to the department.\nBut Ms Campbell added: \"Do you accept you should not have gone to the funeral at all given your role as minister for communities?\"\nMs N\u00ed Chuil\u00edn replied: \"I can see the hurt and the anger and I accept that now... yes I do.\"\nFormer Education Minister Peter Weir also gave evidence on Wednesday.\nHe said he regrets that the debate over closing schools in Northern Ireland at the onset of the Covid pandemic created political division.\nLord Weir, a former DUP MLA, was Stormont's education minister from January 2020 until mid-2021.\nHe said debate within the Northern Ireland Executive over closing schools created a \"level of division\".\nThe context for closing schools, the inquiry was told, was in mid-March 2020, days before the UK government announced a national lockdown.\nOn 12 March 2020, the Irish government announced that it would close all schools in the Republic of Ireland.\nBut the inquiry heard that the Stormont Executive met on 16 March where disagreement between ministers broke out over whether to follow suit.\nLord Weir said he took the view that ministers should be following scientific and medical advice, which at that point did not recommend shutting down all schools.\nBut he said Sinn F\u00e9in and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) ministers had \"one eye towards what was happening in the Republic of Ireland\".\n\"There was a little bit of an element... the situation was that not only would they want to follow the Republic of Ireland, but there was a natural inclination not to follow what was happening in London,\" he said.\nLord Weir also suggested those ministers held a \"level of antipathy\" against the Conservative government under Boris Johnson.\nThe inquiry was shown handwritten notes from that meeting which showed divisions behind the scenes between the parties.\nLord Weir was asked by inquiry counsel Clair Dobbin KC how well children in Northern Ireland were being served when it came to the decision over closing schools, asking whether it had become \"political and divisive\".\nHe replied: \"I regret it became that, I felt there had been a level of consensus a few days before.\n\"Others wanted to take it in a different direction.\n\"At various levels it may have been seen as being directly political.\"\nAsked about notes provided to the inquiry about \"confusion\" about public messaging on schools at that point, Lord Weir said the executive's position had initially been joined up, prior to the Irish government closing schools.\nBut he said that changed \"within 24 hours\" when the then-Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill did a press interview calling for schools in Northern Ireland to close immediately.\nLord Weir also said that once the UK Government announced that schools in England were closing, advice from health officials at Stormont also changed and that schools in Northern Ireland should shut.\nHe acknowledged that it was \"doable at that stage\", with furlough schemes and finances available from Westminster to help support parents with childcare.\nFormer Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey disputed a text message that claimed she showed \"no interest in Covid\" prior to mid-March 2020.\nDetails of the text were revealed during evidence to the Covid-19 inquiry by counsel Leah Treanor.\nShe said the then-head of the civil service Sir David Sterling sent the message to another official, Chris Stewart, on 10 March 2020.\nMs Hargey, a Sinn F\u00e9in MLA, said it was not her reflection of the time.\nThe text from Sir David read: \"I spoke to Tracey earlier, she's briefing her minister (who has shown no interest in Covid up to now) tomorrow.\"\nIt referred to Tracey Meharg, who was the top civil servant in the Department for Communities then advising Ms Hargey.\nAsked by inquiry counsel if that was a fair assessment, Ms Hargey said she was \"disappointed\" to have seen the text message and its contents.\nShe said she had spoken an executive meeting on that date and was looking at contingency plans for her department as well as how to support key sectors.\n\"We would have been planning at the start of March and late February for that to happen, so I am

    "Sharing knowledge between schools is a \"win-win situation\" when it comes to learning a second language, according to a Ballyclare teacher.\nPupils in the County Antrim town have come together to tackle the falling numbers of children who learn a second language in Northern Ireland.\nSixth form students from Ballyclare High School teach language classes to pupils in several local primary schools.\nJonny Nelson, head of Spanish at the school, said the lessons are mutually beneficial for the students.\nLearning a second language is not compulsory for primary school children in Northern Ireland.\nThe 'Language Leaders' scheme allows primary school pupils to get a taste of German, French and Spanish, which they would not otherwise learn on the primary curriculum.\nThe sixth form students lead lessons including games and interactive activities for younger pupils, while they in turn are provided with leadership and teaching experience.\n\"Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK at the moment that doesn't have a primary languages programme as part of the curriculum so we have to take the steps to try and instil that knowledge and enthusiasm from day one,\" Mr Nelson told BBC News NI.\n\"At the moment we deliver French, Spanish and German in Ballyclare High and our pupils are also delivering all three of these languages to four primary schools.\n\"As languages are not part of the curriculum, primary schools are glad of the help, and we are glad of the enthusiasm that we get back from them.\"\nRecent research suggests that pupils in Northern Ireland are required to learn languages less than those in any other country in Europe.\nThere has also been a dramatic fall in the number of pupils taking languages like French at GCSE over the past two decades.\nIrish language teachers have also previously called for action to halt the \"critical decline\" in pupils studying second languages in schools.\nA scheme to teach primary pupils additional languages was axed by the Department of Education (DE) in 2015 due to financial cuts.\nThe Year 13s and Year 14s from Ballyclare High School who are teaching the primary school pupils have studied languages at GCSE or are currently studying at A-Level.\nThose taking the classes are juggling their lesson-planning alongside studying for their upcoming exams.\nOne of the students, Neve, is learning French and German at A-Level.\n\"We get the pupils involved in fun activities; they get to learn a bit of different languages and when they get to high school, it makes it much easier for them to continue on with,\" she said.\n\"I think it's very important to get involved with languages at primary school age.\n\"When I look back at my time at primary school, I remember learning a little bit of German and French, which made it much easier as I knew the basics of the language once I got to secondary school,\" Neve added.\n\"Our world is becoming so much more online and there are so many other cultures out there meaning there's a big need for linguists.\"\nErin told BBC News NI that she loves learning languages.\n\"I study French for A-Level and I learn on my own outside of school,\" she said.\n\"I want to be a teacher when I'm older so being able to come in and share my passion, it's a very enriching experience.\"\nBBC News NI joined a class  joined a class taught by Neve and Erin at Fairview Primary School for Primary 4 pupils, including Jack and Sadie. \n\"When I'm older, I want to travel the world, so I'd like to learn languages so I can talk to people\" Jack said.\n\"I've been learning German and French.

    "Members of the Garrick Club in London's West End have voted to allow women to join the institution.\nThe all-male private members' club, which was founded in 1831, had been under pressure to admit female members.\nOn Tuesday, members voted to allow women to join after reconsidering the legal wording surrounding membership.\nThe head of the civil service Simon Case and the chief of MI6 Richard Moore recently resigned from the club after its membership list was revealed.\nThe vote was passed, with nearly 60% in favour. The Garrick has been contacted for comment.\nThe vote confirming the resolution required a 50% majority, although previous votes on the question of female membership had required a two-thirds majority.\nAnalysis of the club's rules by senior judges concluded there was nothing in the Garrick's constitution preventing women from being allowed to join, because the 1925 Law of Property Act advises that in legal documents the word \"he\" should also be read to mean \"she\".\nPublished by the Guardian newspaper, the closely guarded membership list included the King, judges, lawyers, peers, cabinet ministers and other MPs, as well as academics, actors, rock stars and senior journalists.\nDeputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden and Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove were both revealed as members, as well as former cabinet ministers including Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, Kwasi Kwarteng and Robert Buckland.\nBBC broadcasters John Simpson and Melvyn Bragg were also revealed to be members.\nSpeaking about when he was a member of the club, former culture minister Lord Vaizey told the Today programme \"it really was quite backward - women couldn't even walk up the front stairs, they couldn't dine in the main dining room. \n\"All of that has changed a long time ago, thankfully.\" \nHe added he did not \"think the Garrick is a secret cabal of men that is quietly running a country\" but \"it's just a convivial place where people go and have lunch and dinner, and that's as valid for women as it is for men\".\nThe Guardian also reported pro-women members planned to nominate a list of seven women to join the club, including actress Juliet Stevenson.\nShe told Today a club that \"for hundreds of years [has] been a club largely dedicated to the theatre community and then the arts community... must by definition be open to all\".\n\"I'm not so much interested in wining and dining, but I'm really interested in exchanges of ideas and challenging each other,\" she said.\n\"If it's a place where that can take place, I would be interested in it for sure.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Former Paralympian John McFall is working with the European Space Agency on a ground-breaking study to see if it's feasible for someone with a physical disability to live and work in space. BBC News has been following his progress as he undergoes astronaut training.\nIt's a test that any budding astronaut has to go through. But it's not for the fainthearted - or the claustrophobic.\nWith a clang, the door slams shut, enclosing John McFall in the darkness of a coffin-sized metal box.  \nThe spinning begins. \nHe's in a giant centrifuge, being whizzed around and around, to mimic the extreme gravitational forces of a rocket launch - and the even more extreme G-Forces of coming back down.\n\"The faster it spins, the higher the G load,\" John explains.\n\"And today we're going to be going up to about 6 Gs - so six times the force of gravity. It replicates what it would be like during re-entry into the atmosphere in a Soyuz capsule.\"\nThe test is part of John's training programme with the European Space Agency.  \nIn 2022 he was selected as their first astronaut candidate with a physical disability, to work on a ground-breaking study to see if he could go to space safely. \nJohn's an amputee, he lost the lower part of his right leg in a motorcycle accident when he was 19.\nHe usually wears a hi-tech prosthesis. But he's taken it off to test the effects of the centrifuge on his upper-leg.\nESA flight surgeon Maybritt Kuypers is monitoring him. \n\"It's the first time we have had an amputee in the centrifuge,\" she explains.\n\"The astronaut is basically lying on their back in a sort of seated position, so this influences the blood flow - also in the leg.  We were curious to see how that would affect him, but it went really well.\"\nJohn's paused his career as an orthopaedic surgeon to take a leap into the unknown of astronaut training.\nHe's moved from the UK to the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne, Germany.\nHe isn't guaranteed a space flight, but this study will see what needs adapting to make it possible -  the spacecraft, spacesuits or his various prosthetic legs. \nToday he's assessing his running blade. \nSport is a big part of his life, John's a former medal-winning Paralympic sprinter.  And keeping fit in space is crucial to maintain muscle mass and bone density. \nJohn's using a special anti-gravity treadmill, which recreates the weightless conditions on the International Space Station (ISS). A pocket of air lifts him slightly, artificially making him lighter. \nHe explains how his body weight pushes his blade into the ground, compressing it so it bounces back up again to give him a natural spring to propel him forward.\nBut the treadmill lightens him to about 80% of his body weight, so his blade doesn't work as well.\n\"I notice that the blade is too stiff,\" he explains. \"That's because I'm lighter and putting less force into the blade, so it's bending less, and therefore giving me less spring back.\"\nHe thinks he'd need a bendier blade - but there's more. \nOn a parabolic flight last year, where John experienced weightlessness for the first time, he found his day-to-day, hi-tech, microprocessor prosthetic leg would need recalibrating.\nIn fact, John thinks he might need several prosthetic legs on the ISS.  \n\"There would be a prosthesis for running, a back up for the microprocessor prosthesis, and then there's the mechanical one, which will probably need to be worn inside the spacesuit for launch and return,\" he explains. \n\"I'll need a bit of a wardrobe of prosthetic hardware.\"\nESA is the first space agency to carry out a project like this.\nUntil now, John's disability would have prevented him from becoming an astronaut. But Frank De Winne, the head of the European Astronaut Centre, wants to change that.\n\"We think this is a great opportunity because we have so many great talents - people that have a disability, like we see with John,\" he says. \n\"Why should we not try to harvest this talent for great missions like astronaut missions?\"\nThe move to Germany is a big change for his wife Sonia, a former Olympic gymnast, and their three young children Fin, Isla and Immy. \nAround the dinner table, they talk about their dad's new job. Their friends think it's \"cool\". Fin can't believe his dad has swapped being a doctor for a job where he might be sent \"into the big black void\" of space.\nSonia says John's new career is 100% right for him. \n\"It's a big thing in our family that you go for every opportunity,\" she says. \"And for me, this was an opportunity and he's gone and taken it.  I hope he gets the reward for it, which is eventually going to space and showing people that it's possible.\"\nThe World's First Para-astronaut\nFrom a taste of space on a parabolic flight to taking a spin in a giant centrifuge, follow ESA astronaut John McFall as he studies whether it's possible for someone with a disability to go into space.\nAvailable now on BBC iPlayer (UK only)\nBack at the centrifuge, it slows to a stop and the door clangs open.

    "An agency providing last-minute freelance nurses to NHS hospitals is routinely charging up to \u00a32,000 a shift,\u202fBBC News has discovered.\nGlen Burley, chief executive of an NHS trust, said that Thornbury Nursing Services is targeting areas in England where nurses are in short supply.\nHe says it is \"profiteering\" from an overstretched NHS, but Thornbury says it offers a valuable, flexible service.\nThe government says new measures will end the use of expensive agencies. \nHowever, Labour has said the high costs are a result of the \"Conservatives' failure to train enough nurses over the past 14 years\".\nUnder NHS rules, hospital managers are obliged to use staffing agencies that work within an agreed framework, with a limit or cap on how much should be paid. \nBut when last-minute essential cover is needed, trusts may use off-framework agencies, such as Thornbury. These are not legally obliged to abide by pre-agreed pay scales. \nWorkload pressures in the NHS and a desire for more flexibility over shifts are thought to be driving more nurses to work for such agencies, which tend to pay the people on their books more while also taking a payment for themselves. \nBBC News has discovered Thornbury charges almost \u00a32,000 for a 12-hour bank holiday shift by a specialist paediatric nurse - an area of expertise where there are known staff shortages. Of that, BBC News calculates the nurse receives about \u00a31,050 - meaning nearly \u00a3800 goes to the agency.\u202f \nFor a midweek afternoon and evening shift, the agency charges trusts \u00a391.45 per hour, 85% above what the nurse is paid, at \u00a349.50 per hour. Our calculations indicate that for a single Friday shift the trust is charged almost \u00a31,000, of which \u00a3539 goes to the nurse, and \u00a3400 goes to the agency. \nThornbury also pays nurses their travel expenses, and charges the hospital separately for those costs too.  \nMr Burley is chief executive of the Foundation Group, one of the largest NHS organisations in England. It comprises South Warwickshire Trust, George Eliot Hospital Trust, Worcestershire Acute Hospitals Trust and Wye Valley Trust.\u202f \nSpeaking to the BBC, he says each of the four hospitals in the group is currently spending more than \u00a3500,000 a year on staffing provided by Thornbury.\nHe says although the group has reduced the amount it has spent, sometimes short-notice issues force its hand, especially in specialist areas like paediatrics and emergency care.\n\"Where you've got a critical service to continue, you have no option other than sometimes to go to these very high-cost agencies,\" he says. \nMr Burley says Thornbury is active in areas with nurse shortages and is offering such attractive rates that some staff are being tempted away from the NHS. \n\"I am sure they would say they are an agency of last resort and they are providing a service, but if that's created a bigger problem by pulling nurses away from the NHS, then that's certainly profiteering,\" he says.\nThornbury is owned by one of the largest companies in the agency sector, Independent Clinical Services (ICS), which in turn is controlled by Acacium, a company based in Jersey.\u202f \u202f \nCompany accounts show ICS turnover increased by 46% in 2021-2022, to nearly \u00a3400m. The company says less than 50% of that is related to Thornbury.  \nIn a statement, Thornbury says: \"We offer a valuable and flexible service that helps hospitals guarantee safe staffing levels.\u202f \n\"Requests are typically at very short notice - often as little as four hours before a shift is due to start. The level of rates necessarily reflects the last-minute and urgent nature of requests.\" \nThornbury, which covers England and Wales, has a sister company, Scottish Nursing Guild, which operates in Scotland and Northern Ireland. \nHealth experts say the continued growth in spending on freelance health workers reflects wider factors. Staff shortages in some areas have\u202f added to pressure on rotas and there is now a challenge for employers to try to persuade more staff to stay in the NHS rather than leaving.\u202f\nAgency spending for health workers in England increased from \u00a33bn in 2021-22 to \u00a33.5bn the following year, according to the Nuffield Trust think tank. \nThea Stein, chief executive of Nuffield, says what agencies are able to charge is \"probably not fair, but it is legal\". \n\"The amount some agencies are charging does seem extraordinary. I don't blame any NHS trust - you have a safety critical service you need to fill a shift for - what else are they going to do?\" \nDanny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, said there had been \"mounting concern\" that a small number of staffing agencies were exploiting the pressures facing the NHS. \n\"The BBC raises serious questions about how much public money flows to these 'last resort' agencies and their owners. The NHS is making real strides in retaining NHS staff, and reducing reliance on agency staff,\" he said.\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt said in his recent Budget speech that he wanted to end costly off-framework agency staffing.\nSh",
    "A woman who shouted and waved at a cyclist, causing her to fall into the path of a car, has had her manslaughter conviction overturned by appeal judges.\nAuriol Grey, 50, of Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, used an expletive as she told Celia Ward, 77, to \"get off the pavement\" in the town in 2020.\nMrs Ward, from nearby Wyton, died from her injuries.\nMs Grey, who has cerebral palsy and partial blindness, was jailed for three years at a retrial last year.\nAt the Court of Appeal on Wednesday, three judges overturned her conviction, leading her family to call for \"lessons to be learnt\", saying that vulnerable people needed better support from the justice system.\nDame Victoria Sharp, sitting with Mrs Justice Yip and Mrs Justice Farbey, said: \"In our judgment, the prosecution case was insufficient even to be left to the jury.\n\"In all the circumstances, we have no hesitation in concluding that the appellant's conviction for manslaughter is unsafe.\"\nFollowing the ruling, Ms Grey's family - who watched the appeal via video link - said in a statement: \"Whilst we welcome the decision of the Court of Appeal, our thoughts today are also with the Ward family, and I am a sure a day doesn't go by when they don't remember their tragic loss.\n\"We are very relieved that Auriol's prison ordeal is over and we would like to thank the staff and inmates of HMP Peterborough for the kindness and consideration they have shown over the last year.\" \n\"There has been unnecessary and prolonged suffering and vulnerable people like Auriol need better support from the justice system - we hope lessons will be learnt.\"\nThe court heard Ms Grey, who attended the hearing having been released from prison in March pending the appeal, was charged with unlawful act manslaughter - which requires an unlawful action that caused death to have to taken place.\nHowever, her lawyers told appeal judges no such \"base offence\" was ever identified at the trial.\nDame Victoria and her fellow appeal judges agreed, ruling that the jury were not asked to decide \"the fundamental question of whether a base offence was established\".\nThe senior judge continued: \"Had Mrs Ward not died we regard it as inconceivable that the appellant would have been charged with assault.\"\nDuring her original trial, Ms Grey's actions had been described as \"hostile gesticulation\" towards Mrs Ward.\nHowever, Adrian Darbishire KC, for Ms Grey, said in the appeal: \"Hostile gesticulation is not a crime, otherwise we would have 50,000 football fans each weekend being apprehended.\"\nThe Crown Prosecution Service had responded to the appeal, with its barrister Simon Spence KC telling the court it was accepted that \"common assault as the base offence was not identified by name\". \nAfter the judges gave their ruling, Mr Spence asked for Ms Grey's case to be sent back to Crown Court for a retrial, which was denied.\nIn a statement, Cambridgeshire Police said: \"We note the court's decision\".\nThe force said Mrs Ward's family did not wish to say anything on the ruling.\n Got a story?

    "When former prime minister Imran Khan was dragged out of a court house by police on charges of corruption on 9 May 2023, the reaction was unlike anything seen in Pakistan before. \nEnraged supporters took to the streets in cities across the country and buildings belonging to Pakistan's powerful military became the target - a shock to the institution widely known locally as the establishment.\n\"When he was arrested, our hearts sank. We were crying and didn't know what to do,\" said Hasan, who cycled to a central market in Lahore where Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party had often gathered.\nThe residence of a lieutenant general in the city had already been set ablaze by then.\nOn the streets of the capital Islamabad, where Khan was arrested, protesters pulled down street signs, lit fires and threw stones. Scores of military monuments were vandalised.\nThe military, which has long held sway over governance in the Muslim majority country, swiftly labelled 9 May 2023 a \"Black Day\". They have also described the protests as an \"attack on the army\". \nOne year on, many supporters of the former cricket star are still reeling from the physical and emotional wounds of the day's events. \nHasan was among hundreds arrested for their involvement in the protests. Many of them told BBC Urdu they took to the streets \"peacefully\" and were not involved in the violence, but were nevertheless held without due process and mistreated while in detention.\n\n\nHasan said he joined the protests \"because I felt that what happened to Imran Khan was wrong... We were telling the police, 'Today, you have crossed the red line', he said. \n\"Many Pakistanis have an emotional connection with Khan Sahib,\" he said, using a local term or respect. \"He is like a brother, like a father, to us.\" \nAbrar, another supporter who took to the streets after Khan's arrest, recalled that he left his house in Lahore \"immediately\" after seeing footage of Khan's arrest last May, as he felt his \"leader should not have been humiliated in this way\". \nKhan is a cricketing icon in a country where the sport enjoys almost fanatical support. He brought glory to the country as captain when he led the national team to World Cup victory in 1992. Many Pakistanis have grown up idolising him. \nBut critics argue that Mr Khan had the backing of the army during his rise to power, an allegation both sides reject. The military has heavily influenced Pakistan for most of its existence and is a crucial behind-the-scenes player in the country's politics.\nHe was elected PM in July 2018 but ousted in a parliamentary vote of no-confidence four years later. Shortly before general elections this February he was given several criminal convictions, barring him from standing. He is battling scores of legal cases, including charges for corruption and terrorism, but continues to be a powerful force dividing Pakistan.\nDuring the February elections, his party, which had been denied its election symbol and a united platform, was forced to run candidates as independents, who then emerged as the single largest bloc in a shock result. However, they fell short of the majority needed to form a government.\nAt least 10 people were killed and hundreds wounded during the 9 May protests, which authorities also said resulted in losses of 2.5 billion rupees ($9m; \u00a37.2m).\nThe crackdown after was effective and harsh. Protesters who were jailed have spoken of abuse and despair. \n\"Sometimes the prison felt more like a graveyard. Like how we recite prayers at the graves of our loved ones, perhaps our families were reciting the same prayers when they came to meet us,\" said Abrar, who was released early this year after spending nine months in jail.\n\"My daughter would be crying and I could not wipe her tears,\u201d he added.\nIntizar, a fellow protester who was detained, told BBC Urdu prison officials \"treated us as if we were terrorists, not Pakistanis\".\n\"I told them I only protested and did not vandalise,\" he said.\nHe turned himself into police after they went after his family and broke the gate of his house in an attempt to locate him. \n\"I don't think we can ever describe what we and our families endured.\"\n\nFormer interior minister Rana Sanaullah said the events of 9 May 2023 were but a continuation of the PTI's protests in the past.\n\u201cThe atmosphere had been created because the PTI founder was determined to prove itself more powerful than the state,\u201d he said, referring to Imran Khan.\n\"How can anyone say that 'If I am arrested, it will be crossing a red line'? This is like a rebellion.\"\nWhile a year has passed, political watchers say Pakistan will not be able to move on until the grievances of the protesters are addressed.\n\"I feel the state has only been venting its anger on this matter, as if trying to take revenge, instead of investigating it,\" said journalist Benazir Shah, who reported on the protests.\nMs Shah urged authorities to launch an investigation and make clear the roles of everyone involved.\n\"We will not be a",
    "The founding chief executive of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre has urged people not to panic after a Scottish health board was targeted by cyber criminals.\nCiaran Martin said it was very rare that data breaches involving medical information result in \"actual harm\" to members of the public.\nA ransomware group has dumped an estimated three terabytes of data stolen from NHS Dumfries and Galloway on the dark web.\nIt is believed to include clinical information on thousands of patients, including children, and financial data on staff.\nMr Martin, once called Britain\u2019s \u201ctop cyber spy,\u201d led the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) when it was established as part of GCHQ intelligence gathering agency in 2016.\nThe NCSC is one of several organisations now responding to the attack on NHS Dumfries and Galloway by a group called INC Ransom.\nThe board has said the stolen data contains correspondence between clinicians which includes the contact details and medical history of some patients.\nSome of the data came from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (Camhs) and efforts are under way to identify any individuals who have been affected.\nPeople in Dumfries and Galloway have been advised to remain vigilant and to contact the police if they are approached by someone claiming to have their personal data or NHS data.\nExtra insurance has been offered to the board\u2019s 5,000 staff to protect them from identity theft or fraud.\nMr Martin, who left the role in 2020 and is now a professor at the University of Oxford, said: \"It's a very difficult situation but experience from the rest of the world suggests that even when this data is dumped on the dark web, relatively little direct harm occurs.\n\"A good example is Australia, where over a third of the population's full medical records were leaked onto the dark web.\"\nMr Martin said a concerted government-led effort minimised the impact of the Australian leak.\n\"Police and other authorities were clear that there'd be consequences if there was any sort of extortion,\" said Mr Martin.\n\"Although it's very unpleasant, the data just sort of sat there and there's no evidence of any direct harm, even though nearly 10 million people's full medical records were affected.\n\"People shouldn't panic. There isn't going to be a Google searchable database of people's medical records or people's bank details. That's not the way this works.\n\"It is relatively rare, not unknown, but relatively rare for individuals to suffer direct sort of harm, embarrassment or extortion.\"\nSo far, there has not been any messaging from Police Scotland warning people not to access or share the stolen data.\nINC Ransom has been linked to a series of cyber attacks in the United States and Europe since last year.\nMr Martin said international agencies will be trying to disrupt their activities and pointed to recent success against LockBit, which was believed to have been the most prolific ransomware group in the world.\nA campaign led by the UK's National Crime Agency infiltrated and took over the group's network.\nSanctions against the group's alleged leader Russian national Dmitry Khoroshev have been announced and a $10m reward for information leading to his arrest and/or conviction has been offered by the United States.\nMr Martin said: \"It's relatively rare for ransomware criminals to suffer consequences, simply because of the awkward fact that they tend to be based in Russia.\n\"It's the world's largest open camp and safe haven for cyber criminals and the Russian police don't go after them most of the time.\n\"Russia does not extradite its own citizens, so the chances of somebody behind this horrible attack being behind bars, either in Russia or, more appropriately in Scotland are, I'm afraid, pretty low.\n\"We have just seen a superb operation by the UK National Crime Agency which destroyed the infrastructure of the LockBit ransomware group and exposed their ringleader.\n\"But it's very difficult when there's large scale crime happening remotely from an unfriendly jurisdiction.\"",
    "Fighting and bombardment continued on the outskirts of the southern Gaza city of Rafah as Israel said the key Kerem Shalom crossing had reopened for aid. \nThe Israeli military said troops had killed Hamas fighters in eastern Rafah as part of a \"precise\" counterterrorism operation. Hamas also reported battles.\nEarlier, the military said lorries had reached Kerem Shalom, which was closed after a Hamas rocket attack on Sunday.\nBut the UN says no supplies have passed through the crossing yet.\nThe US said that while the crossing was open again, aid could not get through \"because of logistical and security concerns\" on the ground. \nThe UN had expressed alarm on Tuesday over what it called Israel's \"choking-off\" of Gaza's two main aid arteries, after Israeli troops took full control of the Palestinian side of the nearby Rafah crossing with Egypt.\nThe closing of the Rafah crossing is of particular concern because of the consequences for fuel deliveries - the UN says all of its fuel enters there.\n\"Without fuel, trucks cannot move critical humanitarian assistance, water pumps will stop functioning and the remaining hospitals will shut down,\" Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, wrote on social media on Wednesday.\nWorld Health Organization head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that hospitals in the south of Gaza had only three days of fuel left.\nPlumes of smoke from Israeli air strikes were seen over Rafah and heavy gunfire was heard on Wednesday, as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops were continuing a limited offensive in eastern areas.\nResidents of Rafah reported intense bombardment overnight and video footage on Wednesday morning showed people searching through the rubble of a building destroyed in one of the strikes.\n\"We are in a safe area according to the army's map - an area without operations,\" neighbour Reda al-Najili told Reuters news agency.\n\"We were sitting when suddenly the explosion happened. Our neighbour's house was gone, and our house was all damaged internally. In the house there are only civilians. Women died. Those who were injured were all children.\"\nPalestinian medics also said seven members of one family, including five children, were killed in an overnight strike on a home in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City, in the north of the territory.\nAn IDF statement issued on Wednesday morning said they had \"eliminated terrorists and uncovered terrorist infrastructure, as well as underground shafts in several locations\" during several encounters over the previous day. They were also carrying out raids on the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing, it added.\nThe IDF also said aircraft had struck more than 100 \"terror targets\" throughout Gaza over the same period.\nSeven months into its war with Hamas in Gaza, Israel has insisted victory is impossible without taking Rafah. \nBut with more than a million displaced Palestinians taking refuge there from the fighting elsewhere, the UN and Western powers have warned that an all-out assault could have devastating humanitarian consequences.\nNegotiations on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal have resumed in Cairo, with the US saying it believes a revised Hamas proposal could lead to a breakthrough.\nThe Israeli military played down the significance of the US government's decision to halt a shipment of powerful bombs over concerns that Israel was about to launch a major offensive on Rafah city.\nHowever, US President Joe Biden later warned that  the US would stop supplying some weapons if Israel launched a major ground operation in Rafah.\nThe Israeli military has ordered the evacuation of an estimated 100,000 residents and displaced people in a number of eastern neighbourhoods and told them they will find field hospitals, tents and aid in an \"expanded humanitarian area\", which stretches north from al-Mawasi to the city of Khan Younis and central town of Deir al-Balah.\nMeanwhile, the director general of the World Health Organization said one of the three hospitals in Rafah, al-Najjar, was \"no longer functioning due to the ongoing hostilities in its vicinity and the military operation in Rafah\".\nDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also warned that the partially functioning Kuwaiti and Emirati hospitals would soon run out of fuel unless the UN received a delivery. \"Hospitals in the south of Gaza only have three days of fuel left, which means services may soon come to a halt,\" he added. \nThe WHO has also said the European Gaza hospital in Khan Younis, where critical patients from Rafah are referred, may also become unreachable. \nA displaced man sheltering at the hospital told BBC Arabic's Gaza Today programme that life was very difficult for him.\n\"I suffer from diabetes, high blood pressure, and osteoarthritis - a matter which means the displacement causes a great deal of suffering for me,\" he said. \"We hope to return to our land in Gaza and that everyone will set up a tent in the place of his home and settle back there.\"\n",
    "A man who was injured when an attacker burst into his Hainault home has told the BBC it is a \"miracle\" he and his family were not killed.\nHenry De Los Rios Polania, his wife and four-year-old daughter were sleeping when a man brandishing a sword broke into their home on 30 April.\nThe 35-year-old suffered serious hand injuries as he fought off the intruder.\nFour other people were attacked in the area, including Daniel Anjorin, 14, who died of his injuries. \nMr Los Rios Polania said he and his wife had fallen asleep watching TV on an \"ordinary\" night and opened their eyes the following morning to find a man with a sword standing in front of them.\nHe said: \"I thought I was going to die... even my wife and child. We thought we were going to die that morning.\"\nIn his first interview since the attack, he said: \"I believe a miracle happened in that room.\"\nHe recounted the moment he looked around for something to protect himself from the sword with, only to find \"pillows and teddy bears\".\nMr Los Rios Polania made it clear he could not go into further detail about what happened in the bedroom, because he did not want to jeopardise the police investigation.\nHis wife and child were not injured, but he fears his daughter will suffer from the trauma she experienced and could suffer flashbacks in the future. \"I just hope she doesn't remember anything,\" he said.\nMr Los Rios Polania was released from hospital on Wednesday but will need to return for further surgeries due to the severity of his injuries.\nHe underwent almost 10 hours of surgery to reconstruct tendon and veins, as surgeons battled to save his hand.\nOn the day he spoke to the BBC, doctors had given him the news a finger they feared might be lost would recover.\nMr Los Rios Polania's sister said last week that she believed he was a hero for protecting his family. He became tearful as he accepted there was truth in this.\n\"I protected my family... I will do everything for my family,\" he said. \nThe 35-year-old thanked paramedics, police and doctors who \"came forward\" to help, and said they had all done a \"great job\". He added that he wanted to \"thank God for keeping me alive\".\nAmong others injured on the same morning was Daniel Anjorin, 14. He was attacked a short distance from his home and later died of his injuries.\nMr Los Rios Polania told the BBC: \"I feel so sorry for his family... When I got close to the ambulance, I saw him on the floor... It shouldn't have happened.\"\nThree other people - including two police officers - were also seriously injured.\nA man has been charged with murder and is due to go on trial in February.\nIt has been little more than a week since the Hainault attack and Mr Los Rios Polania told the BBC he was still coming to terms with the \"nightmare\".\nHe has not yet returned to his home, and fears he and his family will never be able to face going back and will need to look for somewhere else to live.\n\"The local community, they've been supportive but we just need to find a way out, try to start over again,\" he said.\n\"We need to continue with our lives. All I know is that the next house I'm going to get into, I'll just make it really safe. I don't want anyone to come from the outside. \"\nOn Saturday, Daniel's parents issued a statement paying tribute to their \"loved and amazing son\".\nThey said: \"We as a family are devastated by the loss of our beloved son Daniel. It is difficult for us at this time to process what has happened to him and that he will never come home. Daniel had left the house for school and then he was gone.\n\"Our children have lost their loving and precious brother and we have lost the most loved and amazing son.\"",
    "Balaram Bhallavi and his family might finally get a proper roof over their heads. \nFor years, a tiled shanty in a sun-drenched village in India's central Madhya Pradesh state has been home to Mr Bhallavi, his wife, and their four school-going children. A strip of a mud-floored foyer packs in a kitchen, a few plastic chairs, two rope beds and fraying clotheslines. \nAfter a three-year wait, the Bhallavi family received 120,000 rupees ($1,445; \u00a31,136) from a programme run by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government last year, allowing them to start building a new home. \nMore than 25 million homes have been built since 2016 under the rural public housing programme, called the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Prime Minister's Housing Scheme). It is one of the more than 300 federal schemes that Mr Modi is leaning on to bolster support for his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) during the general election as he eyes a record-equalling third term in office.   \n\"Life is tough. But I am grateful to get money from the government to build my first house,\" Mr Bhallavi, 42, said.\nAfter coming to power in 2014, Mr Modi has expanded India's welfare programmes, targeting women and farmers in particular. This includes providing cooking gas, free grain, houses, toilets, piped water, electricity and bank accounts, and beefing up a long-running jobs guarantee programme. \nMany benefits - pensions, subsidies, loans and scholarships - are delivered through cash transfers to bank accounts linked to biometric identity cards held by over a billion Indians. Giant posters of Mr Modi promoting these schemes as his personal \"guarantees\" dominate the landscape.\nMr Modi says his government has spent more than 34 trillion rupees ($400bn; \u00a3316bn) in the past decade, delivering direct cash benefits to low-income households and reaching over 900 million people. A yearly handout of 6,000 rupees to more than 110 million farmers constitutes one of the world's largest cash transfer programmes. The transfers, officials claim, have cut corruption and slashed costs.   \nEconomist Arvind Subramanian calls this Mr Modi's \"New Welfarism\", funding essential private items like toilets, rather than expanding public goods such as primary education and healthcare.\nTo be sure, \"New Welfarism\" stands apart from the traditional welfare models in Europe or the US. \nWhile the US tends to favour smaller government and lower taxes, resulting in modest social transfers, European welfare states have been more generous. Social democracies such as those in Scandinavia have favoured higher social spending, supported by higher taxes. \nFollowing Mr Modi's cue, all parties in India have caught what Devesh Kapur of Johns Hopkins University calls the \"virus of cash transfers with numerous schemes across states and political parties\". \nThe country's state governments now operate more than 2,000 cash transfer programmes. \"Every party in India knows that welfare matters for votes,\" says Mr Kapur.\nOn a recent balmy morning in Bishnupur in West Bengal state, more than a hundred men, women and children gathered under a blue-and-white tent in a school courtyard. The event had a festive air about it.\nExcept this was a welfare delivery camp organised by the ruling Trinamool Congress party, led by Mamata Banerjee, a charismatic regional leader who has so far repelled Mr Modi's BJP in the eastern state, home to over 100 million people.\nServing her third term, Ms Banerjee has prioritised welfare initiatives, running some three dozen schemes. These include free bicycles to get to school, scholarships for girls, financial aid, pensions for women, the elderly and the disabled, alongside universal health insurance. \n\"We are giving welfare benefits here from birth to death,\" Naziruddin Sarkar, a senior district official, said. \nTo ease the burden of travelling to distant government offices and dealing with unhelpful officials, Ms Banerjee's government operates a benefits outreach programme called 'Duare Sarkar', meaning 'government at your doorstep'. In the last three years alone, over 100 million people have registered for welfare benefits across different schemes at more than 650,000 such camps in 23 districts, according to official data.\nThe camp in Bishnupur offers a snapshot of the livelihoods of beneficiaries. \nShobha Mondal says she is using her widow's pension to send her son to school. Monika Tithi uses three separate pensions - as a farmer, tribesperson and woman - to run a village grocery. Dipali Mondal, another widow, uses her pension to make and sell street-side snacks.\n\"When old or widowed women get money, they are respected more in their household. Pensions give them dignity,\" Choten Dhendup Lama, a senior official, said.  \nHundreds of miles away in the coastal city of Visakhapatnam in southern India's Andhra Pradesh state, Y Laxmi pins her hopes on welfare to secure a brighter future for her children.\nShe lives with her deaf and speech-impaired husband, their two school-going sons, and ",
    "A Georgia appeals court has agreed to review a lower court ruling that kept District Attorney Fani Willis on Donald Trump's election subversion case. \nThe former president has tried to have Ms Willis removed from the case, arguing her romantic relationship with another prosecutor created a conflict. \nSuperior Court Judge Scot McAfee last month found no conflict of interest but allowed for his ruling to be appealed.\nThis latest development is expected to delay the start of trial.\nNo date had yet been set for it to begin, but the appeal makes it increasingly likely that the trial will take place after November's presidential elections.  Mr Trump is the presumptive Republican standard-bearer. \nMr Trump and 18 others are being prosecuted in Georgia for conspiracy to overturn the state's 2020 election results, which they deny.\nThe case was nearly upended after one of the co-defendants, Michael Roman, claimed that Ms Willis - the Fulton County District Attorney overseeing the case - was improperly benefitting from a romantic relationship with lead prosecutor Nathan Wade.\nSeveral of Mr Roman's co-defendants, including Mr Trump, joined the motion to have Ms Willis disqualified and the charges dismissed.\nOver several tense days in court in February, Ms Willis admitted she had had relationship with Mr Wade but denied that she had benefitted financially.\nJudge McAfee ultimately found in March that Ms Willis had a \"serious lapse in judgment\" and that the relationship damaged the case with the \"appearance of impropriety\". But he ruled the case could continue with Ms Willis as long as Mr Wade resigned. He stepped down soon after. \nProsecutors had asked the Georgia court of appeals not to hear arguments on Mr McAfee's ruling, but their request was unsuccessful. \nMr Trump now has 10 days to file a notice of appeal. Once the appeal court makes its decision, either side could appeal again and bring the case to the Georgia Supreme Court. \nIn a statement to US media, Mr Trump's lead attorney in Georgia said the former president \"looks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution\".\nThe Fulton County district attorney's office did not respond to a request for comment. \nThe Georgia election interference case is one of four criminal cases Mr Trump faces. \nThree are unlikely to take place before the November elections.  The fourth - a criminal hush-money trial  - is currently underway in New York. \nOn Tuesday, a judge in Florida indefinitely postponed Mr Trump's classified documents case there, cancelling the planned 20 May start date.

    "Patients, visitors and staff are being warned of possible disruption at Northern Ireland hospitals next week because of a botched car parking policy.\nIn 2022 the Assembly passed a law abolishing car parking charges at public hospitals in Northern Ireland.\nIn March, the Health Minister said that would need to be deferred for two years\u00a0as hospitals were not ready.\nHowever, the deferral legislation has not yet been passed so charges will be removed from 12 May.\nThe intention is to reintroduce the charges as soon as the legislation is finalised, which will probably be at the end of the month.\nIn the meantime people will be able to park for free without the hospitals having any new way to manage that, such as number plate recognition technology.\nIn a statement the Department of Health said: \"There are concerns that an increase in demand for parking during this limited free of charge period could lead to congestion at some hospital sites, potentially contributing to delayed or missed hospital appointments.\n\"In order to minimise disruption and protect car parking capacity for those most in need, we are asking for cooperation and understanding from all car parking users,\" it said.\nThe department is asking patients and visitors to allow extra time to get to appointments.\nStaff are also being asked to maintain their normal parking arrangements in order to maintain capacity.\nThe deferral legislation is using Stormont's accelerated passage procedures and the fourth and final reading was in the Assembly on 7 May.\nThe department says it \"remains hopeful\" that the Royal Assent process will conclude by the end of May.\nWhen he asked for the delay health minister Robin Swann said health trusts did not yet have the infrastructure required to manage free parking.\nHe added that this was due to legal challenges delaying a contract for automatic number plate recognition technology.\nThe ban on parking charges was brought forward as private members' bill by Sinn F\u00e9in assembly member Aisling Reilly in 2022.\nIt proposed that car parking charges should be abolished for patients, staff and visitors and received cross-party support.\nThe bill was also supported by some trade unions, but the health trusts made clear that its implementation would be challenging.\nThe Department of Health also pointed to concerns that increased demand as a result of free parking provision would add further to the pressure for spaces.",
    "A \"nationwide issue\" which caused huge delays at passport e-gates has been resolved, the Home Office has said. \nMajor UK airports including Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester and Edinburgh all confirmed a Border Force problem was causing delays with arrivals late on Tuesday.\nPictures and videos on social media showed long queues.\nOne passenger told the BBC he spent longer queuing for passport control than he did on his flight from Lisbon.\nE-gates are automated gates that use facial recognition to check a person's identity and allow them to enter the country without talking to a Border Force officer. \nThere are more than 270 of them in place at 15 air and rail ports in the UK, according to the government's website, which also says they are supposed to \"enable quicker travel into the UK\".\nDue to the outage, staff were left manually processing passengers instead.\nAffected airports included London Stansted, Birmingham, Bristol, and Newcastle.\nThe Home Office, which oversees Border Force, said in a statement early on Wednesday: \"eGates at UK airports came back online shortly after midnight.\"\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said the problems were caused by a \"system network issue\" and were first reported around 19:50BST, meaning the issues persisted for more than four hours. \nThey added that \"at no point was border security compromised, and there is no indication of malicious cyber activity\".\nThey extended apologies to \"travellers caught up in disruption\" and thanked \"partners, including airlines for their co-operation and support\" during the outage.\nHowever, the problem did not appear to not just be affecting the e-gates themselves, as Belfast International Airport, which does not have them, said the Border Force \"systems\" had been impacted.\nBy Wednesday morning, most flights at airports across the UK were shown to be departing and arriving on time.\nSteven Brownrigg, who arrived on a flight into Manchester Airport, told the BBC there were \"several flights in quick succession, which meant a lot of passengers\" queueing for passport control.\n\"I was in the queue for around 90 minutes. Priority was given to families with small children and vulnerable passengers, and staff were handing out bottled water to everyone,\" he said.\n\"Generally, most were frustrated but accepted the situation, but a few people were unhappy and questioned staff.\"\nA passenger at Heathrow described border officials rushing to manually process passport holders.\n\"All the e-gates were totally blank and there was just a lot of chaotic scenes,\" said Sam Morter, 32, who was returning after a holiday in Sri Lanka.\nHe said he made it through the airport after about 90 minutes.\nSamira, who had arrived from Spain, said people were distressed and \"everyone was arguing\", while Julian, who had flown in from Lisbon, said: \"I've spent longer in the terminal than I did in the air.\"\nDennis Marsh was among the first people affected, and said he saw the e-gates go from green to red.\n\"It wasn't just e-gates mind you. All manual checking procedures failed too,\" he said. \n\"We were given water and were so lucky being right at the front. \n\"We waited about 40 minutes, so not too bad but thousands were arriving behind us.\"\nManchester Airport said any excess charges for people who are late to leave car parks as a result of the problems would also be waived.\nTuesday is not the first time the UK's automated e-gates have stopped working. Airports were also impacted by an IT issue in May 2023.\nSeparately, in August last year, around 2,000 flights at airports across the UK were cancelled when the National Air Traffic Services system for automatically processing flight plans failed, leaving passengers stranded.\nAdditional reporting by Nicky Schiller\nAre you affected by the issues raised in this story?

    "Social media users have been warned not to engage with videos of monkeys being used as pets or props.\nMatt Lovatt, park director at Trentham Monkey Forest near Stoke-on-Trent, said such footage of primates was \u201cnot something we should celebrate\u201d.\nHis warning came as Holly LeGresley, from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, was convicted for being part of an online group paying people to kill and torture baby monkeys on video.\nThe 37-year-old pleaded guilty to charges of consuming, causing and facilitating the torture of baby monkeys over the internet at Worcester Magistrates\u2019 Court on Tuesday.\nWarning - this story contains distressing content\nSpeaking to BBC Midlands Today, Mr Lovatt said the wider issue regarding footage of monkeys came with the emergence of social media.\nHe said it had led to videos being posted of people using primates as pets, sometimes dressing them up in clothes \u2013 a practice which he said needed to stop.\n\u201cOurselves and most of the people within our industry in the UK are advocates for not showing primates being used as pets,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t share those videos more widely. It\u2019s not something we should celebrate. We should celebrate being able to watch or observe them and still find joy in the fact they are so similar to ourselves.\u201d\nLeGresley was part of a group on the messaging app Telegram that brainstormed, crowdfunded and commissioned videos of monkeys being tortured by people in Indonesia.\nThe group was used to share ideas for custom-made torture videos such as setting live monkeys on fire, injuring them with tools and even putting one in a blender.\nThe ideas were then sent, along with payments, to video-makers in Indonesia who carried them out, sometimes killing the baby long-tailed macaque monkeys in the process.\nLeGresley\u2019s conviction came after a one-year investigation by the BBC Eye team. She is due to be sentenced on 7 June.\nTrentham Monkey Forest has about 140 barbary macaque monkeys roaming its 60-acre wooded site \u2013 the largest collection in the UK.\nThe endangered species had seen its worldwide population decrease by more than 50% in the last 40 years.\nMr Lovatt said this was due to factors like deforestation and the loss of habitat.\n\u201cWe\u2019re allowing primates to live as similar lives to wild [primates] as is probably possible,\u201d he added.\n\u201cThey get all the perks of living like a wild primate but without having to face predators, lack of food resources, things like that.\u201d\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X, and Instagram, Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk",
    "US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr says he is in \"robust health\" following reports that he suffered from a brain parasite more than a decade ago.\nThe New York Times reported that Mr Kennedy also previously suffered from mercury poisoning and heart problems.\nMr Kennedy has made health a key part of his campaign. \nHe has contrasted his physical fitness with that of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. \n\"Questioning Mr Kennedy's health is a hilarious suggestion, given his competition,\" his campaign said in a statement Wednesday.\n\"Mr Kennedy travelled extensively in Africa, South America, and Asia in his work as an environmental advocate, and in one of those locations contracted a parasite,\" the campaign said. \n\"The issue was resolved more than 10 years ago, and he is in robust physical and mental health.\" \nThe New York Times report, based on a divorce deposition, said that in 2010 Mr Kennedy experienced severe memory loss and brain fog. \nHe sought treatment and said in the deposition two years later that a doctor told him the issues could be \"caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died\".\nWorms do not eat brain tissue, experts say, but the idea is a non-medical or layman's understanding of what parasites might do if they enter the central nervous system.\nDr Philip Budge, an associate professor of infectious diseases at the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, said that parasite larvae can migrate to the brain and create cysts, in a condition known as neurocysticercosis.\n\"The cysts don't absorb any brain tissue, they simply create a space for the parasite to live,\" potentially pushing aside small parts of the brain, Dr Budge said.\n\"The cysts can occur in many places in the body. They usually don't cause any trouble unless they are in the brain,\" he said. \nAnd the effects of brain parasites depend on where they end up: \"It's like real estate: it's all about location location location.\"\n\"I'm unaware of any examples where a parasite affected cognition,\" said Dr Arnab Chatterjee, vice president of medicinal chemistry at the Center for Antiviral Medicines and Pandemic Preparedness in La Jolla, California. \nNeither Dr Budge nor Dr Chatterjee have treated Mr Kennedy or have any specific knowledge of his health history.\nHowever, Dr Chatterjee noted that another condition that RFK Jr reported suffering - mercury poisoning - does have a strong link to neurological problems. \nIn the deposition, Mr Kennedy also said he had elevated levels of mercury in his blood due to a diet heavy in tuna fish. He reduced his fish intake and underwent treatment for the condition. \nAfter a career as an environmental lawyer, Mr Kennedy rose to prominence as the head of anti-vaccine organisation Children's Health Defense, formerly known as the World Mercury Project.\nMr Kennedy, 70, frequently talks about health on the campaign trail and has tried to contrast himself with Mr Biden, 81, and Mr Trump, 77. \nHowever, the member of America's most famous political family has suffered from a variety of other health problems. \nHe is a former heroin addict and contracted hepatitis C from intravenous drug use, and has suffered from atrial fibrillation, a type of abnormal heartbeat. \nThe condition has put him in hospital at least four times, he told the New York Times, although he says has not had an episode for a decade.\nHe also has a noticeably strained, raspy voice caused by spasmodic dysphonia, a disorder that causes involuntary spasms in the muscles of the voice box. \nOn social media, he responded to the reports of his parasite by writing: \"I offer to eat 5 more brain worms and still beat President Trump and President Biden in a debate.\"\nAlthough Mr Kennedy is mounting the most popular third-party or independent challenge in decades and could swing the result, polls show him trailing far behind the front-runners.

    "Some social workers in the Belfast Health Trust are taking 48 hours of strike action from Wednesday over a \"staffing crisis\" in family and childcare services. \nAbout 40 members of the Nipsa trade union from three offices across Belfast will take part.\nIndustrial action will also extend to other trust areas in the coming weeks.\nNipsa said in some cases, staffing was about 30-50% below the required levels, which the union claimed had led to excessive workloads and stress.\nIn a statement, the Health Minister Robin Swann said any improvement to workloads will be an \"incremental process\" and is \"dependent on funding available to the department\".\nHe added that he will be \"seeking Executive transformation monies and cross-departmental support for investment in training\".\nBBC News NI understands that in one office in the greater Belfast area, where 10 social work staff are needed, there are only two in place.\nThere are about 3,000 social workers in Northern Ireland. \nA major report published in 2023 found hundreds of vacancies and an increase in demand for services following the pandemic.\nThe number of looked-after children has also hit an all-time high, with at least 3,800 looked-after children.\nNipsa said the strike action came after a period of negotiations with the Department of Health, which failed to address the problem of staff shortages.\nDamien Maguire, who has been a social worker for 20 years, said some staff were working 50-60 hours every week.\n\"We can't do this anymore,\" he said.\n\"We can't have our members crying, leaving the profession, stressed out, retiring early, leaving to go to other jobs that they don't necessarily want to go into.\n\"This is people's lives, it's children's lives and it's families' lives but it's also the lives of those social workers who have lived experience of what it's like to work in the system.\"\nNIPSA's President Tanya Killen also works as a social worker within the Belfast Trust.\nShe says members are on strike action because of the \"vandalism by the Department of Health in workforce staffing within children\u2019s services.\"\nShe said there has been \"an absolute decimation of staffing within children\u2019s services\" leading to \"excessive workloads\".\n\"Members feel that families and children are being left in a vulnerable position,\" Ms Killen said.\n\"Morale is extremely low, there is a serious issue with recruitment and retention of staff. \"\nShe added: \"We have young people that are coming into the service and because of the workforce pressures they are leaving for other jobs.\n\"Nipsa\u2019s concerns is that children\u2019s lives will be put at risk and that is the real fear and lived experience of our members.\"\nClaire Joudeh has been a social worker for 35 years and says she has never seen the system as broken as it is at the moment.\n\"There\u2019s an ever increasing number of children coming into the care system. \n\"We have unprecedented numbers of looked after children, alongside a decrease in the workforce, alongside a decrease in resources and services so we need to highlight that this is no longer safe.\"\nThe Health Minister said he recognised \"the sustained pressures that social workers are facing\".\nHe added: \"I have warned that the budgetary position for health would impact heavily on key areas, including training.\n\"This is the first confirmation of that highly regrettable reality.\"\nThe strike action is due to last until 10 May.",
    "Police arrested 33 people at George Washington University (GW) early Wednesday after officers moved to clear a pro-Palestinian encampment on campus.\nWashington DC police told the BBC that protestors were arrested for assaults on a police officer and unlawful entry. \nUniversity students had been inside the encampment since 25 April. \nHouse Republicans cancelled scheduled testimony by Mayor Muriel Bowser following the arrests after pressuring DC officials to clear the protests.\nThe police operation came a week after six Republican members of the House of Representatives Oversight Committee visited the GW protest encampment and called on officials to arrest protesters involved.\nWednesday's move to clear the encampment was made ahead of a planned appearance by Ms Bowser and Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith before the House Oversight Committee on the city's handling of the unrest.\nIn a statement, the Chair of the House Oversight Committee, Republican Representative James Comer, announced that appearance was being cancelled and said he was \"pleased that the potential Oversight hearing led to swift action by Mayor Bowser\". \nAccording to a report on the arrests by GW Hatchet, the university's independent student-run newspaper: \"Officers gave their third and final warning to demonstrators to move at about 03:30 local time, saying all who remained in U-Yard and the stretch of H Street in front of the plaza would be arrested.\"\nThe newspaper reported that some protestors who refused to leave were pepper sprayed by police.\nIn a statement, the university said police \"conducted an orderly and safe operation to disperse the demonstrators from the illegal encampment on the GW's University Yard\". \nThey added there were no reports of serious injuries during the arrests.\nPreviously, despite GW's efforts to offer an alternative protest site, the encampment remained. \nUniversity officials say they are unsure how many of the demonstrators were students. \n\"While the university is committed to protecting students' rights to free expression, the encampment had evolved into an unlawful activity, with participants in direct violation of multiple university policies and city regulations,\" a previous GW statement said.\nTensions had grown in recent days after police removed a large Palestinian flag that demonstrators had raised above a campus building. The university called the flag's hoisting an \"aggressive act of lawlessness\". \nMetro Police told the BBC there has been \"a gradual escalation in the volatility\" of the protest and, as a result, officers moved in.\n\"Therefore, this morning, working closely with the GW administration and police, MPD moved to disperse the demonstrators from the GW campus and surrounding streets,\" the statement added. \nGW said it remains open and operating as normal, but additional security personnel have been deployed to University Yard and the surrounding area.\nThe yard will remain closed until the end of commencement ceremonies on 19 May, the university added.\nThere have been heated demonstrations at a number of universities across the country against the war in Gaza. \nSince the 7 October attack by Hamas and Israel's retaliatory assault, students have launched rallies, sit-ins, fasts and, most recently, encampments against the war.\nAccording to a BBC tally, there have been pro-Palestine protests at 45 states and Washington DC since the demonstrations started at Columbia University in New York on 17 April.\nThey are demanding that their schools, many with massive endowments, financially divest from Israel. \nMany also want their universities to end academic relationships with Israeli institutions.\nPreviously, President Joe Biden said people had the right to protest but not the right to cause chaos.\nBut, Mr Biden warned on Tuesday the threat of antisemitism is growing in the US, including on college campuses, joining a heated American debate about Jewish security, Zionism, free speech and support for Israel, in the country with the largest Jewish population after Israel.\nAddressing a bipartisan audience at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual commemoration, Mr Biden said: \"This hatred (of Jews) continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness,\" Biden said.\n\"Now here we are, not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later, and people are already forgetting ... that Hamas unleashed this terror,\" he added. \n\"I have not forgotten, nor have you. And we will not forget.\"",
    "A family in a North Yorkshire town have been forced to move into emergency accommodation after their home was damaged by flash flooding.\nMark Robinson, from Knaresborough, said his family had lost their wedding photos and expensive electrical items due to the water damage in their home.\nParts of Yorkshire were affected by sudden heavy downpours of rain which hit on Bank Holiday Monday.\nMr Robinson said: \"We had a foot of water in our house within 15 minutes.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Radio York, he said the flooding appeared to come out of nowhere following a thunder and lightning storm on Monday evening.\nMr Robinson said: \"My youngest son was supposed to be playing a cricket match, but because of the thunder and lightning, they called the match off.\n\"We set off back home and it was raining so heavily that we just sat in the car for five to 10 minutes, to stop ourselves getting wet.\"\nHe said when he got out the car, flooding caused by surface water was up to his ankles.\n\"Then within 10, 15 minutes it was about a foot deep and it just went straight through the house.\"\nSpeaking about the damage to the house, he said it had ruined everything downstairs.\n\"The sofa, television, PlayStation, two laptops, wedding photos which were stored in a box.\"\nThe former firefighter said he had \"never seen anything like that\" in the 10 years he had lived in his home with his wife and two sons.\n\"On Monday night, me and my wife slept on my sister's sofas, while my two boys were at their grandparents' houses, so we were all split up,\" he said.\n\"North Yorkshire Council have now got us into emergency accommodation for last night and tonight together, and luckily the accommodation we've had has been really good.\n\"I think we will be out for a minimum of a month, as everything needs to be dried out and the flooring will need to be ripped up.\"\nElsewhere in Yorkshire, the rain stopped traffic in Bradford, and at Horsforth Station in Leeds, a rail platform became a waterfall as the tracks were flooded.\nRobert Ling, who is co-ordinating North Yorkshire Council's response to the flooding, said 50 households were affected by this week's flash flooding.\nHe added three of these households needed to be rehoused due to the damage caused, while other households had either moved in with family or were able to go back to their own homes.\nMr Ling said the council had set up a Chain Lane Community Hub in Knaresborough for people needing support to drop in over the next few days.\n\"Our emergency response team has been working tirelessly with local volunteers and the town council to help people who have been affected by the flooding in Knaresborough,\" he added.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "Founded in 1924, Paulton Homing Society in Somerset has been sending off and welcoming home pigeons for 100 years. For many members it is a hobby that has taken over their lives. Now they have been reminiscing on how the sport has changed over a century.\nBarrie Simmons' father, Harry, was one of the society's 12 founding members and completed 60 years as its secretary.\n\"He was 'Mr Paulton Homing Society',\" Barrie said.\n\"Things were very much different in those days... I was brought up when it was an out-and-out hobby, but with commercialisation comes changes.\"\nPigeon racing - in which the birds return to their homes over a carefully-measured distance - is thought to have begun as a sport in Belgium before becoming popular with working-class communities in the UK.\nIn north east Somerset, it was the old coal miners who kept the hobby alive.\nThinking about the \"good old days\", Barrie said that when the pigeon arrived back at its loft, the rubber ring was removed and handed to the fastest boy from the local school who would run it to the post office for an official time to be recorded.\nThe boy would be paid sixpence for his efforts.\nNow, the sport sees high-tech devices and the use of ETF (Electronic Timing Systems) systems.\nPeter Rakes has been flying pigeons since 1952, when he was just a boy.\nHe lived in Townsend, not far from Paulton, and said in his youth there were 20 pigeon fanciers in the area.\n\"It was the coal miners who kept the sport going. It was their bit of fun,\" he said.\n\"They used to take the pigeons on the train up to Bristol to be released.\"\nAnd on the way back there would be the treat of fish and chips in Brislington, he added.\nApart from when he got married and did not fly for a couple of years, Peter said \"pigeons have been my life\".\n\"It is in my family, my father was a pigeon fancier [breeding the birds],\" he said.\n\"I've been retired a few years now. If I didn't have my pigeons it would drive me up the wall.\"\nHe said he will eventually \"pack in pigeons\" on the day he loses a sense of pride when he sees his birds come home.\nBarries said as the years had gone by, the sport had become commercialised.\n\"Even when my father retired in 1985, he remarked then it was becoming commercialised,\" he said. \"There is a lot of money involved in it now.\"\nAnd with that, comes even more competitiveness.\nLargely gone are the days when a fancier would take a young boy - or older gentleman - under their wing and pass on their knowledge of the sport, and potentially even give them a bird to get started.\n\"Nowadays, yes there are still some genuine fanciers about, but there is a lot of money that changes hands regarding young pigeons - even old pigeons - and I am talking about hundreds and thousands of pounds,\" Barrie said.\nGeoff Cooper has had some success with racing.\nHe loves the international races which can take place across Europe and see the birds flying anywhere up to 800 miles back to their lofts.\n\"I have won a lot of short and middle-distance races,\" Geoff said.\nBut asking him how that feels, he said his reply would \"have him in tears\".\n\"Those winners\u2026 I can remember every pigeon that I have timed late at night into the day and I've been racing since 13 and keeping them since 11,\" he said.\n\"My life - wasted on pigeons,\" he joked.\nBarrie added: \"It is a fascinating sport. I've been sat on the wall at West Bay with baskets of pigeons ready to let go and people have been interested.\n\"You try to explain to them about how they are going to be let go and make their way back to their loft, and they will do that on a Saturday from various race points from 50 to 800 miles [away].\n\"They become absolutely fascinated with it. It is that sort of sport. It is like a drug, it gets a hook into you.\n\"I just love the sport, to sit in the garden and wait for those birds. The words that most fanciers will say is 'here's one'. It is phenomenal.\"\nAnd so 100 years on from when the society first started, for these men at least, there is no sign of slowing down or taking a step back, just yet.",
    "John Swinney has been sworn in today as Scotland\u2019s first minister, the seventh person to fill that role. \nHowever, he has not only taken on responsibility for leading the country\u2019s devolved government, he has also taken on the job of his party\u2019s leader - with a Westminster election probably no more than six months away.\nGoverning Scotland is not easy at a time when public services are under pressure and the economy is flatlining. \nBut turning around the SNP\u2019s fortunes could prove an even more demanding task.\nWhen Humza Yousaf decided to throw the Greens out of the government, polls of voting intention for Westminster were on average putting the SNP on just 33%.\nThat meant the party was only neck-and-neck with Labour in terms of votes \u2013 an outcome that, because of the greater geographical concentration of its vote, would most likely result in Labour winning most seats.\nThat 33% figure represents no less than a 10-point drop in the party\u2019s rating compared with where it stood when Nicola Sturgeon announced her intention to resign in February last year. \nThat decision triggered what has proven to be a calamitous year for the SNP.\nBy March this year only 29% were telling Ipsos that they regarded Mr Yousaf favourably, while 45% looked on him unfavourably. \nBy last autumn Savanta were reporting that over half felt the party was not united. \nAnd shortly before Mr Yousaf\u2019s fateful decision to oust the Greens, rather more were telling Redfield & Wilton they thought the SNP government was incompetent (37%) than said it was competent (30%).\nEven many of those who voted for the SNP in 2019 had their doubts. Almost as many said the party was not united (43%) as said that it was (47%). Less than half (45%) reckon the SNP government is competent.\nMeanwhile, the fallout from the departure of the Greens has done nothing to improve the party\u2019s standing. \nTwo polls conducted since then, but before it became clear Mr Swinney would become leader without a contest, put the SNP behind Labour.\nEqually, YouGov were now reporting that 67% believed that Mr Yousaf was doing badly as first minister, up from 45% last September. As many as 60% now regarded him unfavourably.\nBut in bringing down Mr Yousaf the opposition parties have potentially given the SNP an opportunity to repair some of the damage of the last 12 months.\nCertainly, Mr Swinney starts his job with rather better polling numbers than his predecessor. \nOnly 40% feel unfavourably about him, 20 points lower than the equivalent figure for Mr Yousaf. \nAccording to Ipsos 37% feel Mr Swinney will do a good job as first minister, only 23% a bad one. \nAnd Panelbase say that among those who voted SNP in 2019, 28% reckon they are more likely to vote SNP with Mr Swinney at the helm - over twice the proportion (13%) who take the opposite view.\nHowever, whether Mr Swinney can seize the opportunity he seems to have remains to be seen.\nHe would appear to have a good chance of being able to make his party seem less divided.  The lack of a contest for the leadership will help for a start. And Mr Swinney is widely respected within his party.\nMeanwhile, much of the open criticism of Mr Yousaf\u2019s regime came from those associated with Kate Forbes, who was narrowly defeated by Mr Yousaf in last year\u2019s ballot.  \nShe is now part of Mr Swinney\u2019s new government. So perhaps the noises off will die down.\nAnd there is also an easily identifiable body of voters for Mr Swinney to target  \u2013 those who have become disenchanted with the SNP but who still believe in independence.\nPanelbase have reported that only just over half (56%) of those who would vote Yes in an independence referendum are currently minded to vote SNP for Westminster. As many as 21% say they would vote Labour.\nBut the key question is whether Mr Swinney can find the persuasive arguments and engaging style needed to bring these voters back into the SNP fold. \nThis was the aspect of the job of party leader that Mr Swinney found more difficult when he was previously leader 20 years ago.\nMr Swinney says he is a changed man. The SNP have to hope this means he can now change their fortunes.\nSir John Curtice is professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde and senior research fellow at the Scottish Centre for Social Research and \u2018The UK in a Changing Europe\u2019.

    "The UK is to invest \u00a3196m into creating Europe's first ever advanced nuclear fuel facility in Cheshire.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said the uranium enrichment plant was essential to \"prise Putin's blood-soaked hands off Europe's energy market\".\nThe government said an energy supply chain that was not reliant on Russia was needed.\nThe facility is to be built and part-funded by Urenco in Capenhurst, Cheshire.\nThe new development will produce advanced uranium fuel by 2031 for export or use domestically.\nThe government said it would support 400 jobs, power the UK's future nuclear power stations and ensure other countries are not reliant on Russia for advanced nuclear fuel, a market which it currently dominates.\nMinisters said it was part of efforts to improve energy security and isolate Moscow from energy markets, following moves to stop imports of Russian oil and gas after the invasion of Ukraine.\nMr Sunak said: \"Russia has been the sole provider of this powerful nuclear fuel for too long and this marks the latest step in pushing him out of the energy market entirely.\n\"The wider future of British nuclear remains a critical national endeavour - guaranteeing nuclear and energy security, and reducing energy bills for Brits.\"\nSecretary of State for Energy Security Claire Coutinho said: \"Backing Urenco to build a uranium enrichment plant here in the UK will mean we are the first European nation outside Russia to produce advanced nuclear fuel.\n\"This will support hundreds of new jobs, bring investment for the people in Cheshire and is a huge win for energy security at home and abroad.\"\nOfficials said the fuel was needed to power new advanced modular reactors which they say will be key to meeting ambitions to quadruple the UK's nuclear capacity by 2050.\nThe funding is part of a \u00a3300 million programme announced in January, and Urenco, which is part-owned by the government, will co-fund the facility.\nUnder the plans the facility will have the capacity to produce up to 10 tonnes of the fuel per year by 2031, which could contain as much energy as more than one million tonnes of coal, the government said.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Asylum seekers have said they are living in fear of being sent to Rwanda as the government prepares for the departure of the first flights to Africa.\nCampaigners say they have seen people in tears after family members and friends were detained at a centre in Loughborough last week.\nA former Afghan army officer who helped British forces has said he is scared of being forced to leave the country.\nAnother asylum seeker said he had started sleeping rough to avoid police while a third said he felt like they were being used as a \"political football\".\nSardar, who served as an officer in the Afghan National Army helping British forces in Helmand Province, did not qualify for a UK resettlement scheme.\nHe said he fled Afghanistan after being targeted at home and crossed the channel in a small boat.\nSardar was injured in the line of duty and had collected a weight of evidence to support a claim for asylum, including a glowing reference by a Nato mentor. \nBut he arrived a few months too late to claim refugee status in the UK because the government had changed the law. \nSeveral former British military chiefs have already campaigned for former soldiers like Sardar to be exempt from the Rwanda plan.\nSardar, who has several photographs of himself on patrol and sharing meals with British soldiers, said he spent four years with UK forces in Helmand Province. \nHe said: \"I know I was not in the British Army, but we did everything shoulder by shoulder against international terrorism.\"\nSardar added he only wants to work and support himself and will not stop signing in at the centre in Loughborough.\nBut he added his fortnightly appointment was \"very scary, very stressful\".\n\"Maybe I will get in and they arrest me, and don't let me back out,\" he said. \n\"[In the past] there were many many people staying for the signing.

    "The Ministry of Defence has been censured with the maximum sanction after a soldier was accidentally shot dead during a night-time \"live fire\" training exercise.\nPte Conor McPherson, 24, from Paisley, Renfrewshire, sustained a fatal head wound in Otterburn, Northumberland, in August 2016.\nAn investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) found the MoD (Army) had failed to properly implement a safe system of work for the exercise.\nThe MoD said it accepted the findings and apologised \"unreservedly\" to Pte McPherson's family. \nIt added his death had been \"preventable\" and said it had addressed \"each of the failings\" cited in the Crown censure. \nThe HSE said by accepting the censure, the MoD admitted breaching health and safety at work rules.\n\u201cJust like any other employer, the MoD has a responsibility to reduce dangers to its personnel, as far as it properly can,\u201d HSE Inspector Jonathan Wills said.\nPte McPherson served in the Black Watch, 3rd Battalion, the Royal Regiment of Scotland.\nHe was taking part in a training exercise when he was accidentally shot in the back of the head by a fellow soldier, at about 23:00 BST on 22 August.\nThe HSE said the planning and conducting of the exercise had been \"poor\", with an ineffective system to monitor the management arrangements mandated within the MoD's own procedures.\nIt said there should have been an additional supervisor with the firers on the night of the incident, due to the soldiers' lack of experience when carrying out night-time firing.\nMandated \"night-time\" specific safety tasks were \"not carried out prior to firing commencing\" and \"incorrect and unauthorised\" night vision equipment was being used by some soldiers, it found.\nOfficers who were not sufficiently experienced in controlling such an activity and were not properly mentored or supervised to deal with an exercise of such complexity, the HSE said.\nIt added some staff had not attended planning meetings in the lead up to the exercise and there should have been an additional supervisor.\nLt Gen Dame Sharon Nesmith, deputy chief of the general staff, said she was \"deeply sorry for failing Pte Conor McPherson\". \nGen Nesmith added action had been taken \"in the immediate aftermath\" and lessons continued to be applied. \n\u201cWe failed to plan, organise, control and monitor the critical safety aspects of this live firing training event,\" she said. \n\u201cWhilst live firing is complex and risky, Conor's death was preventable.

He is expected to enter the plea in the coming weeks.\nHe was fired in March as news of the allegations emerged. At the time, Mr Ohtani, 29, said he was \"saddened and shocked\" that someone he had trusted had \"done this\".\nMr Ohtani signed a record 10-year, $700m contract with the Dodgers before this season, becoming the face of the sports franchise. He had just won his second unanimous American League MVP award.\nHis superstar status was cemented last February when he announced that had gotten married, sparking weeks of speculation about the identity of his wife, whom he did not name at that time. The guessing game ended a month later when he shared a photo of his wife, Mamiko Tanaka.\nMr Mizuhara had been a constant companion since the baseball star's stint in the US started in 2018. \nMr Ohtani, who does not speak English, had relied extensively on his interpreter - from answering questions at news conferences to transacting with financial advisers and opening bank accounts.\nMr Mizuhara's ability to interpret Mr Ohtani's comments into colloquial English had been widely praised in Japan.",

    "After more than three billion doses, the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is being withdrawn.\nAstraZeneca said it was \"incredibly proud\" of the vaccine, but it had made a commercial decision.\nIt said the rise of new coronavirus variants meant demand had shifted to the newer updated vaccines.\nIts vaccine was estimated to have saved millions of lives during the pandemic, but also caused rare, and sometimes fatal, blood clots.\nIn the race to lift the world out of pandemic lockdowns, the Covid vaccine was developed by scientists at the University of Oxford in record time. A process that normally takes 10 years was accelerated down to about 10 months. \nIn November 2020, it was heralded as \"a vaccine for the world\" as it was far cheaper and easier to store than other Covid vaccines. The pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca had agreed to manufacture it en masse.\nInitially, it was the cornerstone of the UK's plans to vaccinate our way out of lockdown.\n\"The truth is it made an enormous difference, it was what lifted us out of the catastrophe that was unfolding at the time, combined with the other vaccine from Pfizer,\" said Prof Adam Finn, from the University of Bristol. \nHowever, its reputation was dented as unusual blood clots emerged as a rare side effect of the vaccine, and the UK turned to alternatives.\nIn a statement, AstraZeneca said: \"According to independent estimates, over 6.5 million lives were saved in the first year of use alone.\n\"Our efforts have been recognised by governments around the world and are widely regarded as being a critical component of ending the global pandemic.\"\nIt said the development of new vaccines that more closely match the mutated forms of Covid that are now circulating meant there was a \"surplus of available updated vaccines\", leading to a \"decline in demand\" for its vaccine which is \"no longer being manufactured or supplied\".\nProf Finn added: \"I think the withdrawal of the vaccine simply reflects it's no longer useful. \n\"It's turned out that this virus is very agile and it's evolved away from the original vaccines, so they have in a sense become irrelevant and only the reformulated vaccines are likely to be being used now.\"",

    "Interest rates are expected to be held at 5.25% for the sixth time in a row by the Bank of England on Thursday.\nThe decision comes as inflation, which measures price rises over time, remains above the Bank's 2% target at 3.2%.\nAs well as the interest rate decision, the Bank will also release its latest forecast estimating what will happen to inflation and the UK economy.\nThe report comes amid pledges from both major political parties on how they would drive economic growth.\nThe health of the UK economy has been in the spotlight with a general election set to be called in the coming months, and economic policies likely to be a key battleground in the quest for votes.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has previously said that 2024 would \"prove to be the year that the economy bounces back\", and that the country had \"turned a corner\" - but many households' budgets remain under pressure.\nWhile economists have predicted that rates will be held at their current 16-year-high rate on Thursday, most expect the Bank to cut rates for a first time in the summer.\nThe Bank raised, and then kept interest rates at a high level, in an attempt to slow the pace at which consumer prices have been rising and ease the cost of living.\nThe theory behind increasing interest rates to tackle inflation is that by making borrowing more expensive, more people will cut back on spending and that leads to demand for goods falling and price rises easing.\nBut it is a balancing act as high interest rates can harm the economy as businesses hold off on investing in production and jobs.\nPrices starting rising quickly as demand for goods increased when Covid-related restrictions were lifted. Energy and food prices then soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, leading to inflation peaking at 11.1% in October 2022 - the highest rate in 40 years.\nThe Bank's base interest rate dictates the rates set by high street banks and lenders. The higher level has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages, but savers have also received better returns.\nEmma Wall, head of investment research and analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, said anything other than the Bank holding rates would be \"a complete surprise\".\nShe said the markets were not expecting a cut, and that Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey had not given \"forward guidance\" on a change.\nBut she added that rates cuts are \"on the horizon\", and that the move by Sweden's national bank to cut rates on Wednesday \"signals the mood music\".\n\"Rate cuts will be coming in the UK, and in Europe, within the next couple of months,\" she said.\nFiona Eastwood, chief operating officer at Madame Tussauds-owner Merlin Entertainments, said: \"With inflation falling, we'd expect to see interest rates come down\".\nMs Eastwood, who is also on the board of industry group UKHospitality, added: \"Many of our businesses in UK hospitality and leisure are still reeling from Covid-related debt, higher interest rates are diverting cash away from investing in the business, but as importantly, it's about consumer confidence.\"\nA quarter of hospitality businesses have no cash reserves, and just under a third have less than three months' worth, so interest rates are \"critical\" for their survival, she said.\nLaith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at AJ Bell, said it was \"almost certainly too early for the Bank of England to pull the trigger on a rate cut right now\", especially against the backdrop of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, warning its interest rate could stay high.\nMr Khalaf said markets suggested it was a \"coin toss\" on whether interest rates would be cut in June, but added investors were leaning more towards an August reduction.\nHe said while it is \"easy to get drawn into obsessing\" over when the first rate cut will occur after a long period of high interest rates, it was \"important to zoom out a bit and take a longer view too\".\n\"While the next interest rate move is almost certainly down, there isn't going to be a sudden collapse in rates thereafter,\" he said. \n\"Policy will adjust slowly and the end point won't be the near zero interest rates of the 2010s.\"\nThe Bank of England has previously said it expects inflation to fall slightly below its 2% target by the summer.\nMr Bailey has sounded more optimistic on rate cuts and has suggested the 2% target does not have to be achieved before rates are cut - just that the Bank's policymakers have to be \"convinced\" it will.\nThe UK fell into economic recession at the end of last year when the economy shrank for two consecutive three-month periods, but policymakers believe the downturn might already be over.\nOn Friday, the latest official figures on the economy will be released, which will confirm whether or not the UK economy grew in the first three months of 2024.\nHow are the interest rates affecting your life?

    "An award winning play about sexual assault and the legal system is being used to help train judges in Northern Ireland.\nJodie Comer starred in Prima Facie in both the West End and on Broadway.\nA recorded version of the show is being made available to judges who deal with sexual assault cases in Northern Ireland's courts.\nMs Comer played the character of Tessa in the one-woman show about a barrister who defends people accused of sexual assault, before she herself is raped by a colleague.\nPlaywright Suzie Miller told BBC News NI she believed theatre could change society.\n\"When you take a character and show, rather than tell, someone what's not working - it's really easy to see it when it's in a story context, and with a character that you really care about,\" she said.\nMs Miller said she thought it \"engages and ignites people to where the unfairness lies.\"\nShe said she had received phone calls from \"so many\" judges who came to see the play. \n\"This is a conversation that everyone has to have and we have to have it now,\" she said. \n\"We need to talk about what we can do within our court system to actually protect someone who's a complainant and encourage people to complain,\n\"Encourage them to have faith there will be some outcome that is, at the very least, not re-traumatising for them, but at the better end of the scale is that they are believed.\n\"The more aware that our judges are in court, the more they can come to terms with something that they see as a rape myth and call it out.\"\nRosie Cowan, a lecturer at Queen's University Belfast, has carried out research into the impact of rape myths in criminal cases. \nShe told BBC News NI the use of the play in training judges could be a powerful tool.\n\"I think it'll be a very compelling reminder of the power of rape myths in society. \n\"Rape myths are false beliefs and stereotypes about rape, like what a victim wears or how much she drinks or indeed as happens in the play, her previous sexual history.\"\n\"There's a substantial body of research, my own included and which has found that rape myths bias many people against complainants.\"\nOne memorable line from the play highlights the character's journey through her perception of the criminal justice system: \"Once you see you cannot unsee\". \n\"When I was at law school, I remember thinking it was really odd that a defence barrister could hold up a pair of underwear that most women in the school were wearing that day at university,\" said Ms Miller.\n\"And so \u2026 that means you were wanting sex.\"\n\"I thought, well I've got underwear on that's fairly decent, but that doesn't mean I'm here wanting to be raped,\" she said. \n\"And I remember thinking there's something very wrong in this area of law, but I couldn't quite articulate it because I was a human rights advocate and I believed in innocence until proven guilty. \n\"So I thought there's something missing. There's a fundamental key missing here that they're actually set up to fail in court.\"\nPrima Facie also puts a spotlight on court delays and the resulting impact on victims. \nRecent figures uncovered by BBC News NI show that it takes 757 days on average for a sex crime to be dealt with in Northern Ireland, considerably longer than most of other crimes. \nIn 2022, a judge was criticised for comments he made during a sentencing when he suggested a convicted sex offender should \"find a wife\".\nThis prompted Lady Chief Justice Dame Siobhan Keegan to announce that judges would receive more training.\nIn a statement she said: \"The Judicial Studies Board regularly monitors developments and innovations to identify material and resources which might enhance the quality of training which judges receive.\n\"The subject matter of any given training may include new legislation or case law, newly available research or any other available material capable of improving the learning outcomes of the judicial participants\".",
    "Ofcom has warned social media sites they could be named and shamed - and banned for under-18s - if they fail to comply with new online safety rules. \nThe media regulator has published draft codes of practice which require tech firms to have more robust age-checking measures, and to reformulate their algorithms to steer children away from what it called \"toxic\" material.\nBut parents of children who died after exposure to harmful online content have described the proposed new rules as \"insufficient\" - one told the BBC change was happening \"at a snail's pace.\"\nIn statements, Meta and Snapchat said they had extra protections for under-18s, and offered parental tools to control what children can see on their platforms.\nOther firms have not responded to a BBC request for comment.\nOfcom boss Dame Melanie Dawes said any company that broke the draft codes of practice would be \"named and shamed\", and she made clear tougher action such as banning social media sites for children would also be considered.\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast, Esther Ghey - whose daughter Brianna was murdered, aged 16, by two teenagers in February 2023 - said she believed Ofcom \"really did care\" about trying to get regulation right.\nBut she said the full extent of the problem remained unknown.\nLisa Kenevan, whose son Isaac died aged 13 after taking part in a \"black out\" challenge online, said the pace of change was not fast enough.\n\"The sad thing is the snail's pace that is happening with Ofcom and social media platforms taking responsibility, the reality is there's going to be more cases,\" she told BBC Breakfast.\nIt is Ofcom's job to enforce new, stricter rules following the introduction of the Online Safety Act - these codes set out what tech firms must do to comply with that law.\nOfcom says they contain more than 40 \"practical measures.\"\nThe centrepiece is the requirement around algorithms, which are used to decide what is shown in people's social media feeds.\nOfcom says tech firms will need to configure their algorithms to filter out the most harmful content from children\u2019s feeds, and reduce the visibility and prominence of other harmful content.\nOther proposed measures include forcing companies to perform more rigorous age checks if they show harmful content, and making them implement stronger content moderation, including a so-called \"safe search\" function on search engines that restricts inappropriate material.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Dame Melanie described the new rules as \"a big moment\". \n\"Young people are fed harmful content on their feed again and again and this has become normalised but it needs to change,\u201d she said.\nAccording to Ofcom's timeline, these new measures will come into force in the second half of 2025.\nThe regulator is seeking responses to its consultation on the draft codes until 17 July, after which it says it expects to publish final versions of them within a year.\nFirms will then have three months to carry out risk assessments on how children could encounter harmful content on their platforms and their mitigations, taking Ofcom's guidance into account.\nDame Melanie added: \"We will be publishing league tables so that the public know which companies are implementing the changes and which ones are not.\u201d\nDame Melanie met Ms Ghey and Ian Russell, whose daughter Molly took her own life in 2017 at the age of 14.\nIn 2022, a coroner concluded she died from an act of self-harm while suffering depression and the negative effects of online content.\nThey are part of a group of bereaved parents who have signed an open letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and leader of the opposition Sir Keir Starmer.\nIn it, they implore the politicians to do more for the online safety of children -

    "A Dundee woman made thousands of pounds secretly selling elephant ivory on eBay, a court has been told.\nJoyce Bell, 67, admitting selling the banned goods in what is understood to be the first conviction of its kind in Scotland.\nDundee Sheriff Court heard that Bell sold nearly 100 items made with ivory obtained from the tusks of elephants.\nBell admitted selling ivory items in 2022 contrary to the Ivory Act 2018.\nShe had claimed to be selling items made with \"bovine bone\" to get around eBay's ban on ivory trading, but collectors knew she was selling prohibited goods.\nThe court was told that Bell spent years selling costume jewellery to China and other countries and had made \u00a36,412 as a result.\nSheriff George Way deferred sentence until 24 June for reports and said: \"It is rare for me to be stumped, but after 16 years on the bench I have never had a case of this nature.\"\nBell also admitted fraudulently evading export duty payments by exporting items without a permit.\nShe further admitted exporting, or trying to export, ivory goods without applying for, or obtaining, export permits.\nFiscal depute Karon Rollo told the court that the Border Force agency at Heathrow Airport highlighted a number of parcel seizures which they suspected contained elephant ivory.\nShe said a parcel for China was examined by Border Force and found to contain a necklace made from elephant ivory.\n\nThe fiscal said several more parcels were intercepted and notices were issued to Bell telling her she required permits to export the jewellery and trinkets.\nBell did not respond to the demands and was later found to be selling items for nearly 10 times what she claimed to be charging.\nThe online auction website confirmed that between April 2018 and April 2022 there had been a number of sales of \"bovine bone\" from the accounts Bell was using.\nWhile \"bovine bone\" sales are legal, elephant ivory - which is heavier - is not.\nThe court was told that international collectors would have been well aware from the listed weights that Bell's goods were made from elephant ivory.\nMs Rollo told the court: \"She said she bought it because she liked and hoarded it and on occasion she sold them for extra money and as a hobby.\n\"She stated that she didn't know the difference between ivory and bovine bone.\n\"She said she didn't think the items were ivory and continued trading because she didn't know the difference.\"\nThe Ivory Act 2018 bans people from dealing in ivory.

    "Opportunities were missed to prevent the death of a vulnerable woman, a safety review has found.\nThe body of Diane Douglas, 56, was found buried in the grounds of her home in Colton, near Norwich, in November 2021. \nA Domestic Homicide Review (DHR) found she had been \"coercively controlled\" by her partner Stuart Williamson.\nWilliamson, who was arrested for her murder, took his own life while on remand in December 2021.\nThe report, commissioned by Norfolk Community Safety Partnership, examined the responses of different agencies and the support offered to Ms Douglas - who is referred to as \"Helen\" - prior to her death. \nIt found a lack of \"professional curiosity\" in potential domestic abuse situations. \nMs Douglas, who had the degenerative condition Huntington's Disease, was last seen by her family in September 2018.\nIn October 2021, her nephew contacted police with concerns about her safety, after Williamson told family members who knocked on her door that she had left him 18 months before.  \nHer body was discovered in a shallow grave and had been there for a number of years, the report said.\nA post mortem examination found severe traumatic head injuries consistent with being repeatedly struck with a heavy blunt object. \nAn inquest revealed Williamson had used her phone to send her family text messages after killing her.\nThe pair first moved in together in 2007 and soon afterwards, Ms Douglas was diagnosed with Huntington's Disease, a progressive illness which affects walking, talking and swallowing.\nThey split in 2008, but reunited in 2016, moving to rural Norfolk where Williamson became her official carer.\nThe review said: \"[Williamson] exacerbated this isolation by placing her in a home which was miles from anywhere, by making it awkward for her to visit friends and family, by making it awkward for them to visit her, and by dwindling away her savings and income on his lifestyle, which [her] family described as extravagant.\"\nHe spent more than \u00a335,000 of her savings, and continued to spend her private pension and welfare benefits totalling \u00a380,000 after her death, the review found. \nThe review found that in July 2015, after qualifying for personal independence payments, Ms Douglas contacted adult social care at Norfolk County Council for an assessment, citing deterioration of her condition and asking about sheltered accommodation.\nIt was deemed \"low priority\" - and she moved in with Williamson in early 2016.\nThe DHR said: \"The timing of this move, and the subsequent bank transfers from her savings into his account, was an act of financial abuse which was largely invisible and which continued after [her] death.\"\nIn July 2016, a neurology appointment in Cambridge put her independence score at 80%, meaning she needed support with chores and sorting finances and work adaptations. \nShe was also given medication after suffering a number of falls.\nFrom December 2018, Ms Douglas failed to attend hospital appointments and a friend's lunch appointment was cancelled by text.\nThe DHR report said: \"Although there were never any obvious signs of physical violence in the form of injuries.. she had been living with a coercively controlling man.\"\nShe had confided in her nephew about Williamson's financial abuse in August 2017, the review said, but efforts by him to reach out to adult social care were not \"responded to adequately\".\nThe review found specialist clinics in Cambridge did not then have a policy regarding routine enquiries about domestic abuse, \"considering the vulnerabilities of patients with degenerative illnesses such as Huntington's\", the review added. \nThe DHR identified a learning need to be curious about vulnerable people if they failed to attend medical reviews.\nAdult social care services accepted there was a missed opportunity to engage with Ms Douglas more fully and to thoroughly explore the allegations raised by her nephew about financial and possible emotional abuse. \nThe review concluded health professionals were uniquely placed to ask about domestic abuse and advised all practitioners must be trained in domestic violence and abuse.\nThe DHR found agencies involved in the review identified learning in this area, much of which had already been implemented, or started, since Ms Douglas' death. \nThis now included working closely with domestic abuse services. \nNorfolk Safeguarding Adult Board said training in \"professional curiosity\" and domestic abuse was being offered to a wider range of staff.\nGot a story?

    "Retired miners have travelled to Parliament to lobby MPs in a row over their pensions.\nHundreds of campaigners marched round Westminster on Wednesday as they called on the government to stop taking a surplus from the pension pot miners paid into during their working lives.\nOne of the ex-miners, Ian Hoggan from Wakefield, dressed as the legendary highwayman Dick Turpin to highlight the campaign.\nThe government has previously said current arrangements struck a \"fair balance\" between the interests of retired miners and taxpayers.\nUnder a deal struck in 1994, when British Coal was privatised, the government takes 50% of profits generated by the pension in return for underwriting it.\nBut campaigners say this is depriving mining families of much-needed cash, with many ex-miners having had to retire early because of ill health or injury.\nMr Hoggan, who worked at Lofthouse Colliery in Wakefield between 1973 and 2004, told the BBC: \"It's money for them, it's money for us.\n\"They (the government) are taking billions and we're not getting our fair share that we paid in. They haven't contributed a single penny.\n\"There are elder mineworkers on as little as \u00a379 or \u00a380 a week, who are struggling to pay their bills and struggling to put food on the table because of the money they've stolen.\"\n\"For a lot of the guys, it's our last hurrah\", Ian Burkhill, from Rotherham, told BBC Radio Sheffield, speaking before the trip to Westminster.\n\"Obviously, mining had a big effect on all of us health-wise - some of the guys simply can't get there because of their disabilities.\"\nHe said those who travelled to London represented \"all of the miners that are still left alive\"; they wanted to tell the government - \"you've taken enough money from us\".\nIn April 2021, a cross-party committee of MPs said the government should stop taking money from the scheme and pay back some of what it had already received.\nLabour has promised to review the arrangements if it wins power at the next election, with shadow minister Ed Miliband telling the BBC in March there had been \"deep unfairness and injustice\" in the Conservatives' approach to the issue.\nA government spokesperson said it was \"protecting the pensions of mineworkers while striking a fair balance between scheme members and taxpayers\".\n\"Mineworkers\u2019 Pension Scheme members are receiving payments 33% higher than they would have been as a result of the government\u2019s guarantee,\" the spokesperson added.\n\u201cOn most occasions, the scheme has been in surplus, and scheme members have received bonuses in addition to their guaranteed pension.\u201d\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

    "SNP leader John Swinney has been sworn in as the seventh first minister of Scotland.\nHe was confirmed in the role during a brief, formal ceremony at the Court of Session in Edinburgh.\nMr Swinney takes office 25 years after he was first elected to the Scottish Parliament. \nThe first minister is now expected to appoint his cabinet, in a series of meetings at his official residence, Bute House.\nHis appointments will be confirmed in parliament on Thursday.\nAfter the ceremony, Mr Swinney, 60, told reporters it was an \"enormous privilege\", but said it had been a \"very abrupt\" change for his family.\n\"It's an extraordinary opportunity to change lives for the better and I intend to use every moment that is available to me to do so,\" he said.\nHe vowed his minority SNP administration government would seek to work collaboratively across parliament, with a particular focus on eradicating the \"curse\" of child poverty. \nLast week he promised a senior role to the former finance secretary Kate Forbes, who declined to challenge him for the leadership of the SNP.\nThe ceremony to install Mr Swinney as first minister was overseen by Scotland's senior judge, Lord Carloway.\nThe Perthshire North MSP swore the oath of office, declared his allegiance to the King and was confirmed as keeper of the Scottish Seal.\nHe confirmed his appointment by putting pen to parchment on a table in the well of the court, Scotland's supreme body for civil law since 1532. \nMr Swinney won the nomination for first minister in a parliamentary vote on Tuesday.\nHe was backed by all 63 SNP MSPs and Alba's sole Holyrood representative, Ash Regan. \nSeven Green MSPs abstained, guaranteeing Mr Swinney the required majority.\nFollowing a tumultuous two weeks for the SNP, Mr Swinney became party leader on Monday.\nA contest was narrowly avoided, with a rival candidate - veteran SNP activist Graeme McCormick - withdrawing his bid at the 11th hour. \nThis paved the way for Humza Yousaf to formally resign as first minister on Tuesday - a move prompted by his tearing up of the power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens. \nHe had been in post for just over a year, having taken over the role from Nicola Sturgeon.\nMr Swinney has 16 years' cabinet experience and led the SNP between 2000 and 2004.\nHe will take office in the week the Scottish Parliament marks 25 years since devolution.\nPreviously, he said he would not be an \"interim leader\" or a \"caretaker\" and that he intended to see out a full term.\nHe has said he will seek to govern on a \"moderate centre left\" platform, and will be open to working with any other political party in the parliament to pass legislation.\nThis was reflected in his speech to MSPs on Tuesday in which he struck a conciliatory note, praising the achievements of other major parties in the devolved parliament.\nHe pledged to be the \"first minister for everyone in Scotland\", adding: \"I am here to serve you, I will give everything I have to build the best future for our country.\"\nThe economy, the NHS and other public services, and \"a drive to lift children out of poverty\" are his priorities for government.\nWhile Ms Forbes is expected to make a return to cabinet but it is unclear where other ministerial roles will be allocated.\nIt is also not clear which roles Mr Swinney will keep, though The Times previously reported he intended to have a \"slimmed-down\" government.\nHaving confirmed he has no intention of resurrecting a deal with the Greens, Mr Swinney will attempt to pass a budget and other key bills with a minority administration of 63 MSPs.\nUntil recently Mr Swinney's career on the frontbenches looked to be over.\nHe stepped down from the cabinet in 2023 after 16 years in key roles under both Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon.\nFollowing the collapse of the Bute House Agreement, and Mr Yousaf's resignation, Mr Swinney was publicly urged to stand for first minister by senior party members - which he said he accepted out of a \"profound sense of duty\".\nThe SNP leader said the decision had been made with his family, expressing \"eternal gratitude\" to his wife Elizabeth Quigley, who has multiple sclerosis and relies on him for support.",
    "Malaysia has said it plans to start giving orangutans as gifts to major trading partners who buy its palm oil. \nCommodities Minister Johari Abdul Ghani said the country hoped to generate the same goodwill as China does with its \"panda diplomacy\". \nBut conservation group WWF said the focus should be on protecting orangutans in their natural habitat. \nThe large apes, which are native to Malaysia and Indonesia, are a critically endangered species as logging and agricultural expansion - particularly for palm oil plantations - are blamed for the shrinking of the natural rainforests where they live. \nWith a name meaning \"man of the forest\", there are around 105,000 orangutans on the island of Borneo and a few thousand on Sumatra, WWF says.\nMr Johari said major importers of palm oil such as China, India and the European Union would be offered the apes as gifts.\n\"This will prove to the global community that Malaysia is committed to biodiversity conservation,\" he said on X.\n\"Malaysia cannot take a defensive approach to the issue of palm oil. Instead we need to show the countries of the world that Malaysia is a sustainable palm oil producer and is committed to protecting forests and environmental sustainability.\"\nThe move is being seen as a goodwill gesture to convince those countries that Malaysia is serious about developing its economy, and a token of its desire to keep this endangered species alive.\nBut conservation groups have voiced concerns about the plan.\n\"WWF supports in-situ conservation of wildlife, and would urge that trading  partners are brought to Malaysia to support this initiative, as opposed to sending orangutans out of the country,\" it said in a statement quoted by Reuters.\nAnd Justice for Wildlife Malaysia told the agency the plan required more research and urged the government to consider alternative diplomatic measures.\nPalm oil is used in a wide range of products - foods such as chocolate and margarine, as well as cosmetics and soap.\nIt is very efficient to grow, but thrives in tropical areas. Its spread has led to the destruction of natural rainforest, and plantations are often described as green deserts because they have none of the biodiversity of the forests they replaced.\n",
    "The boss of Scottish beer giant Brewdog is to step down from his role as CEO of the company.\nJames Watt said he would move to a newly-created position of \"captain and co-founder\" and retain his shares in the company.\nHis role will be taken over by chief operating officer James Arrow.\nMr Watt co-founded the Scottish brewery and pub group in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, in 2007 alongside Martin Dickie.\n\nIn a statement Mr Watt said: \"During my time at the helm of BrewDog, there have been highs and lows, up and downs, crazy successes and incredibly hard challenges. \n\"When I look back on the last 17 years my overwhelming feeling is one of gratitude.\"\nBrewdog now has breweries and pubs worldwide but has retained its headquarters in Ellon, Aberdeenshire.\nMr Watt's tenure has been marked by controversy in recent years. \nThe company has faced criticism for its marketing campaigns and its workplace culture.\nThe firm was accused by former workers in an open letter in 2021 of having a \"culture of fear\" within the business with \"toxic attitudes\" to junior staff.\nIn 2022 several ex-Brewdog workers accused Mr Watt of inappropriate behaviour in a BBC Disclosure investigation.\nLawyers for Mr Watt said the allegations were false. Ofcom rejected complaints that Brewdog and Mr Watt were unfairly treated by the programme.\nIn January, Brewdog also faced a backlash after revealing it would no longer hire new staff on the real living wage, instead paying the lower legal minimum wage.\nLast year, the firm expanded into the Chinese market in a joint venture with brewing giant Budweiser.\nBrewdog's revenue grew to \u00a3321.2m in the 2022-23 financial year.\nCompany chairman Allan Leighton said \"few have accomplished\" what Mr Watt has.\nHe said: \"I am especially pleased he will continue to offer his insight, creative genius and energy to the board.\"\nMr Watt will be replaced by James Arrow, who was hired as chief operating officer last September as forward planning for Mr Watt's replacement.\nHe was previously managing director of Boots Opticians.\nBefore this, he spent a decade at Dixons Carphone, where he held senior roles across e-commerce, trading, operations, sales and transformation.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine James Watt giving up for long on his brewing dream. Remaining on the board and as co-founder and captain, he will be a tough act for James Arrow to follow and to control.\nWatt\u2019s relentless energy and enthusiasm, which drove some of his staff to very strong and public criticism of his management style, is constantly sparking ideas and ambitions - for new products, for outrageous ways of promoting them, and to get the community of loyal \"punks\" he built up to drink his beer and invest in it.\nHe says he wants to \u201ccontinue to build fantastic start-ups\u201d and start new ventures of his own, as well as \u201ccontinuing to help Brewdog build an amazing business\u201d.\nIf he can stand back, that leaves a more conventional team and approach to growing the company\u2019s output and global portfolio of bars and hotels.\nThey also want to get Brewdog back into profit after three years of significant losses, driven by higher energy prices, supply chain disruption and rapid expansion of its on-trade.\nThe new chief executive, hired last year from Boots Opticians, and chairman Allan Leighton, who led Asda, the Co-operative Group and Royal Mail, will probably want to focus on preparing for a stock market float.\nThat has been long delayed by poor market conditions, and the controversies that embattled the chief executive. \nAnother deadline for that looms later this year, which might help explain why James Watt now has more time also for \u201ctravelling and adventures\u201d and \u201cspending more time with family and loved ones\u201d.",
    "A top barrister who was paid by the Post Office to review subpostmasters\u2019 convictions knew about a \"tainted witness\" but failed to investigate, report it to the police or disclose it to defendants.\nBrian Altman KC told the Post Office Horizon inquiry on Wednesday that he \"didn\u2019t turn a blind eye to anything\".\nBut he admitted with hindsight, the Post Office should have disclosed the information to subpostmasters.\nMr Altman knew after his appointment in August 2013 that Gareth Jenkins, an expert witness, had failed to disclose information about bugs in the Horizon IT system to defendants.\nThat information might have helped subpostmasters who had been found guilty to challenge their convictions.\nSoon after his appointment, Mr Altman, formerly the top barrister representing the government, read formal legal advice from Simon Clarke, a barrister with law firm Cartright King. This made it clear Gareth Jenkins had been in breach of his duties as an expert, and that that might be disclosable to subpostmasters convicted of theft and false accounting.\nHowever, he avoided meeting Mr Jenkins and did not advise the Post Office to investigate his evidence. Mr Clarke\u2019s advice was not shown to defendants until 2021.\nThe inquiry saw evidence that Mr Altman re-wrote the terms of reference of his review to remove issues of Gareth Jenkins\u2019 evidence and avoided meeting him.\nHe wrote to fellow lawyers for the Post Office at Bond Dickenson that he knew that not meeting Gareth Jenkins \"risks exposing the final report [of his review of convictions] to criticism\".\n\"This is something I shall need to think about carefully. At this very early stage I am not unnaturally undecided,\" he wrote. \"For now it may be better for the Terms of Reference to remain silent about him.\"\n\"Why did you consider it best for the terms of reference to remain silent on Mr Jenkins?\" asked Jason Beer, counsel to the inquiry.\n\u201cMy view was if the terms if I had yet not yet resolved to see him, that there was no point sticking it in the terms of reference,\u201d Mr Altman said.\n\u201cNot meeting him would be turning a blind eye to a potentially useful source of information? That\u2019s why you wouldn\u2019t want to do it,\u201d said Mr Beer.\nMr Altman responded: \u201cIf you\u2019re suggesting that I\u2019m turning a blind eye, I was not turning a blind eye to anything.\u201d\nMr Beer also asked why Mr Altman didn\u2019t advise the Post Office that it should investigate why Mr Jenkins had given evidence that was, according to Mr Clark, misleading and in breach of his duties to the court.\n\u201cBecause I come back to what I had thought\u2026 that the advice I was giving was about the impact of that failure on the prosecutions and the convictions - and not the reasons why he had failed to do it,\u201d said Mr Altman.\nMr Altman also admitted he did not ask whether Mr Jenkins had been properly instructed by the Post Office on his duties as an expert witness.\nMr Beer: \u201cDid you consider making a report to attorney general?\u201d\nMr Altman: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cOr the [Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions?]\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I think you\u2019ve said it didn\u2019t cross your mind to advise to call in the police?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nThe inquiry saw evidence that Post Office lawyers were interested in hiring Mr Altman because of his political connections and because he \"had the ear\" of the Attorney General\u2019s office.\nPost Office lawyers Rod Williams  and Gavin Matthews discussed on 25 July 2013 how Altman was a good candidate to review subpostmasters\u2019 convictions because he was \"clearly [very] alive to the political dimension\".\nThe inquiry continues.",

    "An \"undeclared\" Russian military intelligence officer will be expelled from the UK, James Cleverly has said. \nThe home secretary also announced the closure of several Russian diplomatic premises and new restrictions on diplomatic visas. \nThe defence attache, named as Colonel Maxim Elovik, appears to have been in the UK since at least 2014.\nThe Russian embassy in London said restrictions had been imposed under a \"groundless and ridiculous pretext\".\nSpeaking in the Commons on Wednesday, Mr Cleverly told MPs: \"Today, in conjunction with the foreign secretary, I am announcing a package of measures to make clear to Russia that we will not tolerate such apparent escalations.\n\"I can tell the House that we will expel the Russian defence attache, who is an undeclared military intelligence officer.\"\nThe Commons was told new restrictions on Russian diplomatic visas would be introduced, including a cap on the length of time Russian diplomats can spend in the UK.\nThe tougher measures were the latest step in response to a \"pattern of alleged Russian malign activity across the UK and Europe\" in a bid to \"target and dismantle Russian intelligence-gathering operations\", the Home Office said.\nIt comes after five people were charged over conspiring to commit espionage activities in the UK on behalf of Russia under the National Security Act, the first prosecutions of this kind under the new laws.\nPrior to his posting in London, Colonel Elovik served as an assistant military attache at Russia's embassy in Washington DC.\nMr Cleverly said that in the coming days, Moscow would make accusations of \"Russophobia\" while spreading \"conspiracy theories and hysteria\".\n\"This is not new and the British people and the British Government will not fall for it, and will not be taken for fools by Putin's bots, trolls and lackeys,\" he added. \nHe said diplomatic premises status from \"several Russian-owned properties in the UK\", including Seacox Heath house, a Russian-owned property in Sussex, and the trade and defence section in Highgate, will be removed. \n\"We believe [they] have been used for intelligence purposes,\" he said. \nRussian state news agency TASS reported that the Russian embassy in London was promising \"an appropriate response\" to the accusations. \n\"We always make sure that we protect our ability to have lines of communication with Russia, even during these most challenging of times, routes for de-escalation, of error avoidance and the avoidance of miscalculations are really important,\" Mr Cleverly said.\nShadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Labour \"wholeheartedly\" supported the move, telling MPs: \"We echo the home secretary's strong condemnation of Russian interference and hostile activity here in the UK and throughout Europe.\n\"Repeatedly, we have seen a brazen disregard by Russia for the rule of law, for the UK, for our allies, for our domestic security.\"\nConservative former minister Rehman Chishti questioned if the UK would bring in legislation to seize Russian assets, adding: \"It's absolutely crucial we do everything we can to cut off Putin's finances and make sure that he pays for the reconstruction of Ukraine.\"\nMr Cleverly replied: \"We have absolutely made it clear, we will be incredibly imaginative, we will work hard to ensure that the regime and the people that have funded the brutal attack on Ukraine are also those that fund the rebuilding of Ukraine, and we work with our international partners to make that a reality.\"",
    "Kyren Wilson's former mentor - the 2002 World Snooker champion Peter Ebdon - said the emotion of watching Wilson's first world title moved him to tears.\nWilson, from Kettering, defeated Jak Jones 18-14 as the World Championship final in Sheffield concluded on Monday.\nEbdon said the pair first met when Wilson played him in an exhibition match in Northamptonshire aged six.\n\"I was taken by his natural ability,\" said Ebdon. \"I said he should take up snooker - and the rest is history.\"\nEbdon, 53, who was born in London but grew up in Wellingborough, said he and 32-year-old Wilson played many hours of snooker together at Rushden's Windmill Club and Barratts Club in Northampton.\n\"He [Wilson] is a true world champion,\" said Ebdon. \"He is a lovely lad, with a really nice family.\n\"To be so close to him in a professional sense and see him go through and become a world champion - knowing how hard it is - was magical. I couldn't be happier for him.\n\"He put the work in and came through every test with flying colours. He was by far the best player at the Crucible this year and a very, very worthy champion. \n\"He had the all important ingredient - he believed in himself.\"\nHe said Wilson's nickname - The Warrior - was \"very apt\" and reflected his \"very strong mentality\". \nMore recently Wilson has had to contend with challenging family issues away from the table.\nHis wife Sophie had a stroke and was diagnosed with epilepsy, while his younger son Bailey suffered with illness and had to have an operation after an accident at school.\nEbdon - who retired from professional snooker in 2020 - was not present at Monday's final and said he chose to stay away so as not to \"upset his routine\", but he predicted more titles for Wilson.\nThe World Championship was his sixth victory in a ranking event and his first in one of the sport's Triple Crown tournaments - the Masters and UK Championship being the other two.\n\"I believe he can go on and become a Triple Crown winner,\" said Ebdon. \"He has a great chance of being a multiple world champion.\n\"It is such a huge thing to become world champion. Now the world is his oyster.\"\nGot a story? Email eastofenglandnews@bbc.co.uk or WhatsApp 0800 169 1830",
    "Two men who completed a 3,542-mile (5,700km) voyage across the Atlantic Ocean have thanked pupils who left secret good luck messages for the pair.\nRussell Davis and George Nelson arrived in Antigua in March, having set off from Portugal 98 days earlier.\nChildren from St Peter's Primary School in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, had written supportive messages for the pair, which were hidden in food packs.\nThe rowers have raised about \u00a340,000 for charity through their exploits.\nMr Nelson visited the school on Tuesday, when he presented pupils with a framed picture of their good luck messages.\nThe messages were secretly stashed in the rowers' food packs, with the pair only discovering them while they were at sea.\nThanking the children when presenting them with the notes \"as a token of gratitude\", Mr Nelson said he hoped the rowing and fundraising effort - for Vicky McClure's Our Dementia Choir and Mansfield-based Help at Hand - would inspire them.\n\"With determination and perseverance, you guys can achieve anything you want,\" he said.\nThe 56-year-old added: \"It was a complete surprise to us.\n\"Some of [the messages] were really funny, they kept us going, others were heartfelt which brought tears to your eyes and made you want to get home quicker.\n\"I know it's just a small thing, but by golly, for Russ and I, who were out there, lonely, with no telephones to communicate, it was a massive, massive boost for us.\"\nKyra Kennedy, a class teacher at the school, said she was \"so glad\" her uncles had made it home safely.\n\"Last summer, George [Nelson] came in with the boat to show the children, because I'd told the children about an exciting adventure my uncles were going on,\" she said.\n\"The kids were just amazed and kept asking questions, and we knew the kids would be able to give some good messages.\n\"My aunties and my mum, they were packing up the food bags for George and Russ, so we slid [the messages] in so when they opened up a food package each day, there was a new message each day to keep them going.\"\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "The bid for a murderer to be released from prison early had been rejected just days before he died.\nVictor Farrant was convicted of the murder of Glenda Hoskins, 44, in 1996.\nMs Hoskins' family had been told earlier this year that Farrant was being considered for early release on compassionate leave.\nThey told the BBC that the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) informed them of a decision to reject the request last week.\nThe Prison Service said Farrant, 74, died at HMP Wakefield on 3 May.\nMs Hoskins' son Iain Hoskins said: \"We'd been contacted the day before [Farrant's death] by the justice department's victim liaison, and they told us that they weren't progressing the plans for his release to the next stage.\n\"That was a relief, but then still having this hanging over us, that this potentially could happen at some point in the future, was very stressful and we didn't quite understand where we should be going forward.\"\nEarlier this year, Ms Hoskins' family said they had been contacted by officials who said Farrant was being considered for compassionate leave as he had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and could have months to live.\nA Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (Mappa) meeting in April looked at the case, which the family said had been passed on to the prison governor to decide whether to make a formal application for his release.\nThe MoJ said the prison governor had recently concluded that the criteria to grant this was not met.\nMr Hoskins told the BBC that a lack of \"clarity\" and \"transparency\" from the MoJ hadn't \"helped us through the process and given us information that we needed to be able to process\".\n\"All those things combined unfortunately haven't helped these last couple of months and cost us probably way more stress and anxiety than what was needed,\" he added.\nIn a statement, the MoJ said: \"Our victim liaison officers aim to keep victims aware of key updates or potential changes about offenders so that they feel well-informed.\n\"We are sorry that Glenda Hoskins' family were left confused by our communications which were done with the best of intentions.\"\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

    "This summer's Download Festival has added a new act to its line-up.\nIt's not another band though, but the Japanese role-playing video game Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance. \nAn \"immersive experience\" will let festival-goers play the game on-site in Leicestershire, battling demons in a post-apocalyptic world. \nDownload has called it a \"first of its kind experience\" and is the latest in a growing crossover between the worlds of music and gaming.\nThe festival, which will take place 14-16 June, is usually known for its line-up of rock and indie bands, with acts this year including Fall Out Boy, Queens of The Stone Age and Sum 41.\nThey'll be joined by the latest in the Shin Megami Tensei series, where players are being promised a way to play the game \"like never before\".\nThis title, which combines some previous Shin Megami Tensei 5 games with new features and a new story path, launches on the same day as the gates to the festival open.\nSet in an alternative apocalyptic version of Tokyo, players battle demons in turn-based over-the-top combat. \nThe original version of the game, made by Sonic the Hedgehog developers SEGA and ATLUS, received generally positive reviews, praising its combat and high difficulty.\nWhile Download is promising a new kind of experience at the festival, it's far from the first time the worlds of gaming and music have come together. \nConcerts where full orchestras play the soundtracks from games have become popular in the last decade. \nMost recently, a performance of the music from multi-BAFTA award winning game Baldur's Gate 3 filled London's Royal Festival Hall.\nDan Lazarides, vice-president for marketing at SEGA West EMEA told BBC Newsbeat he thought the partnership would be a good way to get his game in front of new audiences who might not have considered playing it before.\n\"The Shin Megami Tensei series is well known for its amazing soundtracks, so what better place to be some of the first people to play the game than at this legendary rock festival.\"\nNot everyone is convinced though. \nFollowing Download's announcement on X, one user simply replied: \"I think you're mistaken; this is a music festival.\" \nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",
    "A teacher embroiled in a race row with a mayoral candidate did not use a highly offensive racist slur while canvassing for Labour, police say.\nIndependent candidate Akhmed Yakoob took to social media to accuse the teacher, who works at a Wednesbury school, of making a racist remark.\nReacting to the subtitled doorbell footage, Mr Yakoob alleged the worker, who has since received death threats, had made the comment after asking a Dudley resident about their voting intentions.\nThe Labour Party has since said the video Mr Yakoob shared had been manipulated, while he has urged the party to share its findings with him.\nThe BBC understands Labour officials sought independent expert analysis of the audio recording and concluded the subtitles containing the racist slur were unlikely to be an accurate representation of what was said.\nResponding to the news, Mr Yakoob said: \"In light of the Labour Party claims that the footage maybe suspect, we encourage the party to share their findings with us.\n\"We take this very seriously and are investigating this ourselves.\"\nWest Midlands Police has also carried out its own investigation and has now said the original audio of the video has been examined closely. \n\"We have found no evidence of any racist slurs or language used,\" the force said in a statement. \n\"The canvasser has received significant abuse as a result of the footage being released on social media, which is distressing.\n\"She has been fully updated regarding our findings and offered our support.\"\nThe teacher - who has not been named - was canvassing with Labour councillor for Dudley, Qasim Mughal, who has called on Mr Yakoob to \"apologise for attempting to destroy someone's career\".\n\"He has done irreparable damage to a completely innocent young lady and he needs to understand the severity of what he has done,\" Mr Mughal said.\nHe described the woman as a colleague who had respect for every single student in her care.\nHer local community has been misled by the video, which caused the teacher to receive death threats along with abusive messages, Mr Mughal added.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X, and Instagram, Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk",

    "Proposals have been unveiled for another set of electricity cables to come ashore on the Lincolnshire coast.\nThe project would bring power 400km (250 miles) from a Scottish windfarm along a cable laid on the sea bed which would then be routed underground when it reached land. \nThe cable would terminate at two grid connection points in central and southern Lincolnshire. \nSenior council officials said the plans \"will irreversibly change the character\" of the county.\n\nThe cable would be laid from the proposed Ossian Array floating windfarm, which is 84km (52 miles) off the east coast of Scotland. \nThe latest cable plans were discussed at Lincolnshire County Council's (LCC) executive committee meeting on Wednesday.\nColin Davie, executive councillor for economic development, environment and planning, expressed concern about the cumulative impact.\n\u201cThis is industrialisation of the Lincolnshire coast on a scale we have never seen before,\" he said.\nPrior to this latest proposal, National Grid announced plans for three electricity cable schemes as part of what it calls The Great Grid Upgrade.\nThey include an overland pylon route from Grimsby to Walpole, two underground cable routes running 100km (62 miles) across Lincolnshire and five large electricity substations. \nLCC has made a formal objection to the pylon scheme.\n\u201cIf all these proposals were taken as one application by a planning authority, it would be refused due to the sheer scale of it and the impact, irreversibly changing the character of the county,\" Mr Davie said.\n\u201cInstead, we proposed that National Grid look to install this infrastructure offshore. \n\"This would be the most sustainable, secure, and cost-effective option and would mean the power could come onshore precisely where it is most needed, and not channelled through vast swathes of the countryside,\" he added.\nDavid Willson, senior project manager for Ossian Offshore Wind Farm said: \u201cWith a capacity of up to 3.6GW, enough to power up to six million homes annually, Ossian\u2019s scale makes it a game changer in the UK renewable energy sector and a critical driving force behind the journey to net zero and creating greater energy security.\n\u201cUltimately the decision for onshore design of the GB electricity network lies with National Grid Electricity Systems Operator.\"\nA spokesperson for National Grid said: \u201cOur proposals in Lincolnshire are a critical part of the new electricity infrastructure required for the UK to reach net zero. \n\"By developing these projects, we will be able to connect new sources of low-carbon energy to homes and business across Lincolnshire and beyond so that everyone has access to cleaner, more affordable electricity.\"\nA number of public consultation events are being planned in Lincolnshire.\nMr Wilson added: \u201cOssian is fully committed to listening and engaging with the local community throughout the process and providing regular updates.\"\nFollow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

    "A woman said her late husband's experience working at a German slave camp in Alderney affected him for the rest of his life. \nIris Prigent, 88, said her husband Gordon Prigent was 19 years old in late 1943 and living in Jersey when the Germans demanded he work for them, as he was then employed as an apprentice plasterer and they wanted someone with his skillset.\nMrs Prigent described her husband's experiences as Jersey marks 79 years since the island was liberated from Occupation at the end of World War Two.\nUnhappy that he should be expected to work for the people who had occupied his island, Mr Prigent refused - and the German authorities punished him severely before transporting him to Alderney. \nMr Prigent was taken from his home at 3 Hope Street to the northernmost Channel Island which had been all but evacuated before the Germans came to occupy it in 1940.\nThere four slave labour camps had been set up to hold the unfortunates whose task was to build the bunkers, gun emplacements and walls that would turn the island into an impregnable fortress, according to Hitler's wishes.\nAlderney was given the codename \"Adolf Island\" and prisoners were brought there from 27 countries.\nMr Prigent was forced to carry out a variety of jobs, on a meagre diet and with regular beatings. \nOnce, because he was too slow to get out of his bunk, a Nazi guard smashed Mr Prigent's teeth with a truncheon.\nMrs Prigent said the cruelty he witnessed stayed with him in later life, and that he \"never spoke about it\".\nShe said: \"Some nights he had nightmares - we'd be in bed and I'd be woken up with 'Achtung, Achtung, Achtung!' [attention], and he'd be standing next to the bed, talking, you know, to a German who wasn't there. \n\"I never woke him up, because I thought he might strike out at me, thinking I was a German.\"\nMrs Prigent said the huts in the camp accommodated two per bed, but when there were a lot of them they \"used to make them move over and get three in a bed\".\n\"Some nights, if he was having a nightmare, he'd push me to make room for this other person to get in,\" she said.\nMr Prigent's story is set to be remembered on one of 20 special memorial stones that will be be set into pavements across Jersey.\nStolpersteine are cobblestones covered with a brass plaque which provide details of Occupation survivors.\nThe stones will bear the name of other people from the Occupation, including John Max Finkelstein who survived Buchenwald concentration camp and Peter Hassall who tried to escape from the island in a boat.\nChris Addy from Jersey Heritage said the stones were a nice way to remember people.\nHe said: \"The 20 Stolpersteine in Jersey will provide a moving commemoration for survivors of the Occupation, and we hope there might be an opportunity in the future to add further stones to remember people who lived through these difficult years.\"\nMrs Prigent said she was looking forward to seeing her husband commemorated.\nShe said: \"I'm very proud, he never really spoke about what happened - for him it was just 'that's life', and we carry on. \n\"They're going to put it [the stone] in the pavement outside his house - I'm very pleased.\"\nFollow BBC Jersey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "With his dramatic defeat in the West Midlands mayoral election still sinking in on Saturday, Andy Street briefly pondered his future.\n\"I'm just going to take time to reflect,\" he told the BBC. \"On Monday, I shall be up Cadair Idris in Wales and I'm really looking forward to that.\"\nA thank-you message posted on Monday suggested he'd not contemplated much beyond his hike in the Welsh mountains - even if plenty of others had.\n\"In fact it seems many of you already have my next move planned out before I've even thought about it!,\" he wrote.\nSo what is being said about his next move?\nWith a general election expected this year, the Conservative Party is looking for parliamentary candidates.\nIn the West Midlands, there are vacancies in several constituencies, including Solihull West and Shirley. \nSolihull was one of the seven council districts where votes were cast in the mayoral election, and Mr Street won there by a large margin.\nWould being an MP appeal to Mr Street?\n\"I don't think he'd fancy being an MP,\" one Tory MP told me. \"Being an MP would probably frustrate him, having been in control of such a big area.\"\nTim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, said being a mayor \"with a big budget, power, influence and agency is very different to being a backbencher\".\n\"I'm not sure it would be easy for someone like Andy Street, who is used to getting things done.\"\nEven so, his record as mayor has turned heads in the Conservative Party.\nAs the party reflects on its heavy losses in local elections, some Tory MPs have been framing Mr Street's defeat as a chink of light in a black horizon.\nIn the mayoral race, Mr Street wore his Conservative affiliation lightly, and pinned his campaign on his personal brand.\nIn the end, he lost by about 1,500 votes to Labour's Richard Parker.\n\"That is a heck of an achievement given current circumstances and shows that his brand of non-ideological Conservatism has got a lot to offer,\" one Tory figure told me.\nThat brand has even inspired a Spectator article with an eye-catching title: \"Could Andy Street be a future Tory leader?\"\nThe morning after the mayoral election, Mr Street received an endorsement from an unexpected source on social media.\n\"Is it too far fetched to think that Andy Street - a genuinely nice guy - could be leader of the Conservative Party in six months time?\" Labour's former deputy leader Tom Watson wrote.\nHe added: \"He's head and shoulders above the current runners and riders and Labour folk like him.\"\nDon't forget, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has insisted he can lead the party to victory in the next general election and beyond this year.\nBut if Mr Sunak falls short, would there be appetite for a new Tory leader in the mould of Mr Street?\n\"Given the drift of the Conservative Party towards the populist right, it wouldn't seem the ideal pick for leader,\" said Professor Bale.\nHe said if the Conservatives lose the next two general elections, \"they might be looking for a more moderate centrist like Andy Street\".\n\"But at the moment, they're probably looking for a culture warrior.\"\nBefore he entered politics, Mr Street had a successful career in retail and was managing director of John Lewis and Partners.\nAs mayor, he worked with many businesses as he sought to bring investment into the West Midlands and upskill the region's workforce.\nThe Centre for the New Midlands hosted events that brought together businesses and Mr Street and the think tank's founder, Chris Smith, suggested the former mayor was \"more likely to get back into the corporate world\".\nIt's common for former politicians to take up jobs as business advisers - and they can make a lot of money in doing so. If they're high profile enough, they can also earn large sums by speaking at events.\n\"It wouldn't surprise me if he got an offer to be the chancellor at the university, and backed it up with a portfolio of business directorships,\" Mr Smith said.\nA Tory MP told me if Mr Street wanted to dip into politics and business, the House of Lords would be the best place for him. Though only prime ministers can nominate peers.\nWith a fresh start awaiting him after his rambling trip in Wales, Mr Street will have plenty of time to consider which path to walk.",
    "Police have urged Asian communities to remain vigilant after a spate of burglaries targeting family gold.\nThere have been 19 incidents in the Eastleigh area and Southampton this year, Hampshire police said.\nOne victim told the BBC she was woken up by two men in her bedroom, \"going through my wardrobe\". She said \u00a320,000 worth of gold jewellery was stolen.\nCh Insp Matt Paling, Eastleigh District Commander, said the burglaries were \"a very organised crime\".\nThe 22 or 24 carat gold is often bought as gifts in Asian families, and passed down through generations, holding significant sentimental value.\nLast month, Ch Insp Paling visited Southampton's Vedic Society Hindu Temple to offer people support and advice.\nHe told the BBC: \"We have seen an increase in high-value gold theft, I want to reassure the community we are doing everything we can and to remain vigilant.\n\"We need to reduce this crime. I don't want people to become victims of this, I want them to listen to our crime prevention advice.\"\nPreeti Nayyar was burgled on 15 March in Chilworth, Hampshire. She told the BBC she believes four men were involved, smashing her conservatory door to gain entry, before going upstairs and into her bedroom where she was sleeping. \nMrs Nayyar said: \"I was in a deep sleep, when I opened my eyes and saw two burglars going through my wardrobe. I screamed and they ran down the stairs.\"\nShe said the burglars stole about \u00a320,000 worth of gold. Two of them were captured on home CCTV running down the stairs and out of the house.\nMrs Nayyar said: \"I think they were very prepared. I feel they had an eye on the house. I think those targeting Asian households definitely do their homework. They didn't take any other valuables, they were after the gold.\"\nSince the burglary, she said she had taken her remaining gold jewellery back to her mum in India, saying she felt it would be \"safer in India than in the UK\".\nCh Insp Paling said of the recent cases in his area: \"This is a very organised crime. If you think of the yield that they are going for - gold has gone up quite considerably.\"\nHe said criminals were able to sell it on through various methods, melting it down \"to make it unidentifiable\" using devices bought online.\nThe BBC has submitted a Freedom of Information (FOI) request about Asian gold thefts to six police forces in the south of England: Dorset Police, Hampshire & Isle of Wight Constabulary, Surrey Police, Sussex Police, Thames Valley Police and Wiltshire Police.\nDorset Police stated there were eight burglaries between January and March this year, totalling almost \u00a390,000 worth of gold stolen. In 2023, there were 13, totalling more than \u00a3330,000 in stolen gold.\nSurrey Police reported there had been 23 incidents of gold burglaries so far this year (January to April), with a total of more than \u00a3110,000 worth of gold taken. Last year the force attended 36 incidents, involving a total of around \u00a325,000 worth of stolen gold. \nThe other forces refused to respond to the FOI on the grounds of cost.\nWhile it did not provide figures, Hampshire police said it was advising residents to be careful with valuables, including keeping gold in a safe location, such as a bank or safety deposit box, and installing CCTV cameras at home.\nKavya Jagiasi's home in Poole, Dorset, was broken into last year, with burglars stealing about \u00a33,000 worth of gold and some cash.\nShe said: \"I was not expecting this in this country. I was shocked at how easily they entered my house. We still don't feel safe, we always check our security cameras and don't always sleep well.\" \nNeeraj Shah, from Camberley, Surrey, said he was targeted a few years ago, when burglars stole about \u00a37,000 worth of gold. \nMr Shah said he had since set up a neighbourhood watch scheme to protect his local community. \n\"We are all very vigilant,\" he said. \"We text each other if we see any suspicious activity, like cold-callers or any cars parked here - we take down registration numbers. I believe it is deterring crime.\"\nMr Singh [who did not want to give his first name], said nearly \u00a310,000 in gold was stolen from his home in Reading, Berkshire, in April.\nHe said they were not at home when \"the burglars smashed through the patio door\".\n\"We had CCTV at the front of the house, not the back. They have taken up to \u00a310,000 worth of gold. They didn't take other valuables like laptops - 100% they were after gold,\" he said.\n\"I'm still in shock that this happened.

    "Before Tory MP Christian Wakeford swapped sides to Labour at the peak of the Partygate scandal in 2022, it had been 27 years since an MP had defected directly from the governing party to the main party of opposition.\nLess than two weeks ago, Dan Poulter made the same journey as Mr Wakeford.\nAnd today - to bafflement and shock from MPs of all parties - Natalie Elphicke sits as a Labour MP. \nIndeed, it took a while for MPs to work out what Sir Keir Starmer was talking about at Prime Minister's Questions when he welcomed Mrs Elphicke to his side; few had noticed her sit down behind the Labour leader.\nShe walked in accompanied by John Healey, the shadow defence secretary - who is understood to have been instrumental to wooing her across, due to a working relationship they forged due to a shared interest in housing. \nMrs Elphicke worked in the housing sector before she became an MP in 2019, while Mr Healey was the housing minister in Gordon Brown's government and shadowed the brief for Labour from 2015 to 2020. \nSir Keir and his team are jubilant. They believe there could be few clearer messages for voters motivated by the small boats issue than the MP for Dover - where many of the crossings arrive - declaring that she trusts the Labour leader over Rishi Sunak on the issue. \nRemember this is one of the prime minister's five priorities: an issue at the heart of his attempts to reverse his political predicament. \nMore broadly, Sir Keir's allies believe that the defection will help him make a direct argument to 'big C' Conservatives that if an MP as 'small c' conservative as Mrs Elphicke is moving to Labour, so they should too.\nOn the flipside, that is exactly what is worrying some Labour MPs, who worry that a broad church that can include Mrs Elphicke is simply too broad. \nMultiple sources claimed that party whips, who are responsible for enforcing discipline, expressed concerns about admitting Mrs Elphicke to the party, though Labour denied this. \nIt is worth remembering, too, that some Labour MPs are still angry that Diane Abbott, first elected as a Labour MP in 1987, has not had the Labour whip restored since April last year, when she was suspended over allegations of antisemitism.\nThe two previous Conservative defectors were widely welcomed by Labour MPs: Mr Wakeford was disillusioned with Boris Johnson at a moment when his character was at the heart of the political debate; Labour MPs liked that Mr Poulter defected specifically on the issue of the NHS.\nMrs Elphicke's cause of immigration and asylum policy sits less easily with many Labour MPs - though it is worth noting that she also cited housing, where her views are much more in tune with the Labour mainstream. \nIt hasn't helped settle some Labour MPs' nerves that so many Conservative MPs have been noisily declaring that they are much less right-wing than Mrs Elphicke.\nThe truth about Ms Elphicke's position on the ideological spectrum is perhaps a little more nuanced. \nShe was staunchly pro-Brexit, and a member of the Eurosceptic European Research Group of Conservative MPs.\nYet while she has repeatedly castigated Labour over its approach to small boats, she has long argued that diplomacy with France will be more effective than the government's Rwanda scheme - putting her fairly close to Labour, which opposes the policy.\nIn 2022, she proposed that all private rents be frozen to help renters with the cost of living, and the next year was part of a cross-party project to build houses for homeless people. \nIn February she praised Nye Bevan, one of the heroes of the post-war Labour government, in the House of Commons. \nSome of the anxieties among Labour MPs are not just about Mrs Elphicke's beliefs, but about her messy arrival in politics. \nShe has only been an MP since 2019, replacing her then-husband, Charlie Elphicke, after he was charged with sexual assault. He was later convicted and imprisoned, at which point she announced that their marriage was ending. \nDespite the private rumblings of dissatisfaction from some quarters of the Labour Party, it is noteworthy that few have so far gone public to express their concerns. \nThat is a sign of a disciplined Labour Party, with even some of the MPs most sceptical about Sir Keir's leadership determined not to make victory at the general election harder by sounding off. \nBut that does not mean they will forget this episode. \nOne Labour figure warned that Sir Keir was \"storing up bad will\" for the government that most people - including Natalie Elphicke - now assume he will lead.

    "Joe West and Jack King - two Metropolitan Police officers - are just a couple of hours into their Friday shift on the Bromley response unit when a call comes over the radio: a boy has just been chased through Beckenham by a group of teenagers, one of whom has a knife. \nAfter a search of a nearby park, a boy is arrested and the knife is seized.\nIt is the kind of call the officers believe they should be focusing on - and the kind they say they can now respond to more quickly - since the Met's Right Care Right Person (RCRP) initiative was launched alongside the NHS in November 2023.\nThe changes aim to reduce the number of mental health-related incidents police attend, and mean the force only responds if a person is at risk of serious harm.\nSix months on from the launch, the Met says it is responding to about 6,000 fewer calls every month, freeing up roughly 34,000 hours of officers' time to tackle crime.\nMet Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley told BBC London that since RCRP was rolled out, the force was now attending about 500 more robberies a month.\n\"It really has made a massive difference to us in how we respond to crime,\" PC West said.\nHe explained he previously spent \"entire shifts\" sitting in a hospital emergency department waiting with someone struggling with their mental health to receive care, but estimated the new approach has reduced such call-outs by up to 70%.\n\"It's giving us that time to actually go out and actively hunt for burglary suspects, and look for people that are involved in stealing cars, and bring positive results back to the public,\" he added.\nAs part of the scheme, a new 24-hour helpline has also been set up for officers to call for advice before detaining someone under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act, which PC West believes is better for patients.\n\"People that are suffering from mental health issues don't want to see police,\" he said.\n\"I think that's something that has been has been abundantly clear ever since I joined the job.\n\"Sometimes, you know, the uniform can look quite intimidating, and we may turn up with a few of us, and we completely understand that looks very intimidating.\"\nPC West said being able to call the helpline had given him greater confidence in the decision-making around whether a person needs to be sectioned.\nDuring such a call, there is a discussion about issues like the medication the person is taking and whether they are engaging with mental health services, before advice is given on the best option for care.\nIf a decision is made that the person does not need to be sectioned, officers are given options of a \"safe\" alternative place they can be taken to - perhaps to a friend or family member - and arrangements for further checks from the mental health team.\nPC West said before RCRP, officers' time would also be spent waiting for an ambulance to arrive.\nWhile the initiative has been received positively within the Met, what impact is it having on patient care?\nWhen RCRP was first announced by the Met Police Commissioner in spring 2023, there was general agreement that police were often not the best people to respond to mental health incidents.\nBut some in the NHS privately worried it was being brought in too quickly and charities raised concerns about whether vulnerable people could fall through the net.\nThe scheme, initially supposed to launch that September, was then delayed by two months. \nWhen the rollout was discussed by London's police and crime committee at City Hall in February this year, it was clear those concerns remained.\nDr Lade Smith, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, told the committee there were increasing reports of police refusing to attend when vulnerable people go missing from hospitals or mental health units, and in some cases A&E staff were having to go to a person\u2019s house and look for them.\nShe told BBC London basing the success of the scheme on police statistics overlooked the potential \"negative impact\" on mental health, social care and ambulance services, which often do not have the same legal powers as police to transfer people to certain services.\nDr Smith added: \"It's not necessarily people getting the right care by the right person, sometimes it's people simply getting less care because they're not getting support.\"\nHowever, Sir Mark said the force had \"a strong line of communication between our teams day to day, and the health service teams\".\nHe said they had not seen any evidence of \"anybody slipping through any cracks\".\n\u201cWe will always turn up to save lives, that was never in doubt. But if it's simply a mental health crisis then I think we'd all expect, if it was a relative of ours, for that to be a medical professional,\" he added.\nDespite a reduction in call-outs for such incidents, when BBC London joined the officers on shift it was clear most of the calls coming in were still mental health related, and all required a police response.\nA man at a railway station was in a mental health crisis.

    "Three newspaper editors and dozens of other journalists have been named in documents related to the Duke of Sussex's High Court claim against the publisher of the Daily Mail.\nPrince Harry is among a group of high-profile individuals accusing Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) of unlawfully obtaining information.\nIn the court papers, made public on Wednesday, the Sun's editor Victoria Newton, editor of the Times Tony Gallagher, and the Mail on Sunday's editor David Dillon were among those named. \nANL has strongly denied the allegations as \"preposterous\".\nAs well as the prince, the publisher faces multiple claims of \"gross breaches of privacy\" from Sir Elton John, his husband David Furnish, Elizabeth Hurley, Sadie Frost, former MP Sir Simon Hughes and Baroness Doreen Lawrence.\nThis includes allegations of bugging devices in cars, listening into phone calls and dishonestly obtaining medical and financial information.\nNo findings have been made in respect of the allegations and the legal claims are in the preliminary stages.\nIn ANL's written defence - the publication of which on Wednesday lifted restrictions on identifying those named - Andrew Caldecott KC and Adrian Beltrami KC said the case \"is without foundation and is an affront to the hard-working professional journalists whose reputations and integrity, as well as that of Associated itself, are wrongly traduced\".\nThe documents, setting out the group's claims, named about 70 current or former journalists.\nDavid Sherborne, the duke's barrister, said in the written claim: \"The claimant will contend that the information obtained by these private investigators on behalf of Associated and its journalists was unlawfully or illegally obtained, and was known or must have been known to be, or were obviously, to have been so obtained.\"\nHowever, Mr Caldecott and Mr Beltrami said in the publisher's written defence that the duke's case was \"replete with sweeping allegations of serious criminal conduct which lack even the most basic of particulars\".\nThey said \"it is denied that Associated's journalists widely and habitually carried out, or commissioned the carrying out of, illegal or unlawful information gathering activities\".\nA spokesperson from ANL said the publisher \"has filed a trenchant defence of its journalism\" against the claims.\n\"In papers submitted to the High Court, the publisher of the Daily Mail and the Mail On Sunday denied under oath that its journalists had commissioned or obtained information derived from phone hacking, phone tapping, bugging, computer or email hacking or burglary to order,\" a statement said.\n\"Associated also denied claims made by Prince Harry and Baroness Lawrence that it commissioned private investigators Gavin Burrows and Jonathan Rees, as well as claims by Sir Simon Hughes that it commissioned convicted phone hacker Glenn Mulcaire.\n\"Indeed, it is highly significant that Gavin Burrows has retracted a statement he allegedly gave to the claimants, on which their case appears to be based.\"\nANL said it \"stands by its previous statements\" that the claims are \"preposterous and without foundation\".\nIt added that \"the stories concerned, many of which were published 20 or more years ago, and not subject to any complaint at the time, were the product of responsible journalism based on legitimate sources\".\nSpokespeople on behalf of the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times declined to comment.",
    "When James Blyth created what many believe was the world\u2019s first wind turbine in 1887, villagers dismissed it as the \"work of the devil\".\nThe huge structure at Blyth\u2019s family home in the Aberdeenshire village of Marykirk was built with four cloth sails and generated enough power to light 10 bulbs along with a small lathe.\nIt is said that he offered to light the streets of the village with his electricity but the offer was shunned.\nBlyth's vision of a future powered by wind only started to be realised many decades after his death\nBut now, almost 140 years later, Blyth\u2019s achievements are finally being commemorated with a blue plaque at his former home.\nJames Blyth's family have described him as a \"clever man with a curious mind\".\nHis first turbine was 33ft (10m) tall and was attached to a series of primitive batteries, known at the time as accumulators.\nFour years later, in 1891, Blyth patented his \"wind engine\" and went on to create a larger version which supplied power to Montrose Lunatic Asylum - later the Sunnyside Royal Hospital - for almost 30 years.\nProf Bill Leithead, from Strathclyde University, said there was a race on to develop wind power, with American engineer Charles Brush completing his turbine just six months after Blyth's first model.\n\"There was very little previous work on this sort of development of generating technologies so really he was starting from the very beginning,\" Prof Leithead said.\nBlyth was a professor of natural philosophy at Anderson's College in Glasgow which  later became part of the University of Strathclyde.\nHe spent his summers at his childhood home in Marykirk where he developed the wind engine technology.\nAccording to the University of Edinburgh, Blyth presented a paper in 1891 to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in which he argued the benefits of renewable energy including wind and wave power.\nBlyth's great granddaughter Ferelith Green said: \"As a family, we're delighted about this initiative. \n\"When he was developing wind power, coal was plentiful and cheap at the time and so wind power never really took off. \n\"It's only within recent times, when it's become much more important, that he's finally getting some recognition.\"\nBlyth died in 1906 and is buried at St Mary's Church in Marykirk.\nIndustry body Scottish Renewables has funded the plaque because it says the Scottish pioneer deserves wider recognition.\nChief executive Claire Mack said: \"You might struggle to go to a renewables office of any size and discover that there isn't a meeting room named after James Blyth but beyond the industry {he's} probably not particularly well known.\"",
    "A village car boot sale is ending after more than 40 years after a new limit on sellers made it \"unworkable\", said organisers. \nThe Melton Car Boot Sale has been running near Woodbridge in Suffolk since 1980.\nNew rules introduced in October setting a limit of 50 sellers led to committee members deciding to end events on the recreation ground.\nThe parish council said the sales needed to be better controlled and hoped another one might be established at the site.\nEarlier this year, organisers agreed to raise the cost for sellers from \u00a35 to \u00a37, but said the increase still did not make hosting events viable.\nThey said between 1980 and 2019 they raised \u00a342,000 for Cancer Research UK and more money for the Bobby Moore Fund.\nJohn Woolnough, chairman of Melton Car Boot Sales committee, said: \"You can't raise money for charity with just 50 cars coming to the site to sell goods. It's unworkable. \n\"I have to keep \u00a3250 aside every year in case there's an accident and there are other costs too, so we need more than 50 sellers to attend the events to make them viable.\" \nHe said on a busy summer's day the event could attract more than 100 sellers, with buyers coming from Lowestoft and Essex.\nThe committee was due to hold five events this year on the first Saturday of the month, beginning in May. \n\"I would be heartbroken if we didn't hold any more sales at the site because it's been such a major part of my life,\" said Mr Woolnough.\nMelton Parish Council said at no point had it given notice to the organisers to cancel the sales and it had never been stated that the events could not be run on a limit of 50 sellers.\nA spokesperson said: \"This was their decision. At the full council meeting in October 2023, concerns were raised about the numbers attending the car boot sales in recent years. \n\"It was agreed to set a limit for the number of sellers and reverse the layout, so the parked cars were away from football pitches - in line with other events in the park.\"\nThe council said this was in response to complaints about the size of the boot sale, the congestion it caused and the state of the grass after some events.\n\"Mr Woolnough, on behalf of the organisers, provided the figures for stalls and stated they were between 40-60 in 2023.

    "A masterpiece of 18th Century Italian art will go on display in Wales, 80 years after it was last in the country for a very different reason.\nThe Stonemason\u2019s Yard - painted by Canaletto in about 1725 - has been loaned from the National Gallery in London.\nIt will be the main attraction of the new Idyll and Industry exhibition at the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, from Friday.\nIt was last in Wales during World War Two when it was one of 2,000 priceless artworks moved from London to a slate mine in Blaenau Ffestiniog to protect them from German bombs.\nMore than 80 years later it is back and will be on display at the library until September.\nThe exhibition tells the story of The Stonemason\u2019s Yard and how it came to Wales as a \"refugee\" from bombing to be safely protected in the cavernous Manod slate mines.\nWinston Churchill \u2013 prime minister during the war -\u00a0ordered the National Gallery's collection to be moved away from London and hidden in \"caves and cellars\".\nBrick studios and air conditioning were installed inside the mines to store the National Gallery\u2019s collection which included work by artists such as Titian, Michelangelo and Constable.\nLong after the paintings had been returned to London, Glyn Williams and his family from Blaenau Ffestiniog became the owners of the quarry.\nIn the 1980s, Mr Williams said he had plans to expand the work there but the UK government wanted to keep the warehouses in place and restricted blasting at the quarry in case the warehouses were damaged.\nMr Williams won a court victory to effectively evict the government and expanded quarrying at Manod.\nIn 1983 he helped produce a booklet to remember the time the priceless works of art were stored in the quarry.\nHe said transporting some of the paintings proved difficult \u2013 a portrait of Charles I on horseback by Van Dyck - was 3.67m (12ft) tall and 2.92m (9ft 7in) wide.\nAlso, a trench had to be dug under a railway bridge in Llan Ffestiniog as the gap was not big enough for the lorry transporting the artwork.\nMr Williams said: \"But they still miscalculated by about two inches, so they had to let all the air out of the tyres to get under the bridge and then pump them up again to go up to the quarry.\"\nHe said the paintings were well looked after \u2013 experts stayed near the quarry to care for them and a garrison of soldiers guarded them - while air conditioning units kept the air \"quite clean and static\" to protect them.\nAfter the war ended, the 2,000 works were returned to their galleries, many to the National Gallery some to Buckingham Palace.\nAs part of the National Gallery\u2019s 200th\u00a0anniversary celebrations, 12 masterpieces from its collection are on display across the UK.\nThe exhibition in Aberystwyth is the only one in Wales and, for the first time at the national library, there will be an audio described tour for some of the items for visitors who are blind or visually-impaired.\nRhodri Llwyd Morgan, chief executive of the National Library of Wales, said it was \"an honour to have one of Canaletto's masterpieces here\".\nCanaletto was born in 1697 and raised in Venice. and was the city's most famous Venetian painter of his day. \nThe Stonemason\u2019s Yard is one of his early paintings and is different from many of his other work as it depicts a scene of daily life rather than his celebrated views of Venice\u2019s Grand Canal, regattas and festival days.

    "A man whose gambling addiction put him \u00a325,000 in debt, aged 23, said it \"truly felt like my brain was rewired\".\nChris Spindler, from Cheddar, Somerset, said he was 12 when he and a school friend began placing 20p football bets. \n\"It was my first interaction with gambling and my first taste of risk and reward\", he said.  \nHe has spoken out as ARA Recovery, which supports people with gambling addictions, highlights its work so people know where to get help. \nThe Bristol based non-profit charity has supported more than 20,000 people across the South West and South Wales over the last year, providing free support for anyone struggling with their own gambling, or someone else's.\nMr Spindler, 26, said after his early experiences of gambling with small amounts, he knew \"as soon as I turned 18 I would be betting on football\".\n\"Within days [of my birthday] I had a betting account with every bookmaker that you could think of because they offer new player, free bets, free spins, so I was trying to maximise those offers. \n\"And my gambling did start off very responsible, just \u00a35-\u00a310 bets on a Saturday afternoon just trying to win ridiculous amounts of money\u2026 that you know you're never going to win but it's just a bit of fun. \n\"But very quickly, in just a few months, that was no longer the case.\n\"I was gambling on all types of sport and events, I was gambling on football teams I couldn't even tell you what colour kit they played in or which country they were in.\nHe said horse racing became a big thing because it went on all day and while he was waiting to bet, he would play roulette or Black Jack. \n\"My gambling became quite relentless... my mind was always in a gambling state.\"\nMr Spindler said looking back, he knew he had a problem but had no intention of stopping, regardless of how bad his situation was.\n\"I was regularly taking out new loans... I didn't care about real world consequences.\n\"Even as my debt was building up to \u00a325,000... my mind was just on gamble, gamble, gamble and that's all I cared about.\"\nHe said it was only after his parents found out that things changed. \n\"I kept my gambling very secretive and hidden for years... I was battling on my own and my mental health was in the gutter\u2026 and suicide was looking like a very real option. \n\"But when my parents found out\u2026 I had to be open and honest with them and my mum took me to gambling anonymous the next day.\"\nSince then, he said he started to be more open with friends and family and began to speak out on social media about gambling harm and gambling addiction. \nHe closed his online accounts and blocked gambling sites on his computer and through the Multi Operator Self Exclusion Scheme (MOSES) - which takes one phone call - became blocked from betting shops.\nHe also let his dad get involved in his finances, which he said went some way to mending the trust between them.\n\"My parents were shattered when they found out and probably felt like they didn't know me any more... [but] they have played a crucial part in me getting better and without them, I don't think I'd be here to be honest.\"\nGuy Hawker, Service Delivery Manager at the gambling charity ARA Recovery said there are lots of harms as a result of gambling that go beyond the financial element. \n\"There are relationship harms, people can get involved in the criminal justice system which they wouldn't necessarily do so and there are impacts on people's mental health and suicide... we believe there to be around 400 suicides a year related to gambling.\"\nHe said people who have accessed their services told them the harms associated with gambling addiction have been \"significantly lowered\".\nThey are able to assess which treatment suits each individual, whether individually, in groups, through peer support and also offer ongoing support to live a life free from gambling, he added.\n\"Gambling can often be quite a hidden harm and with that increased awareness a lot more people are coming forward.\n\"Like mental health, there's a lot of stigma... but there's been a lot of work to reduce those barriers.\"\nA recent YouGov survey of 5,075 UK participants, between 29 January - 15 February, found people are most likely to choose weekly support sessions with a trained professional as an effective way to reduce gambling harms.\u00a0\nTwo-thirds (66%) of people believe that sessions with trained professionals such as these would be an effective way to reduce harm caused by gambling. \nSix in 10 (59%) said that tools to block access to gambling websites would be an effective way to control their gambling, and 58% cited speaking to a family member.\nMr Spindler said the advertising around gambling in this country is \"sickening and relentless... it's thrown in your face whether you want it or not\".\nHe said he would like to see gambling advertising \"completely eradicated\" to help other people like him. \nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Train company TransPennine Express (TPE) has lost its contract after months of poor performance.\nIt will cease to operate its routes across the North of England and Scotland on 28 May, with control passing to the government.\nBBC News analysed official figures from industry regulator, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), to examine how TPE's services have fared in recent months.\nTPE's services began to experience ongoing disruption in early 2022.\nThe company said it was affected by high staff sickness levels and the coronavirus pandemic delaying the training of new drivers.\nThis has been compounded by its lack of an agreement with unions for drivers to work voluntary overtime. The union Aslef has accused the company of relying on this instead of recruiting enough staff.By December, TPE was one of three operators said by the government to be responsible for \"unacceptable\" services across the North of England.\nThe latest figures show TPE cancelled about one in six (16.9%) of its services in March - the highest rate of any train company, but an improvement on January and February, which saw about a quarter of services cancelled.\nMost cancellations happened up to 22:00 the night before the service was scheduled due to a lack of staff, a practice known as \"pre-cancelling\" or \"p-coding\".\nThe main purpose of pre-cancellations is to adjust emergency timetables when poor weather or infrastructure damage requires unexpected changes.\nFigures on these additional cancellations have only been published since February, after the ORR asked train companies to provide the data to reflect the true impact on passengers. It means a full comparison with previous months is not available.\nThe timeliness of TPE trains improved slightly in the latest figures to March, after a sharp decline in September.\nAbout half of services arrived late, which is defined as a minute or more after the scheduled time. For all operators in Great Britain overall it was 29%.\nWhile figures suggest the company's current punctuality rates have improved on the period before the pandemic, they do not take into account the fact that the number of services has been reduced by around a third. \nThere was a similar trend in longer delays. In March 5.7% of trains arrived later than 15 minutes after the scheduled time, an improvement on December but still about triple the score for all operators.\nIn December, when there was disruption due to industrial action, TPE recorded the lowest number of trains planned in timetables since records began in 2016, at about 3,500.\nThe company planned to run about 6,000 trains in March. This was slightly more than planned over the same period in 2022, but about 2,500 fewer than in 2020.\nThese figures only count the number of planned services, before on-the-day cancellations are made.\nIncluding trains cancelled the previous day - which are removed from the official figures and do not count as being planned - at one point TPE timetabled about 6,600 trains in March.\nThe government has chosen to bring TPE under public control with the Operator of Last Resort (OLR) from the end of May.\nThe OLR, effectively a government-run train company, manages rail contracts that are brought into public ownership, with a view of eventually returning them to the private sector.\nUnder the OLR, the government has said services will run as normal with no changes to tickets, timetables or planned services, but the overall aim is to improve performance.\nNorthern, London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and Southeastern are also run by the OLR.\nFirstGroup, the company which owns TPE, said it was disappointed by the government's decision not to renew the contract it has run in various forms since 2004.\n\"Our team have worked extremely hard to improve services, including by recruiting and training more drivers than ever before,\" said Graham Sutherland, FirstGroup's chief executive.\nAdditional reporting by Wesley Stephenson and Hope Bolger",
    "John Swinney has become Scotland's seventh first minister after securing the SNP leadership. \nIt is his second turn leading the party and marks a remarkable turn-around 20 years after he stood down from a difficult period in the top seat.\nFor many in the SNP - particularly those who have been in the movement for a long time - John Swinney embodies what they think of as core SNP values.\nThey see him as trustworthy, hard-working and loyal. He is a favourite at the party conference and his admirers recognise in him a burning desire for independence.\nEdinburgh born and bred, the 60-year-old has something of the traditional Scottish banker about him, and indeed he spent five years working for Scottish Amicable Life Assurance before winning the Tayside North seat at Westminster in 1997.\nBut by then he was already a party veteran, having joined in 1979 aged just 15. \nHe ran the SNP's youth wing before climbing through senior roles in the national party, becoming its secretary at 22. \nMr Swinney is full of contradictions. He rose rapidly among the fiery young party activists yet there is something quite old-fashioned about him.\nHis cautious strain of nationalism was forged in the era of SNP leader Gordon Wilson, who headed the party from 1979 to 1990.\nYet he became a close and trusted colleague of the next leader, Alex Salmond, who had emerged from the more radical wing of the party.\nThrough his time at Westminster and then at Holyrood from 1999, he was a trusted lieutenant to Mr Salmond and so it seemed natural that he should succeed him in 2000, when the leader stood down.\nHis own time as leader, however, was not seen as a success. The early years of devolution were a surprisingly unhappy time for the party. \nThe Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition seemed to quell the nationalists. Seats were lost in the 2003 Holyrood election and there was a disappointing result in the 2004 European poll.\nTowards the end of his four years in the top job, it was clear his time as leader was over.\nHis party colleague Michael Russell borrowed from tales of Conservative fixers in grey suits to warn that Mr Swinney was facing a visit from \"the men in grey kilts\".\nMr Swinney was furious, and as he stood down launched a scathing attack on Mr Russell and other senior members of his party, blaming them for briefing against him and creating a \"fog of media speculation\" about his position.\nThose people \"should know better'\" than to \"import the grubby concepts from the Conservatives,\" he said.\n\"Our leader is democratically elected and, once democratically elected, should be supported by every single member of the party,\" he added.\nYet his ability to adapt and fit in, get on with the job and put duty first served him well when, after a spell on the back benches, he joined Mr Salmond's first government as finance secretary.  \nIt was a job he would fill for the next nine years, adding the title deputy first minister to his office door when Nicola Sturgeon succeeded Alex Salmond in 2014. \nHe remained her loyal deputy, moving to take over the education brief in 2016.\nHis time in office was not without its problems. He was particularly criticised for falling standards in science and mathematics and survived two votes of no confidence while in the role, one in 2020 and the other a year later.\nJust two months after that second vote he was moved to head the Scottish government's response to Covid, while remaining Ms Sturgeon's deputy.\nAnd that had looked like being his final job in government. Just after Ms Sturgeon stood down in February 2023, he announced that he too was going, returning to the back benches after 16 years as a cabinet secretary.\nHe remains liked and respected by both colleagues and political opponents. \nBut remember those contradictions. \nPolite and moderate in person - and much funnier than on camera - Mr Swinney is also a ferocious parliamentary performer and has been a serious political operator for almost 40 years.\nAs he announced his candidacy he spoke of uniting the party for independence.\nAlmost his first act was to say there would be a place for Kate Forbes - who had considered a rival bid - in his government and he denied he would be a \"caretaker\" leader, saying he was in it to lead the SNP through the next Westminster and Holyrood elections.\nAlmost 20 years after standing down, John Swinney is stepping up once again.",
    "In the lead-up to India's general election, Narendra Modi was expected to frame it as a referendum on his  decade as prime minister. \nHe was expected to boast about achievements like generous welfare programmes and spaceflights. He was to reaffirm that the new Ram temple in Ayodhya represented a cultural assertion for India's majority Hindus. Even foreign policy was anticipated to influence the ballot, with the publicity boost afforded by Mr Modi's hosting of the G20 summit last September. Opinion polls have predicted a third, record-equalling landslide win for his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\nBut early in the gruelling six-week election, Mr Modi's campaign shifted gears, using divisive rhetoric that has raised questions about his tactics. He's been accusing the opposition, led by the Congress party, of appeasing the Muslim minority community.\nMuslims make up 14% of India's more than 1.4 billion people. Taking a cue from Mr Modi's campaign, social media posts by the BJP have, according to the opposition, \"demonised\" Muslims.\nHe told a rally on 21 April that the opposition Congress wanted to distribute wealth to \"infiltrators\" and to \"those who have many children\". His remarks were widely seen as referring to Muslims. \nAt another rally, he warned women that the opposition would confiscate their gold and redistribute it to Muslims. He accused the Congress of orchestrating a \"vote jihad\", urging a \"certain community\" to unite against him. Mr Modi even said the Congress would select the Indian cricket team \"on the basis of religion\". \nThat's not all. In a recent interview Mr Modi said the \"whole world\" was trying to influence the elections. This week, Mr Modi blamed the Congress for taking \"truckloads\" of money from billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has long spoken about the close ties that Mr Modi shares with the country's two richest men. \n\"For the first time you have spoken in public about Adani and Ambani. Is it your personal experience that you know they give money in trucks?\" Mr Gandhi responded in a video message. Neither businessman has reacted to the comments.\nIndia's opposition has also accused Mr Modi of Islamophobia, calling his remarks \"divisive, hate speech\". The Congress has demanded an investigation into a potential code of conduct violation. Since the BJP's rise to power, hate speech against India's 200 million Muslims has increased. But Mr Modi's fiery rhetoric on the stump has surprised many, as they expected a focus on highlighting his achievements instead. \n\"To be honest, I thought Mr Modi's campaign would be much more about the rising India story, and about what they had done for the people,\" says Rahul Verma of the Centre for Policy Research (CPR), a Delhi-based think tank. \nOthers say Mr Modi's remarks are not unprecedented. They point to many such instances during his previous election campaigns, including what they call his \"inflammatory rhetoric\" after the riots in Gujarat in 2002 ahead of the state's assembly elections. \"So, it has not surprised me, but is has shocked me. We often refer to such rhetoric as dog-whistling but there was nothing subtle about the language being employed,\" says Milan Vaishnav of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.\nFor one, many say, the BJP might have been spooked by a significant dip in turnout in early rounds of voting amid what has been a rather low energy election. In the previous two elections, won decisively by the BJP, high turnouts benefitted the party - 2014 was largely a vote against the Congress, and 2019 was a vote for Mr Modi. \nSecond, the opposition has been trying to reshape the narrative of the 2024 election, shifting focus from being solely a referendum on Mr Modi to campaigning on issues like unemployment, social justice and economic inequality.\nPolitical scientist Neelanjan Sircar suggests that the BJP excels in national elections when it focuses on overarching national issues. He told a podcast recently that the party's not \"playing its strongest game\" when elections become more regionalised, and local factors come into play.\nMr Modi's party is targeting 370 seats this time, up from 303 in 2019. However, their rallying cry of \"Abki Baar, 400 par\"  (This time, above 400), aiming for the party and its allies to secure a landslide, might have backfired. The opposition appears to have seized on the slogan, portraying the BJP as a dominating force set to reshape India with a massive majority.\n\"The opposition is using this slogan to say if they come with such huge majority, the BJP will change the constitution. And the opposition's narrative to empower poor and lower castes might have got some traction given there are high levels of economic anxiety evident in the pre-poll surveys,\" says Mr Verma. \"This might have provoked Mr Modi to take this narrative head on and give it a Hindu-Muslim twist.\"\nIs Mr Modi's divisive rhetoric a sign of desperation? \nNot really, says Mr Vaishnav. \"",
    "An Irish shipping company has stopped accepting freight that has travelled through Cherbourg because of issues caused by migrant stowaways.\nHyland Shipping, based in Dublin, told BBC News NI that it encountered \"unprecedented\" problems last week.\nCCTV footage from the company warehouse showed six men jumping from the inside of one trailer.\nManaging director Tino Hyland said there was evidence of stowaways in nine trailers last week.\nHe said all the vehicles had passed through the French port.\n\"They hide in the freight in the trailer, they tear stuff apart and climb down into boxes in order to hide themselves from a cursory glance of a security officer down in the port,\" he said.\nMr Hyland added that the damage to trailers and freight is costing the company and its customers thousands of euros.\n\"We're talking at least \u20ac10,000 (\u00a38,500) worth of damage to the freight in the trailer, in that one trailer, and then there was the damage to all the other trailers,\" he said.\nMr Hyland said many of the stowaways gain entry to trailers by cutting the heavy-duty exterior curtains, which then need to be \"replaced or repaired, depending on whether it's possible\". \nHe said further damage is then caused when the stowaways hide among goods in boxes inside the trailers.\nThe company director believes most of the stowaways disembark at ports before the freight arrives at their warehouse for distribution.\nBut, he said, the trailers and the goods are already damaged by the presence of migrants among the freight.\nThe decision to stop accepting freight through Cherbourg has resulted in additional travel costs for the shipping company, as well as delays for some of its customers on both sides of the Irish border.\n\"The alternative ferry is a lot more expensive, about 40% more expensive. You've got extra mileage involved but also, because the regularity of the ferry is less often, you're delaying freight,\" he continued.\nMr Hyland stressed that he has sympathy for migrants who are fleeing conflict or danger in other parts of the world, but he said the practice of hiding inside trucks is \"massively dangerous\" for stowaways.\n\"It's horrible for them,\" he added.\nIn addition, Mr Hyland said, it is very difficult for small companies to absorb the additional costs caused by damage to vehicles and freight.\nSecurity around Cherbourg has been increased in recent years to address issues arising from the global migration crisis, but Hyland Shipping believes its experiences last week highlight the ongoing challenges facing operators in the freight and shipping industry.",
    "Fiji's long-serving former prime minister Frank Bainimarama has been sentenced to a year in prison for obstructing a police investigation into corruption.\nBainimarama, 70, is one of the most high-profile politicians in the Pacific Islands, having led Fiji for more than15 years until he was voted out in 2022.\nOn the international stage he was also a leading representative lobbying for climate change action for vulnerable Pacific countries.\nHe was taken away in handcuffs after the High Court's ruling on Thursday.\nLast month he was convicted of perverting the course of justice during a police investigation into university fraud.\nProsecutors alleged he had told his friend, the former Fijian Police Commissioner, to drop a 2020 investigation into abuses of finances at the University of South Pacific which included alleged bonuses, promotions and pay rises to staff.\nBainimarama pleaded not guilty to the charges but a court in April found he and the police chief Sitiveni Qiliho had used their power to sideline the investigation at the university, one of the leading tertiary educations in the region.\nHe was initially spared a jail term last month at his sentencing when a lower court magistrate also ruled for his conviction to not be recorded.\nBut that verdict was challenged by Fiji's top prosecutors who launched an appeal.\nOn Thursday, the country's high court quashed the lower court's ruling and handed down prison sentences for both men.\nQiliho, who has been suspended from his role, was sentenced to two years in prison.\nOutside the court, supporters of Bainimarama who had gathered to hear the verdict sung hymns while governing politicians praised the verdict.\n\"The court case and sentencing shows... that people who break the law, doesn't matter who they are, they are brought to account,\" Unity Fiji party leader Savenaca Narube said.\nPolitical watchers have noted the timing of the criminal cases brought against Bainimarama.\nHe is facing several allegations of political abuse after losing the tight vote in December 2022 to current PM Sitiveni Rabuka, who led a coalition of parties. \nLast year, Bainimarama as an opposition leader was also suspended from parliament for three years after giving a speech where he criticised the new government. \nHis political party FijiFirst is standing by him. \u201cBainimarama will continue to be the leader of the FijiFirst party. Come 2026, we will deal with it,\u201d party senior Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum said according to local media reports.\nBainimarama, a former military commander, first seized power in Fiji in a 2006 bloodless coup. He retained office through winning democratic elections in 2014 and 2018.",
    "Bollywood is adored globally, but it has also faced criticism for being sexist and misogynistic.\nThat's something film and theatre maker Pravesh Kumar wants to change.\nKumar, who was born in Slough but spent a decade working in Bollywood, told BBC News he is using his new musical, Frankie Goes To Bollywood, as a way to shine a light on the Indian film industry's darker side.\n\"I think it's important to ask the really important questions,\" he said.\nThe problems of sexism and gender inequality run far deeper than just India.\nHollywood was at the centre of the #MeToo movement, which was sparked by allegations against Harvey Weinstein in 2017.\nThe disgraced film producer is facing a new trial in the autumn after his state rape conviction was overturned, a judge ruled last week.\n\"It's not just Bollywood, we know it's Hollywood too, this is just the story we're telling,\" British Asian actress Laila Zaidi told BBC News.\nThe musical is told through the eyes of a young actress from Milton Keynes who moves to India seeking stardom.\nBut once there, Frankie quickly becomes disenchanted by the industry. She is objectified and preyed on by men double her age. Older female actresses are cast aside, although older male actors are celebrated. Nepo-babies get ahead quicker and win awards.\nThe show is based on true stories.\nKumar worked for various big film houses and television production companies in India as an assistant director and writer.\nHe said he always loved the films growing up, but as he became older, became increasingly uncomfortable about what he was seeing on screen.\n\"You regularly see scenes where a 50- or 60-year-old man is romancing a girl less than half his age. And we're all complicit in that if we buy that ticket.\"\nHe described the industry as \"absolutely still sexist,\" adding: \"Bollywood cinema is still run by men, and it's for men.\"\nKumar says he wanted to depict these themes in his musical, to draw attention to them and drive change.\nHe also consciously portrayed a strong female character, in the protagonist Frankie, as part of the musical's message of female empowerment.\n\"I didn't want to make a fluffy Bollywood dance show,\" he said. \"All I can do, as an artist, is ask important questions. And if it is difficult, when you go back home, I want you to have a conversation about it because that's how change happens.\"\nThe musical has been well received by critics, with the Stage calling it \"witty and knowing\" and awarding it three stars.\nThe Salterton Arts Review, meanwhile, said it showcased \"all the best bits of Bollywood while calling for the problematic bits to change\".\nBollywood produces hundreds of films every year and has a huge following among Indians globally.\nBut many of its movies have been criticised for being regressive, and for portraying women in a negative and misogynistic way.\nOne recent film, 2023's Animal, faced a backlash from some critics, including in India. Scenes such as the one in which a female character is asked to lick a man's boots, and others portraying domestic and sexual abuse, sparked controversy. Despite this, it was a box office hit.\nLast year, a study revealed just how little gender equality there was in Bollywood - both on and off screen.\nResearchers from Tiss (Tata Institute of Social Sciences) in Mumbai concluded that though women-centric films give some reason for optimism, the box-office hits continue to be sexist and regressive and women and queer representation remains abysmal in them.\nAnupama Chopra, a film critic and Editor of Film Companion, based in Mumbai, said Bollywood is still sexist \"but so is every film industry in the world\".\nBut she said change is happening, driven in part by the MeToo movement which took off in 2017.\n\"Absolutely there is much more awareness and many more women in positions of power. So there is change. It's slow but it's definitely there.\"\nNandini Ramnath, a film critic at Scroll.in, also based in Mumbai, agreed that things are improving, even though there is still \"a long way to go\".\n\"The studios behind Hindi films, television shows and streaming series are packed with women, both in top positions as well as in influential decision-making departments,\" she said.\n\"There has been a broad shift in terms of representation. For instance, there is greater awareness that the item song, featuring a dancing woman surrounded by the hero and several men, is inherently sexist and completely unnecessary to the larger narrative.\n\"The item song hasn't disappeared, but we don't see as much of it as before, and some filmmakers have consciously dropped it from their productions.\"\nZaidi, who stars in the musical as Frankie, said she also hoped it would go some way towards helping confront the issues of sexism and gender pay disparity in Bollywood.\nShe said it was \"emotional\" acting the part of Frankie. \"All women and all people will be able to relate. The first time we did a run through, I was in tears.\"\nThe 30-year-old actress said the problems were no",
    "In Asia, discussing food is like discussing the weather - it can get people talking for hours.\nBut when the BBC recently visited one of the region\u2019s leading food and drink events, it became clear that there are some cuisines that leave even the foodies speechless.\n\u201cBritish food?\u201d asks one Thai woman with a perplexed pause. \u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure what that is. Is that, like, sausage?\u201d\nA Malaysian man nearby was less hesitant to offer his opinion: \u201cIt\u2019s boring! Definitely nothing special,\u201d he laughs.\nThese are sobering words for British exporters, who were promised easy access to lucrative new markets after Brexit.\nIn 2021, to give one example, former International Trade Secretary Liz Truss told UK food producers they had a \"golden opportunity\" to get British food \"to the top of the global food menu\".\nThe reality is that the UK still lags far behind its main European counterparts, both in terms of sales and reputation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a massive job educating people,\u201d says Stephen Jones, managing director of cheese exporters Somerdale International.\nFrom his stall at the FHA Food and Beverage Trade Show in Singapore, he introduces locals to strange-sounding cheeses such as Stinking Bishop, Double Gloucester and Wensleydale.\n\u201cThe French, the Swiss, the Italians - they\u2019ve been doing it a lot longer than we have. We're coming in fairly late getting that message across,\u201d he adds.\nSeeing groups of South East Asian visitors trying - and liking - Wensleydale for the first time certainly raises a smile. But the UK\u2019s small pavilion is dwarfed by Italy\u2019s show-stopping display, which is just around the corner.\nThere you find Michelin-starred chefs giving live cooking demonstrations, while the winner of Italian MasterChef chats away with her country\u2019s ambassador. For Italy, as well as being good for its economy, selling food to Asia has long been an act of diplomacy.\n\u201cDoing this kind of stuff is a major part of the job,\u201d says Dante Brandi, who has been the Italian ambassador to Singapore and Brunei since last year.\nSpeaking to the BBC under an Italian tricolour and the logo of his country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr Brandi explains how trade shows form part of the machinery of government.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an overall effort from what we call \u2018Sistema Italia\u2019\u201d, he says. \u201cThe group of institutions all aimed at promoting our food, gastronomy and way of life, which we spread through our diplomatic and consular network all around the world.\u201d\nHowever, it is clear that this kind of success is not achieved overnight. For example, panettone is now a Christmas fixture in Singaporean supermarkets. But the woman who originally introduced the festive treat to South East Asia says it took \"years of activities, tastings and promotions\" to eventually get it onto shelves here.\n\"Food is obviously a key export for Italy and something Italians are very proud of,\" says Giuseppina Pravato from Jupiter 57, an Italian delicatessen in Singapore.\n\"We have a great rapport with the Italian institutions, but 20 years ago it was basically just me, bringing in hundreds of pieces of panettone and literally just gifting them to whoever would try it,\" she adds.\nThe gulf between Britain and, in this case, Italy should not come as a surprise. To a large extent this is a long-term issue, which predates Brexit or the current UK government, and speaks to a country\u2019s fundamental economic priorities.\nLast year Italy exported more than \u20ac64.4bn (\u00a355.4bn; $69.1bn) worth of food and drink globally, while the UK sold \u00a324.4bn ($30.5bn). When you look at these numbers as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP), exporting food and drink is around three times more valuable to the Italian economy than it is to Britain's.\nMost British food exporters seem to take a pragmatic view of where they stand in the global food market. The issue, many argue, is that the government is not doing enough to match its rhetoric when it comes to changing the situation.\nIn fact, the UK delegation in Singapore told the BBC they were only able to attend because they paid out of their own pockets.\n\u201cSince 2019, we\u2019ve received no government money whatsoever to help us come to these kinds of shows,\u201d says Karen Beston from the Food and Drink Exporters Association.\n\u201cIt makes it very difficult to stand out against the other European groups or other world groups that are almost fully funded by their respective governments,\u201d she adds.\nWhen this was put to the UK government by the BBC, the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) said: \u201cPromoting the interests of our farmers and food producers is a priority of our trade policy\u201d.\nDefra also pointed out that - although suppliers do not receive any direct public money to help them attend trade shows - last year it spent \u00a31.6m on events to promote sales of British food, such as tastings and networking opportunities.\nCurrently, the UK exports \u00a33.5bn ($4.4bn) worth of food and drink to Asia, which is an increase of 18% since 2019.

    "A free bottle of wine has finally been claimed after being hidden in the privacy policy of a tax-focused think tank's website for three months.\nTax Policy Associates added the clause in February as an experiment, to see if anyone would actually read the full terms.\nThe non-profit organisation's head Dan Neidle shared the story in a tweet on X, formerly Twitter, saying the first person to spot it would get sent a \"bottle of good wine\".\nMr Neidle - who has previously reported on high-profile tax cases, including that of former Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi - told the BBC it was his idea to add the wine offer.\nThe business has recently changed the small print on its site after the eagle-eyed discovery.\n\"We know nobody reads this, because we added in February that we\u2019d send a bottle of good wine to the first person to contact us, and it was only in May that we got a response,\" a sentence in their privacy policy now reads.\nMr Neidle said it was \"my childish protest that all businesses have to have a privacy policy and no one reads it\". \n\"Every tiny coffee shop has to have a privacy policy on their website, it\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s money that\u2019s being wasted.\"\nAny company that holds personal data, including small businesses and charities, has to have a privacy policy, according to the Information Commissioner's Office.\nIt is a key requirement under the UK's General Data Protection Regulation 2018 (GDPR).\nMr Neidle said the person who spotted the passage on his website \"kind of cheated\" because they were trying to write their own policy and looking at examples. Then they emailed the organisation saying they guessed the bottle of wine was gone, but they were in luck.\nMr Neidle said he originally did something similar when his organisation first launched over two years ago. Back then it took four months until someone spotted it.\n\"We did it again to see if people were paying more attention and they\u2019re not,\" he added.\nAs for the \"good wine\" in question that the site referred to; the lucky recipient was sent a bottle of Ch\u00e2teau de Sales 2013/14, Pomerol as a reward.\nMr Neidle said his approach was inspired by one used by the band Van Halen, who would ask for a bowl of M&Ms with all the brown ones removed as part of their tour rider.\nIt was not because they were picky eaters though, they included it as a test to make sure promoters were paying attention to their requests, which often included complicated technical instructions.\n\u201cIt was a brilliant strategy to see if people were paying attention,\" Mr Neidle said.",
    "Donald Trump dictated his tweets and demanded capitals and exclamation marks, a former aide told his trial.\nMadeleine Westerhout said Mr Trump preferred her to take notes rather than write himself.

He denies the charges.\nGiving evidence for the prosecution Ms Westerhout, who was eventually fired by Mr Trump, recounted her tasks as her boss prepared to enter office in 2016 and during his time in the White House.\nMr Trump's top aide, Dan Scavino also had access to the @realDonaldTrump account, she said, but added that when he was absent, Ms Westerhout would occasionally help craft a tweet.\nMs Westerhout, whose desk sat directly outside the Oval Office while Trump was president, said he would sometimes have her print out draft tweets for him to edit by hand.\nThough he was an avid Twitter user, Mr Trump preferred to summon her and dictate his posts, she said.\nMs Westerhout said she would have to take notes, quickly type up the draft, and print it out for him.\nOccasionally Mr Trump would have more edits.

    "Five babies have died from whooping cough as cases continue to rise in England, health officials have announced.\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) reported 1,319 cases in England in March, after just over 900 in February, making the 2024 total nearly 2,800.\nIt fears this year could see lots of the bacterial infection. The last peak year, 2016, had 5,949 cases in England.\nThe infection can be particularly serious for babies and infants. \nHalf of cases seen so far this year have been in the under-15s, with the highest rates in babies under three months of age.\nThe five babies who died this year were all under three months old. These are the first deaths since 2019.\nOther parts of the UK and Europe are also seeing a rising number of cases.\nKnown as pertussis or \"100-day cough\", the infection is a cyclical disease with peaks seen every three to five years. \nUKHSA has said a steady decline in uptake of the vaccine and the very low numbers seen during the pandemic, as happened with other infections because of restrictions and public behaviour, were both factors in the rise in cases.\nThe agency said a peak year was therefore overdue.\nIn September 2023, the number of two-year-olds who completed their routine six-in-one vaccinations, which includes protection against pertussis, was 92.9%, compared with 96.3% in March 2014. \nUptake of the maternal pertussis vaccine, offered to women in every pregnancy, also dropped - from more than 70% in September 2017 to about 58% in September 2023.\nGetting vaccinated while pregnant provides some protection to babies in the first months of life.\nThe first signs are similar to a cold, with a runny nose and sore throat. \nAfter about a week, the infection can develop into coughing bouts that last a few minutes and are typically worse at night. \nYoung babies may make a distinctive \"whoop\" or have difficulty breathing after a bout of coughing.\nThe bacterial infections spreads through coughs and sneezes.\nPeople of all ages can catch whooping cough, but it is most serious for young children and babies.\nHealth experts are urging those not vaccinated to come forward to get the jab.\nChildren who have not been vaccinated can still get the jab up to the age of 10.\nVaccination does not provide lifelong immunity against the disease, but subsequent infections tend to be mild.\nDr Gayatri Amirthalingam, from UKHSA, said: \"Vaccination remains the best defence against whooping cough and it is vital that pregnant women and young infants receive their vaccines at the right time.\n\"Whooping cough can affect people of all ages, but for very young babies it can be extremely serious.\n\"Our thoughts and condolences are with those families who have so tragically lost their baby.\"\nProf Kamila Hawthorne, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said: \"It's highly concerning that such a high number of whooping cough cases have been confirmed.\n\"While whooping cough will be an unpleasant and uncomfortable experience for most patients, causing restless nights and leaving those affected with a shortness of breath, for some, it can be far more serious.\"",
    "Newcastle United's refusal to let Sports Direct sell next season's kit would see fans having to pay more for shirts, the retailer has claimed.\nThe firm, owned by former Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, is seeking an injunction on the Magpies' exclusivity deal with JD Sports.\nSports Direct has taken its case to the Court of Appeal after the Competition Appeals Tribunal found against them ahead of a a full legal trial at a date yet to be set.\nThe firm's lawyer Tony Singla KC told appeal judges the deal was \"anti-competitive\" but Newcastle United strongly rejected the claim.\n\nMr Singla said Newcastle\u2019s refusal to provide Sports Direct with the new Adidas kit would \"distort competition in the retail market and ultimately lead to consumers paying high prices\".\nHe said Newcastle\u2019s approach was \"an abuse\" of the club\u2019s \"dominant position\" in the market.\n\"Bluntly put, a Newcastle fan will not switch to buying an Arsenal jersey, even if faced with a price hike,\" he said.\nThe barrister told the hearing there was a \"complete lack of transparency\" over the JD Sports deal, which was done in October 2023 but which he claimed Sports Direct only learnt about in February.\nHe added \"home of football\" Sports Direct was \"the largest sportswear retailer in the UK\" with 488 stores, and had sold Newcastle\u2019s kit \"continuously for decades\".\nMr Singla also said Newcastle fans' \"alleged dislike\" of Sports Direct's majority shareholder Mr Ashley was \"massively overstated\" and many bought shirts from the retailer.\nHe said an injunction needed to be in place by 17 May to allow time for the delivery of the new Adidas manufactured kit before its expected launch on 7 June.\nThomas de la Mare KC, representing Newcastle United, said the Competition Appeals Tribunal reached a \"fully justified\" conclusion.\nHe said Sports Direct had in recent years \"enjoyed exclusive retailing rights\" with current Newcastle manufacturer Castore, which had \"no material distinction\" between the exclusivity now offered to JD Sports.\n\"Sports Direct in effect seeks an injunction to preserve the preferential arrangements put in place for it during the period when Mr Ashley owned both it and the club, even after his sale of the club,\" Mr de la Mare said.\nHe said competition would be \"preserved\", and added: \"Under the new arrangements there will be, at all times, three independent competing retailers, the club, Adidas and JD Sports.\"\nMr de la Mare said it was \"entirely fanciful\" to suggest an absence of kit at Sports Direct stores would make consumers less likely to return and buy other products.\nHe also said many Newcastle fans felt a \"deep and lasting antipathy\" towards Mr Ashley and Sports Direct as their relationship with the club's former owner was \"toxic\".\nMr de la Mare told judges the kit deal was \"nowhere close\" to an \"elimination of all competition\".\nThe hearing before Sir Geoffrey Vos, Sir Julian Flaux and Lady Justice Andrews, which is due to conclude on Thursday, continues.\nFollow BBC Newcastle on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "A California surf competition has been told it must allow a transgender woman to compete in the women's division or it will be in violation of state law.\nThe California Coastal Commission said surf competitions could \"not discriminate based on gender\".\nThe contest's organiser had announced that Sasha Jane Lowerson would not be allowed to compete in the Huntington Beach Longboard Pro.\nThe decision divided opinion, and received hundreds of responses.\nLowerson had entered the women's division of Saturday's competition in Huntington Beach, south of Los Angeles. She said she put herself forward because rules set by the International Surfing Association (ISA) allow transgender women to compete if they meet certain criteria around testosterone levels.\n\"I was really disappointed and surprised [at being excluded],\" she told the BBC. \"You can't cherry-pick the rulebook. If you're going to use the rulebook, you use all of it.\"\nTodd Messick, whose American Longboard Association organises the competition, had announced on 25 April that the contest would not allow transgender women to compete in the women's division, saying he wanted to \"offer an equal playing field for all athletes\".\nHe told the BBC he was \"surprised by the amount of anger\" that the decision generated, but added: \"What I found too is that there was a lot of people very appreciative of me speaking up.\"\n\"For me, I was trying to do the right thing. It wasn't something I ever expected to have to deal with really, not in our little longboard community,\" he said.\nLowerson - an Australian who previously won men's events in her home country - said she had encountered mostly positive attitudes in the world of competitive surfing when she began living as a woman.\n\"Three years ago I had just started my transition, and I made a phone call to Surfing Australia,\" she said. \"I was really well-received. They were very forthcoming on being inclusive and being progressive.\"\nSince transitioning, she has contributed to the development of guidelines adopted by Australia's national governing body allowing transgender women surfers to compete in some women's events.\nIn the US, the issue has proved more contentious. It is also under the spotlight in California, with Los Angeles due to host the Olympic Games in four years' time. \nLast year, the World Surf League (WSL) announced a new policy on transgender participation, which allows trans women competitors to compete in women's events if they maintain a testosterone level below a certain limit for at least 12 months. Some professional surfers, including well-known pro Bethany Hamilton, were critical of the new rule, which is based on a policy created by the International Surfing Association.\n\"Many of the girls currently on tour are not in support of this new rule, and they fear being ostracised if they speak up,\" Hamilton said at the time. \"Is a hormone level an accurate depiction of whether someone is male or female?\"\nReferring to Hamilton's views, Todd Messick, the longboard competition organiser, added: \"90% of the female surfers I spoke to are in agreement, but many haven't commented. It's that sensitive.\"\nSurfers like Hamilton who oppose transgender women participating in the women's event argue that they have an unfair strength advantage.\nLowerson, a longboarder, said she did not believe that was the case. \"It's not a race, it's about style, flow, grace. As a longboarder, it's more like ballet on a wave,\" she said, adding that she could prove her testosterone levels are below the required threshold.\nThe surfer said that despite the furore she would continue to enter women's events. \"I've inadvertently become a poster-child for trans women in surfing,\" she said. \"Not that I wanted to do that, but it just kind of happened.\"\n\"Sport is about community,\" she added. \"It's about sharing and having fun with other like-minded people, and the fact we're losing sight of that is really sad.\"\nAccording to the California Coastal Commission, local sporting events that do not allow transgender women to compete in female divisions could be shut down.\n\"Surf contests in state waters must be carried out in a lawful manner that does not discriminate based on gender,\" spokesman Joshua Smith told the BBC.\nA letter to the competition organisers from the coastal agency, seen by the BBC, said that a ban on transgender women from competing \"is not consistent with the public access, recreation and environmental justice policies of the Coastal Act\".\nTodd Messick said he was told that \"this went all the way to the California governor's desk\". The BBC has approached the office of Governor Gavin Newsom for comment.\nThere is no consensus between different sporting bodies on what rules should be in place for transgender competitors, and many have been wrestling with how to establish policies. \nThe international governing body for swimming, World Aquatics, has effectively banned transgender women from competing in top female swimming events. \nWorld cycling",

    "With the Chinese economy facing massive challenges, there have been concerns over its growth potential, at least in the immediate future.\nYet a key exception is emerging in the form of domestic tourism.\nLast week's five-day public holiday to mark labour day saw 295 million trips made within China, according to figures from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. This was 28% higher than pre-pandemic figures recorded in 2019.\nThe Transport Ministry's figures are also staggering: 92 million rail trips; almost 10 million air trips and 1.25 billion highway journeys.\nHowever, this comes as international arrivals continue to lag, with foreigners currently entering China at barely 30% of 2019 levels. Why the disparity?\nThe beautiful historical river town of Wuzhen, a short drive from Shanghai, is considered one of China's top visitor sites for travellers of all types. When we arrive the little pathways and old bridges which cross narrow waterways are filled with visitors.\nA popular thing to do in Wuzhen is to pose for photos dressed in traditional hanfu clothing - as if you have really been transported back hundreds of years.\nTwo women in their 20s, friends since high school, are visiting from Jilin Province in the north east. After arriving, they spend an hour getting their hair done in an elaborate imperial-era style - and they are full of praise for Wuzhen's classical beauty. \nWe ask if, following the post-Covid opening up, many of their family and other friends have been travelling much? \"Of course, after the pandemic, we're all visiting other places.\"\nNearby a local man who is selling ice-creams also says tourist numbers are \"not that bad lately\".\nAs good as before Covid? \"Almost the same,\" he replies.\nShopkeeper Wang Ying, who sells traditional snacks, echoes this sentiment with a big smile on her face. \"Business is going well, and it'll only get better.\"\nAll this will be seen as good news for the Chinese government. It's been saying that a push on domestic consumption can counter the significant faltering portions of the economy.\nMajor players in the once-mighty property sector are struggling to stay afloat, local government debt continues to rise, and persistent youth unemployment has left highly qualified university graduates uncertain of their future.\nAmid all these challenges, the Communist Party has set a target of \"around 5%\" GDP growth for this year. Apart from the fact that analysts have long questioned the veracity of the country's official growth figures, economists are also asking how such a target can be reached, in any genuine sense, in 2024 without significant extra stimulus.\nOne lifeline could be a more buoyant travel scene which could bring broader business opportunities and greater service industry employment.\nSchubert Lou, chief operating officer at travel agency Trip.com, told the BBC: \"We've seen very strong domestic travel demand with search volumes in hotels up 67% compared to last year, and flight volumes up 80%.\"\nTourism industry consultant Peng Han from Travel Daily is following the investment trail to see how the business community really views the possibilities in the sector.\n\"With famous international hotel brands - like Intercontinental, Marriott and Hilton - you just have to look at their growth in China in 2023,\" he says. \"Then check the performance goals for these large hotel groups in 2024 which have also been set relatively high. This shows that they are very optimistic about the growth potential of the Chinese market.\"\nBut, while the volume of local travellers might be up, Mr Peng does point to the problem of per capita consumption which remains persistently low.\nHe says general uncertainty about the Chinese economy is putting more emphasis on saving, so people are looking for good value options. They are going on holidays and paying for things but doing so much more frugally.\nThis is where an increase in big-spending foreigners could help. But they are simply not travelling to China in the numbers they used to. \nIn 2019, nearly 98 million international visitors came to the country. Last year it was only 35 million - including business trips, students and the like. Mr Lou describes the domestic versus international market as \"uneven\".\nFor many in the tourism industry here specialising in services for foreign travellers, \"uneven\" would be an understatement. Three years of harsh Covid prevention measures drove down arrivals from other countries, but that alone can't account for the current situation.\nHuang Songshan, the head of the Centre for Tourism Research in the School of Business and Law at Australia's Edith Cowan University, blames this weakness in part to \"the shifting geopolitical landscape globally\".\nIn the peer-reviewed East Asia Forum, he pointed to a 2023 survey carried out by the Pew Research Centre, writing that, \"Most individuals in Western nations hold unfavourable views towards China.

The Executive eventually agreed a compromise. \nMr Poots said it was an \"action of last resort\" as his fellow ministers were not willing to work together to find an agreed solution. \nThe former agriculture minister also raised concern about the level of missed cancer diagnosis during the pandemic. \nHe said up to 170 cancer screening were cancelled during that time along with 4,000 heart screenings. \n\"We should have been following the science which said we needed to prevent cancer but instead we closed down all the clinics which was unnecessary,\" he said. \nQuestioned about controversial tweets he posted raising concerns about Executive decisions, he said they were out of \"frustration\" and he wanted to put forward an alternative viewpoint. \nMr Poots also criticised Sinn F\u00e9in ministers for attending the funeral of republican Bobby Storey, which he said had \"diminished their roles\". \nBut he added he recognised the apology on Wednesday from former Sinn F\u00e9in Minister Car\u00e1l N\u00ed Chuil\u00edn over her attendance at the funeral. \n\"I commend her for making that apology,\" he said.\nJustice Minister Naomi Long also raised concerns about leaks during her evidence to the inquiry on Thursday.\nShe said leaks from Stormont Executive meetings created a sense of \"panic\" and made ministers appear \"incompetent\".\nShe also accused Sinn F\u00e9in ministers of undermining \"confidence in medical advice\" by pushing for schools to be closed at a time when the chief medical officer recommended they should remain open.\nNaomi Long also criticised DUP ministers for blocking moves by the health minister to extend lockdown restrictions in November 2020.\nShe described it as the Executive's \"low point\" during the crisis and said the search to find a compromise at the time was \"chaotic and embarrassing\" and involved lots of \"horse-trading\".\nMs Long said she often found out in news reports what was to be discussed before she received her ministerial papers.\nShe revealed that valid concerns raised by her and fellow SDLP Minister Nichola Mallon were \"batted\" away so as not to unravel the \"consensus\" between the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in agreed at a prior meeting.\nOn the debate around school closure in March 2020, Naomi Long said she disagreed with Sinn F\u00e9in ministers who argued for the immediate closure of schools.\nThat followed the decision by the Irish government to close schools on 12 March, four days ahead of the Executive meeting.\nAsked about a statement by the then-Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill calling for schools to close, Ms Long said it \"undermined confidence fundamentally\" as it went against advice received by the Executive for schools to remain open.\nBut Ms Long accepted the decision by the Irish government to close schools created a problem for those living in border areas and made the process more complicated for the Executive.\nFormer Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has said he was concerned that the Stormont executive could have collapsed in Autumn 2020, as ministers argued over whether to extend restrictions.\nHe told the Covid inquiry that \"it was really difficult\".\nMr Lewis was secretary of state from February 2020 until 2022.\nHe was asked for his view of relations within the executive in November 2020, when an executive meeting to decide on the level of Covid restrictions took four days to reach agreement.\n\"It wasn't about so much the decisions per se, it was about the process, papers coming late, people leaking things during the meeting.\n\"There was a real frustration with each other, it was a very, very difficult period.\"\nHe said it had become the \"public exposure\" of tensions that had been manifesting within the executive since the controversial funeral of republican Bobby Storey in June 2020.\nMr Lewis said the executive was also suffering at that stage from not having a head of the civil service, with the first and deputy first ministers at that stage unable to agree on an appointment.

    "Asylum seekers have said their lives are \"not safe\" having been told they are being sent to Rwanda as part of the government's plans.\nA Hull charity said 16 of them had been detained and sent to a detention centre without notice or formal warning.\nThe Home Office said it had begun detaining \"illegal migrants\" in preparation for the first flight to Rwanda in nine to 11 weeks.\nGainsborough MP Sir Edward Leigh said the move would keep migrants safe.\nOne of the 16 asylum seekers, who had been living in Hull, told the BBC he was being held at a detention centre near Heathrow, along with a friend, and both were facing deportation to the Central African country.\nThe asylum seeker, who wished to remain anonymous, said he \"cried really hard\" when he was told he would be flown out after \"suffering to come to this country\".\n\"We don't feel it is safe,\" he said.\n\"They don't tell me when they [will] send me to Rwanda. We still need to know about our situation and what's [going to happen].\"\nHe said he wanted \"freedom\" and was worried about his future.\n\"I was happy in Hull because I [thought] this is my country and I was playing football and I was learning in college.\n\"I'm angry. Today I've not eaten anything, nobody eat today because it is a bad situation. How will we eat when everybody's thinking what's happening in the future? What's happening tomorrow?\"\nHis friend, who also did not give his name and had briefly lived in Cottingham, East Yorkshire, also said he was worried about the \"bad situation\" he was facing and did not feel safe.\nShirley Hart, from Welcome House, a charity that supports refugees in Hull, said 16 young men including three footballers who play for Acorn FC - a team made up of asylum seekers and refugees living in Hull - had been rounded up with their phones taken from them.\n\"They went to sign on at the police station - a weekly requirement while waiting for refugee status - and they literally were detained, put into a detention van and sent down to a detention centre. \n\"Now they didn't know what was happening and initially we didn't know what was happening because they weren't allowed to come out and tell anybody.\"\nShe said the charity was formally alerted to their plight via a late night phone call to another refugee.\nOfficial documents revealed last week that contact has been lost with 3,557 of the 5,700 asylum seekers in the first group of migrants identified for removal to Rwanda.\nSir Edward, who has been against plans to house asylum seekers at former RAF Scampton, said asylum seekers should have no fears of being unsafe in Rwanda.\n\"We've got a close working relationship with Rwanda. We've had to meet numerous tests set by the Supreme Court. \n\"Let's be honest about this, it's a lot safer than what [they've] probably gone through already.\"\nThe Home Office said it did not routinely comment on individual cases and ongoing detentions.\nHowever, a spokesperson said: \"The first illegal migrants set to be removed to Rwanda have now been detained by highly trained teams, following a series of nationwide operations. \n\"We will get flights off the ground to Rwanda in the next nine to 11 weeks, creating the deterrent effect to help break up the people smuggling business model and stop the boats.\" \nFollow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

    "Even without a full-scale Israeli ground invasion, Rafah's medical facilities have been overwhelmed.\nMedics say more than a million people sheltering in the southern Gaza city are at risk of being deprived of healthcare after the Israeli military began a \"limited\" operation against Hamas on its eastern outskirts on Monday.\nThe largest of the city's three partially functioning hospitals, Abu Youssef al-Najjar, had to be hastily abandoned the following day after staff received an evacuation order and there was fighting nearby. \nThe hospital's dialysis department had been the only surviving one in Gaza, a lifeline for patients suffering kidney failure.\nThe Israeli advance has also cut off access to the nearby European Gaza Hospital in Khan Younis, where critical patients were being referred for surgery, as well as the nearby Rafah and Kerem Shalom border crossings.\nWith the Emirati maternity hospital in Rafah busy delivering dozens of babies each day, the Kuwaiti Specialist hospital is struggling to cope with a surge of emergency cases despite a lack of capacity, staff and equipment.\nOne doctor at the hospital, which before the war had only four intensive care beds, said the situation there was \"catastrophic in every sense of the word\".\n\"Unfortunately, the Kuwaiti hospital is a small hospital that does not have diagnostic capabilities,\" Dr Jamal al-Hams, its director, told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme. \"Even the X-ray machine is disabled due to the Israeli shelling and there are no spare parts for it, as the crossings are closed.\"\n\"And the CBC analysis device has stopped due to being overloaded,\" he added, referring to the complete blood count test used to diagnose and monitor numerous diseases.\nDr Hams said he and his colleagues were nevertheless having to treat people with complex trauma wounds, burns, fractures and crushed limbs.\n\"We have received some cases of torn abdomen and intestines, and cases of skull fractures with parts of the brain outside the skull,\" he recalled. \"Some cases have lost major parts of the buttocks, in addition to cases of amputation of the lower limbs at the foot area.\n\"These are unusual injuries caused by unusual weapons. I lived through all previous wars [in Gaza]... where injuries were always in a certain area and dealt with by one specialist. But now each case needs several specialists.\"\nHe also expressed anger at how doctors at al-Najjar hospital had been forced to evacuate both the facility and their family homes at such short notice.\nThe Israeli military told all residents of a number of eastern areas of Rafah to leave for their own safety on Monday and head towards an \"expanded humanitarian area\" stretching from nearby al-Mawasi to the central town of Deir al-Balah, where it said there would be field hospitals, tents and aid.\n\"Where should they go? Tents and other supplies were supposed to be provided in other safe areas. This has not been done,\" Dr Hams said. \nDr Youssef Abu al-Rish, undersecretary of the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, told Gaza Lifeline that Rafah's remaining medical facilities would no longer able to save the lives of many seriously wounded or ill patients.\n\"Rafah governorate does not have real medical services after the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital went out of service and people were unable to reach the European Gaza Hospital,\" he said. \n\"There are many field hospitals, but they cannot provide all these services as they do not have the necessary infrastructure or capabilities... For instance, they do not have dialysis services, oxygen-generating stations, intensive care departments or blood banks.\" \nHe added: \"The Kuwaiti Hospital is a small non-governmental hospital that cannot provide emergency services. But we are trying to enhance its capabilities.\"\nMedical aid group Project Hope said on Thursday that all of its clinics and mobile medical points in Rafah were closed, and that almost all of its staff had been evacuated, with many fleeing to Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah.\n\"Most aid services were based in Rafah. Now that people are further north, there is nearly no help. As long as the violence continues and the Rafah border crossing remains closed, more and more people will die from preventable causes,\" said Moses Kondowe, its Gaza team lead in Rafah.\nMr Kondowe said he expected to see malnutrition, pregnancy complications and other health conditions like Hepatitis A and cholera increase.\nHundreds of thousands of children sheltering in Rafah are already injured, sick, malnourished, traumatized or living with disabilities.\nM\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said on Wednesday that its teams had begun to discharge patients from Rafah Indonesian Field Hospital, where they helped provide post-operative care, and had suspended activities at its clinic in al-Shaboura - a move it described as \"catastrophic\".\nThe medical group also said it was handing over its activities at the Emirati maternity hospital to the Gaza health ministry. \nDr Abu al-Rish said th",
    "Israel's Eurovision contestant says \"nothing will deter\" her after getting booed during a dress rehearsal on Wednesday.\nEden Golan was performing her song Hurricane ahead of Thursday's semi-final in Malmo, Sweden.\nIn a statement, she said she was \"proud to represent my country\".\nThere have been several campaigns to block Israel from taking part in this year's contest following the outbreak of war in the Middle East, and thousands of people joined pro-Palestinian protests in the city on Thursday. \nBut the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which hosts the event, has ruled Israel is allowed to compete.\nAfter Wednesday's dress rehearsal, several videos surfaced on social media from audience members who had recorded Golan being booed by some members of the crowd.\nIsrael is currently engaged in a military campaign in Gaza, which they launched as a response to Hamas' cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October.\nAbout 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 34,840 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nIsrael is free to compete in Eurovision as it is a member of the EBU. \nSpeaking on Sunday, the deputy director general of the EBU, Jean Philip De Tender, said if you \"exclude Kan (Israeli public broadcaster) outside of these competition rules, that would have been a political decision, as such, which we cannot take\", because it considers itself as an apolitical organisation.\nHe added: \"We do understand the concerns and the deeply held views that many people have around the war in the Middle East and I think nobody can remain untouched by the profound suffering of everybody involved in that war.\"\nGolan was requested to change her original track, entitled October Rain, after it caused controversy.\nThe song was thought to allude to Hamas kidnapping and killing Israelis and was then changed to Hurricane, which was approved by the EBU.\nGolan's team say the 20-year-old has been confined to her hotel room after a series of threats against the Israeli delegation.\nThe Israeli Broadcasting Corporation, which organises the country's Eurovision entry, says it has complained to the EBU about the booing and asked it to prevent a repeat of the incident.\nEurovision organisers liaised with Swedish police to bring in reinforcements from Denmark and Norway, as they were expecting protests in the city ahead of Israel\u2019s semi-final performance.\nA heavy police presence has now arrived in the city, as demonstrators gathered with Palestinian and LGBTQ+ flags on Thursday afternoon.\nWhilst performances from musicians were taking place,  smoke canisters in the colours of the Palestinian flag were set off in the city\u2019s central square.\nProtestors have also been carrying signs displaying images of Gazan civilians who have been injured in the conflict.\nEurovision's 2023 winner Loreen told the BBC she understood why people were protesting.\n\"All of us are affected by what\u2019s going on [but] we don\u2019t know what to do, because it\u2019s such a complex situation,\" the Swedish singer said. \n\"Some react with aggression, some cry, some shut down. We are different in that way, so I understand where it [the protesting] comes from.\u201d\nBut Loreen argued that booing Golan was \"not fair\" and \"unconstructive\".\nElsewhere, organisers apologised on Tuesday after a semi-final performer displayed a pro-Palestinian symbol.\nFormer Swedish contestant Eric Saade, whose father is a Palestinian from Lebanon, wore a keffiyeh - a type of scarf commonly worn by Palestinians - on his arm.\nA spokeswoman for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said: \"The Eurovision Song Contest is a live TV show.\n\"All performers are made aware of the rules of the contest, and we regret that Eric Saade chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event.\"\nSaade later said on his Instagram story the scarf was \"just my way of showing a part of my origin... I got that keffiyeh from my dad when I was a little boy, to never forget where the family comes from\".\nFans were also warned not to bring Palestinian flags, symbols or bags into the audience at the Malm\u00f6 Arena.\nIsrael's participation has been one of the main talking points at this year's Eurovision.\nIreland's contestant Bambie Thug told reporters they were \"ordered\" to remove political gestures from an outfit ahead of the semi-final performance.\nTheir costume had originally included an ancient Celtic writing known as Ogham - which they said had spelt \"ceasefire\" and \"freedom for Palestine\".\nThe UK's entrant, Olly Alexander, has previously called for an \"immediate and lasting ceasefire\" in Gaza, but refused calls to boycott the event.\nIn December he signed a statement accusing Israel of genocide in the war \u2013 an accusation which Israel has vehemently rejected.",

    "A woman has shared how a school project uncovered their father's secret tale of survival after he was deported to a Nazi internment camp.\nJudith Tolcher revealed she first learnt her father Alf Priaulx spent time in the Laufen internment camp in Germany after his granddaughter asked for help with a school project in the mid-1990s.\nShe shared her father's story as part of 2024 Liberation celebrations marking the end of Occupation in Guernsey.\nSeveral precious mementos reveal details of how her father survived the ordeal after he was deported to Bavaria from Guernsey aged 21 in 1942.\nA photograph, a dog tag and an original letter telling him where and when Mr Priaulx should report for deportation are among the mementos.\nIt was a period the Canadian-born Guernseyman never spoke of until the end of his life.\nHis family said Mr Priaulx feared he would never survive.\nJudith said: \"My dad was born in Ontario, Canada, and this is one of the reasons he was deported to Laufen. \n\"It happened because, in late 1941, Hitler ordered the deportation as a reprisal for actions in Persia of non-island-born British residents of the Channel Islands.\"\nIn late 1942, two German officers and a policeman arrived at his house, but he was not at home. \n\"He said: 'If they want me, they will come and get me,' which is what they did,\" Judith recalled. \n\"They went back with a letter that said he had to report on 23 September 1942 at the cinema.\n\"As with lots of people who were involved in the occupation and deportation, we knew he had gone away but we never knew exactly what had happened. He would never ever talk about it.  \n\"It was never spoken about and my sister and I only found out about what had happened when his granddaughter Nicky was doing a project on World War Two at school and asked if he could give her some information.\"\nThe family would discover Alf was the among the second group to arrive at the camp, where he would remain until the end of the war in 1945, battling ill-health and unsanitary conditions. \nJudith said: \"When they arrived, all the first group were standing at the gate and they all did a thumbs down.\n\"He said that wasn't what they wanted to hear or see, and talked about the toilet facilities...

    "Delving into salacious details of an alleged sexual encounter in a Nevada hotel suite with Donald Trump, adult-film star Stormy Daniels provided Manhattan prosecutors with helpful - but sometimes irrelevant - context. \nMr Trump has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges of falsifying business records in relation to a hush-money payment made to Ms Daniels. He also denies having sex with her.\nOne of the most eagerly awaited witnesses of the trial, her appearance in the Manhattan courthouse Tuesday and Thursday proved dramatic. \nBut whether her at times long-winded testimony significantly boosted prosecutors' case is unclear. \n\"She was a very sensational witness. There was a lot of evidence that came out that was wholly irrelevant,\" said former Manhattan prosecutor Diana Florence. \n\"But at the end of the day, she adds context to the story.\"\nTaking the stand in a modest look with her hair clipped back, Ms Daniels got off to a rocky start Tuesday. \nHer meandering responses to prosecutors prompted criticism from Justice Juan Merchan, who later told the court that some of it \"would have been better left unsaid\". \nMr Trump, meanwhile, sat hunched over in his seat - his son Eric just two rows behind him - as Ms Daniels aired lurid details about their alleged meeting.\nThe details included Mr Trump greeting her in silk pyjamas at his hotel suite, and her claim that he did not wear a condom when they allegedly had sex. \nThe testimony prompted Mr Trump's lawyers to lodge two mistrial requests, which Justice Merchan denied. The judge had asked prosecutors to tread carefully when probing the specifics of the alleged sexual encounter. \nBBC News reporters are in the Manhattan courtroom covering the historic first criminal trial of a former US president. You'll find their updates and analysis on the BBC news website and app, and across TV, radio and podcasts.\nBut ultimately, Ms Florence said, the day in court amounted to a \"side show\" that had little to do with the heart of the case: whether Mr Trump broke the law by classifying reimbursements for Ms Daniels' hush-money payment as \"legal expenses\". \nWhile the hush-money payment itself was not illegal, prosecutors allege he tried to cover it up to save his 2016 presidential election bid. \n\"It doesn't really matter whether they had intercourse or not,\" Ms Florence said, adding that Ms Daniels' testimony \"went on too long.\" \nStill, the material made for a tense couple of days in court, including on Thursday, as a defiant Ms Daniels went head-to-head with a forceful Trump attorney, Susan Necheles. \nMs Necheles worked to damage Ms Daniels' credibility by accusing her of making up the alleged sexual encounter. \nAt one point, Ms Necheles claimed Ms Daniels had made up the story just like the screenplays she wrote for the adult films she starred in. \n\"The sex in those films was very much real, just like what happened to me in that [hotel] room,\" a frustrated Ms Daniels responded. \nHer response was a \"mic drop\", said former Manhattan prosecutor Jeremy Saland. \n\"She hit back hard,\" he said. \nAt another point, Ms Necheles accused Ms Daniels of lying about not actually eating dinner at Mr Trump's hotel suite on the night of the alleged sexual encounter. \n\"Your words don't mean what you say, do they?\" she told Ms Daniels. \nMs Daniels stuck to the broad facts of her story. \n\"You're trying to trick me into saying something that's not entirely true,\" she told Ms Necheles later on. \nMs Necheles kept swinging, portraying Ms Daniels as a money-hungry woman who fabricated details. \nThe strategy may have been too aggressive for a witness who had an \"air of truthfulness\", Mr Saland said. \n\"She came across as very strong, and I think the defence did a poor job \u2026 in really trying to dehumanise her,\" he said. \nWith their cross-examination, Mr Trump's legal team also may have inadvertently helped the prosecution's case, experts said.\nWhile grilling Ms Daniels, the defence demonstrated exactly why Mr Trump would have tried to conceal the sex scandal before the election - to avoid association with a witness the defence team portrayed as ''tawdry,'' Ms Florence said. \n\"It was a side show at the trial - and it would've been a main event just before the election,\" she said. \nThough Ms Daniels appeared more composed during her second day of cross examination, her testimony at times aired bizarre details about her life. \nOn one occasion, Ms Necheles -  to damage Ms Daniels' credibility - started pressing her for details on a television show she made about \"talking to ghosts\".\nMs Daniels explained that the show involved investigating ghosts at her haunted Louisiana home. In the end, though, it was just a \"giant opossum that was under the house\", she testified. \nBut the story also veered away from the business records that are key to the case.\nStill, Mr Saland said, Ms Daniels' candid answers helped set up Mr Trump's motivation for the reimbursement of the hush money - and his alleged illegal cover up. \n\"It w",
    "An increase in business rates in Wales has created a \"perfect hurricane\" for hospitality and retail firms, an industry body has warned.\nSince April, the Welsh government\u2019s discount on business rates for the sectors has been cut, with high street traders facing bigger bills.\nUK Hospitality Cymru said rising costs had left some businesses \"on the edge\".\nThe Welsh government said it continued to offer business rates relief, with only one in five paying the full bill.\nTraders in Bangor, Gwynedd, said the rising costs were beginning to bite.\n\"We've got the longest high street in the whole of the UK, and it's one of the emptiest high streets in the whole of the UK,\" said clothes designer and upholsterer Sophia Ingham.\nSince last July she has run her Phia shop in the Deiniol shopping centre, but expects to have to close this summer in a move that would be \"entirely down to the rate increase\".\nIt will be the latest business in Bangor to close its doors.\n\"Most of the shops are closed or boarded up,\" Ms Ingham said. \nShe called on the government to cut rates completely \"to help rejuvenate the high streets, rather than terminate them\".\nBusiness rates, sometimes known as non-domestic rates, are a tax based on the rateable value (RV) of the property being used. \nThe Welsh government body Business Wales says they are calculated by taking that RV and multiplying it by a set amount. This is fixed by the Welsh government and in this financial year is 0.562.\nSo, for example, a business premises with a \u00a315,000 RV will have it multiplied by 0.562, which means a a rates bill of \u00a38,430.\nThe rates are collected by local authorities and paid into a Welsh government national fund. \nThe Welsh government determines what discounts, or relief, certain businesses are entitled to.\nIn April the amount of relief fell from 75% to 40% for retail and hospitality businesses. Similar businesses in England continue to get 75% relief.\nThe Welsh government said it was still offering retail and hospitality sectors the equivalent of \u00a378m in discounts on their business rates.\nBut the body representing hotels, pubs and restaurants said the sector was under huge financial strain.\n\"It's not just a perfect storm, it's a perfect hurricane,\" said David Chapman, executive director of UK Hospitality Cymru.\n\"We've had compulsory closure with Covid, we've had high levels of energy prices, high levels of inflation on food and drink. We've not got any cash reserves, we're paying back Covid loans.\n\"The only support that we had was business rate relief, and that's been cut away from us,\" he said.\nMr Chapman urged the Welsh government to restore the relief to its previous level, which would match the discount on offer in England.\nAndria Thomas runs the Dot clothing shop in Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, where she sells imported European fashion brands to customers in the rural market town.\nShe said the increase in her business rates was \"a little bit unfair\" when similar shops in England pay a lower rate.\n\"We\u2019re having to pay more than what [businesses] across the bridge in England are having to pay, where our running costs are probably very equal,\" she said.\nMs Thomas also sells clothing online, but wants to stay on the high street.\n\"Every extra cost impacts on how much profit you can make. And obviously, as much as I want to continue having bricks and mortar and a window shopfront, the running costs for online are cheaper and cheaper.\n\"So having business rates at a reduced cost is a massive influence to helping us locals to stay local.\"\nThe Welsh government said it was doing \"all we can, with the resources and powers available to us\" to provide support to businesses.\n\u201cWe provide a range of permanent non-domestic rates reliefs for businesses, worth \u00a3250m a year and fully funded by the Welsh government.\n\"This includes small business rates relief, which supports ratepayers for around 70,000 properties across Wales, of which more than two-thirds pay nothing at all.\n\"We are providing additional non-domestic rates support worth \u00a3134m in 2024-25. This includes a fifth successive year of support for retail, leisure and hospitality businesses with their rates bills, at a cost of \u00a378m, building on the almost \u00a31bn of support provided in rates relief to these sectors since 2020-21. \n\"Only one in five properties are liable for their full bill this year.\"",
    "Hundreds of people evacuated from their homes while Army bomb experts removed \"a number of suspicious items\" from an address have been allowed to return.\nAbout 130 properties were cleared and a 100m (328ft) cordon put in place around an address in Brierley Road, Grimethorpe, on Wednesday morning.\nSouth Yorkshire Police later reduced the cordon to just three houses.\nA 58-year-old man and a 57-year-old woman were both arrested on suspicion of offences under the Firearms Act.\nA police spokesperson said the woman was later further arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs.\nThe force said the incident was not terrorism-related.\nEmergency services, including the Army's bomb squad, were called to the street in Barnsley after a warrant was carried out in the early hours of Wednesday.\nThis led to a number of \"suspicious items\" being removed and \"made safe\", the force added.\nNo details of the items recovered have been released.\nThose forced to evacuate were initially told the cordon was expected to be in place for 72 hours, with a rest centre set up at St Luke's Church.\nHowever, the cordon was reduced at about 22:15 on Wednesday.\nSearches at the three properties which remained cordoned off on Thursday were expected to continue for a further 24 hours, police said.\nAccording to the Press Association, police activity was focussed on a disused church building and adjoining house, which had been in the process of being renovated for a number of years.\nReverend Canon Paul Cartwright said volunteers from  St Luke's had offered food and drink to people displaced, with one person being given overnight accommodation.\n\"Grimethorpe's a fantastic community, we've always looked after each other,\" Mr Cartwright said.\n\"Actually, the best came out yesterday.\"\nAssistant Chief Constable David Hartley said: \"I would like to again express my gratitude and thanks to the local residents for their continued understanding and support.\n\"This would have been a distressing and disruptive incident for everyone affected.

    "John Swinney has confirmed that the SNP's strategy for independence is still based on winning a majority of seats at the forthcoming general election.\nThe new first minister has told BBC Scotland News that winning a majority would be a mandate for another referendum and he would \"proceed with urgency\" as Scotland could only \"move on\" if it became independent. \nHe has also denied that the decision to abolish the minister for independence post in his government has placed the campaign on the backburner.\nHe said he was going to concentrate on making sure his party built the support for independence by concentrating on issues such as the cost of living and Brexit.\nThe news of Mr Swinney's decision to scrap the independence minister post came as the first minister announced his new government on Wednesday.\nJamie Hepburn, who held the post, has taken over as minister for parliamentary business.\nMr Swinney was speaking to the BBC on Thursday, after his first session of First Minister's Questions.\nHe said he would concentrate his efforts on \"winning the arguments and building support\" for independence.\nHe said the cost of living and Brexit are examples where Scotland is being held back by a Westminster government.  \nBut he declined to answer whether failure to secure a majority would mean he lacked public support for another referendum, saying he would not answer hypotheticals.\nMr Hepburn earlier denied that independence had been downgraded in the government\u2019s list of priorities despite his post being abolished.\nHe told BBC Scotland News that \"every Scottish government minister is a minister for independence and that will remain the case.\" \nHe added: \u201cIndependence is going to be front and centre of our mission - it always has been - and the work will continue.\"\nHowever the move has been criticised by some independence campaigners outside the party. \nGordon MacIntyre-Kemp, founder of pro-independence campaign group Believe in Scotland, said the move sent \u201cthe wrong signal to a lot of people\u201d.\nHe called for Mr Swinney to declare himself the minister for independence, and for all ministers to put the case for independence \u201cfront and foremost\u201d whenever they announce new policies.\nMr MacIntyre-Kemp said: \u201cIf he takes personal responsibility for it he can send the right message on independence.  We\u2019re saying step up, double down on independence and send that message out.\u201d\nMr MacIntyre-Kemp said such a move would get grassroots independence supporters  \u201cworking in harmony\" with the SNP.\nGraeme McCormick, the former SNP leadership challenger who stood aside for John Swinney, said that it was \"right\" not to involve the civil service in any way.\nHe added:  \"I envisage that this work will be taken forward with greater alacrity.\"\nA central part of Mr Hepburn\u2019s role was overseeing the publication of the government\u2019s Building a New Scotland papers \u2013 first launched by Nicola Sturgeon in June 2022 to make the case for independence.\nThe latest of the papers, on the justice system in an independent Scotland, was published on 25 April, the same day Mr Yousaf\u2019s power-sharing deal with the Scottish government collapsed.\nThe cabinet secretary for the constitution, Angus Robertson will retain oversight of the issue.\nThe Scottish government said this would involve publishing further papers in the Building a New Scotland series.\nMr Swinney declined to answer whether he would open up discussions with any future Labour government on the Gender Recognition Reform Bill.\nThe Conservative government blocked the Scottish Parliament's bill from becoming law in 2023.\nThe first minister said he would \"wait and see\" what the political landscape was like.

    "Bin collections and housing repairs could be delayed in Flintshire after a company providing the council's bin lorries and vans went into administration.\nFlintshire council outsourced\u00a0the supply and maintenance of its fleet of more than 400-plus vehicles to Essential Fleet Services in 2016 in a bid to save money.\nThe firm, which changed its name to Go Plant Services, announced last week that it had\u00a0gone into administration.\nThe council said services were running as normal, but that future disruption was \"inevitable\".\nThe council\u2019s initial seven-year contract with the firm ended last year and was originally allowed to expire without a new deal being struck.\nHowever,\u00a0a\u00a0temporary extension of six months was given in late October after concerns were raised that\u00a0failing to reach an agreement would have led to bin collections coming to a halt.\nThe authority\u2019s\u00a0monitoring officer Gareth Owens admitted at the time that it would have resulted in all of its vehicles being taken away, including bin lorries and housing repair vans.\nOfficials said more time was needed to hold discussions with the company over a new long-term arrangement due to uncertainty surrounding inflationary cost pressures.\nFollowing the company entering administration, the council has reported that services are running normally, but has warned of the possibility of future disruption as it looks to find alternative vehicles.\nChief executive Neal Cockerton said: \u201cFlintshire county council is aware that Go Plant Fleet Services Ltd, who provided fleet management services to the council, have entered administration.\n\u201cWe are in discussions with the administrators to resolve matters. Currently services remain as normal.\n\u201cWe are engaged with local and national suppliers to ensure the continuity of services, however, some disruption may be inevitable during the period of transition.\u201d\nJoint administrators Mike Denny and Jonny Marston, of Alvarez and Marsal, completed the sale of several depots owned by Go Plant Limited last week.\nHowever, the future of the fleet services element of the business remains uncertain.\nThe pair blamed challenging conditions, including cost pressures and a subdued UK housebuilding market, for the company entering administration.\nA spokesperson for the joint administrators said: \u201cWe are working closely with Flintshire council to try to ensure continuity of frontline services in the area and to minimise any disruption.\u201d",
    "The NHS continued to give patients infected blood after virus screening had been introduced in the UK. \nScreening, including for hepatitis C, began in September 1991 but there was no process to stop old, contaminated blood being used.\nBBC News has learned untested and potentially contaminated blood could have been stored for up to 10 years. \nWe have identified patients infected after 1 September 1991, who are currently unable to claim compensation.\nSchemes for victims to claim financial compensation are only open to those treated with infected blood prior to the introduction of routine virus screening. \nLawyers have told BBC News the rules about eligibility should be changed. \nCaz Challis was diagnosed with cancer in 1992 and received several blood transfusions over the next 12 months. In 1993, she was diagnosed with hepatitis C before undergoing a stem cell transplant.\nThe NHS trust where she was treated has confirmed the virus came from blood she received during her cancer treatment. \nShe is one of many victims who are not eligible for compensation. She says she has been left \"fighting for every crumb\" and feeling \"that you don't count\".  \nBeatrice Morgan, a solicitor at law firm Leigh Day, represents more than 300 infected blood victims. She is calling for compensation schemes to be extended to those who received infected blood beyond the date routine screening was introduced.\n\"Although there was a national rollout of testing of new donations from 1 September 1991, blood that was already in the system wasn't tested,\" Ms Morgan says. \"We have evidence to show that there was untested blood that slipped through the net.\" \nThe infected blood scandal is one of the biggest treatment disasters in NHS history - 3,000 people who were infected with HIV and hepatitis C after being given contaminated blood and blood products have died.\u202f\nMany victims were haemophiliacs and were given infected blood products as part of their treatment. But thousands more were given transfusions using contaminated blood after accidents, emergencies or childbirth.\nAfter years of campaigning by victims, the Infected Blood Inquiry was announced in 2017. Led by former judge Sir Brian Langstaff, it heard evidence between 2019 and 2023.\nDuring hearings at the inquiry, several doctors confirmed untested blood remained within the NHS supply after virus screening began. \n\"There was quite a lot of uncertainty about what we were doing,\" Dr Frank Boulton, who was working in the west of England at the time, said. \"I did feel a little bit nervous about the chance of HCV [hepatitis C] emerging amongst some of our recipients.\"\nGiving evidence, blood expert Professor Marcela Contreras told the inquiry that in some parts of the country there was blood in the system which had not been tested for viruses, including HIV, until as late as October 1995. Some rare blood groups \"could be frozen for 10 years\", she added.\nConcerns about remaining untested blood product stocks in the system being administered to patients had been raised by doctors before screening was introduced.\nIn February 1991, Dr John Cash, from the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service, wrote a letter to Dr Harold Gunson, who at the time was director of the National Blood Transfusion Services.\nHe asked when a decision would be made about whether existing blood stocks would be tested, noting: \"The task is doable but formidable.\"\nNo national policy was ever announced and testing was piecemeal, if it happened at all. \nDuring the Infected Blood Inquiry, Sir Brian Langstaff noted some old blood donations were not tested, saying: \"If it's right, it may have repercussions for the accuracy of the start date [of the compensation schemes].\"\nThe inquiry into the wider infected blood scandal will conclude on 20 May.\nBBC Wales Investigates: Blood Money\nHow did 3,000 people lose their lives to deadly diseases in blood?

    "A nursery worker denied she \"persecuted\" a nine-month-old baby who died in her care.\nKate Roughley, 37, found Genevieve Meehan unresponsive on 9 May 2022 at Tiny Toes in Cheadle Hulme, Stockport.\nThe prosecution alleged the she \"allowed her dislike to manifest\" as the child was left \"virtually immobilised\" on a beanbag for 90 minutes before she died.\nMs Roughley denies manslaughter and an alternative charge of child cruelty.\nGenevieve's parents, John Meehan and Katie Wheeler, were at Manchester Crown Court on Thursday as the jury was shown CCTV footage from the day the baby died. \nThe jury, which was also shown footage from the baby room from May 5 and 6, was told Genevieve was subject to \"illogical and disturbing hostility\". \nPeter Wright KC, cross-examining, told the court that whatever the child \"did or didn't do\" it was \"never going to be satisfactory\" for Ms Roughley. \n\"You allowed your dislike of a nine-month-old child to manifest itself in ill-treatment that you meted out to her,\" he added. \nMs Roughley, from Heaton Norris, Stockport, denied the claims as Genevieve's parents sat behind her in court.\nShe said: \"I would never not like a nine-month-old baby. So to say I disliked her is far from the truth.\"\nMs Roughley rejected the suggestion the CCTV footage showed Genevieve was in distress. \nThe prosecution said the youngster died from a combination of asphyxia and pathophysiological stress after the defendant placed her face down, tightly swaddled and strapped to a beanbag.\nIt is alleged she then ignored the cries and distress of Genevieve, and showed \"sporadic\" and \"fleeting\" interest in her wellbeing, for 97 minutes.\nMr Wright told Ms Roughley that the footage shown the child \"moving violently\" and in distress.\nMs Roughley said she did not see Genevieve in \"discomfort and distress\" on the beanbag, and her position was how she went to sleep \"previous times at the nursery\".\nMs Roughley told the court she and other members of staff would often engage with children by singing rhymes to them.\nBut Ms Roughley was then asked by the prosecution: \"What rhymes with 'whinger' or 'diva', or other such remarks you have made to her?\"\nShe replied: \"I would not say diva is malicious. \n\"It's just when children are showing their personality off. \n\"Genevieve would not have been the only child I would have called a diva.\n\"Often we would say to children 'stop whingeing'. \n\"This was not shouted at the children or said in any malicious way. \n\"They were just passing comments through the working day.\"\nWhen asked if she believed Genevieve's death was avoidable, Ms Roughley said if she checked on her a \"couple of seconds or minutes earlier it may have been different\". \nBut she added the baby girl was sleeping on the beanbag \"like many children had done before\".\nShe told the court she felt responsible for Genevieve being in her care that day but added: \"I don't feel my actions were the reason for the death.\"\nThe trial continues. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "The girlfriend of an Australian surfer murdered in Mexico received a heart-rending voicemail shortly before he died, she has revealed. \nCallum Robinson, 33, was traveling with his brother Jake and a US friend, Jack Carter Rhoad, when the trio were murdered near the town of Ensenada.\nA Mexican man has been charged in their disappearance and reportedly has confessed. \nAuthorities believe the victims were killed while resisting a robbery. \nOn Instagram, Callum's girlfriend Emily Horwath shared the last voicemail he left her, which began with the words, \"happy Tuesday!

Mexican authorities have said murder charges will also be filed in the case. \nThe suspect, who can only be described under Mexican law by his first names, Jes\u00fas Gerardo was detained along with his girlfriend and another man.\nIn court on Wednesday, the girlfriend - who has yet to be charged with a crime - said that Jes\u00fas had come to her home on 28 April and confessed to having murdered \"three gringos\".\n\"I killed them,\" she said he told her. \nThe crime, near the well-worn tourist and surfer town of Ensenada, has shocked the community, which has long been considered an oasis of calm in the notoriously violent state of Baja California. \nProtesters, some carrying surfboards bearing slogans demanding more to be done to ensure safety on local beaches, marched through the city on Sunday.

    "A Virginia school board has approved a motion for two schools to revert to their Confederate names following a debate that bitterly divided a town.\nThe Shenandoah County School Board voted 5-1 to reinstate the names of Stonewall Jackson High and Ashby-Lee Elementary in Quicksburg.\nCommunity members had been pushing for a reversal, arguing the 2020 name change was unpopular.\nThe vote marked the first such U-turn anywhere in the US.\nA large crowd flocked to the school board's public meeting on Thursday to listen to a series of arguments from residents on both sides of the issue.\nFollowing the May 2020 murder of George Floyd and a summer of racial justice unrest, Virginia and other states took down Confederate statues from public spaces.\nIn a letter to school board chairs across the state, then-Democratic Governor Ralph Northam said: \"It is time to change school names and mascots that memorialize Confederate leaders or sympathizers.\"\nThe Shenandoah County School Board took action three days later, moving to rename Stonewall Jackson High as Mountain View High, and Ashby-Lee Elementary as Honey Run Elementary.\nThe schools were named after Confederate generals Robert E Lee and Stonewall Jackson, and cavalry commander Turner Ashby.\nIn doing so, the six-member panel also approved a resolution condemning racism and affirming its \"commitment to an inclusive school environment for all\".\nBut some critics slammed the renaming effort as a hasty and undemocratic move, and have since attempted to restore the schools' Confederate names as local elections reshaped the school board. \nA 2022 vote on the matter failed by a tied 3-3 vote - but the three who voted against the move have since been replaced on the school board.\nIn April, a local conservative community group, the Coalition for Better Schools, brought up the request again, pointing to citizen surveys it conducted that \"indicate overwhelming support for this restoration\".\n\"These groups hold historical significance,\" the group wrote in a letter to the school board, and \"revisiting this decision is essential to honor our community's heritage and respect the wishes of the majority.\" \nAccording to local media, the group says it will raise private funds to cover expenses related to the name reversal, such as changing school signage.\nIts effort is drawing attention across the state, with the Virginia chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), a civil rights organisation, urging the school board in a letter on Wednesday to \"use your power in a way that positively impacts all your district's children and their families\".\nNeil Thorne, a local resident campaigning against the U-turn with a group called Claim the Names, warned \"it will indelibly damage our community's reputation\".\nMinority members of the community still recall when Stonewall Jackson High was \"whites-only\" and they had to be bussed to schools in adjacent counties, he said.\n\"The naming of these schools was not incidental but reflected the segregated policies of the time,\" he said in a statement.\n\"The people who suffered through this are not past strangers - they are people we know, they are our friends and neighbours.\"\nShenandoah County, in northern Virginia, was once a stronghold of the pro-slavery South, with its ample valley providing food, security and transportation advantages.\nDuring the US Civil War, Confederate forces waged several successful military campaigns against the Union army there.\nThe county is now home to more than 44,000 people, and is predominantly white. \nBlack residents often live and work in towns where Confederate flags are displayed on front porches. Many of those who fly the banner defend it as a celebration of heritage, not a symbol of hatred.",
    "A detection dog has joined the fight to save seabirds on Rathlin Island.\nWoody, the two-year-old Fox Red Labrador, will help trace any remaining ferrets on the island.\nThe ferrets pose a threat to puffins and other seabirds for which the island is renowned for. \nTraps were deployed in October 2023 in the first stage of a world-first plan to eradicate ferrets and rats.\nThe team behind the LIFE Raft project hopes the complete removal of both invasive species will protect internationally-significant bird populations.\nBoth ferrets and rats prey on the eggs and young of the vulnerable bird species that use the island\u2019s cliffs for breeding.\nAlmost 100 ferrets have been trapped and humanely destroyed in the first stage of the project.\nIn September 2024 more than 6,000 bait stations will be laid across the island, in a final effort to make Rathlin free from these invasive non-native species.\nThousands of people visit the island every year to witness the spectacle of birds including puffins nesting on the cliffs.\nBut just one in three puffin chicks, or pufflings, survived last year with the predators playing a role.\nTourism is critical to the economy of the island and the chair of the Rathlin Community Development Association, Michael Cecil, said that made the LIFE Raft project important to everyone.\n\u201cProtecting the wildlife means protecting a whole way of life, as well as securing the livelihoods of many of the people who live here,\" he added.\n\"This project has the potential to protect the future of this historic island.\u201d\nThose behind the project are confident they are on the verge of the first ever removal of ferrets from an island.\nFieldwork Manager Michael Rafferty said everyone on the island was excited to welcome Woody.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been no easy feat attempting a world-first eradication, and we knew we needed the best dog for the job to get us over the finish line.\n\u201cWoody's ludicrous energy levels, uncanny sniffing skills, and goofy grin ticked all our boxes.\u201d\nMichael will be Woody\u2019s handler as he begins his first stint on the island.\nThe dog is touring the island first to get used to his new surroundings, before being deployed to see if he can find any remaining ferrets.\nThen he will undergo retraining for the second phase of the project which will focus on brown rats.\nNatasha Woollon trained the Red Fox Labrador pup in England.\n\u201cWoody is a lovable rogue, he is an absolute fool, he\u2019s lovely.\n\u201cA perfect detection dog, he\u2019s got detection drive, hunt drive so he\u2019s just really easy to train and really lovely to train as well.\u201d\nAhead of the next phase to eradicate rats, islanders are also playing their part.\nResidents like Teresa McCurdy are clearing out sheds and barns, making sure there is nothing that would give a rodent a hiding place. \nShe is delighted with the progress of the project and the difference it will make to island life, with one benefit in particular\n\u201cPeople will be able to keep chickens and have their own eggs again.\u201d\nThe \u00a34.5m LIFERaft project is funded by EU LIFE, National Lottery Heritage Fund, Garfield Weston Foundation and DAERA.\nAfter it ends in 2026, it is hoped Woody will play a part in monitoring biosecurity to help prevent any non-native species returning to the island.",
    "One of the most common types of mosquito has been identified for the first time in locations across Scotland, according to researchers at the University of Glasgow.\nThey found 16 types of mosquito in Scotland, including the Culex pipiens, which is prevalent in North and South America, parts of Europe and some areas of Asia and Northern Africa.\nProf Heather Ferguson, who has been leading the study, said they were surprised to find the insects in all corners of the country.\nShe warned that warmer temperatures could lead to larger numbers of mosquitoes, including ones from areas where they can transmit diseases.\nWhile Scots have long been pestered by swarms of midges, which thrive in the warm and wet conditions of a Scottish summer, there has been little knowledge about how widespread mosquitoes are north of the border.\nMosquitoes are larger than midges and have a proboscis with which they suck blood.\nThis means mosquitoes are feared across the world as carriers of deadly diseases such as dengue and Zika.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 219 million people contract malaria from mosquitoes each year globally, resulting in 400,000 deaths.\nExperts stressed that the type of mosquito which carries malaria is unlikely to be found in the UK any time soon, though an early warning system is important.\nUntil now, very little has been known about how widespread mosquitoes are in Scotland.\nSo experts at the Centre for Virus Research have been keeping a close eye on their movements to monitor the impact of climate change on disease spread.\nThey hung traps at 24 locations across the country and lured the insects by the smell of carbon dioxide, which mimics human breath.\nThey found 16 varieties out of about 4,000 in the world.\nThe highest concentrations were at their sites around Loch Kinnordy in Angus and Broubster Leans in Caithness.\nProf Ferguson said: \"With warming temperatures we\u2019re going to see larger numbers of mosquitoes, potentially different species including some that might be migrating from other areas where they can transmit diseases,\" she said. \n\"They may be active for longer periods which means they maybe do pose a risk.\u201d\nDr Nick Phin, the medical director at Public Health Scotland, said mosquitoes could carry potentially deadly diseases so it was important to understand how they were spreading.\nHe said that in recent years the West Nile virus, which is mainly transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes, had been spreading across Europe.\n\u201cCases have been identified in France,\" Dr Phin said.\n\"It doesn\u2019t take a leap of the imagination to see that very soon they could be detected in England and in Scotland\u201d\n\"It\u2019s the warmer winters rather than the summers which allow the mosquitoes to survive.\n\"That\u2019s because colder conditions kill of many of the insects, keeping populations numbers lower.\"\nA major worry is the UK becoming more suitable for invasive species such as the Asian tiger mosquito, also known as Aedes albopictus, which carries dengue fever.\nA recent UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) report looked at a worst case scenario.\nThey found England would be the first country in the UK to be affected, with Wales, Northern Ireland and parts of the Scottish Lowlands also becoming suitable habitats later in the century.\nThe mosquitoes have already been responsible for recent cases of dengue in France and the chikungunya virus in Italy.\nUKHSA already has a surveillance system in place to rapidly spot invasive mosquitoes, including a network of traps placed at UK borders that detect mosquito eggs.\nThe Scottish government says it also funds research through the Animal and Plant Health Agency.\nDr Phin says there now needs to be more government-backed studies to better understand the risks.\nHe said: \u201cWithout a baseline to know what is currently happening it\u2019s difficult to say whether things are getting better or worse.\n\"If we do have a formal system, the hope is we\u2019ll identify some of these species early and take measure to hopefully stop them breeding in the UK.\n\u201cWe need some formal structure around this surveillance. \n\"We need this to be continued in a very systematic and structured way to understand what\u2019s happening but to detect early incursions of these mosquitoes into Scotland.\"",

    "MP Natalie Elphicke - who defected from the Tories to Labour - has apologised for comments she made supporting her ex-husband after he was convicted of sexual assault. \nCharlie Elphicke was found guilty of sexually assaulting two women in 2020. \nSome Labour MPs had raised concerns about her saying he was \"an easy target\" for false allegations because he was \"attractive\". \nThe Dover MP joined the Labour Party on Wednesday.\nIn a statement on Thursday she said she knew her defection would \"put a spotlight on the prosecution of my ex-husband\". \n\"The period of 2017 - 2020 was an incredibly stressful and difficult one for me as I learned more about the person I thought I knew. I know it was far harder for the women who had to relive their experiences and give evidence against him,\" she said.\n\"I have previously, and do, condemn his behaviour towards other women and towards me. It was right that he was prosecuted and I'm sorry for the comments that I made about his victims.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Political Editor Chris Mason, Mrs Elphicke said she wanted to apologise directly to those victims. \nShe said tackling violence against women and girls was \"a critical mission for the Labour Party\" and she was looking forward to working alongside her fellow Labour MPs to tackle the issue. \nMr Elphicke, who was her predecessor as MP for Dover, was jailed for two years in 2020 for sexual assault. \nMrs Elphicke ended their marriage after his conviction but supported his unsuccessful appeal. \nIn September 2020, she told the Sun newspaper he was \"an easy target for dirty politics and false allegations\" because he was \"attractive, and attracted to, women\". \nHer previous comments had prompted criticism from some Labour MPs. \nJess Phillips, the former shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, said Mrs Elphicke should \"account for her actions\".\nShe told ITV's Peston: \"I'm all for forgiveness but I do think that that needs some explaining.\"\nMartin Abrams, a spokesman for left-wing campaign group Momentum, said Labour's response to Mrs Elphicke's apology showed clear \"double standards\". \n\"A hard-right Tory MP says sorry months after offensive comments and faces no repercussions,\" he said. \n\"Meanwhile, Britain's first black woman MP says sorry and is suspended for a year and counting.

    "A builder has been disqualified as a company director for 10 years after he falsely claimed a loan under the Covid Bounce Back scheme.\nMarcel Ion, 39, from Bromley in south-east London, claimed his company's turnover was more than double what it actually was and put \u00a335,000 from the loan into his personal bank account.\nMr Ion was the sole director of Mavion Group Ltd, registered in Dagenham.\nIt is the latest in a series of London cases involving the government scheme.\nUnder the rules of the Bounce Back scheme, companies could apply for a loan of between \u00a32,000 and \u00a350,000 - with any money lent having to be used for the economic benefit of the company. \nIn June 2020, Mr Ion applied for a \u00a350,000 loan on his company's behalf, stating it had a turnover of \u00a3205,410.\nInvestigators later found the company had made sales of about \u00a383,000 between January and December 2019.\nThey also discovered five days after the \u00a350,000 loan entered the company's bank account in July 2020, Mr Ion began moving money into his personal bank account.\nMore than \u00a335,000 was transferred to his personal account by the end of April 2021, and investigators found no evidence the payments were for the economic benefit of the company. \nMavion Group Ltd went into liquidation in August 2022, owing more than \u00a3180,000 including the full amount of the loan - triggering an investigation by the Insolvency Service. \nAccording to the Insolvency Service, during the 2023-24 financial year 831 directors were banned for Covid financial support scheme misconduct, with an average disqualification length of more than nine and a half years. \nAlthough specific figures are not available for the capital, BBC London has found details of at least seven successful civil and criminal prosecutions since September 2023 for misconduct under the scheme.\nLawrence Zussman, deputy head of company investigations at the Insolvency Service, said Mr Ion \"blatantly took advantage of a government scheme to support businesses when they were facing huge challenges posed by the pandemic\". \n\"His lengthy ban shows the Insolvency Service will pursue those who seek to abuse taxpayers' money and remove them from the business arena,\" he added.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

I know all parties are a broad church, but she was an ERG member and big Liz Truss supporter, I believe,\" she told GB News.\nTransport Minister Huw Merriman branding her \"shameless\" and an \"opportunist\", adding \"I'm just disappointed for politics that she's done what she's done\".\nMish Rahman, a member of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee, said that he did not welcome Mrs Elphicke's defection, saying the party is getting \"grubbier\".\nHe said the Labour Party should be in the business of changing the country, \"not saving the careers of Tory politicians who the British public are rejecting because of the damage they've done to the country\".\n\"She's not fit to be a Labour Party member, let alone an MP,\" he added.\nDo you live in Natalie Elphicke's constituency in Dover?

    "The annual Red Square military parade felt different this time round.\nAnd not just because of the spring snowstorm.\nThere were 9,000 people marching across the square. Sounds a lot. But in previous years \u2013 before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2013 the numbers were often higher.\nThere was less military hardware on display, too, today. The only tank was one T-34.\nWhat there were plenty of were references to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Among the participants of the parade were soldiers who\u2019d been fighting there.\n\u201cWe mark Victory Day at a time when we are carrying out the Special Military Operation,\u201d President Vladimir Putin said in his Red Square address. \u201cThose taking part on the frontline are our heroes.\u201d\nIn recent days Russia has accused Western nations, including the UK and France, of threatening Russia. President Emmanuel Macron has not ruled out sending ground troops to Ukraine.\nToday Vladimir Putin issued a warning to the West. Accompanied by more nuclear sabre-rattling.\n\u201cRussia will do everything to avoid a global confrontation,\u201d the Kremlin leader said. \u201cBut at the same time, we will not allow anyone to threaten us. Our strategic forces are always on combat alert.\u201d\nUnder Vladimir Putin, Victory Day has become Russia\u2019s most important secular holiday. \nA day for remembering, not only the Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany, but also the enormous human cost of that victory - the more than 27 million Soviet citizens killed in what\u2019s known here as the Great Patriotic War.\nBut in many ways Victory Day isn\u2019t just about the past. It\u2019s about Russia now. \nIf this country today has any kind of national idea, it is the idea of victory. Russians are constantly being told that throughout history their country has come under attack from enemies abroad \u2013 like Napoleon and Hitler \u2013 and has emerged victorious.\nIn Russia today the authorities are not just remembering the past. They are weaponising it, to try to justify the present.\nThey want the Russian public to view the war in Ukraine as a continuation of World War Two, so that Russians believe that once again external forces are fighting to destroy Russia. Today\u2019s enemies - Ukraine and the West.\nIn reality, it was Russia that annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and intervened militarily in the Donbas. And in 2022 it was President Putin who ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nAs a consequence of the Ukraine war, something quite extraordinary \u2013 and unsettling \u2013 is happening in Russia.\nAfter the horrors of World War Two, for decades Russians used to say: \"We can put up with all kinds of privations. Just so long as there\u2019s no more war.\"\nThat phrase: \"No more war.\" You would hear it in towns and villages across this giant country. Wherever you\u2019d go. \nI remember former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev telling me with tears in his eyes that \"No more war\" was precisely what Russians told him when he travelled the country as Soviet leader.\nThe message has changed.\nIn a small town outside Moscow on Thursday I witnessed the unveiling of a war memorial. It is dedicated to Russian soldiers who died in the Soviet war in Afghanistan, the war in Chechnya and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\nA local official made a speech. And what did he tell the adults and children who were gathered there?\n\u201cThere were always wars. And there will always be wars. It\u2019s human nature.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s happening in Russia is the normalisation of war in a country that has suffered so much from wars in its past.\n",
    "A man has been found guilty of murdering a teenager in an \"unprovoked\" attack on the night of the victim's school prom.\nKajetan Migdal, 18, died after being stabbed on Cutty's Lane in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, on 27 May 2022, after he had been at the Saint John Henry Newman Catholic School event.\nPatrick Sharp-Meade, now 20, mistakenly believed the teenager and three friends had spoken to his ex-girlfriend.\nSharp-Meade, of Cutty's Lane, admitted the killing but denied murder, claiming he suffered \"neurodevelopmental disorders\" that affected his behaviour. A jury at Luton Crown Court rejected the defence case and convicted him of murder.\nReading a statement outside court, Mr Migdal's grandmother, Lorna Buckland, described her grandson as a \"pacifist who hated violence\".\n\"[He] was the life and soul of our family \u2013 the beating heart,\" she said.\n\"Our utterly innocent, unique, talented and widely cherished boy\u2019s contribution to the world has been far greater than he will ever know.\n\"The vacuum that has been left behind is enormous and we are all forever changed by losing him,\" she added.\nThe trial heard how the group of friends had attended their school prom at the Holiday Inn.\nThey returned to Mr Migdal's car - parked on Sharp-Meade's street - where they intended to change before heading to an after-party in Cambridge.\nProsecutor Jane Bickerstaff KC told the court: \"They were approached by the defendant who was armed with a large zombie-style knife. He had it concealed down his tracksuit trousers.\"\nShe said the friends had backed away but Mr Migdal had not finished changing and \"momentarily stood his ground\".\nThe defendant approached and stabbed him in the chest, the jury heard.\nHe was rushed to Stevenage's Lister hospital, where he died in the early hours of the morning.\nThe jury was told that on the night of the stabbing the defendant's ex-girlfriend was heading to Sharp-Meade's flat to collect a fur hood. As she walked past the group she was talking to a friend on her mobile. \nThe defendant, who was in the flat with the person taking the call, heard the conversation and could hear the four teenagers talking in the background.\nThe prosecutor said: \"As a result of hearing them in the background, he became irrationally jealous.\n\"The defendant armed himself with a knife. Once the ex-girlfriend arrived he threw her hood at her. He put on a balaclava and speed-walked to find and confront those who he wrongly thought had engaged with her.\"\nDet Insp Justine Jenkins, from Hertfordshire Police, said: \"This was a senseless act of violence, which resulted in a young man being killed in cold blood because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, by an enraged teenager who imagined a situation that simply did not exist.\"\nMr Kajetan had appeared on BBC TV's Greatest Dancer.\nHe was a member of a dance group called Prospects Fraternity, and had also won first place in an under-14 category of the World Street Dancing Championships in 2017.\nWhen the murder verdict was delivered, his family and friends, seated in the public gallery, gasped before crying and hugging. \nSharp-Meade will be sentenced on 17 May.\nJudge John Hillen told him: \"The jury has convicted you of murder. The only sentence I can pass is life, but I have to set a minimum terms.\"\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

    "The Duke of Sussex has told the BBC it has been great to be back in the UK this week.\nThe BBC was given exclusive access to Prince Harry's final engagement during his short trip to London.\nHe was the surprise guest at a party hosted by the charity Scotty's Little Soldiers, which supports the bereaved children of military personnel.\nPrince Harry threw himself into the spirit of the party.\nWithin minutes of arriving, his jacket was off, he had a bucket on his head and teams of children were targeting him with plastic balls.\nIt was a side of him that we've not seen so much of lately - on show was the fun, informal prince.\nIn comparison, other recent visits have been more sombre or formal, such as the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, an appearance at the High Court to give evidence during the phone-hacking case, the King's coronation, and a visit to see his father after King Charles's cancer diagnosis.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped back as senior Royals in January 2020, and that year they moved to California, saying they wanted space to raise their son, Archie. Their daughter Lilibet was born there in 2021.\nPrince Harry's visits back to London are not straightforward. Relationships between him and other Royals remain broken and there was no fix to be had this week. The prince and King Charles were at events just two miles apart on Wednesday but didn't meet up. . A statement from the duke attributed this to his father's \"full programme\", but said that he \"hopes to see him soon\".\nDespite these strained relationships, Harry told me it was \"great\" to be back in the UK. \nSpeaking about attending the party, the prince said it was \"amazing\". \n\"What Scotty's is doing with these kids is absolutely incredible and very needed as well. \n\"The more opportunity you get to do these kinds of events, the more the families and kids know this place exists which is really the most important thing.\"\nWe spent around an hour with Harry.\nSince the prince left the UK for the US, it has been rare to see him up close in a context such as at the Scotty's party. \nEvery child attending the party, like Harry, had experienced the death of a parent.\nHe talked privately to a group of them about how he'd coped with the death of his mother, Princess Diana, and offered his own advice on dealing with the pain.\nNikki Scott founded Scotty's Little Soldiers after her husband, Lee, was killed in Afghanistan in 2009.\n\"I would imagine Prince Harry got so much from that room and had so much fun and joy that I wouldn't mind betting that he's probably thinking about those children right now because it does that to you, it really makes you think, these children are incredible,\" she said.\nAs well as showing his compassionate side, when it came to the party games, Harry was competitive.\nHe was on the winning team for the fastest consumption of a strawberry lace sweet but less successful when it came to rolling a Malteser down a tape measure into someone's mouth - something he learnt required a high level of skill.\nAnd no chocolate went to waste. At least three Maltesers that rolled off the tape were picked up off the floor and eaten by the fifth in line to the throne.\nThis party was the first event he'd been able to attend in person with Scotty's Little Soldiers, after becoming a global ambassador for it in November and having previously been involved since 2017.\nAs the party wrapped up - there were goodies to hand out and take home.\nFor Prince Harry that included a Lego figure of himself.\nThe family fallout and the move to California has limited what Prince Harry has been able to do for the organisations he supports in the UK.\nThese kind of events are now a personal rather than royal duty.\nWhile family ties remain fractured, Prince Harry's charity work is an important link to the place that was once home.",
    "Rishi Sunak bears ultimate responsibility for a Conservative Party mired in \"chaos\", Ben Houchen has said. \nThe newly re-elected Tees Valley mayor said \"lots of\" Tories were \"fighting each other like rats in a sack\" and the blame \"ultimately lies with Rishi\".\nHis comments will come as a blow to the prime minister, still reeling from disastrous local election results.\nHe had hailed Lord Houchen's victory as a sign the Tories could still win the general election. \nThe Conservatives lost 474 council seats, the Blackpool South by-election and the West Midlands mayoral race.\nMr Sunak's woes deepened on Wednesday with the surprise defection of Dover MP Natalie Elphicke to Labour in protest at his record on housing and stopping small boat crossings. \nAsked if the prime minister was to blame for the Conservatives' problems, Lord Houchen told BBC Radio Tees: \"Ultimately it always rests on the shoulders of the leader, all responsibility goes back to the top, it's the same in my job as well. \n\"Ultimately, you're the one responsible for it. But there are lots of people who are involved in the problems with the Conservative Party. It's a bit of chaos at the minute, right, isn't it?\n\"There's lots of people fighting with each other in the Conservative Party, there are defections going on, and ultimately the public do not vote for parties who are not united and are not presenting a united front and also aren't talking to the public.\n\"If they're fighting with each other like rats in a sack instead of saying to the public 'this is what we're going to do for you', that doesn't win elections.\n\"Obviously, it ultimately lies with Rishi but there are lots of people that need to get their act together, stop messing about and start talking to the public about what they can offer them, rather than just fighting with each other,\" Lord Houchen added. \nThere was a general disillusionment with politics at the moment rather than a desire to vote Labour, but the \"way through is getting narrower by the day\", he warned. \n\"If the government actually got on and delivered some real things and showed themselves to be competent... then there is a way through to be able to get some of that respect back, some of that confidence back from the public, and to help reduce what is a very large gap at the minute,\" he said. \nMr Sunak travelled to Darlington last Friday to celebrate Lord Houchen's re-election, saying it was evidence of \"the Conservatives delivering\" and \"levelling-up in action\".\nThe prime minister said the people of Teesside \"knew it was Ben and the Conservatives that delivered for them and they stuck with you at this election. And I know that come the general election, they're going to stick with us too.\"\nLord Houchen thanked Mr Sunak for his support, saying: \"I could not have delivered the things we've delivered in this region without you, prime minister.\"\nLabour said Lord Houchen had run his campaign as a \"pseudo-independent\" by not branding himself as a Conservative or mentioning Mr Sunak in his campaign literature. \nIn his BBC interview, the mayor acknowledged that \"on the doorstep, lots of people\" told him they would vote for him personally while also voting for other parties, because they \"did see me slightly separately from the Conservative Party\".  \nHe vowed to fight for government funding for a new hospital to replace North Tees hospital in Stockton-on-Tees, an ageing estate he said had a lifespan of \"five to eight years, maximum\".\n\"We need a new hospital, that is accepted by everybody. That work has to happen now, it's a priority locally.\"\nA government spokesperson said \u00a319m had been invested in North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust in recent years to upgrade emergency departments, speed up access to diagnostic tests and improve critical infrastructure.   \n\"Going forward, new schemes will be considered through a rolling programme of capital investment in hospital infrastructure to upgrade NHS facilities across the country,\" the spokesperson added. \nLord Houchen also outlined his plans for a new tram system in parts of Teesside, and said people under 21 in the region would now benefit from \u00a31 bus fares.\nAsked how he would tackle child poverty, he said he would focus on tackling the cause rather than the symptoms and concentrate on creating high-paid jobs. \nThe Conservative Party has been approached for comment.

    "Universities \"may need to take action\" if  protests against the Israel-Gaza war interfere with life on campus,  the president of Universities UK has said.\nProf Dame Sally Mapstone said there should be no presumption universities would clear protest encampments but all students must be able to take their exams and graduate.\nThe leaders of 17 universities met the prime minister earlier to discuss the protests and steps they should take to tackle antisemitism. \nThe Union of Jewish Students said it wanted the meeting to be followed by  \"decisive action\".\nThe police were called to Newcastle University on Wednesday, after escalated protests prevented some students accessing counselling services.\nProtesters have told BBC News the encampments are \"completely peaceful\".\n\nSt Andrews University principal and vice-chancellor Dame Sally said universities took a recent rise in antisemitism on campus \"extremely seriously\" and \u201cconcrete actions\u201d had been agreed at the meeting to ensure universities knew how to draw \u201cimportant lines\u201d.\n\u201cThere is behaviour that is acceptable when people are protesting\u2026 and behaviour that is not acceptable because it is against the law,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of this can be tricky.\u201d\nAsked whether universities should clear encampments, Dame Sally said vice-chancellors would monitor who was involved in the protests \u2013 noting that not everybody was a student -  and that \u201cwe shouldn't automatically presume that universities will straight away say \u2018you have to move off our land\u2019\u201d.\nBut she added: \u201cWhere there is clear evidence that encampments are interfering with good university business and with the rights of students and staff to go about their business \u2013 to take exams, to do their degree shows, to graduate - then universities may need to take action.\u201d\nEdward Isaacs, president of the Union of Jewish Students, told the BBC the government gave \u201creassurances\u201d to Jewish students during the meeting and offered to help universities in efforts to tackle antisemitism.\nBut he added: \u201cWhile the commitments were important, it's what follows next that will really matter for Jewish students.\u201d\nHe said vice-chancellors needed to take \u201cdecisive action\u201d, including using the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism. The definition, in part, describes it as \"a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred towards Jews\".\nThere must be \u201cclear communication\u201d with Jewish societies, Mr Isaacs added - and \"red lines need to be drawn\" when it came to protests, which the UJS previously warned were creating a \u201chostile and toxic atmosphere for Jewish students\u201d.\nThe encampments appearing on about 15 UK university campuses in recent days and weeks are much smaller than those in the US.\nThe student activists want their universities to divest from Israel in response to its military operation in the Gaza Strip.\nDivestment means selling off stock in Israeli companies or otherwise dropping financial ties.\nIsrael launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.\nMore than 34,780 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nIssy, who is protesting outside the University of Leeds, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cOf course we\u2019re opposed to antisemitism and we\u2019re opposed to all forms of oppression.\u201d\nStudents at the University of Lancaster, the latest to see tents springing up, described their encampment as \u201ca liberated space\u201d, with events and collective meals.\n\u201cAnyone is welcome to join us,\u201d the students said in a statement. \nProtests at Newcastle University escalated on Wednesday, with a rally blocking access to its King's Gate building.\n\nOne student, Gemma, who is not protesting and asked for her surname to be withheld, told BBC News protesters had blocked the entrance to the building, which houses student-support services such as counselling, financial and visa help, leaving students unable to attend appointments.\n\u201cI feel really strongly that the local university students should not be being impacted by this protest,\" she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s often hard for students to build up the courage to get to a [counselling] session in the first place, so placing barriers to these services saddens me.\u201d\nGemma added she had been \u201calso faced with shouts via megaphone about us all enabling or supporting genocide\u201d.\nNewcastle University said some services had been moved online and students would be contacted to rebook missed appointments.\n\"We continue to work with the police and our security, to ensure the safety and security of our campus,\" it said in a statement.\n\u201cThe student protesters have been reminded of our guidance that enables them to exercise their right to protest in a way that respects our university and our community.\"\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak warned, on Wednesday, protests were disru",
    "The closure of a Barclays branch in a town centre will \"make life extremely difficult\", its customers have said.\nThe bank said its Darwen Street site in Blackburn would close at noon as part of its \"need to adapt to provide the best service for all our customers\".\nIt said it would be replaced by a \"a cashless banking site where customers can meet a colleague face-to-face for banking support\".\nSome local account holders said they were disappointed by the closure.\nLocal resident Malika said she did not agree with the move, as there were \"plenty of people who are not so highly educated\" in the town, who needed the \"kind help\" of the branch staff.\nBlackburn vicar Father Nicholas Heale, whose church uses the branch, said it was \"going to make like extremely difficult for us\". \n\"Arranging all of the appropriate formalities to continue functioning is extremely hard,\" he added.\nAlan, whose wife uses the bank, said face-to-face banking in the area was becoming harder all the time.  \n\"I don't live in Blackburn, I live in Chorley, but there's no branch in Chorley,\" he said.\nHe said the closure meant there was \"only one branch\" left and \"that's Preston\".\n\"You can do it online, but it's a nightmare. You don't know if they are scammers,\" he said.\nHowever, account holder Phillip said he could understand the decision, adding that it was \"the way of the world these days\".\n\"They're trying to reduce their overheads and people aren't using the branches, so there's not much choice,\" he said.\nMany customers said they hoped a banking hub, which allowed account holders from all major banks and building societies to carry out cash transactions and speak to a representative about more complicated issues, would be set up in the town.\nLancashire's first such hub opened in Barnoldswick in March, while two others, in Darwen and Great Harwood, remain under development.\nA Barclays representative said it planned to \"open a Barclays Local\" in Blackburn to replace the Darwen St branch, whcih they said would offer \"cashless banking\" and an opportunity for customers to \"meet a colleague face-to-face for banking support\".\n\"We are currently working with the local community to identify a suitable location and will announce details once confirmed,\" they added.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds\u00a0and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A former police officer who was sexually assaulted and complained about bullying and misogyny at a Moray station has accepted a payout from Police Scotland of \u00a3431,968.\nGemma MacRae, who left the force in 2021, had started legal action against Police Scotland but settled last month.\nShe told BBC News the last seven years had been devastating and called for complete reform of the police complaints system.\nThe force's deputy chief constable said misogyny, sexism and discrimination of any kind was utterly unacceptable and he would meet Gemma to apologise for her treatment. \nIn 2022, former police officer Scott Gallop was convicted of sexually assaulting Gemma MacRae. He was given a one-year community payback order and put on the sex offenders register for a year.\nIt was the only conviction to result from a 15-month Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc) probe at Forres Police Station, following complaints of bullying and misogyny.\nThe Pirc report made allegations against seven police officers but the Crown Office determined there was insufficient evidence of criminality in relation to six of them.\nMs MacRae began an employment tribunal claim against Police Scotland alleging sex discrimination but following discussions earlier this year agreed to accept \u00a3431,968 for the loss of her career, injury and distress.\nMs MacRae said: \u201cIt has been seven arduous years of torture, not only for myself but for my family.\n\u201cThe toxic masculinity and power used against me was inexcusable and cruel. I am physically and mentally drained.\n\u201cSeven years is a long time to fight for justice against an organisation that is meant to represent it.\u201d\nMs MacRae has not seen the Pirc report into allegations of bullying and misogyny at Forres Police Station.\nShe said part of the investigation had been \u201ccompletely buried and hidden from the public.\u201d\nMs MacRae added: \u201cIt is difficult for Pirc to justify their purpose when we are refused insight into what they do and their findings.\nShe described the police complaints system as broken and failing both honest officers and the public.\nStephen Smith, solicitor at Livingstone Brown, said: \u201cWe have acted for female officers of Police Scotland from Dumfries to Inverness who have said the same things.\n\"They have fallen foul of a male-dominated management hierarchy which has been able to use internal procedures to delay and avoid investigating what has happened to them.\n\u201cThey have had to use the Employment Tribunal as a last resort, because their genuine attempts to have the actions of male colleagues investigated have not gone anywhere either.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt this takes a toll on them, as it has on Gemma. They should not be left in this position in any organisation, let alone one that is created to protect people.\u201d\nDeputy Chief Constable Alan Speirs said: \u201cMisogyny, sexism and discrimination of any kind is utterly unacceptable - it has no place in society and no place in policing. I will personally meet with Gemma and apologise for the way she was treated.\n\u201cPirc conducted an independent Crown-directed investigation and Police Scotland fully assisted with those enquiries. \n\"Since this investigation, Police Scotland assessed a number of matters and - although conduct proceedings are private - appropriate action was taken to address behaviour that was not in line with our values of integrity, fairness, respect and upholding human rights.\n\u201cPolice Scotland is meeting these challenges head-on through sustained, tangible and measurable activity, driving a relentless focus on our values and standards under our Policing Together programme,\" he added.\nA spokesperson for Pirc said: \u201cWe were instructed by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) to investigate allegations of potential criminality against officers of Police Scotland.\n\u201cThe matter was referred to us in December 2018 and, following our investigation, a detailed and comprehensive report of our findings was submitted to the COPFS in April 2020 for consideration. \n\"Our reports and findings are confidential due to legal reasons.\u201d",

    "A Scottish scientist has described her record-setting deep sea dive as the underwater equivalent of climbing Mount Everest.\nHeather Stewart from Edinburgh inadvertently set a new world record by being part of the deepest dive ever to be carried out by an all-female-crew.   \nShe completed the feat in the Bakunawa submersible in the South Pacific Ocean with her colleague Kate Wawatai from New Zealand.\nThe almost 10-hour dive - part of a research trip on 16 April - took them 8,000m under the surface. Everest reaches 9,000m in the opposite direction.\nSpeaking to BBC Scotland News after the mission, marine geologist Prof Stewart, 43, said she and her pilot partner were unaware they were going to break a world record.\n\"I didn\u2019t realise until that day. Kate, as we were descending, said 'I think this might be the first time that an all-female submersible crew has descended this deep'.\"\nThe area they are researching is called the Nova-Canton Trough, a geological feature called a fracture-zone that is 400 miles long and 8,000m deep.\nThe two women and a group of experts are based in Samoa, where it takes four days to sail from there to the research area.\nThey are taking part in series of four expeditions, which started at the beginning of April, each lasting 21 days. \nThe group is now on its fourth and final expedition, with Prof Stewart set to return home at the end of May. \nDuring the dive, the team gathered data to look at the ecological, biological, geological and oceanographic questions about how that area of the world functions.\nProf Stewart said it was an \"amazing opportunity\" and compared the scale of the dive to the world's highest mountain.\n\"It's almost 9,000m high and we\u2019re studying a feature that\u2019s 8,000m deep. \n\"We\u2019re kind of exploring the underwater equivalent of a mountain range in scale. Instead of going up, it\u2019s a long linear hole in the sea floor rather than a set of mountains.\"\nDespite working as a marine geologist since 2001, Prof Stewart only did her first dive in 2019.\nShe has now completed five, with her first ever deep dive below 6,000m being a record breaker.\nDespite her relative lack of diving experience, Prof Stewart says she only gets a \"bit\" nervous.\n\"It isn\u2019t something that most people would ever get the opportunity to do, so the technology isn\u2019t necessarily familiar.\n\"I think nerves are good because it shows a bit of respect for what we\u2019re doing as well, it\u2019s not easy and not a lot of people do it, but I\u2019m not scared.\"\nDuring the series of dives, she has had the opportunity to see features which nobody has ever seen before.\n\u201cWe\u2019re down there doing research but at the same time, it's amazing seeing the sea floor and the features that we\u2019re seeing for the first time. We\u2019re the only people that have ever seen these,\" she said.\nAs a geologist, Prof Stewart is looking at the structure of rocks and sediment, trying to unpick the processes that are going on at these depths. \nShe is also studying how geological features such as fracture zones act as pathways for deep ocean currents, which are key in regulating the Earth's climate.\n\"I\u2019m also seeing these amazing sponges, fish and octopus and lots of other fauna that live in the deep sea.\"\nShe said that time spent on the sea floor goes \"in the blink of an eye\" because you don\u2019t know what you're going to come across, so it\u2019s \"really exciting\".\nProf Stewart and Mrs Wawatai have daughters and nieces and hope to inspire young women to go in to Stem [science, technology, engineering, and mathematics].\n\u201cMy kids are still young. I talk to them about me going away. It sounds really mushy but they are really proud of me,\" she said\n\"If either of them wanted to go in to a career in research, that would be totally awesome.\n\"Something that Kate and I do talk about a lot, even if we just inspire a handful of kids to consider going into a Stem career, that's truly our job done.\"",
    "Former chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has said he will stand down as an MP at the next election.\n\"My mistakes have been mine,\" he announced on X in a lengthy statement.\nMr Zahawi was sacked as Tory Party chairman in January last year after an inquiry found he had failed to disclose that HMRC was investigating his tax affairs.\nHe has been MP for Stratford-on-Avon for 14 years and said it had been his \"greatest honour\" to serve its people. \nMr Zahawi is the 64th Conservative MP to announce he'll stand down at the next election, and the 104th MP.\nReferring to the role as the \"MP for Shakespeare\" he said: \"As my most famous constituent once wrote: 'Go to your bosom; knock there and ask your heart what it doth know'.\n\"I have come to feel that the time is right for a new, energetic Conservative to fight for the honour of representing Stratford-on-Avon and assuming the mantle of MP for Shakespeare.\"\nMr Zahawi was education secretary from September 2021 to July 2022 and had a short stint as chancellor of the exchequer between July and September 2022.\nIn November 2020, in the middle of the pandemic, he was appointed vaccines minister and oversaw the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine programme for nearly a year.\nBorn in Iraq in 1967, he could have been sent to fight in the 1980s Iran-Iraq War but instead he and his parents fled Iraq and he grew up in the UK.\nIn his statement on X, Mr Zahawi said: \"Every morning as I shave my head in the mirror, I have to pinch myself. How is it that a boy from Baghdad who came to these shores, fleeing persecution and unable to speak a word of English, was able to do as much as I have?\"\nHe said helping his constituents in their time of need \"remains one of the most meaningful things I have ever done\" and pledged the Conservative Party \"will continue to have my unswerving support into and beyond the next general election\".\nMr Zahawi made his fortune after co-founding the online polling company YouGov in 2000 and is believed to be one of the richest politicians in the House of Commons. \nHis political career started when he was elected as a Wandsworth councillor in 1994, being re-elected three times, and unsuccessfully contesting the Erith and Thamesmead seat in 1997 before being elected as the MP for Stratford-upon-Avon in 2010.\nA keen equestrian, Mr Zahawi had to apologise for claiming parliamentary expenses for electricity to supply his stables and a mobile home in the stable yard in 2013, saying he was \"mortified by this mistake\" and paying back about \u00a34,000.\nHe began to climb the ministerial ladder when Theresa May made him an education minister and was known as a safe pair of hands.\nThis opened the door for him to become chancellor when Mr Sunak dramatically quit the role in July 2022, during the mass resignations that forced Boris Johnson out of Downing Street.\nMr Zahawi was given the role due to his robust defence of Mr Johnson but, after a few days, he too called on Mr Johnson to leave.\nAfter unsuccessfully bidding to replace Mr Johnson as the next Tory leader, he backed Liz Truss and then Mr Sunak, who made him Conservative Party chair when he became prime minister.\nIt was during Mr Zahawi's period as chancellor when questions were raised about the sale of shares in YouGov and whether this was taxed correctly, which eventually led to Mr Sunak sacking him for a serious breach of the ministerial code.\nStratford Can, a group of disgruntled former Conservative members who formed a group intending to run an alternative conservative candidate against Mr Zahawi at the next election, welcomed the move.\nSpokesman David Spencer said: \"That his resignation statement fails to mention a single meaningful achievement that he has delivered for this town during his 14 years as MP says everything about his negligible tenure as our local MP.\"",
    "The Scottish Greens have urged First Minister John Swinney not to adopt the \"repressive values of the 1950s\" after appointing Kate Forbes as his deputy. \nMs Forbes was criticised by Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie for her views on LGBT rights, gay marriage and abortion.\nShe returned to government following a year on the backbenches after agreeing last week not to stand against Mr Swinney for the SNP leadership.\nMaking his debut at First Minister's Questions, he defended his deputy and insisted the minority SNP government would be a \"moderate left of centre\u201d administration. \nMr Swinney was officially sworn in on Wednesday after Humza Yousaf resigned as the result of the fallout from his decision to rip up a power-sharing agreement with the Greens. \nMs Forbes, a member of the Free Church of Scotland who has been criticised for her socially conservative views, returned to government as his deputy, as well as cabinet secretary for the economy and Gaelic. \nThe Greens abstained in the vote to nominate Mr Swinney as first minister, guaranteeing him a majority, but Mr Harvie urged the new first minister to give a signal of what direction his new government would take.\nHe said: \u201cYesterday that signal came pretty clearly - progressive ministers sacked, and the second most powerful job in government given to someone who has opposed LGBT people\u2019s legal equality, who has expressed judgemental attitudes against abortion, and who has even expressed the view that people who have families without being married are doing something wrong.\u201d\nHe asked: \u201cIs this the Scottish government\u2019s vision for the future of Scotland - taking us back to the repressive values of the 1950s?\u201d\nMr Harvie questioned whether the first minster understood \u201cjust how worried\u201d many LGBT people and others were in Scotland.\nHe went on to demand that Mr Swinney continued with \u201cprogressive\u201d taxation and did not \u201cgive in to the right wing of his party\u201d.\nThe SNP leader said his government would be led from the \u201cmoderate left of centre\u201d political position.\nThe first minister said Ms Forbes had delivered progressive taxation during her time as finance secretary, between 2020 and 2023. During that time, her budgets were supported by the Scottish Greens.\n\u201cI want to lead a modern, dynamic and diverse Scotland, Mr Swinney said. \u201dA place for everybody, where everybody feels at home, at peace, where they have a place and that their place in our society is protected by my leadership of this country.\u201d\nSpeaking to reporters afterwards, Ms Forbes said: \"I am here to support the first minister and together we serve all communities in Scotland as we further and progress the rights of every community in Scotland, and I look forward to doing my part in achieving the government's aims in that regard.\u201d\nShe said she had signed up the government\u2019s collective responsibility, adding: \u201cSo I stand by the government's decisions and agenda to improve and progress the rights of all of Scotland's communities.\"\nMSPs voted to formally approve the appointment of Ms Forbes later on Thursday. \nThe Greens opposed the move, with MSP Ross Greer telling parliament: \"We cannot support the appointment of someone who believes not only that equal marriage is wrong, but also children being born outside of marriage.\"\nThe official LGBT+ wing of the SNP also said it had \u201cconcerns\u201d about the appointment.\nThe Out For Independence executive posted on social media saying it wanted \u201curgent clarification\u201d that policies such as a ban on conversion therapy would not be \u201cstalled\u201d.\nMs Forbes was the only addition to Mr Swinney's cabinet, with the rest of Mr Yousaf's senior team retained. \nHowever, the new first minister discarded the minister for independence from his first government.\nJamie Hepburn, who held the post, took over as minister for parliamentary business from George Adam.\nMr Adam, as well as former ministerial colleagues Joe Fitzpatrick and Emma Roddick, have moved to the backbenches, while Ivan McKee - an ally of Ms Forbes - returned to government as public finance minister.\nMr Swinney served in SNP cabinets for 16 years before stepping down from government in 2023.\nAt First Minister\u2019s Questions, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross asked whether the government would uphold a commitment made by Mr Swinney in his previous role as education secretary to increase teacher numbers by 3,500 by 2026.\nHe pointed to a report commissioned by the government, published this week, that said the target would have \u201csignificant implications for cost and sustainability\u201d and could raise questions about whether it delivered \u201cmaximum value for money\u201d.\nThe report found teacher numbers had fallen by 252 from 2021 to 2023.\nMr Ross also pointed to reports Glasgow City Council could cut about 450 teacher jobs over three years.\nHe told MSPs the government had a record of \"broken promises\" on education and said it was \"not being straight\" with Scots.

    "Electric Ireland is pulling out of Northern Ireland's residential electricity market.\nThe firm's 53,000 customers do not have to take any immediate action though they will eventually have to move to another supplier.\nElectric Ireland said the decision was taken after a strategic review of its Northern Ireland business.\nThe Dublin-based firm will continue to supply business customers in Northern Ireland.\nIt has about a third of the business market.\nElectric Ireland entered the residential supply market in Northern Ireland in 2015 and currently has about 6% of that market .\nIt is currently under investigation by the NI Utility Regulator for potential breaches of its licence.\nLast year, a significant technical fault affected thousands of Electric Ireland customers, leaving some without power.\nHowever it is not clear to what extent the investigation is related to that incident.\nThe regulator is investigating eight potential breaches, including the handling of complaints and the provision of customer information.\nIn 2020 Electric Ireland agreed to make a donation of \u00a3250,000 to charities after another regulator's investigation which focused on the firm's treatment of customers in areas such as switching, communications and handling complaints.\nBarbara Cantley, the Interim Director of Consumer Protection and Enforcement at the Utility Regulator, said they were working with Electric Ireland to ensure a smooth transition for consumers.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme, Ms Cantley said: \"I really would like to reassure consumers. They will not lose supply as a result of this decision. \n\"Customers don't need to panic, and they don't have to do anything, your lights will stay on.\n\"Our key focus is that there is no customer detriment as a result of this commercial decision that Electric Ireland have taken,\" Ms Cantley said.\nAnalysis: Northern Ireland left with five suppliers\nElectric Ireland's decision to leave the market will leave Northern Ireland with five residential suppliers.\nIt is now more than 15 years since the market was fully opened to competition.\nPower NI remains the biggest supplier.\nData from the regulator suggests it had about 60% of the market at the end of last year.\nIn a distant second SSE Airtricity had about 17% with Budget Energy the next largest supplier on just over 11%.",

    "Plane bodies made by Boeing's largest supplier regularly left the factory with serious defects, according to a former quality inspector at the firm.\nSantiago Paredes who worked for Spirit AeroSystems in Kansas, told the BBC he often found up to 200 defects on parts being readied for shipping to Boeing.\nHe was nicknamed \"showstopper\" for slowing down production when he tried to tackle his concerns, he claimed.\nSpirit said it \"strongly disagree[d]\" with the allegations. \n\"We are vigorously defending against his claims,\" said a spokesperson for Spirit, which remains Boeing's largest supplier.\nMr Paredes made the allegations against Spirit in an exclusive interview with the BBC and the American network CBS, in which he described what he said he experienced while working at the firm between 2010 and 2022.\nHe was accustomed to finding \"anywhere from 50 to 100, 200\" defects on fuselages - the main body of the plane - that were due to be shipped to Boeing, he said. \n\"I was finding a lot of missing fasteners, a lot of bent parts, sometimes even missing parts.\"\nBoeing declined to comment.\nUS transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg said that the government was \"putting Boeing under a microscope\" through ongoing investigations by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\n\"They need to demonstrate that they are meeting the quality standards and the safety standards that FAA has set forward,\" he told the BBC on Thursday.\n\"They have a responsibility to meet our standards, but we don't simply take it on faith\u2026 we'll hold them accountable to do so.\"\nSpirit AeroSystems and Boeing have both come under intense scrutiny after an unused door came off a brand new 737 Max shortly after take-off in January, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane.  According to investigators, the door had originally been fitted by Spirit, but had subsequently been removed by Boeing technicians to rectify faulty riveting. \nThe incident prompted the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, to launch an audit of production practices at both firms. It found multiple instances where the companies failed to comply with manufacturing control practices.\nRegulators temporarily grounded nearly 200 Boeing 737 Max 9 jets after the incident.\nAnd another FAA investigation was launched earlier this week after Boeing told regulators that it might not have properly inspected its 787 Dreamliner planes. The FAA said it would look into whether staff had falsified records.\nMr Paredes told the BBC that some of the defects he identified while at Spirit were minor - but others were more serious. \nHe also claimed he was put under pressure to be less rigorous.\n\"They always made a fuss about why I was finding it, why I was looking at it,\" he said.\n\"They just wanted the product shipped out. They weren't focused on the consequences of shipping bad fuselages. They were just focused on meeting the quotas, meeting the schedule, meeting the budget\u2026 If the numbers looked good, the state of the fuselages didn't really matter,\" he alleged.\nMany of Mr Paredes' alleged experiences at Spirit form part of his testimony in legal action that disgruntled shareholders have brought against the firm. \nHowever, in legal documents he is referred to simply as \"Former Employee 1\". This is the first time Mr Paredes, a former Air Force technician, has spoken publicly.\nBefore his departure from the firm, Mr Paredes led a team of inspectors based at the end of the 737 Max production line.\nA second former quality auditor, Josh Dean, whose claims were also to form part of the lawsuit, passed away last week after contracting a serious bacterial infection. \nThe lawsuit accuses the company of deliberately attempting to cover up serious and widespread quality failings, and exposing shareholders to financial losses when those failings became exposed. Spirit said it \"strongly disagrees\" with the assertions in the legal action.\nSpirit was once part of Boeing and remains the planemaker's primary supplier. It builds the fuselage for every 737 Max at its factory in Wichita, Kansas, before shipping them to Boeing's own facility in Renton, near Seattle, Washington. It also makes large parts of the 787 Dreamliner.\nIt is now in a difficult position. It is haemorrhaging cash, and lost $617m (\u00a3494m) in the first three months of the year.\nBoeing has agreed to provide financial support, and is in talks to buy back its former subsidiary. \nSources within the aerospace giant insist that efforts are under way to address quality concerns at Spirit, and these have succeeded in reducing the number of faults in parts leaving the Wichita factory by around 80%.\nMr Paredes said both companies were aware of the scale of the problem with defects, and that it was discussed at weekly meetings between quality inspectors from both firms.\nMatters came to a head for Mr Paredes personally, he claimed, when he was ordered by his manager to change the way in which defects were reported, in order to reduce their overall numbe",

That's the only thing we care about at the moment.\"\nThe UK Health Security Agency urged people affected by the fire to stay indoors, keep windows and doors closed and if driving nearby, turn off air conditioning and keep air vents closed.\nOne nearby resident posted on social media and said they had heard \"loads of explosions\" from the blaze as well as the noise of the fire engines.\nAnother user on X wrote that he had heard a \"series of explosions\" before the fire.\nAccording to its website, Super Smart Service was established in the West Midlands in 2015 and opened its Cannock warehouse in 2019, creating more than 300 jobs.\nThe firm said it provided warehousing and distribution services for online sellers and at full operational capacity it could process and dispatch 70,000 parcels each day.\nBuses were diverted due to the incident with operator Chaserider posting on social media: \"Due to the incident at the Orbital Retail Park we are having to divert service 3 via Lichfield Road, Cannock Road, Hednesford Road and Walsall Road.\n\"We are also unable to serve Jerome Road, meaning we will using Bettys Lanes and Red Lion Lane.\"\nThe fire was not affecting railway services and trains were still running through the area, West Midlands Railway said.\nWest Midlands Ambulance Service said it was called by the fire service at 06:36 BST but stood down its staff when they were told they were no longer needed. \nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X, and Instagram, Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk",
    "More than 30 serious criminals have been jailed after police cracked their encrypted text messages and uncovered a violent feud over stolen drugs.\nCrime bosses in the Huyton Firm had planned to murder the men they thought had taken more than \u00a31m of cocaine from them.\nAfter a successful challenge in court, BBC Panorama obtained 10,000 of the firm's messages.\nThey reveal plans for brutal violence, including a hand-grenade attack.\nThe Huyton Firm - named after the part of Merseyside where it is based - has been run for 30 years by two secretive brothers. Following the conclusion of a series of trials at Manchester Crown Court, they can now be identified as Vincent and Francis Coggins.\nThe brothers and others in the firm spoke freely on the EncroChat messaging system, believing their encrypted conversations were completely secure.\nTheir messages give a unique insight into the inner workings of an organised crime group, revealing that:\nMatt Horne, former deputy director of investigations at the National Crime Agency (NCA), told Panorama the gang's \"industrial-scale trafficking of drugs\" and willingness to resort to severe violence put them \"in the upper tiers of organised crime in the UK\".\nIn one message, Vincent Coggins threatened to torture a local businessman: \"then we deside weather we slash him ,chop his fingers off or wotever\". (All the crime group's messages are reproduced here with their original spelling and punctuation.)\nThe next day, he boasted about how he had slashed the man with a knife: \"slash across face an smashed his eyes in an took half an ear an tonge\".\nThe brutality of the Huyton Firm even shocked rivals in Liverpool's notoriously violent criminal underworld.\nOne anonymous source, who knows Vincent Coggins well, told Panorama that the crime gang were \"deeply hated\" by many people because of the \"level of depravity that they go to, to instil fear and terror\".\nThe messages talk about the Huyton Firm being helped by a corrupt police insider. The insider appears to have provided the crime group with printouts from the Police National Computer, that allowed the gangsters to see what detectives knew about them.\nMerseyside Police says a thorough and extensive investigation was conducted by the anti-corruption unit and no officers or staff were identified in relation to misuse of police systems.\nLike thousands of criminals around the world, the Huyton Firm thought the EncroChat software would keep their messages completely secure and their identities secret.\nBut French police cracked the encryption app and shared messages about 7,000 British criminals with the NCA in 2020.\nThe messages covered the period when one of the Huyton Firm's drug stash houses in Liverpool was robbed by rival gangsters.\nIn total, 32 serious criminals linked to the raid have now been convicted.\nVincent Coggins, who used the EncroChat handle \"Moonlitboat\", has been jailed for 28 years for drug trafficking and blackmail. \nOther jailed crime group members include enforcer Paul Woodford (24 years and six months), drug dealer Michael Earle (11 years) and money man Paul Fitzsimmons (12 years and six months).\nTheir convictions could not be reported until the completion of the trial of Edward Robert Jarvis - another major player in the Huyton Firm.\nHe was found guilty of drug trafficking and blackmail at Manchester Crown Court on Thursday.\nCrime boss Francis Coggins is on the run and believed to be abroad.\nPanorama's request for copies of the 10,000 messages from the Huyton Firm that had been used in court was initially turned down. But the programme obtained the messages after making an application to the judge.\nThey provide a vivid account of how the crime group tried to exact violent retribution after the cocaine heist.\nA young man makes a frantic 999 call from a semi-detached house on a residential street. He and his dad have just been attacked by masked men, armed with a machete and an axe.\nWhen police turn up, there is blood everywhere. The two men inside are keeping quiet. Nobody talks about the Huyton Firm. But this time the police have a secret weapon. \nThey have access to the messages that members of the crime group are sending each other. They show that 30kg of the Huyton Firm's cocaine has been stolen, a haul worth \u00a31m.\nThe gangsters are shocked that someone has dared to rob them. And they want revenge. \nThe user named Moonlitboat is giving the orders on EncroChat, demanding that the robbers are identified and killed.\nWhen police later identify him as Vincent Coggins, one of the pieces of evidence is a photo he had sent on EncroChat of his new coffee machine - identical to the one found in Coggins' home.\nThe day after the cocaine heist, Vincent Coggins gets his hands on CCTV of the robbery from a neighbour's house.\nThe footage shows three masked men getting out of a van. A fourth man was carrying a parcel, pretending to be a delivery driver. Within four minutes, they make their escape with the Huyton Firm's cocaine.\nThe g",
    "A County Durham MP has urged the government to address \"past injustices\" and reform mineworkers' pensions.\nLabour's Grahame Morris, who represents Easington, accused ministers of neglecting deprived communities, with some retired miners receiving just \u00a310 a month under the current scheme.\nOn Wednesday, former miners and their families marched on Downing Street, claiming some were \"dying in poverty\".\nThe government said pension scheme members had received payments that were 33% higher than they would have been, due to a guarantee they would go up with inflation. \nIn 1994, a privatisation agreement was signed meaning the government would get half of any surplus cash from a miners' pension scheme, in return for guaranteeing that pensions would increase. \nThe government confirmed it had received \u00a34.8bn from the scheme over the last 30 years.\nCampaigners believe the figure is closer to \u00a38bn, and marched to Downing Street to demand the surplus cash back.\nFormer miners said, after a tough working life, they did not expect to spend their retirement campaigning.\nBert Moncur, a former Murton Colliery miner, said: \"When you look at a widow who hasn't got enough money to bury her husband, there's nothing there for these people.\n\"Many miners are dying in poverty, in this day and age, this should not be happening.\"\nMr Morris told the Commons on Thursday: \"My father died in the belief that his pit pension would provide security for my aging mother - who is incidentally celebrating her 88th birthday on Sunday.\n\"However, we do know that some pensioners receive as little as \u00a310 a week from the Mineworkers' Pension Scheme. Our miners created the wealth that made this country great, with the Mineworkers' Pension Scheme being amongst the UK's largest pension funds.\"\nHe continued: \"This money should be used to enhance pensions, it wouldn't only provide extra security in retirement, but would support our local economies, coalfield communities, employment and small businesses.\"\nThe government added members of the scheme also received bonuses in addition to their guaranteed pensions.\nAdditional reporting by PA Media\nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "A barrister who worked for a firm advising the Post Office says he was \u201cmisled and deceived\u201d by them about evidence in the key case of sub-postmistress Seema Misra.\nSimon Clarke from the law firm Cartwright King played a crucial role in bringing those prosecutions to an end.\nHe was giving evidence at the Horizon Inquiry, which aims to explain how hundreds of sub-postmasters were falsely accused of taking money from the tills, using evidence from a flawed computer system\nMr Clarke told the inquiry about how he came to realise that a key expert witness was not sharing information about software bugs that caused accounting discrepancies.\nIn frank and often self-critical testimony, Mr Clarke admitted that hearing about the bugs had been a \u201cbombshell\u201d.\nMore than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly convicted for theft and false accounting using evidence from the faulty computer system.\nIt appears few people played a more pivotal role than Gareth Jenkins.\nThe senior engineer from Fujitsu was a key architect of the flawed IT system which ran in every Post Office across the UK, and he provided expert evidence in several court cases testifying that the system was robust.\nHis evidence was pivotal in the case of Seema Misra, the sub-postmistress from West Byfleet in Surrey who was sent to jail in 2010 - while pregnant \u2013 for alleged theft.\nOn Thursday, the Horizon Inquiry was shown a transcript of a phone call, during which the barrister Mr Clarke discussed what Gareth Jenkins knew about the software bugs. Mr Clarke's law firm, Cartwright King, was working with the Post Office at the time.\nThe transcript confirmed that Mr Jenkins knew of two bugs in the Horizon system, and that he could not be sure there were not more. It indicated that he must have known of the bugs earlier because he had informed the independent investigators Second Sight that they existed.\nA few weeks later Mr Clarke wrote formal legal advice to the Post Office which warned that Mr Jenkins had failed to disclose information \u201cin plain breach of his duty as an expert witness\", and this put the Post Office \u201cin breach of its duty as a prosecutor\u201d.\nA lawyer for Mr Jenkins told the BBC in March it would be \"inappropriate\" for him to comment ahead of him giving evidence to the Inquiry in June.\nHowever, despite raising these doubts over Mr Jenkins\u2019 testimony, Mr Clarke advised the Post Office that the information did not have to be disclosed to lawyers representing  Mrs Misra.\nThat information would have allowed her to mount an \u201cirresistible\u201d appeal against her conviction, and would have helped defendants in other cases too, lawyers at the Inquiry suggested.\nMr Clarke said Post Office lawyers never showed him all the documents from the Misra trial.\nHe said he had asked \u201con a number of occasions\u201d to see the file of documents relating to the trial.\n\u201cI came to the conclusion that it was deliberately withheld from me,\u201d he said.\nHe said he was \u201cmisled\u201d by the Post Office over whether there were other Horizon bugs, too.\nWhen he joined the Post Office in 2013, Mr Clarke said he asked for a copy of the Post Office\u2019s prosecution policy \u2013 the rules they used to decide whether to proceed with prosecutions against sub-postmasters.\nWhat came back was a \u201csingle A4 document, badly photocopied\u201d, he told the Inquiry. \u201cI can\u2019t remember what it said, but it wasn\u2019t a prosecution policy,\u201d he said.\nHe proposed a revised version based on the Crown Prosecution Service\u2019s policy, and was disappointed when what he called a \u201cwatered-down\u201d version was adopted.\n\nLater in 2013 Mr Clarke wrote another memo warning that the Post Office was destroying evidence of Horizon bugs raised in regular \"hub\" meetings, convened to pool knowledge of problems with the system. He advised that the practice must stop.\nHe was asked about why he carried on working for the Post Office, once he knew about Gareth Jenkins\u2019s situation and the shredding of evidence about the bugs.\n\u201cI am a bit old-fashioned about this,\u201d he said. \u201cBarristers don\u2019t just walk away from their clients when life gets difficult.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s trite,\u201d he said, but he kept working for the Post Office \u201cin the hope that I could do some good for them.\u201d\nThe inquiry continues.",
    "A self-styled \"eunuch maker\" who mutilated paying customers and streamed it online has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 22 years.\nMarius Gustavson admitted offences including five counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.\nHe was described at a three-day sentencing at the Old Bailey as \"a lunatic\", \"an arch-manipulator\" and \"a butcher\".\nThe Norwegian, 46, ran a lucrative business in extreme body modifications.\nWarning: Contains graphic descriptions\nJudge Mark Lucraft KC said Gustavson had been the mastermind of the \"gruesome and grisly\", \"large-scale\" and \"extremely dangerous\" enterprise.\n\"On one occasion Gustavson cooked what appeared to be human testicles which were then plated to be eaten, and kept other body parts as 'trophies',\" he said.\nJudge Lucraft told the court he was \"entirely satisfied\" that the motivation \"was a mix of sexual gratification as well as financial reward\".\nSome of what happened was \"little short of human butchery\", he said.\nThe court heard how the defendant's \"Eunuchmaker\" pay-per-view website advertised services including castration, penis removal and the freezing of limbs.\nThe Old Bailey was also told how Gustavson got others to perform procedures on him, including having a nipple and his penis removed and a leg frozen.\nThe website showed the defendant and his medically unqualified accomplices - six of whom were sentenced alongside him - performing a series of operations in London flats and hotel rooms on apparently willing volunteers. Some were as young as 16.\nSometimes it all went badly wrong. The court heard several recordings of 999 calls in which Gustavson calmly lied to the operator about how his victims had in fact injured themselves.\nIn January, three men were sentenced after admitting causing grievous bodily harm to Gustavson.\nIn his defence, Gustavson's legal team claimed he only wanted to \"put a smile on people's faces\" by offering a service to those suffering, like him, from what was described as body integrity dysphoria (BID).\nHowever, prosecution barrister Caroline Carberry KC told the court: \"We suggest that diagnosis - if it exists - may explain why it is Mr Gustavson acted as he did to have his own body maimed and mutilated, but does not explain why he made a lucrative business out of mutilating others.\"\nGustavson earned almost \u00a3300,000 from his website, having amassed 22,841 visitors from across the globe who paid to view the gruesome footage, the court heard.\nSubscribers who paid the yearly \u00a3100 subscription would be entitled to VIP status, while victims were promised money from the video revenue.\nCourt documents also showed Gustavson used his business to sell human tissue gathered from the procedures, with references to a \"buy it now\" button.\nIn the end it was the bravery of one of Gustavson's victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, that led to the website being taken down.\nIn 2020, the participant told Devon & Cornwall Police about the procedures carried out on him, and provided a USB stick that contained 5,000 WhatsApp messages, 100 images and a number of videos.\nHe told police how he had been \"high on drugs\" when Gustavson had first cut him with a scalpel at his flat in Haringey, north London, and how he was strapped to a bed and electrocuted.\nIn later procedures the man told police how he had his testicles clamped and how Gustavson had used a red-hot iron designed by the victim to brand him with the initials EM - which stood for eunuch maker.\nIn a victim impact statement read to the court, the man described how he had been \"mesmerised\" by Gustavson, but now recognised he had needed to see a psychiatrist \"not a back-street surgeon\".\n\"I realise I have trusted a wrong person and Gustavson is in fact a lunatic.\"\nThe thousands of messages handed to police revealed how Gustavson was an \"arch-manipulator of victims\", who may have consented to the procedures but were themselves vulnerable, the prosecution said.\nHaving pleaded guilty to a series of charges including conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent, making and distributing indecent images of a child and possessing extreme pornography, Gustavson did not need to give evidence at a trial.\nInvestigations by journalists into Gustavson's background in Norway, and from what his defence team claimed at court, make it possible to trace how the once-respectable community figure descended into a spiral of criminality.\nOriginally from a small town to the south-west of Oslo, Gustavson was a postal worker and the chair of an LGBT charity, known for organising Pride weekends as well as the traditional \"Russ\" celebrations - a series of events and parties high school students enjoy before their final exams.\nBut by 1999 he had received a suspended prison sentence for a fraud committed against a housing co-operative and in 2001 he was sentenced to eight months for internet fraud.\nDefence barrister Rashvinderjeet Panesar said Gustavson's marriage in 2005 kept him \"stable\" but it broke do",
    "A brewery that pumps out two million pints a day is celebrating a major milestone.\nThe Carlsberg brewery in Northampton was officially opened 50 years ago on 10 May 1974.\nIt is thought to have produced about 28 billion pints over the last half century.\nThe famous National Lift Tower in the town is being lit up to mark the occasion.\nLager was still a relatively new phenomenon in the UK when the engineering firm Arup and the Danish architect Knud Munk were commissioned to create a new brewery in Northampton that would \"express the best in modern Danish architecture\".\nThe cost of the project was \u00a315m.\nThe River Nene was diverted to create space for the huge concrete building which was inspired by a Danish longboat. \nIt won architectural awards, even if the brutalist style was not to everyone's taste.\nBrewing had started on site in 1973, but the official opening was performed on 10 May 1974 by Princess Benedikte of Denmark who is said to enjoy a cool beer before bed.\nThe plant got bigger over the years, with a major expansion in 2013 increasing brewery output by a third.\nIt now employs about 230 people and runs an engineering apprenticeship scheme for new recruits to the industry.\nTo celebrate the 50th anniversary, the brewery and its rival for dominance of the skyline, the 418-foot National Lift Tower, will light up in Carlsberg green on Friday and Saturday.\nA ceremony has already taken place to bury a time capsule containing historic and modern items from the brewery, with instructions for it to be opened to mark the centenary.\nAn abseil down the lift tower is being organised for staff to mark this year's 50th anniversary of Northampton Hope Centre.\nJacob Aarup-Andersen, the chief executive of Carlsberg Group, said: \u201cAs the first brewery Carlsberg built outside of Denmark in Europe, the Carlsberg Brewery in Northampton holds a special place in our history.\"\nCarlsberg - known for its famous \"If Carlsberg did...\" advertising slogan, was founded in 1847 in Copenhagen, Denmark.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A ban on sex offenders in England and Wales changing their name to avoid detection will be brought in, the government has confirmed.\nLast year the BBC revealed more than 700 sex offenders had slipped off the radar of police over three years, many due to an identity change.\nLabour MP Sarah Champion has been campaigning for the change, which has now been accepted by the Home Office.\nShe is MP for Rotherham, where a child abuse scandal was exposed in 2016.\nThe measure was first announced by Suella Braverman, the then home secretary, at the Conservative Party Conference in October.\nOn Thursday, Safeguarding Minister Laura Farris confirmed the amendment will be included in the upcoming Criminal Justice Bill.\nFollowing the announcement Ms Champion posted on social media: \"My mind is slightly blown\".\nShe congratulated campaigners and added: \"Amazing!

    "About 1,750 people in the UK are living with an undiagnosed hepatitis C infection after being given a transfusion with contaminated blood, according to BBC analysis.\nOfficial documents, seen by BBC News, reveal how the UK government and the NHS failed to adequately trace those who were most at risk of having the virus.\nThey show how officials slowed detection rates and even sought to keep public awareness of the virus low.\nUp to 27,000 people were exposed to hepatitis C after having blood transfusions in the 1970s, 80s and 90s.\nThe true scale of undiagnosed cases is based on BBC analysis of statistics submitted to the Infected Blood Inquiry by an expert panel, as well as Freedom of Information requests to infected blood support schemes.\nBBC News can reveal for the first time how the UK government and the NHS actively tried to limit the public's awareness of the virus to avoid embarrassing \"bottlenecks\" at liver units. Testing was limited because of \"resource implications for the NHS\". \n\"Raising awareness poses undoubted difficulties for the NHS,\" an internal government note from the 1990s says. \"In terms of value for money, there may be better candidates for additional resources.\" The document has been added to the inquiry's website.\nRather than prioritising care for those harmed by NHS-provided blood, officials squeezed budgets as cost concerns took precedence over patient safety. \nEven though it wasn't formally identified until 1989, health officials and NHS staff recognised that this form of hepatitis could be fatal as early as 1980. \nBut they chose to delay \"look back\" programmes until 1995, which further hampered efforts to track down people who may have been infected, reducing their chances of receiving treatment before permanent liver damage was caused.\nAs NHS funding for hepatitis remained limited, and awareness low, victims told BBC News how they felt doctors patronised and ignored them instead of offering tests and support.  \nKnown as the \"silent killer\", hepatitis C may cause few symptoms initially, with early signs including night sweats, brain fog, itchy skin and fatigue. But for every year a person carries the virus, their chance of dying from liver cirrhosis and related cancers increases. \nThe infected blood scandal is one of the biggest treatment disasters in NHS history - 3,000 people who were infected with HIV and hepatitis C after being given contaminated blood products have died.\u202f \nMany of the victims were haemophiliacs, who were given infected blood products as part of their treatment.\nBut many thousands more were given transfusions using contaminated blood after accidents, emergencies or childbirth.\nThe Hep C Trust says, on average, two people a month call its helpline following a diagnosis as a result of a blood transfusion more than 30 years ago. More often than not, they say their prognosis is dire. \nVictoria's mother, Maureen Arkley, was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and hepatitis C in September last year. \nBy the following month, it was clear she had untreatable liver cancer. \nMaureen had an operation in 1976 involving multiple blood transfusions. They were noted on her medical records, but at no stage was she contacted by her GP or anyone in the NHS about the fact she might have been exposed to hepatitis. \nYears later, in 2008, she began having pains in her abdomen. Tests were eventually done in 2010, including an ultrasound but the consultant concluded nothing was wrong. She wasn't tested for Hep C. \nMaureen passed away in February, five months after she was diagnosed - and 47 years after she had the blood transfusion that infected her. \n\"The end was utterly horrific, she weighed less than four stone when she died,\" says Victoria. She says her mother felt there was a stigma attached to the virus. \"She was very ashamed and hid from it. \n\"I work in social care but we just didn't make the link there was a chance someone with a blood transfusion could have been infected with hepatitis C. Where was the public health campaign? Why didn't the doctor test her?  \n\"They knew she had had transfusions, but no one tested her. I'm so angry,\" says Victoria.\nIn 1973, a Blood Transfusion Service booklet was released warning of the risks of hepatitis. Over the next 20 years, it became common knowledge that blood transfusions carried the risk of infecting patients with hepatitis. \nBut, despite this, it was not until 1995 that the UK government began a look-back exercise to find people who may have been infected by contaminated blood transfusions decades earlier.\nOther countries, including the US, started their process years before.\nHospital trusts were tasked with looking through medical records, but without funding, efforts were limited. Some people were traced but there was a postcode lottery when it came to treatments and counselling.\nA year after the exercise began, an official report noted that \"increased testing has resource implications for the NHS\".

    "Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed Israel can \"stand alone\", after the US warned arms shipments could be stopped if he orders a full-scale invasion of Rafah in Gaza.\nThousands of people have already fled the southern city after the Israeli military began what it called a \"limited\" operation on Monday.\nUS President Joe Biden has repeatedly warned against the operation, saying that it would cross a \"red line\".\nBut Mr Netanyahu dismissed the US warning, saying Israel would fight on.\n\"If we need to ... we will stand alone. I have said that if necessary we will fight with our fingernails,\" the prime minister said. \nMr Netanyahu also invoked the war of 1948 - where the newly formed State of Israel was attacked by a coalition of Arab states - to dismiss the US warnings. \n\"In the War of Independence 76 years ago, we were the few against the many,\" he said. \"We did not have weapons. There was an arms embargo on Israel, but with great strength of spirit, heroism and unity among us - we were victorious.\"\nDespite Mr Netanyahu's comments, his government has come under pressure after the US suspended the delivery of 1,800 2,000lb (907kg) bombs and 1,700 500lb bombs over fears that they could cause civilian deaths in Rafah. \nMr Biden went further still in an interview with CNN on Wednesday, saying that if the attack went ahead he would further suspend supplies of artillery shells and other weapons. \nYoav Gallant, Mr Netanyahu's defence minister, dismissed the US warnings, saying Israel's \"enemies as well as ... best of friends\" should understand that his country \"cannot be subdued\". \n\"We will stand strong, we will achieve our goals,\" he added. \nThe comments came hours after the UN said more than 80,000 people had fled Rafah since Monday amid constant bombardment and as Israeli tanks massed close to built-up areas.\nThe UN also warned that food and fuel were running out for the more than one million still sheltering in the city, because it was not receiving aid through nearby crossings.\nIsraeli troops took control and closed the Rafah crossing with Egypt at the start of their operation, while the UN said it was too dangerous for its staff and lorries to reach the reopened Kerem Shalom crossing with Israel.\nIsraeli forces said they were conducting \"targeted raids\" against Hamas elements remaining in the city. However, the Israeli government has refused to rule out a full scale invasion, leading to Mr Biden's warning he would not supply it with the munitions to do so.\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby said Mr Biden did not believe \"smashing into Rafah\" would advance Israel's objective of defeating Hamas.\n\"An enduring defeat of Hamas certainly remains the Israeli goal, and we share that goal with them,\" Mr Kirby said. \n\"The argument that somehow we're walking away from Israel, or we're not willing to help them defeat Hamas just doesn't comport with the facts,\" he said.\nPalestinian media said two people were killed on Thursday afternoon in an Israeli air strike in the al-Jneineh neighbourhood of Rafah - one of the eastern areas which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ordered residents to evacuate before beginning its ground operation began on Monday night.\nAnother three people were reportedly killed in an air strike in the nearby Brazil area, which is not in the evacuation zone but is next to the Egyptian border.\nHamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) - which are proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the US and other countries - said they were targeting Israeli forces on the eastern outskirts with mortar bombs and anti-tank missiles.\nHamas also said it had blown up a booby-trapped tunnel east of Rafah underneath three Israeli military vehicles. The IDF said three of its soldiers were moderately wounded as a result of the explosion.\nOvernight, at least five people were reportedly killed when a family's home in the western Tal al-Sultan neighbourhood was hit in an Israeli strike. They included three children, one of them a one-year-old infant, medics said.\nMeanwhile hopes of a peace deal - which seemed close earlier in the week before Israel said it did not past muster - appeared to be fading. Both Israeli and Hamas delegations left indirect talks in Cairo on Thursday.\nAfter seven months of war in Gaza, Israel insists victory is impossible without taking the city of Rafah and eliminating the last remaining Hamas battalions.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities.\nMore than 34,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nIsrael says 128 hostages are unaccounted for, 36 of whom are presumed dead.",
    "A botanic garden has been tracking the effects of climate change on nature as part of an initiative. \nThe Phenology Project at Cambridge University Botanic Garden has been monitoring 90 marked trees and woody plants in the gardens since 2020.\nPhenology - the study of seasonal changes in plants and animals from year-to-year - can help researchers understand how wildlife and plants respond to environmental change.\nRosemary Fricker, the project's coordinator, said: \"We want to know if our trees are actually suffering because of climate change.\"\nSpecies such as oaks and birch cherry have come into leaf and flowered earlier this year, she added. \n\"A lot of people now talk about spring coming earlier and seeing flowers out.\n\"Here in the botanic garden we've got a fantastic resource with all these trees, so we'd like to find a bit of evidence to see if climate change is affecting the seasonal changes of our plants.\n\"Phenology literally means the study of cycles in plants. For us it's seasonal cycles.\"\nStaff and volunteers have carried out weekly monitoring and collected data when the trees and shrubs come into leaf. They also record when the flowers open, fruit ripens and when leaves tint and fall at the end of the year.\n\"We need evidence that climate change is affecting our trees, but our questions are actually bigger than that,\" said Ms Fricker.\n\"We want to know if our trees are actually suffering because of climate change. \n\"We're also very interested in what happens in autumn, because if the leaves are staying on the trees longer, it means they're having a longer active season [and] they don't have as long a rest period as they would have if they had enough winter, and so therefore does that stress the trees?\"\nMs Fricker added that with recent winters now more mild and wet, and spring arriving earlier, the project is focusing on responses from the species.\n\"As the climate changes, the trees that are naturally from equatorial regions might like it better, so they thrive in our garden,\" said Ms Fricker.\n\"It might have to change what we do in the botanic gardens in the future.\"\nEdward Chang is studying for an ecology masters with the Department of Plant Sciences at Cambridge University.\nHe said he was particularly interested in hawthorn as it is a native species.\n\"I think its a good idea to see the variance between the plants themselves and see how the differences average out.\"\n\"We know that the world is changing, temperatures going up, there are also insects and plants doing different things.\n\"We need to get a better understand of this and at the same time, try to bring that [knowledge] back into the community.\"\nSally Petitt, the head of horticulture at the botanic garden, said the data would be valuable in helping her team manage their collections.\nShe said: \"I was talking to a colleague this morning and asking should we be growing Chinese woodland species in a changing climate, will they actually adapt?\"\n\"At a botanic garden we want to grow representatives from across the globe, but should we also be focusing on the plants we can grow well?\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A company owned by GB News investor Sir Paul Marshall has lost a legal battle with South Africa over \u00a334m ($42m) worth of salvaged silver.\nIn 2017, Argentum Exploration LTD raised the silver from a World War Two-era shipwreck in the Indian Ocean and took it to the UK, launching a claim for salvage.\nSouth Africa argued it was theirs and was originally intended to be made into coins.\nThe ship, SS Tilawa, was torpedoed by Japan in November 1942 as it travelled to east Africa from India during the height of the global conflict. \n\nMore than 950 passengers were travelling on board the ship when it was targeted, with 280 people being killed. \nThe silver was sold by the government of India to be turned into coins for South Africa and Egypt. \nOver 70 years later Argentum - which takes advantage of improvements in technology to explore previously inaccessible wrecks - found the ship 2.5km (4 miles) below the surface and spent six months retrieving the silver. \nAccording to Companies House, Argentum Exploration Ltd is majority owned by Sir Paul, who was a leading investor in GB News when it launched in 2021. Last month he stepped down from the board of the broadcaster's parent company amid reports that he was preparing a bid for The Daily Telegraph newspaper. \nWhen the silver was brought to Southampton, Argentum declared it to Receiver of Wreck, a government official responsible for identifying and trying to trace the ownership of any artefacts from the seabed in UK waters - or brought into the country from elsewhere.\nIt was at this point South Africa claimed ownership of the silver, but Argentum said that as the salvor, it is entitled to claim payment for the salvage. \nMaritime law allows salvors to make payment claims, regardless of whether the owner of the property asked for it to be salvaged or not. In this case, South Africa did not ask for Argentum to retrieve the silver. \nClaims can either be made towards the item's owner or Argentum's case \"in rem\", which means a right to arrest the property in question. \nBoth the UK Court of Appeal and High Court ruled in favour of Argentum's claim, despite South Africa claiming immunity as a sovereign state.\nSouth Africa then took the case to the Supreme Court, with the argument hinging on whether the silver was to be used for \"commercial purposes\" at the time of the sinking, which Argentum claimed it was. \nAccording to South Africa, the silver was not being used for commercial use, which the Supreme Court unanimously agreed with. \nThis decision from the Supreme Court means that South Africa is immune from Argentums claim against the silver. \n",
    "Venezuela may be the first nation in modern history to lose all its glaciers after climate scientists downgraded its last one to an ice field.\nThe International Cryosphere Climate Initiative (ICCI), a scientific advocacy organisation, said on X that the South American nation's only remaining glacier - the Humboldt, or La Corona, in the Andes - had become \"too small to be classed as a glacier\".\nVenezuela has lost at least six other glaciers in the last century.\nWith global average temperatures rising due to climate change, ice loss is increasing, helping to raise sea levels around the world.\n\"There has not been much ice cover on the last Venezuelan glacier since the 2000s\", Dr Caroline Clason, a glaciologist at Durham University, told Newsround. \"Now it's not being added to, so it has been reclassified as an ice field.\"\nIn March, researchers at the University of Los Andes in Colombia told AFP the glacier had shrunk from 450 hectares to just two.\nLuis Daniel Llambi, an ecologist at the university, told the Guardian that it had now shrunk to less than that.\nWhile there is no global standard for the minimum size a body of ice must be to qualify as a glacier, the US Geological Survey says a commonly accepted guideline is around 10 hectares.\nOne study, published in 2020, suggested the glacier shrank to less than this sometime between 2015 and 2016 - though it was still considered Venezuela's last glacier by Nasa in 2018.\nDr James Kirkham and Dr Miriam Jackson, glaciologists with the ICCI and the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development respectively, explained that \"glaciologists recognise a glacier as an ice mass that deforms under its own weight\".\nThey told the BBC in a joint statement: \"Glaciologists often use a criteria of 0.1 sq km [10 hectares] as a common definition, but any ice mass above that size still has to deform under its own weight [to count].\"\nThey suggested that there may have been issues accessing the Humboldt glacier in recent years, which could have delayed the publication of the measurements.\nProfessor Mark Maslin, a professor of earth system sciences at University College London, said an ice field like the Humboldt - roughly equivalent to the area of two football pitches - \"is not a glacier\".\n\"Glaciers are ice that fills valleys \u2013 that\u2019s the definition \u2013 and therefore I would say Venezuela has no glaciers whatsoever,\" he told the BBC.\nIn December, the Venezuelan government announced a project to cover the remaining ice with a thermal blanket it hoped would stem or reverse the thawing process.\nBut the move drew criticism from local climate scientists, who warned that the covering could contaminate the surrounding habitat with plastic particles as it degraded, according to Spanish newspaper El Pais.\nProf Maslin said mountain glacier loss was \"not directly reversible\" as to survive through the summer months they needed enough ice to reflect sunlight and keep the air around it cool.\n\"Once a glacier\u2019s gone, the sunlight heats the ground, makes it much warmer and makes it much less likely to actually build ice up over the summer,\" he said.\nMaximiliano Herrera, an extreme weather researcher, wrote on X/Twitter that the next countries that were likely to become glacier-free were Indonesia, Mexico and Slovenia.\nProf Maslin said these suggested nations \"make logical sense\" because of their relative proximity to the equator and relatively low-lying mountains, which made their ice caps more susceptible to global warming.\n\"The warm zones are just expanding upwards and outwards with climate change,\" he said, pushing the point at which snow and ice can form year-round higher.\nThe author of several books on climate change said these smaller glaciers \u2013 like the one recently lost in Venezuela \u2013 did not contain enough ice to substantially raise sea levels when they melt. But in some regions, glaciers play a crucial role in supplying communities with fresh water, particularly during hot, dry periods.\n\"Once you get rid of that, the problem is you\u2019re then purely reliant on spot rainfall,\" he said.\nDr Kirkham and Dr Jackson said: \"The latest projections show that between 20 and 80% of glaciers globally will be lost by 2100 (with significant regional variation), depending on the emissions pathway followed.\"\nThey said that even though \"a portion of this loss is already locked in\", rapidly lowering CO2 emissions could save other glacial deposits, \"which will have enormous benefits for livelihoods, and energy, water and food security\".",
    "A man whose photo of a dress bought for his wedding \"broke the internet\" has admitted violently assaulting his wife. \nA court heard how Keir Johnston, 38, pinned his wife Grace to the ground, choking her, and brandished a knife at their home on a small Scottish island. \nThe couple received global media attention nine years ago when a picture of a dress worn by the mother-of-the bride at their wedding sparked an internet debate over its colour. \nPeople were divided over whether it was black and blue or white and gold. The dress was really black and blue, but some people viewing the poor quality snapshot perceived it differently.\nThe couple went on to appear on the Ellen DeGeneres Show in the USA, where they were handed $10,000 and a luxury trip to Grenada.\nBut the High Court in Glasgow heard that Johnston had a history of abusing his wife. \nProsecutor Chris Macintosh told the court that on 6 March 2022 Johnston had been drinking at a pub quiz on the Isle of Colonsay in the Inner Hebrides. \nHis wife - who had been elsewhere  - returned home after receiving strange texts from him complaining that she did not do enough to support him. \nShe found him asleep at the cottage but he woke up and told her he was going to leave her. \nWhen she went outside, he followed her and pinned her to the ground with his knees on her arms. \n\"He then began strangling her with both his hands,\" said Mr Macintosh. \n\"She was initially able to scream. She feared for her life and believed Johnston intended to kill her. He was very forceful.\"\nA witness heard her screams and tried to pull Johnston away.\nHe initially stopped and went back inside - but stormed back out threatening to \"finish\" his wife \"off\", before again choking her.  He was also seen clutching a knife. \nMrs Johnston sent text messages to her friends asking for help, the court was told. \nShe eventually dialled 999 and told the operator: \"My husband is trying to kill me.\"\nShe suffered visible bruising to her neck during the attack. \nJohnston, a petrol station attendant now living in Moffat, Dumfries and Galloway, was expected to face trial but changed his plea and admitted assaulting his wife to her injury and the danger of life. \nThrough his lawyer, he applied for continued bail, but the judge Lady Drummond remanded him in custody, pending sentence. \nShe told him: \"You repeatedly strangled her, injured her and put her life in danger in what must have been absolutely terrifying circumstances for her.\n\"I am afraid, Mr Johnston, that your status has now changed, you have been convicted of a very serious crime and you will be remanded meantime.\"",
    "The Bank of England boss has weighed in on a row over whether the UK economy is recovering from the cost-of-living crisis.\nAndrew Bailey told the BBC that the UK economy had \"turned a corner\".\nHe made the comments ahead of figures due out on Friday expected to confirm that the UK is no longer in recession.\nThe government has pressed the case that the economy has turned around, but Labour has described such views as \"delusional\". \nThe debate about the strength of the economic recovery is set to be a central battleground in the general election campaign.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has previously said that the economy had \"turned a corner\" - but many households' budgets remain under pressure.\nEarlier this week, Labour shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, accused the government of misleading people over the state of the economy, saying suggestions that the feel-good factor is returning were \"completely out of touch with the realities on the ground\".\nAsked whether, as suggested by Ms Reeves, the suggestions of a turnaround amounted to \"gaslighting\" the British people, Mr Bailey replied: \"We set out our best judgement of what we see.\"\n\"All the evidence we see is that we have turned a corner from that. I don't, however, want to sort of portray it as a strong recovery... that isn't what we are seeing, but we are now seeing a recovery, and we seemed to have turned a corner.\"\nAfter the Bank of England held interest rates at 5.25% for the sixth time in a row on Thursday, Mr Bailey said he was \"very encouraged\" by easing price rises, but added the Bank had to see more evidence that inflation would fall to 2% and stay there before cuting interest rates.\nOfficial figures on Friday are expected to show the economy has grown in the first three months of 2024. The Bank has forecast 0.4% growth for this period, which would mark the end of the recession at the end of last year.\n\"It looks like it was by quite a long way the mildest recession,\" said Mr Bailey.\nThe governor said the UK economy was now going into a \"gradual growth phase\" - not a \"strong recovery\" - but that there was \"good news\" in household incomes increasing. \nDarren Jones, Labour shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said while it was the Bank of England's \"independent right\" to set interest rates, interest rates remaining at 5.25% was \"bad news for people at home having to reset their mortgages for the years ahead at a more expensive rate and people to have to pay rent for their homes\".\nHe added households were \"not feeling any uptick, when they are told by Conservatives ministers doing victory laps this week that the country has turned a corner, when it hasn't\".\nMr Bailey also said that there could be more interest rate cuts than expected over the next year or so, pointing to a \"somewhat lower path of interest rates\" being required in order to hit the Bank's 2% inflation target. \nHe added he was \"somewhat puzzled\" that market interest rates, including mortgage rates, had started to rise, following developments in the US markets.\n\"The dynamics of inflation in this country are different to the US,\" he said.",
    "Spotify says music by UK recording artists generated \u00a3750 million in royalties on its platform last year.\nAlmost 1,000 artists were played often enough to generate at least \u00a3100,000 in royalties each, the company added.\nThe figures were revealed as part of Spotify's \"Loud and Clear\" campaign, which aims to provide transparency on how it pays the music industry.\nHowever, the company is unable to say how much of those royalty payments actually goes to musicians.\nThat's because every artist has a different contract with their record label and publishers, which determines how the money is divided. \nThe artist's share is often around 16%, a committee of MPs heard in 2021.\nThat would mean an artist whose music generated \u00a3100,000 on Spotify might only receive \u00a316,000 in royalty payments, before tax.\nHowever, Spotify is not the only source of revenue. \nThe Swedish company has about a 50% share of the UK music streaming market, according to the CMA, which means artists could make the same amount again via platforms like Apple Music, Amazon Music and Tidal.\nEd Sheeran was the most popular British artist on Spotify last year, with his songs played 6.35 billion times.\nColdplay came second with 5.58 billion streams, followed by Harry Styles with 5.11 billion streams.\nHowever, British artists were unable to crack Spotify's Top 10 most-played chart, which was topped by Taylor Swift (on 29 billion streams) and also featured Puerto Rican star Bad Bunny, Mexico's Peso Pluma and Colombia's Karol G.\n\nThe shift suggests that speaking English is no longer a pre-requisite for global music success. \nMore than half the artists who generated $10,000 (\u00a38,000) on Spotify last year are from countries where English is not the first language, the company said.\nEnglish is still the top language for music globally, accounting for 54.9% of the top 10,000 songs. But its share of the market is falling, with languages like Hindi and Japanese making gains.\n\"It's really interesting time for music,\" said Spotify UK's head of artists and industry partnerships, Bryan Johnson. \n\"In the past few years, we've seen genres like K-pop and Amapiano take off, and now Music Mexicana is really starting to travel. \n\"The choice now for fans and listeners is incredible.\"\nHe noted that 75% of all the royalties paid to UK artists came from international listeners - suggesting there is still a \"huge export opportunity\" as the streaming market matures.\nJohnson added that independent artists and labels received 40% of the UK's royalty payments - a total of \u00a3300 million.\nThey typically receive a higher share of the proceeds, with artists who self-release music (ie without the help of a record label or distributor) sometimes keeping 100% of the income their songs generate.\n\nHowever, Spotify has come under fire recently for demonetising songs with fewer than1,000 streams.\nThat means the copyright holders will not be paid at all, if the song falls below that threshold in a 12-month period.  \nCritics have complained that the policy means will \"enrich the top of the pyramid\" and starve working musicians of money.\nBut Johnson said the policy was designed to filter out \"spam\", and thwart fraudulent activity. \nSpotify has previously noted that 1,000 plays only generates a \"micro-payment\" of around $0.25 (\u00a30.20) that artists rarely see - because distributors often set a minimum threshold before artists can withdraw money.\nIn 2024, the company expects that the new policy will divert $40 million (\u00a332 million) to more popular songs.\n\"This is not something that Spotify takes,\" said Johnson. \"The money goes back into the pool... to emerging and professional artists.\"\nThis year marks the first time that Spotify has disclosed its figures for UK payouts. It says the total of \u00a3750 million has doubled since 2017.\nEarlier this year, the company announced it had paid $9 billion (\u00a37.2 billion) in royalties worldwide last year, making it the biggest single contributor to the music industry's revenues.\nYouTube, once the thorn in the industry's side, is thought to be the industry's second largest source of income. \nIn February, it said it had paid out $6 billion (\u00a34.8 billion) to rights-holders last year.",

    "Jersey has been celebrating its 79th Liberation Day, marking the day the island was freed from occupation.\nOn 9 May each year the island celebrates the end of occupation and the end of World War Two.\nThe Channel Islands were the only part of the British Isles to be occupied by German forces during the war.\nThis year's celebrations include a service of thanksgiving, music, dancing and a re-enactment of the British soldiers landing in Jersey.\nA special States meeting took place at 10:30 BST, where Chief Minister Lyndon Farnham delivered a Liberation Day address.\nHe described the stories he heard about the occupation from his family.\nHe said: \u201cIt was hearsay on 28 June 1940 that they remember the three of them on the beach looking for sand eels when German bombers flew over at low level - so low in fact that they could clearly see the pilot in the cockpit.\n\u201cThey ran up to the perceived safety of the summerhouse and heard the bombs falling on La Rocque, and then St Helier.\u201d\nMr Farnham said his family remembered \u201csecretly listening to radio broadcasts from London\u201d, and his grandparents \u201cgoing without\u201d so the children could eat.\nHe said: \u201cFor the rest of his days my father always ate everything on his plate which impressed me as a child -  I watched with a slight bewilderment as he ate plate after plate of unappetising looking greens, \u2018we would have been glad of these during the war\u2019, he used to say.\u201d\nThe meeting was followed by a procession from the Royal Square to Liberation Square, consisting of the Bailiff, the Lieutenant governor, States members and other senior officials.\nThe Musical Originals choir sang at Liberation Square prior to the Bailiff\u2019s speech.\nIn his speech, Sir Tim Le Cocq recognised the spirit of service in Jersey by honouring those who contributed to the island.\nHe said: \u201cFrom the front-line workers who serve to keep us safe to the volunteers who lend a helping hand to those in need, to those wherever they are from who would not consider themselves as anything out of the ordinary, but who all embody the spirit of community in their everyday lives.\n\u201cOn a lighter note even our traffic system has a unique filter in turn rule that relies upon taking turns and courtesy to keep the island moving - it's what we are.\u201d\nA union flag was also raised at the Pomme d'Or during the celebrations.\nThe weather provided the perfect setting for a day of joy and jubilation. \nThe chief minister told the States Assembly about his father's and uncle's experiences of occupation and how it disrupted their idyllic childhood. \nBut he said while those stories shocked and saddened, they also inspired and reminded islanders not to take our freedom for granted. \nThat message was one we regularly heard amongst the celebrations. Politicians and faith leaders pointing to conflicts around the world to remind islanders how precious the freedom we enjoy is. \nThe rendition of Beautiful Jersey was, as always, one of the most poignant and haunting moments of the day.\nIslanders have reflected on their experience of the occupation, including Iris Prigent, who said her late husband Gordon's work at a German slave camp in Alderney affected him for the rest of his life.\nJersey Heritage is putting special memorial stones across the island to commemorate significant islanders from the war years, including Mr Prigent.\nDavid Perchard, a member of Le Ronde Concert Band, remembered the Liberation in 1945, when he was five years old.\nHe said: \"I particularly remember we all went down on the Albert Pier to wait for the Tommies to come in and we were standing there waiting and the boat came through the pier heads.\n\"Instead of coming to the Albert Pier it went on to what we now called the new North Quay, so everybody started running up the harbour to get to the top of the harbour.\"\nMr Perchard said there was also another moment that stuck with him.\nHe said: \"There was a compound with barbed wire, and being a small kid I was looking up at a guy standing there dressed in rags round his feet and I couldn't believe it.\n\"I remember that very, very clearly, and these were apparently Russian prisoners of war.\"\nDavid Luce was 12 years old when Jersey was liberated, and said the island was put under extreme regulations.\n\"I have many recollections of the war years.\n\"I was seven when the Germans arrived in 1940, and remember the regulations that came in, not least the day when we had to ride bikes on the right hand side of the road which was an uncanny experience,\" he said.\nThe 91-year-old said he remembered the excitement of Liberation Day.\nHe said: \"I remember the Liberation Day when I was 12 and the excitement down here at the harbours, our soldiers were arriving in full kit and they could barely move because people were embracing them as they landed on the pier.\n\"They were throwing out cigarettes and they were throwing out sweets to the children as one of my cousins put it - the air on Liberation Day was electric with joy.\n\"It sums up just how we felt, a",
    "A petition has been launched for \"dedicated dog-friendly\" beaches year-round in Jersey after the summer restrictions came into force this month. \nCurrently, if you take a dog on any of Jersey\u2019s beaches from 1 May to 30 September,  between 10:30-18:00 BST, they must be on a lead. \nBut some people said they felt the rules should be more relaxed to allow dogs on some beaches, or make the rules more dog-friendly. \nJersey's government has rejected calls to relax the rules in the past, but said it would welcome the discussion again should enough people call for it. \nDog owner Sally Minty-Gravett said it was time for change and common sense should be used. \nShe said: \"If it's not a nice day and there is nobody on the beach, why can't we just run with our dogs for an hour?\"    \nAnother idea, petitioned by Jen Salisbury, was to have \"dedicated dog-friendly beaches\" throughout the summer months. \nIt has more than 500 signatures so far. If it reaches 1,000, ministers will have to respond. \nIn Guernsey, the rules are more relaxed and dogs are allowed on some stretches of sand, while others are out of bounds.\nStaff at Spotted Wellies, a Jersey dog-walking company, said they were happy with the existing setup, saying it allowed for a quieter environment \"beneficial for birds and wildlife\". \nThey also said creating dedicated dog-friendly beaches for the summer \"could bring challenges\".\n\"It might lead to overcrowding and potential safety concerns due to the large amount of off-lead dogs in one area,\" they said. \nThe company said that extending off-lead hours until midday could potentially be beneficial to dog owners, providing them with more off-lead time with their dogs. \nChairman of the Constables Committee Mike Jackson said the rules had been in place since the days of a \"bigger tourism industry\" in the island and that it was important for a \"balance to be struck\" to allow all beach-users to benefit. \n\"Not everyone likes having a big dog jump up on them,\" he said. \nThe States previously rejected calls to relax the rules when a similar petition was lodged in 2019, but Mr Jackson said it could be looked at again if there was enough support to do so.\nFollow BBC Jersey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "Angela Rayner has unveiled plans for a new law to protect interns from sexual harassment in the workplace.\nLabour's deputy leader said the issue was \"rife\" and need to be tackled to support women at work.\nNew legislation would be put in place as part of the party's New Deal for Working People if Labour wins the next general election.\nHowever, Unite the Union accused Labour of watering down wider pledges on workers' rights in that plan.\nAt their party conference in September, Labour committed to strengthen a recently-introduced a legal duty for employers to \"stop sexual harassment before it starts\" by taking \"all reasonable steps\".\nSpeaking at the Chartered Management Institute's Women's Conference, Ms Rayner said sexual harassment affected millions of people and \"all too often\" women were targeted in their first job, so more still needed to be done to \"stamp out\" the problem, including for contracted interns and volunteers.\n\"Sexual harassment remains rife in workplaces across Britain,\" she said. \n\"For any employee, but especially interns and volunteers, experiencing sexual harassment can destroy confidence and ruin early careers.\n\"My message to working women is clear: with our New Deal for Working People, a Labour government will have your back.\"\nThe Crime Survey of England and Wales findings that one-in-four alleged incidents of sexual harassment happen at work, with one-in-nine of those complaints from women being targeted by a colleague.\nLabour's plans would make employers liable if they are made aware of an incident impacting on contracted interns and volunteers who have signed a worker agreement and failed to take action.\nAnn Francke, boss of the Chartered Management Institute, welcomed measures to strengthen employee wellbeing as \"ultimately good for business\".\nGood employers recognise that they need to move swiftly and decisively - with clear policies in place when it comes to tackling these behaviours - both for the sake of their teams and also to protect their reputation.\"\nLabour's New Deal plan also includes a requirement for large firms to create and implement gender pay gap action plans and steps to support women experiencing menopause symptoms at work.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe party is currently preparing a final document setting out its proposals, which it says will be in a \"form that can be campaigned on\". \nIt insists there have been no substantial changes since last October, when the issue of workers' rights was thrashed out at Labour's National Policy Forum.   \nBut Sharon Graham, the leader of the Unite union, said the latest version of Labour's New Deal policy was \"unrecognisable\" from previous versions and changed what had been a \"real new deal for workers\" into \"a charter for bad bosses.\"\nShe said: \"This new Labour document on the New Deal, issued to the unions on Monday, is a row back on a row back - It is totally unrecognisable from the original proposals produced with the unions.\"\nThe original workers rights pledges included fundamental workers' rights from day one, including statutory sick pay for all, a ban on zero-hour contracts, and a ban on so-called \"fire and rehire\" practices.\nClaiming that Labour don't want a law against fire and rehire, Ms Graham accused Labour of \"effectively ripping up the promise of legislation on a new deal for workers in its first 100 days\" and replacing it with a code of conduct.\n\"Likewise, the proposal to legislate against zero hours contracts is watered down to almost nothing,\" she added.\n\"In truth this new document is not worthy of discussion and all unions must now demand that Labour changes course and puts the original New Deal for Workers back on the table.\"",

    "Opportunities to help murdered toddlers Maya Chappell and Dwelaniyah Robinson may have been missed, according to a report.\nThe children died within months of each other in 2022, with two-year-old Maya killed by her mother\u2019s boyfriend Michael Daymond and Dwelaniyah, three, by his mother Christina Robinson.\nA Child Safeguarding Practice Review (CSPR) published on Wednesday found no evidence the deaths could have been prevented, but said agencies could have shown \"more professional curiosity\". \nIt highlighted several opportunities for intervention.\nNeither family were known to statutory services, but similarities in the cases prompted the Durham Safeguarding Children Partnership (DSCP) to commission a review.\nExamples of effective practice were found, but the report highlighted several critical moments where professionals could have stepped in to help with \"hidden vulnerabilities\" around domestic abuse, mental health, religion and parenting.\nMaya was shaken to death by her mother Dana Carr's new boyfriend, Michael Daymond, at her Shotton Colliery home in September 2022.\nHe was found guilty of murder and Carr of child cruelty and allowing the death of a child.\nPrior to the toddler's death, Maya's father had asked police to disclose information about Daymond under the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme, known as Claire's Law, but officers closed the case after Carr told them she was no longer in a relationship.\nThe decision was a missed opportunity to assess risks about Daymond and collate details about him, the report found.\nIt also highlighted possible gender bias and the need to take fathers' concerns seriously.\nIn unrelated circumstances, Dwelaniyah, from Ushaw Moor in County Durham, died after being violently shaken by his mother.\nChristina Robinson had subjected him to horrific abuse in the weeks before his death, claiming she was following teachings of the Bible.\nThe review said lessons should be learned around the importance of exploring the impact of religious beliefs on the lives of children.\nA failure to do so represented \"a significant omission from services in understanding the child\u2019s experience, possibly because of a desire to be culturally sensitive,\u201d the report said.\nIn both cases, there were a number of house moves and changes of the children's primary carer, while police records also reflect concerns around domestic abuse in both families.\n\u201cIf there is no curiosity about the children\u2019s whereabouts and the family dynamics, any potential support needs cannot be explored,\u201d the report said.\nThe impact of Covid-19 on health services affected both families, with each child seen by several different health visitors because of team changes and the need for agency staff.\nIt meant little continuity of care and potentially complicated the transfer of information among services.\nThe review said a call for help with Maya's behaviour from her mother could have been a chance to provide more targeted support for the toddler's family, but no action was taken prior to her death.\nDave Ashton, chair of the Durham Safeguarding Children Partnership, said the review's findings had been shared with agencies, who are working to implement the recommendations.\nHe added: \u201cThese are deeply distressing cases resulting in the tragic deaths of two young children, and our thoughts and sympathies are very much with all those who loved and cared for them.\n\u201cWe are committed to learning from the circumstances of each case.\"\nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "The Tokyo Olympic Games are under way, with thousands of athletes set to compete.\nOrganisers say the event can be held safely, despite calls for it to be cancelled because of Covid.\nThe 2020 Summer Olympic Games take place between 23 July and 8 August. \nThe Paralympic Games are due to run between 24 August and 5 September. \nThe Games were postponed last year because of Covid. \nThe Olympics will feature 33 sports at 339 events across 42 venues. The Paralympics will feature 22 sports at 539 events across 21 venues.\nMost events are in the Greater Tokyo area, although some football games and the marathon will take place in the northern city of Sapporo.\nJapan has had relatively low case numbers, but a new wave of infections began in April.\nAs of 21 July, there were 848,222 confirmed cases and 15,062 deaths (compared with 5.5 million cases and 128,800 deaths in the UK).\nJapan only began vaccinating in February and only 22% of its population of about 126 million is fully vaccinated.\nIn Tokyo and Osaka, the two cities hit hardest by the recent surge, authorities hope over-65s will be fully vaccinated by the end of July. \nEntry to Japan by foreigners from 159 countries - including the UK - is currently banned. \nInternational athletes and support staff are being tested every day.\nAthletes don't have to be vaccinated, though International Olympic Committee (IOC) officials expect around 80% will be.\nMore than 90 people associated with the Games have tested positive so far, including British athlete Amber Hill who has withdrawn from the women's skeet competition.\nAll spectators were banned after a state of emergency was declared in Tokyo on 8 July. It will stay in place until 22 August.\nA decision about whether Japanese spectators will be able to attend the Paralympics has not yet been made.\nTokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimoto said she was \"sorry to those who purchased tickets\".\nThe contract between the IOC and the host city Tokyo suggests only the IOC can cancel the event.\nThe IOC is thought to make around 70% of its money from broadcast rights, and 18% from sponsorship.\nIOC president Thomas Bach said the thought of rescheduling the competition \"caused sleepless nights\". He insisted the Games must go ahead \"to give hope\" for the future.\nThe head of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also backed the competition, arguing it could show what can be done with the correct Covid safeguards.\nBut the head of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee Toshiro Muto has not ruled out cancelling the Olympic Games even at this late stage.  He said he would keep an eye on infection numbers and hold \"discussions\" if necessary.\nIf the Tokyo organisers were to cancel the contract, the risks and losses would probably fall on the Japanese side. \nThe budget for Tokyo 2020 was set at $12.6bn (\u00a38.9bn), although it's been reported the actual cost may be double that. \nSeveral towns set to host athletes reportedly pulled out earlier in the year because of fears about Covid and extra pressure on the healthcare system.\nIn May, a Japanese doctors' union said it was \"impossible\" to hold the Games given the pandemic. \nA poll in May in the leading Asahi Shimbun newspaper suggested more than 80% of the population want them cancelled or postponed.\nA number of bodies have expressed concern. \nThe World Players Association, representing 85,000 athletes in over 60 countries, said the IOC must do more to ensure athletes' safety - with stricter physical distancing and more rigorous testing. \nJapanese athletes have largely kept a low profile, but the country's biggest sports star, tennis champion Naomi Osaka, previously said there should be a debate about whether the Games should go ahead.

    "Prince Harry told students in Nigeria it was okay to have a bad day, as he and Meghan began a three-day visit to the country.\nThe Duke of Sussex told children at a mental health summit in Abuja \u201cthere\u2019s no shame to acknowledge that today is a bad day, that you left school feeling stressed\u201d.\nThe visit comes after Harry concluded a brief visit to London, where he told the BBC it had been \"great\" to be back in the UK.\nTheir visit is part of a series of events linked to the Invictus Games, the sporting event for injured servicemen and women founded by Prince Harry which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year.\nThe couple landed in Abuja on Friday morning, and began their visit with a tour of Lightway Academy, a primary and secondary school in the capital city.\nThey were greeted by traditional dancers and met some of the primary schoolchildren. \nOne group of year five pupils told the BBC they were really excited about the visit, saying they hope it will raise their school's profile.\nDuring their tour the couple visited a kindergarten class where children aged up to five danced and sang - at one point, the visitors got to their feet and joined the class in singing Jump Up, Turn Around.\nThe couple mentioned their own family: Archie, who turned five earlier this month, and two-year-old Lilibet.\nMeghan said that dancing was Lilibet's favourite class, adding: \"Maybe it\u2019s all the jumping around.\"\nDuring a visit to a STEM class, when pupils showed the robot cars they had created, the duchess said that Archie also liked construction.\nWhen told by the class that they would be showing the robot cars in class one day, Meghan said: \"We will have to come back for the exhibition.\"\nThe couple then spoke to students to deliver remarks launching a two-day mental health summit.\nMeghan began by telling the audience:  \u201cWe have got to acknowledge those amazing dance moves\u201d saying Harry was excited and nearly jumped up to join.\nHarry asked the children to put their hands up if the words \"mental health\" scare them or if they know what they mean, before going on to talk about the stigma surrounding mental health worldwide.\nThe duke told the children the message he wanted them to remember was that mental health affects everyone in the world.\n\"The more you talk about it, the more you can kick it in the long grass\u201d.\nHe made the children promise, after Friday, not to be scared of talking about their mental health, and ended his speech with: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, not to be okay.\u201d\nHe then handed the microphone to Meghan who joked: \u201cDo you see why I married him? He\u2019s so smart.\"\nShe then went on to encourage the children to share their stories, saying that Lilibet once said to her: \u201cMama, I see me in you.\u201d\nEven though she meant literally, Meghan said she hung onto the words, saying she sees herself in her daughter but also all the students there. \n\u201cI believe in you\u201d, she told them.\nThe couple were also joined on stage by Brian, one of three Lightway Academy students who spoke on stage about mental health.\n\"Both boys and girls have feelings and emotions they bottle up because they can\u2019t really express it\u2026 it can lead to suicide,\" he said.\nHe went on to add that he hoped the summit would enlighten him and teach him more about mental health.\nLightway Academy's School Director, Joyce Agbese, told the BBC mental health is a topic not often talked about in Nigeria.\nShe praised Prince Harry's message to the students, which was to \"speak up and speak out, don\u2019t bottle things up\". \n\"He nailed it, basically yes. We want to encourage them to speak out, speak up, express their emotions in the right way,\" said Ms Agbese.\n\u201cWhen somebody this popular or this famous speaks about mental health it makes people realise that it\u2019s normal and so they don\u2019t have to be afraid to talk about it.\"\nOne of the students who watched the talk was 14-year-old Valeria Offia, a year 10 student who brought her copy of Prince Harry's Book Spare to be signed.\nThe prince wrote: \"Keep inspiring others, smashing stigma, and making a difference.\"\nShe told the BBC: \"I think it\u2019s very important because I personally go through some mental health issues; I have anxiety, I suffer from depression from now and then and it\u2019s really nice that people still don\u2019t really think it\u2019s a taboo anymore to speak on these things, and it\u2019s really nice that they were able to come here today and tell us that it\u2019s ok to not be ok.\"\nAfter launching the summit, the prince will head to a military rehabilitation centre in Kaduna.\nPrince Harry and Meghan were invited by Nigeria's chief of defence staff, General Christopher Musa, and will meet injured service personnel.\nThe duke and duchess will also visit Lagos.\nThe couple are set to attend a training session for Nigeria: Unconquered - a charity which collaborates with the Invictus Games - as well as a cultural reception and a polo fundraiser for the charity.\nMeghan is also due to co-host an event of Women in Leadership with Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, director-general of t",
    "Cancelled lessons and snaking lunchtime queues are among the ways pupils are being affected by an increasing number of cyber attacks on schools.\nNew figures from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) show 347 cyber incidents were reported in the education and childcare sector in 2023 - an increase of 55% on 2022. \nGovernment data suggests most schools and colleges have identified a cyber-security breach in the past year. \nSome tell BBC News it has led to temporary closures and weeks of disruption.\nThe Department for Education (DfE) says it has a dedicated response team available to advise schools when that happens.\nTwo school trusts in the East Midlands were targeted in separate attacks within days of each other earlier this year.\nEmbrace Multi-Academy Trust CEO Sharon Mullins says her schools are still feeling the effects of the attack, which happened just before Easter.\nStaff at Brockington College, in Leicester, were first alerted to the breach when they saw their mouse cursors moving remotely across their screens, with files already open on the computers, when they first logged on at the start of the school day.\n\"The whole thing feels very sinister,\" Ms Mullins said.\nWithin 30 minutes, she had ordered all of the trust's nine schools to take all of their systems offline.\n\"You're basically telling every teacher across the trust that whatever they had planned that day, they can no longer teach with immediate effect,\" she said.\nSuddenly, everything from pupil registers to fire safety had to be done on paper, as staff worked day and night over the holidays to get the systems back online safely.\nBrockington's school librarian Elizabeth Elliott says she is now chasing more than 100 overdue books after losing access to her online records.\nEven the school's catering facilities were affected, with the computer systems responsible for taking payments for school lunches also taken offline.\nYear 10 pupil Archie said the length of the lunch queues doubled overnight.\n\"Teachers had to write down everyone's name and what they got, all the prices,\" he said.\n\"It took about double the time to get through everyone and some people didn't get the food they wanted because break-time just wasn't long enough.\"\nIsaac, in Year 9, says his homework is still affected two months on from the attack, as the app they use is not yet fully back online.\n\"There was just so much we couldn't do,\" he said.\n\"All in all it just made everything more difficult to work around.\"\nThe type of cyber attack which increased most across all sectors between the end of 2022 and 2023, according to the ICO, was ransomware, incidents of which increased by 170%.\nDuring a ransomware attack, hackers block access to a school's computer records, including sensitive personal data, and demand money while threatening to publish them online.\nOften the attacks are committed by organised criminal gangs based in foreign countries.\nOne such attack, identified by the BBC in the south-west of England at the start of last year, saw hackers steal and publish several highly confidential documents, including information about children with special educational needs, child passport scans and staff contract details. \nMs Mullins now says she wants school leaders to talk more openly about how to deal with such incidents.\n\"My opinion is that multi-academy trust leaders and school head teachers aren't talking about this enough,\" she said.\n\"Taking pupil data, school data that is quite personal, and then sending a ransom message for it is definitely something we're not fully trained for when you start your career - but you certainly need to know about it.\"\nA few miles away, in South Derbyshire, the de Ferrers Trust was targeted by a near-simultaneous but separate cyber attack which forced two of its schools to close.\nThey were the subject of a \"brute force\" attack, where hackers make repeated attempts to crack passwords or login credentials.\nTrust CEO Kathy Hardy likened the method to \"a car thief going down the road and trying door handles, and getting lucky\".\nBoth Granville Academy and the Pingle Academy, in Swadlincote, had to remain closed for an extra day after the Easter break while all the systems were brought back online.\n\"You don't realise how much you rely on the technology in terms of the systems it affects,\" Granville Academy head Michelle Oliphant said.\n\"It makes me very angry because there are a lot of pressures on the education system at the moment and this is an unnecessary hindrance that impacts on students and that's really unfair.\"\nPaul Alberry, CEO of Secure Schools, said the concept of managing cyber-security risk is fairly new to most schools.\n\"IT teams have not had to operate and defend to this level before,\" he said.\n\"Schools are increasingly reliant on tech to process the data that they need to be operational - and sometimes that's as crucial as keeping the doors open and keeping children safe.\"\nHe said school leadership teams, as well as specialist IT sta",

If the UK government lifted its legal block \u2013 the section 35 order - it would become law.\n\u201cThe problem is that the current UK government has said they will not.\n\u201cThe Scottish government\u2019s position is simple - UK government should lift their section 35 order.\n\u201cThey have made clear however that they will not, and until they do, it is simply not legal to implement the legislation.\u201d\nScottish Conservative deputy leader Meghan Gallacher said: \u201cWomen\u2019s groups, and the vast majority of Scots, will be dismayed to hear that John Swinney is doubling down on Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s reckless gender self-ID policy.\n\u201cThis is further proof that John Swinney spells more of the same, and is wedded to the same failed and flawed approach as Nicola Sturgeon and Humza Yousaf.\"",

Ukrainian reports said they had studied together in the border troops academy many years ago.\nMaj Gen Rud has served in Ukraine's military for most of his adult life, and much of his career has been focused on state security. \nEver since Russian paratroopers attempted to land in Kyiv and assassinate President Zelensky in the early hours and days of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, plots to assassinate him have been commonplace.\nThe Ukrainian leader said at the start of the invasion he was Russia's \"number one target\".\nPresident Zelensky has frequently replaced key figures in Ukraine's security forces, and on Thursday he also announced that the commander of special forces, Col Serhiy Lupanchuk, was being moved from the role only months into the job.\nThe man who led Ukraine's defence in the first two years of Russia's full-scale invasion, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, was replaced in February. He has now been appointed as Ukraine's ambassador to the UK and given the title \"Hero of Ukraine\".",
    "India's top court has granted interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, more than a month after he was arrested in a corruption case. \nThe court said that the bail is applicable until 1 June after which he must surrender to authorities again.\nA former anti-corruption crusader, Mr Kejriwal was arrested in connection with a now-scrapped alcohol sales policy in March.\nHe has denied the charges against him and has called his arrest \"illegal\".\nThe chief minister moved the Supreme Court after the Delhi High Court refused to give him bail last month. His bail was strongly opposed in court by India's financial crimes agency, the Enforcement Directorate. \nOn Friday, a bench of Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Dipankar Datta said Mr Kejriwal would have to surrender on 2 June, two days before the results of India's general election are due.\nThe court has said Mr Kejriwal would be allowed to campaign for the election upon his release but will not be allowed to perform official duties during that time.\nA member of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Mr Kejriwal was arrested on 21 March, days after the election dates were announced. He was the third AAP leader to be jailed in the case.\nThe ED accused him of favouring liquor barons in exchange for kickbacks. The party has denied the allegation. \nCritics said the action against Mr Kejriwal and several other opposition parties was politically motivated and denied them a level playing field in the parliamentary election. The Indian government said the investigative agencies were just doing their work.\nDuring his time in jail, Mr Kejriwal did not give up office. His party said he was running the Delhi government from prison. \nA diabetic, the Delhi chief minister's detention also caused concerns about his health among supporters.\nLast month, Mr Kejriwal and his party accused prison authorities of refusing to give him proper treatment which, they said, had led to the spike in his blood glucose levels.\nThe ED, however, claimed he had deliberately had too many mangoes and sweets to spike his sugar levels and use it as grounds for bail.\nHe later received insulin shots after a court ordered doctors from a premier hospital to determine his medication.\nDuring the court proceedings, the ED opposed Mr Kejriwal's bail plea, claiming it would set a bad precedent as he had evaded the agency's summons nine times. \nJustice Khanna, however, said: \"While granting interim bail, we examine whether there will be any misuse or if the person is a hardened criminal. That is not the case here.\"\nIn March, the arrest had also drawn comments from the US and Germany. \nUS State Department spokesperson, Mathew Miller said the country was closely following Mr Kejriwal's arrest and actions taken against opposition parties in India. \n\"We encourage fair, transparent, timely legal processes [in both cases],\" Mr Miller said. \nThe German foreign ministry said it hoped that Mr Kejriwal would get a \"fair and impartial trial as India is a democratic nation\".\nIndia summoned senior diplomats of both the US and Germany to register its protest.",
    "Wrestling fans have hit out at \"extortionate\" ticket prices for WWE's first ever Scottish pay-per-view show, Clash at the Castle.\nThe \"premium live event\" comes to Glasgow's OVO Hydro venue on 15 June.\nThe cheapest tickets cost \u00a3300, with premium tickets more than \u00a32,000.\nSeveral fans told BBC Scotland News they have been priced out of the event, and will miss the chance to see Scottish wrestling talent like Piper Niven, Alba Fyre, Nikki Cross and Drew McIntyre.\nWrestling fan Lewis McLean, 18, had hoped to attend the show in his home city with his dad Craig.\nHe said: \"We don\u2019t make all that much money and my dad, he\u2019s quite ill so we\u2019re not able to travel a lot.\n\"To be able to get one of these live events in Scotland is quite a big deal to us. We were planning on getting me, my dad and my cousin. \n\"Over all it would be \u00a3900 for us all to go an watch WWE with the worst possible seats. It\u2019s just far too much.\"\nGlasgow's Hydro venue has a maximum capacity of 14,300 people. Hundreds of seats are still on sale.\nA WWE spokesperson told BBC Scotland News that some tickets had been on sale at lower price point across two nights at the venue.\nHowever, they declined to give details of how many of these tickets were available or how many had sold.\nJournalist Ross Brady, who has followed WWE to events in London, Cardiff and New Orleans, said he was not able to find a ticket for less than \u00a3300.\nHe said: \"The first prices that went up were for combo tickets of around \u00a3330, so I waited for the event on the Saturday and it was \u00a3303.50 for just the single ticket.\n\"I\u2019ll have to watch it on TV \u2013 save myself some money.\n\"I am a proper fan of this but I\u2019ll need to miss the one that\u2019s 20 minutes down the road because I\u2019m just not paying extortionate prices.\"\nScottish wrestling fans are excited for the Glasgow pay-per-view to support Ayrshire wrestler Drew McIntyre.\nThe WWE veteran is currently embroiled in a feud with fan favourite CM Punk. \nHe taunted McIntyre this week, saying: \u201cIf you make me go to Glasgow, Scotland, I\u2019m gonna be hiding in a bowl of haggis and I\u2019m gonna pop out and break your face.\u201d\nFormer wrestling promoter Mark Dallas, founder of Scotland's Insane Championship Wrestling (ICW) said it was a \"massive deal\" for the event to be held in Scotland.\nHe said: \"It\u2019s fantastic that finally, WWE are bringing one of their big events to Glasgow \u2013 it\u2019s long overdue.\n\"I think it\u2019s a real shame that there\u2019s not more affordable tickets towards the back of the venue at least.\"",
    "Hundreds of students protesting the war in Gaza have marched through Oxford to deliver a list of demands.\nProtest camps, described as \"liberated zones\", have been set up near Oxford University campuses.\nOn Wednesday, protesters hung a list of demands up at the gates of the Sheldonian Theatre for the vice chancellor. \nThe university has previously expressed \"profound sympathy for those suffering in Gaza, Israel and the West Bank\".\nOn the list of demands, protesters called for the university to disclose all finances, overhaul university investment policy, boycott \"Israeli genocide, apartheid and occupation\" and stop banking with Barclays. \nIn a statement, the University of Oxford previously said it was aware of the latest protests and its students and staff members had a \"right to freedom of expression in the form of peaceful protests\".\nIn the past week, pro-Palestinian protesters have set up tents outside university buildings in cities including Manchester, Sheffield and Newcastle as well as at Goldsmiths, University of London.\nMore than 33,000 people have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry there says, the majority of them civilians.\nOn Thursday, the Union of Jewish Students said the encampments were creating a \"hostile and toxic atmosphere\" on campuses and called on universities to \"take their duty of care to Jewish students seriously\".\nIsrael rejects accusations that it is engaging in genocidal acts in its campaign in Gaza, and has insisted it has the right to defend itself following the armed incursion by Hamas on 7 October.\nThe leaders of 17 universities have now met the prime minister to discuss the protests and steps they should take to tackle antisemitism.\nIt comes after Prof Dame Sally Mapstone, president of Universities UK, said they \"may need to take action\" if protests against the Israel-Gaza war interfere with life on campus.\nThe BBC has approached the university for an updated comment about the protest demands.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

    "The US says Israel may have used American-supplied weapons in breach of international humanitarian law in some instances during the war in Gaza.\nIt is \"reasonable to assess\" that those arms have been used in ways \"inconsistent\" with Israel's obligations, says the state department. \nBut it added that the US did not have complete information in its assessment and that shipments could continue.\nThe report was submitted to Congress on Friday after a delay.\nThe White House-ordered review looked into how the country, along with six others engaged in conflict, has used US-supplied arms since the start of last year.\nWhile the report was a clear rebuke of some Israeli operations in Gaza, it stopped short of definitively saying that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) campaign had breached international law.\nIsrael had had to confront an \"extraordinary military challenge\" fighting Hamas in Gaza, it said.\nAnd it added that assurances it had received from Israel about adhering to the legal use of US weapons were \"credible and reliable\".\nThe document also noted that because Hamas \"uses civilian infrastructure for military purposes and civilians as human shields\", it was often \"difficult to determine facts on the ground in an active war zone\" of what are legitimate targets.\nBut it said that given Israel's significant reliance on US-made weapons, they had probably been used \"in instances inconsistent with its IHL [international humanitarian law] obligations or with established best practices for mitigating civilian harm\".\nIt added that \"Israel has the knowledge, experience, and tools to implement best practices for mitigating civilian harm in its military operations\", but that \"results on the ground, including high levels of civilian casualties, raise substantial questions as to whether the IDF is using them effectively in all cases\".\nThe report said the UN and humanitarian organisations had described Israeli efforts to mitigate civilian harm as \"inconsistent, ineffective and inadequate\".\nThe state department found that Israel did not fully co-operate with US efforts to \"maximise\" humanitarian aid into Gaza in the initial months of the conflict. It said, however, that this situation had changed.\n\"We do not currently assess that the Israeli government is prohibiting or otherwise restricting the transport or delivery of US humanitarian assistance,\" the report said.\nOne of the contributors to the report, David Satterfield, a former US ambassador to Turkey, told the BBC that the report was the first of its kind and that the US would continue to keep Israeli actions \"under review\".\n\"This is a conflict quite unlike any that the world has seen,\" he added. \"We tried to take account of all those factors in coming up with a very frank, but also credible judgement.\"\nThe report was finally released days after US President Joe Biden publicly threatened to withhold certain bombs and artillery shells from Israel if it went ahead with an assault on Rafah, the last stronghold of Hamas in Gaza that is packed with more than a million Palestinians.\nShortly before the report's publication, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed President Biden's warnings that the operation in Rafah would cross a \"red line\" and vowed that Israel would \"stand alone\" if necessary. \nMore than 80,000 people have fled Rafah since Monday, the UN says, with Israeli tanks reportedly massed close to built-up areas amid constant bombardment.\nIsraeli troops took control and closed the Rafah crossing with Egypt at the start of their operation, while the UN said it was too dangerous for its staff and lorries to reach the reopened Kerem Shalom crossing with Israel.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage. More than 34,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",
    "A family in Washington state has been left devastated after a mobile butcher confused their home with a different address and slaughtered their pet pigs. \nBetty and Patty, both two years old, were shot in their pen in Port Orchard while the family was away from home.\nOwner Nathan Gray said he could not contain his anger. \"They were my wife's pets and my kids' and they, you know, they're family.\"\nPolice told the BBC that the matter had been passed to the prosecutor's office. \nMr Gray and his wife Natalie said they returned home on 1 May to find their pets in the process of being butchered. Their home CCTV system had alerted them to an unknown vehicle on their property. \nMr Gray said that after arriving, one of his employees approached him and said: \"These guys shot your pigs.\"\nHe said he found Patty and Betty laying in pools of blood. \"They shot them. Only 16 feet from our neighbour's fence.\"\nHe said he confronted the butcher, who said his GPS \"screwed up\". \"They asked me what I wanted to do with the with the pigs - whether I wanted them to be processed.\n\"They'll be buried on this property, like the rest of our animals.\"\nMrs Gray said that her children had been traumatised. \"They were my babies,\" she said of Betty and Patty. \"And when you have kids and they don't feel safe - when they feel violated, I feel mad that they don't feel safe.\"\nThe pigs enjoyed chasing their daughters and playing in the mud and were expected to live their entire lives at their Gray Acres farm, the couple said. \nThe Grays now want to ensure that this never happens again, and hope to change the laws that regulate mobile butchering. \n\"It seems like there's no guidelines. What I've read - there's nothing about firearm training,\" said Mr Gray. He added that he would find it incredible if it was legal to walk onto private property with a gun and kill an animal without the owner's permission.\nA lawyer for the couple, Adam Karp, told BBC News that \"the law treats Betty and Patty no differently than if were they Golden Retrievers or Norwegian Forest Cats\".\nDespite being legally classified as \"livestock\", he said that it is a serious crime to intentionally cause injury to any animal without legal justification, and that the butcher may be civilly liable for the offence of theft of livestock. \nHe added that he has been hired by the couple \"to explore criminal, civil, and regulatory avenues to do justice for Betty and Patty and to ensure no horror like this ever happens again\".\nMobile slaughter units were created in the US in 2002. Each is accompanied by an official food safety inspector. They are intended to allow farmers and ranchers to have their animals butchered without being forced to travel long distances to access larger facilities.",
    "Hundreds of climate protesters have clashed with police in Germany after attempting to storm the Tesla factory near Berlin. \nSeveral people were injured, including three police officers, during Friday's demonstration against the proposed expansion of the electric car giant's only European plant. \nPolice made several arrests and prevented activists from gaining access to the facility.\nCampaigners have been camped out in woods in Gr\u00fcnheide, in the state of Brandenburg, since February, claiming Tesla's plans to double the size of its factory would damage the environment.\nDemonstrators on Friday blocked a nearby motorway and interrupted the railway service by sitting on the tracks, police said.\nThere was also a sit-in on a country road near the factory.\nFootage on social media shows hundreds of people, many donning blue caps and holding blue flags, running towards the site attempting to gain access.\nOne video, verified by the BBC, shows protesters breaking through the police cordon and entering the grounds of the factory, which is located around 30km (18 miles) from the capital. \nThey can be seen heading towards an outlying building at the northeast corner of the Gigafactory grounds.\nPolice confirmed that protesters who tried to enter the facility were prevented from doing so, with several people taken into custody. \nTesla said earlier this week that the site would be closed for the day due to the demonstration, with employees reportedly allowed to work from home. \nIn a post on his social media platform X, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also said the group did not manage to break into the facility. \n\"Why do the police let the left-wing protesters off so easily?\" Musk wrote in another post. \nThe Disrupt Tesla group had been calling for mass protests against the expansion to take place between 8 and 12 May. \nSpeaking to Reuters news agency on Friday, Ole Becker, a spokesman for Disrupt Tesla, said the protesters aimed to draw attention to the \"environmental destruction\" in Gr\u00fcnheide.\nSome activists have occupied part of the forest expected to be cleared for the expanded factory for months, building tree houses and erecting signs in opposition. \nKnown as the Gigafactory, the facility currently employs an estimated 12,000 people and makes around 500,000 cars a year.\nProduction had to be briefly halted in March after a power outage was triggered by a suspected arson attack.\nThe far-left activist group known as Volcano Group claimed responsibility.",
    "The Bank of England boss has said it needs to \"see more evidence\" that price rises have slowed further before cutting interest rates.\nAndrew Bailey said he was \"optimistic that things are moving in the right direction\" as rates were held at 5.25%.\nHe said the Bank expected inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, would fall \"close\" to its target level in the next couple of months.\nIt paves the way for an interest rate cut as early as June.\nBut Mr Bailey warned a cut was \"not a fait accompli, it's not a done deal\".\nAugust or September appear to be the most likely timing, especially if inflation falls as expected. \nThe interest rate set by the Bank dictates the rates set by High Street banks and money lenders. Rates are currently at their highest level for 16 years which has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things such as mortgages and loans, but savers have also received better returns.\nMr Bailey said there had been \"encouraging news\" on inflation, currently at 3.2%, but said the Bank needed \"more evidence\" it would stay low before cutting rates.\nHowever, at the news conference following the Bank's decision, Mr Bailey said it was \"likely that we will need to cut bank rates over the coming quarters\" and by more than financial markets are currently predicting.\nThe nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee, which votes on rates, appeared to be edging closer towards a cut with two voting for reducing rates and the remaining seven for hold.\nThe Bank was more positive on the prospects for the UK economy in its latest forecast, predicting\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt said he would \"much rather\" policymakers \"wait until they are absolutely sure\" inflation was falling than \"rush into a decision that they had to reverse at a later stage\".\nBut he added that it was encouraging to see \"real optimism\" from Mr Bailey for the first time.\nBut Darren Jones, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said while it was the Bank of England's \"independent right\" to set interest rates, it was \"bad news for people at home having to reset their mortgages for the years ahead at a more expensive rate and people to have to pay rent for their homes\".\nThe health of UK economy has been in the spotlight with economic policies likely to be a key battleground in the quest for votes in the upcoming election, expected by the end of this year.\nAsked on Thursday if the economy had turned a corner, Mr Bailey said: \"All the evidence we see is that we have turned a corner from that.\" But he warned that it was not a \"strong recovery\".\nPaul Day, 62, from Felixstowe, says his mortgage is set to go up by \u00a3225 a month when his five-year fixed deal expires at the end of May.\nMr Day, who is retired, currently pays \u00a31,027 a month, but when his fixed rate of 1.89% ends, he will move on to his lender's standard variable rate of 7.99%.\n\"It's been a scary three months waiting for interest rates to go down and I'm getting closer and closer to my deadline, which is the 31st of May, and they're not,\" he says.\nHe is choosing to go on to a variable rate, because he doesn't want to be \"stuck\" on another fixed.\n\"I think things should settle down within the next six months. So it's a gamble,\" he says. \nFollowing the Bank's latest comments, financial markets now expect rates to be cut to 5% by August and then trimmed to 4.75% in November or December. More rate cuts are predicted for 2025.\nThe Bank started raising rates in December 2021 and has kept interest rates at 5.25% since last summer in an attempt to slow the pace at which consumer prices have been rising - and to ease the cost of living.\nPrices starting rising quickly as demand for goods increased when Covid-related restrictions were lifted. Energy and food prices then soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, leading to inflation rising over 11% in October 2022 - its highest rate in 40 years. \nElectricity and bills have since fallen but are not expected to fall further. \nBy making borrowing more expensive, the Bank hopes to encourage people to cut back on spending which in turn leads to demand for goods falling and price rises easing.\nBut it is a balancing act, as high interest rates can harm the economy and restrict growth, as businesses hold off on investing in production and jobs.\nThe UK fell into recession at the end of last year when the economy shrank for two consecutive three-month periods, but the Bank said it believed the downturn might already be over with official figures released on Friday expected to confirm this.\nThe Bank said it expected the economy to perform slightly better this year, partly due to the size of the population increasing and some measures in the government's spring Budget, such as the cut to National Insurance.\nTackling It Together: More tips to help you manage debt",
    "A federal appeals court has upheld the criminal conviction of former Trump strategist Steve Bannon.\nThe decision may soon send Bannon, 70, to prison, after years of legal wrangling. \nHe was convicted in 2022 of contempt of Congress for refusing to provide testimony or documents to the committee probing the 6 January Capitol riot.\nBannon's lawyer said he would file new appeal, adding there were \"important constitutional issues at stake\" .\nBannon was sentenced to four months in prison and ordered to pay a fine of $6,500 (\u00a35,200).\nBut the right-wing podcaster, who has denied any criminal wrongdoing, was able to remain out of jail on bond while challenging his conviction.\nBannon's lawyers have characterised the case as politically motivated and said that he was attempting to negotiate - rather than ignore - the committee's subpoenas. \nBannon himself has maintained that he was following legal advice when he refused to testify before the House committee investigating the 2021 attack that was intended to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden won the 2020 election.\nIn a unanimous decision, the US DC Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Bannon's argument, saying it \"runs headlong into settled law\". \n\"This exact 'advice of counsel' defense is no defense at all,\" wrote Justice Bradley Garcia, a Biden appointee, on behalf of the court, a panel that also included a Trump appointee and an Obama appointee.\nBannon was not ordered to immediately begin his four-month term. He now has seven days to file another appeal. \nDavid Schoen, his lawyer, said that he would ask the full 11-member DC appeals court to hear the case.\nMr Schoen argued that Donald Trump had invoked executive privilege - a legal concept which allows presidents to keep some communications private - and that Bannon would be breaking the law if he testified in front of Congress.\nBannon's legal team advised him, Mr Schoen said, \"in no uncertain terms that he was not permitted as a matter of law to in any way respond to the subpoena\". \nPeter Navarro, another senior Trump aide, reported to prison in March after his own contempt of Congress conviction. \nIn a 2021 memoir - In Trump Time - Navarro said he was the architect of a strategy to challenge the 2020 election's results that made Joe Biden president.\nBannon was a key player in Mr Trump's successful 2016 election campaign and later took the role of chief strategist at the White House. \nHe left that position following a violent far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. Even after his departure, the combative podcaster was considered a top ally of Mr Trump.",
    "\"So, let's talk about porn,\" says Ethan West to the classroom of Australian teenagers. Most look slightly awkward. All are uncharacteristically quiet. \n\"Do any porn videos start off with a relationship where the actors talk about feelings or consent?\" he continues. More silence.\nAt Kellyville High School, north of Sydney, this is just one tricky conversation the 15-year-olds will be having today.\nFrom sexist jokes and coercive control to sexual assault and brutal jealousy-fuelled assaults - there's not much off limits on the Love Bites programme which national charity Napcan has delivered to thousands of students.\nThe \"respectful relationship education\" title sounds a little bland. But it is being delivered against a backdrop of violence against women in this country that has been labelled a \"national crisis\". At its core: trying to shift attitudes and behaviour that has contributed to that culture.\nThe high-profile stabbing murders of six people at Sydney's Bondi Junction shopping centre last month - in which police said it seemed \"obvious\" that attacker Joel Cauchi targeted women - brought the issue into sharper focus. \nIn the month since then, at least three Australian women have been murdered, allegedly by partners or exes.\nSo far this year, 28 women have been violently killed in Australia, according to campaign group Destroy the Joint which runs the Counting Dead Women project. At the same point last year it was 15.\nIn 2023, 64 women were killed by someone known to them. In the UK, a country with more than twice the population, the number was 100, according to the Counting Dead Women project in the UK.\nTwo weeks ago, tens of thousands of people around Australia took part in marches calling for gendered violence to be declared a national emergency. \n\"For a young woman growing up in Australia it's scary, knowing these things are happening,\" says student Shriya, who listens intently at the back of the classroom as the group is given small cards with statements such as \"equality\", \"slut-shaming\" and \"sending unwanted nudes\". \nThey're asked to place the phrases along a line of masking tape on the floor - labelled \"respect and consent culture\" at one end, and \"violence and abuse culture\" at the other.  \n\"Think of the line today as a metaphor for your gut feeling,\" says Tara Gleig, a student support officer who is helping run Love Bites. \"Your body will tell you when something's not right. I want you to be able to know where that is.\"\nAs a senior constable with New South Wales Police, Ethan West's experience of attending domestic violence calls made him want to fix what he calls an \"epidemic\".\n\"Every two minutes police are called to a domestic violence situation in Australia,\" he says. And he thinks that for the younger generation, domestic violence is on a \"new battlefield\".\n\"Everything's online - there's stalking, harassment. And a lot of the problems with relationships are the sending of intimate images. Young people are sharing nude photos all the time. The relationship may end and they're shared with others. That's a domestic violence offence.\"\nFor 16-year-old Kya, who took part in Love Bites a year ago, growing up in Australia leaves her \"on edge\" - not just the threat of violence but the micro-aggressions of sexist jokes and a feeling she is less valued than the boys in her class and community.\n\"There are so many new advances in society, but this is still something that's happening,\" she says. \"You have someone making a sexist comment [but] really it's not that difficult to evolve from.\"\nShe thinks more boys in her year group need to \"step up\", though some are clearly committed to doing more.\n\"As a guy, I feel the need to be more masculine, more strong,\" says Izaiah - the chattiest of the boys in the session we observe. \n\"Relationship violence is very serious. Learning about it is a very big part of growing up as an Australian teenager.\"\nYet change is hard to come by. 10 years ago, Rosie Batty's son Luke was killed by his father, Greg Anderson. Ms Batty went on to become one of the country's top campaigners against family violence, but the national conversation has frequently been reignited by further devastating incidents.\nThese include the murders of teenagers Jack and Jennifer Edwards, who were shot by their father John Edwards in 2018; the killings of Hannah Clarke and her three young children, whose car was set alight by her estranged husband Rowan Baxter in 2020; and last year's murder of young woman Lilie James by Paul Thijssen, with whom she'd had a fleeting relationship.\nSo while the recent wave of violence against women has applied pressure on state and federal governments to do more, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's call for change across all of society is alarmingly familiar. \nSo too are other concerns. A lack of mental health support, historically inadequate police approaches to domestic violence complaints, and the over-representation of Indigenous Australians as both perpetrators and vi",
    "A leading vaccine expert says he is \"very worried\" by the large increase in whooping cough cases which have led to the deaths of five babies in England this year.\nProfessor Sir Andrew Pollard, head of the UK's vaccine committee, said the youngest were at greatest risk and more pregnant women should be vaccinated.\nIf the disease continues to spread, more babies will die, he warned.\nThe whooping cough vaccine is offered to babies and pre-school children.\nThe \"only thing we can actually do\" about rising cases of whooping cough is to ensure higher vaccination rates, Prof Pollard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\"Very important - for this very vulnerable group, those who are too young to be vaccinated - is the vaccination rate in pregnant women,\" he added.\n\"Worryingly, those have fallen from a peak of about 75% of women being vaccinated during pregnancy to under 60% today, and that's what puts these very young infants at particular risk.\"\nLondon has particularly low vaccination rates of 36.8%.\nUK health officials say there have been 1,319 cases of whooping cough in England in March, up from 900 in February, giving a total of nearly 2,800 so far this year.\nThe bacterial infection, which can develop into prolonged bouts of coughing, is a cyclical disease, with peaks seen every three to five years. \nThe last peak year came in 2016, when there were nearly 6,000 cases in England.\nHalf of cases seen so far this year have been in the under-15s, with the highest rates in babies under three months, who are most at risk. The five babies who died this year - the first deaths since 2019 - were all under three months old. \n\"The troubling thing is that if we continue to have high rates of spread and low rates of vaccination, there will be more babies severely affected, and sadly there will be more deaths,\" Prof Pollard said.\nA steady decline in uptake of the vaccine and the very low number of infections seen during the pandemic, were both factors in the rise in cases, the UK Health Security Agency said.\nThis also happened with other infections, because restrictions on socialising during the pandemic meant that diseases which normally spread widely were stopped in their tracks, and a peak year was therefore overdue.\nIn September 2023, the number of two-year-olds who completed their routine six-in-one vaccinations, which includes protection against pertussis, was 92.9%, down from 96.3% in March 2014. \nUptake of the maternal pertussis vaccine, which is offered during every pregnancy and provides some protection to babies in the first few months of life, has also dropped. \nThe first signs are similar to a cold, with a runny nose and sore throat. \nAfter about a week, the infection can develop into coughing bouts that last a few minutes and are typically worse at night. \nYoung babies may make a distinctive \"whoop\" or have difficulty breathing after a bout of coughing.\nThe bacterial infection spreads through coughs and sneezes.\nPeople of all ages can catch whooping cough, but it is most serious for young children and babies.\nHealth experts are urging those not vaccinated to come forward to get the jab.\nThe whooping cough vaccine is routinely given as part of the:\nIf you are pregnant, you should also have the whooping cough vaccine - ideally between 16 and 32 weeks.\nChildren who have not been vaccinated can still get the jab up to the age of 10. Vaccination offers enough protection that, if the child is infected, the illness will be mild.\nProf Kamila Hawthorne, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said it was \"highly concerning\" that such a high number of whooping cough cases had been confirmed.\nShe said whooping cough was an uncomfortable experience for most patients, causing restless nights and shortness of breath - but for some it could be \"far more serious\".\nDr David Elliman, consultant in community child health at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, said: \"While the vaccines against whooping cough are not 100% protective, they enormously reduce the chances of babies dying. \n\"Parents should ensure that their babies are immunised on time, but as importantly, that they get the vaccine when pregnant.\"\nHe also said the rise in cases of this infection, as well as of measles, should be \"a wake-up call to the NHS\", adding: \"For too long, successive governments have paid lip service to the importance of preventative healthcare. It is now time that appropriate resources are provided to back up the rhetoric.\"",
    "A general strike against public spending cuts has affected most of Argentina, where schools, banks and many shops remained closed. \nTrain and metro services were suspended on Thursday, with a limited bus service running.\nOne of the main union leaders, Hector Daher, said the 24-hour strike was a wake-up call to President Javier Milei. \nMr Daher urged him to review some of the cuts to subsidies and social programmes. \nMr Milei, a right-wing economist who campaigned with a chainsaw to represent his desire to slash public spending, has begun implementing comprehensive austerity measures since coming into power in December. \nHe says his measures are necessary to reduce Argentina's public deficit and control the country's inflation rate, which is the highest in the world at nearly 300% a year.\nThe president criticised the strike, saying his government had already made many concessions to the unions.\nHis government has trumpeted some successes since he came to power, with officials pointing to falling inflation in recent months. But critics say it has come at a cost, with a slump in economic activity. \nA government spokesman described the strike as \"purely political\", and said it \"damages and complicates the lives of many people\".\nThe unions, however, have accused Mr Milei's cuts of doing the same.\n\"Far from being sustainable, [the cuts are] taking sectors of citizens to extremes that they will hardly be able to recover from if this continues,\" Mr Daher said, according to the Diario Democracia newspaper.\nOther union leaders vowed to continue the collective action if the Argentine government refused to ease some of his measures.\nViggo Mortensen, the Lord of the Rings actor who was raised in Argentina, told RTVE that he felt Mr Milei was a \"clown\" whose administration had been \"a total disaster\" for Argentines.\nBut others expressed anger towards the strikes, as while they predominantly affected public services, many businesses had remained open.\n\"This hurts us because we sell less,\" Cacho, a bingo vendor, told El Tribuno in Salta, northwest Argentina. \"We have to work. I walked 20 blocks [to] come downtown.\"\n\"I barely got a passenger,\" a taxi driver in Buenos Aires told a TN reporter. \"If I don't work one day, I don't eat.\"\nDespite the dissent towards his measures, opinion polls suggest that Mr Milei remains popular with Argentinians. Recent surveys showed his approval rating hovering around 45-50%, just short of the 56% vote share he won in the election. \nIn a recent interview with the BBC, he denied that ordinary citizens were paying the price for his cuts, arguing that \"the most regressive tax that most afflicts people is inflation\".\nMr Milei expressed pride in the fact he had lowered government spending below tax revenue for the first time since 2008, but said that \"there is no magic, real life needs time\".\n\"What would have been the alternative? To continue to print money like the previous administration that generates inflation and ends up affecting the most vulnerable?\"\nHis left-wing predecessor, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, described the cuts as a \"useless sacrifice of the people\" in the wake of the strikes.",
    "Barron Trump is declining to serve as a delegate on behalf of his father at the Republican National Convention, according to his mother's office.\nThe Florida Republican Party announced on Wednesday that the 18-year-old would be among those selecting Donald Trump as the party's presidential nominee.\nReacting to what would have marked his youngest child's political debut, the ex-president said he was \"all for it\".\nBut former First Lady Melania Trump now appears to have shot down the idea.\n\"While Barron is honoured to have been chosen as a delegate by the Florida Republican Party, he regretfully declines to participate due to prior commitments,\" a spokeswoman for Mrs Trump said in a statement, first reported by the Daily Mail.\nIt is unclear if Barron, who graduates from high school next week, will even attend the 15-18 July convention, which takes place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\nOther family members, including his half-siblings Donald Jr, Eric and Tiffany, will all serve as delegates for the state of Florida, where their father now resides and votes.\nIvanka Trump, who has publicly stated she will not be a part of her father's re-election campaign, and her husband Jared Kushner are not currently confirmed as participants.\nNeither is Melania Trump, who has been spotted at political events hosted at the couple's Mar-a-Lago resort home in Palm Beach but has not joined Mr Trump on the campaign trail or at his ongoing criminal trial in New York.\nWhile other family members have become involved with the Trump campaign, Mrs Trump has kept their son - the only child from a nearly two-decade marriage - largely out of the public eye.\nAttending a private school in Maryland during Mr Trump's presidency, he rarely appeared in public, with his mother reported to be fiercely protective of his privacy.\nComments on his appearance and behaviour from his father's critics often drew fierce rebukes from the first lady's office, as well as from other former first children, most notably Chelsea Clinton.\nIn a story this week confirmed by the Florida Republican Party, the high school senior was to be on Florida's list of 41 delegates, alongside family members and a number of Mr Trump's close allies.\nAs a delegate, Barron would stand on the convention floor and join the Florida delegation in formally nominating his father.\nThe three-day convention will see each of the nation's 50 states and territories do the same, and will end with Mr Trump confirmed as the Republican candidate for November's presidential election.\nHis son's first foray into politics drew a joyful response from Mr Trump, who described him in a Thursday interview with Telemundo 51 as \"very cute\". \n\"He's pretty young, I will say. He's 17,\" the former president said, appearing to misstate his age. \"But if they can do that, I'm all for it.\"\nIn a separate interview, Mr Trump said his son, who is reportedly considering attending college at New York University (NYU), likes politics.\n\"It's sort of funny,\" he told Philadelphia's Talk Radio 1210 WPHT. \"He'll tell me sometimes, 'Dad, this is what you have to do.'\"\nMr Trump is currently fighting his first of four criminal trials, where he has been charged with falsifying business records in New York. He denies any wrongdoing.\nHe has been given special permission by the judge to take time out of court to attend Barron's high-school graduation next Friday.",
    "The government is planning one of the toughest smoking laws in the world, which would effectively ban it.\nSmoking has been on the decline for two decades. In fact, more young people now vape than smoke tobacco.\nBut one recent estimates suggests that about 350 young people still take up smoking each day in the UK. \nAmong 15-year-olds, nearly one in 10 say they sometimes smoke.\nSo why does this deadly habit still hold appeal?\nLouis, 22, started smoking aged 19 while at university. \"I thought I might as well give it a try,\" he says.\nThe student from Barnstaple, Devon, is among the 11.6% of people aged 18-24 in the UK who smoke and says he mostly does it \"on nights out drinking outside pubs\". \nBut his first cigarette was not his first taste of nicotine. He was already hooked on vapes. \nHe thinks lots of people his age are drawn to smoking by vaping, even though they were designed to help smokers quit. \nHe says having both options made it more \"convenient\" to get a nicotine fix. \n\"Because cigs are expensive you can supplement with a vape and puff on that constantly.\"\nThere is, however, no strong evidence that vapes lead to smoking.\nAt least one study suggests vapers may be more likely to become smokers. But we don't know that there is a direct link from one to the other, says Dr Sarah Jackson, from University College London's Alcohol and Tobacco Research Group.\n\"It may be these people have a sort of propensity for nicotine use or risk-taking behaviour, so someone who tries vaping is also more likely to try smoking,\" she says.\nDr Jackson's recent research suggested there may have been a slight rise in young people taking up smoking during the pandemic, but she says rates are likely to be in decline again. \nBut \"we can't ever become complacent with smoking\", she adds.\nOne of her big concerns is that negative publicity about vaping may be putting smokers off using them as a quitting tool.\nEleanor, a 23-year old graduate from Widnes, Cheshire, says she is addicted to nicotine - first a smoker, now a vaper too.\nPeering over at a stash of nicotine products on her windowsill, she says: \"This is disgusting. When I got paid last month\u2026 I bought a bag of tobacco and all my skins and filters, I bought a vape and I bought a pack of cigs.\"\nHers is a familiar tale. Aged 15, she was introduced to smoking at house parties.\nAnd when she later left home to study, it became a regular vice.\n\"It just sort of went hand in hand with being at uni in Manchester,\" she says.\nSmoking was a big part of Eleanor's university social life. Outdoor areas at house parties were always \"way better\" than inside, as her smoker friends would all spend the evening there, she says.\nBut during her university years, nicotine vapes became the big new thing, which she joined in with.\nRather than help her quit smoking, it had the opposite effect, she says. \n\"I think as a result of vaping more, I became more addicted to nicotine. And I then started to smoke more as well\u2026 but I wouldn't mind what form it came in. I would vape, smoke cigs, rollies, snuffs even.\"\nEleanor said the government's plan to effectively ban smoking was \"hypocritical\". She said excessive drinking, also a major cause of hospital admissions, seemed to be \"acceptable\".\nLouis says smoking is also a central part of his social gatherings.\n\"You want to see for yourself what's going on. You get fear of missing out on a conversation.\"\nAnd he describes a type of \"camaraderie\" among smokers gathering outside pubs and clubs\n\"You go outside for a breather and a smoke and there are other people outside and you instantly make a connection, it's actually a conversation starter.\"\nJo, a 22-year-old smoker from Sheffield says \"peer pressure\" was a factor.   \nJo, who uses the pronoun \"they\" says: \"Everyone I know smokes basically... I'll go to meet with friends, they'll be smoking.\"\nThey think lots of young people feel \"social pressure\" when cigarettes are handed out.\n\"They'll push a bit, they're like, oh, go on. You'll enjoy it.\"\nJo says the planned ban was \"definitely the right direction\" but felt it would lead to an expansion of the black market.\n\"Because it's so easy to get hold of them. The trade is so big that it won't stop people\".\nJo also believes smoking is sometimes a \"backlash against vaping\", by people concerned with their image. \n\"It's like this new modern, obnoxious thing\u2026 It's cool or retro.\n\"Because everyone smoked back in the 70s and people look back to those idols. I've got a great classic picture of David Bowie with a cigarette. I think people look back at that and think, oh, yeah, that was cool.\"\nLouis agrees that it's partly an \"image thing\".\n\"I think that's why me and my friends do it - it goes hand in hand with it - sex, drugs and rock and roll type thing. You see the most famous musicians of old with cigarettes hanging out of their mouth.\"\nThere is strong evidence the inclusion of smoking in films, on TV and in music videos is a risk-factor in young people taking up the habit.

    "\"When I left for work on Monday, I could still get through the water-logged street with my car. By the afternoon, the army was rescuing people with a truck,\" says Porto Alegre resident Magda Moura.\nThat was the day that the floods which have devastated parts of southern Brazil cut off the building she lived in.\n\"By Wednesday, the water had reached [a height of] 1.7m (5ft 6in),\" she recalls. \nThe 45-year-old physiotherapist is one of 408,100 people who have been displaced by floods triggered by torrential rain in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul.\nAt least 116 people have died across the state and, with many towns still cut off by the flood waters, hopes of finding the more than 140 people who are still missing are dwindling. \nMuch of the state capital, Porto Alegre, has been plunged into darkness by the flood, which has damaged power and water treatment plants, also leaving most residents without drinking water.\nMagda, 45, and her husband, 49-year-old Angelo Tarouco, spent two days rescuing neighbours cut off by the flood waters which surrounded their high-rise buildings. \n\"Of all the occupants of the towers, only a young couple remained on the premises,\" she says.\nThe couple told her that they had enough provisions to last them for a week but with food and water scarce in the city she cannot help but worry about them. \nAbout 70,000 people are living in temporary shelters. Roselaine da Silva is one of them. She is staying in an evangelical church with her three children, one of whom has autism. Their two dogs are with them, but she says she's had to leave her two cats behind in her flooded Sarandi neighbourhood.\n\"I didn't know the water would take over like this,\" she says, her voice choked with emotion. \"I've cried so much, blaming myself for leaving them in what I thought was a safe place.\"\nIn her makeshift bedroom in the church, Roselaine - surrounded by donated clothes and other displaced families - says she has found some comfort in the support of strangers who have opened their doors to those in need.\nIn the northern zone of the city, the evangelical church has become a lifeline for dozens of families like Roselaine's huddled in the halls.\nThey too have lost everything to the floodwaters, their homes submerged, their possessions destroyed.\nPastor Dari Pereira, overwhelmed by the influx of displaced people, says he is doing his best to provide for everyone's needs.\n\"We offer four meals a day, hot showers, medical and psychological assistance,\" he explains, his voice weary but determined. \"But the demand keeps growing, and we ran out of space. We now have to relocate people to other shelters.\"\nHe believes it is important to offer shelter not only to people but also to their pets, adding that it is crucial for families' emotional healing.\n\"We didn't separate people from animals because separating them would take away everything they had,\" he says.\n\"Today the vet said these animals could not stay inside because of the risk of transmitting diseases. But the school across the street has given us the gymnasium so we can build a kennel and a cattery.\"\nWhile some volunteers stockpile water, others sort donated clothes by size, and part of the team distributes the dozens of hot meals that have just arrived, also as donations.\nGiven the extent of the devastation, Marcelo Dutra da Silva, professor of ecology at  the Federal University of Rio Grande (FURG), says that this time the public response needs to change radically.\n\"It's no use trying to rebuild everything that was destroyed in this current event trying to make it as it was before. That doesn't work any more.\"\nAccording to Mr Dutra da Silva, the reconstruction of Rio Grande do Sul will need to be planned by taking into consideration which areas are safer and more resistant to extreme climate variations and which are here to stay.\n\"Entire cities will have to change location,\" he says.\n\"It is necessary to move urban infrastructures away from these higher-risk environments, which are the lower, flatter, and wetter areas, the hillside areas, the riverbanks, and the cities located within valleys.\"\nBut the road ahead will be long and difficult. The flood crisis has left neighbourhoods isolated, with residents struggling to access basic necessities like food and clean water. The city's infrastructure has been severely damaged, and it will take months, if not years, to recover.\nThe continuous rainfall is a constant reminder of the fragility of life in this flood-prone city. The fear of further flooding looms large, casting a shadow over the already devastated communities.\nDespite the devastation and despair, there are glimmers of hope. Churches, community centres, and volunteers have been coming together to provide support and assistance to those in need. Donations pour in from across Brazil, and people from all walks of life are lending a helping hand.\nAs Roselaine watches her children play with other children displaced by the floods, she refuses to give u",

    "A Roman \"service station\" may have been found on the site of a major road development, archaeologists say.\nSome of the pieces found at the A417 in the Cotswolds are from the Neolithic period, dating back 12,000 years.\nThe items, which include a rare cupid figurine, Roman nail cleaner, pottery, coins and jewellery, went on display at a public event held at Gloucester Guildhall on 11 May.\nAlex Thompson, project manager from Oxford Cotswold Archaeology, said they believe the items may have been used by people travelling between settlements.\n\"We have a nice Roman settlement and it lies on Ermin Street, the road between Roman Cirencester and Gloucester,\" said Mr Thompson.\n\"We think that our settlement was being used to help with people that were travelling along the road and probably something to do with horses.\"\nOne of the theories is that the settlement may have been used for people to stop by to have their horses cared for or exchanged.\n\"We have a nice Roman building that may have been used as stabling or potentially as somewhere where you could stay the night and have your horse looked after,\" he added.\"\nThe pieces date from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Roman periods, and the Second World War.\nOne of the the most unusual finds from the dig was a small Cupid figurine from the Roman period, said Mr Thompson.\nFound during the excavation phase of the dig, the figurine is 7cm (2.7in) in height and is made from copper alloy.\nThe figurine is a depiction of Cupid in the style of Hercules. \n\"It represents the power of love over even the strongest Heroes. It was probably a love token,\" added Mr Thompson.\n\"It wouldn't have been cheap. It's a really unusual and special find.\"\nOf more than a thousand metal figurines from across Roman Britain, some 33 are known to depict Cupid, although this example appears to be the first to show Cupid as Hercules.\nArchaeologists also unearthed a Roman nail cleaner.\nAccording to Oxford Cotswold Archaeologists, Roman nail cleaners come in a variety of forms.\nThe one found in the A417 is a distinctive type which integrates a disc-shaped bone bead at its neck. This form has a pronounced western British distribution.\n\"The Romans were very clean people,\" said Mr Thompson.\n\"So you quite often find nail cleaners, small cosmetic sets and things like that.\"\nThe team also discovered a number of brooches - a commonly found piece of Roman jewellery. \nMr Thompson said the copper alloy brooches were likely to belong to the working people of the settlement.\n\"An archaeologist may only find something like that once in their career,\" he said.\n\"But it's the whole story that we're really interested in - it's how you draw those all together to create a narrative.\"\nMr Thompson said the team hopes to transfer the artefacts to the Corinium museum in Cirencester.\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The family of a 13-year-old boy who died after being hit by a drink-driver have criticised the \"gut-wrenching\" and \"disgusting\" sentence handed to his killer.\nKaylan Hippsley was struck by a car driven by Harley Whiteman, 19, as he walked with friends to a youth club in Hirwaun, Rhondda Cynon Taf, on 29 February.\nWhiteman was sentenced last week to six years and nine months detention after admitting causing death by dangerous driving.\nThe UK government said those convicted of this crime were going to jail for longer than ever.\nBut Kaylan\u2019s family said it was not enough, with a petition calling for tougher sentences having gathered almost 5,000 signatures and the support of Senedd politicians.\nMerthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard Whiteman had been drinking and taking drugs on the day of the crash, before driving a car from Aberdare to Hirwaun with two passengers.\nWitnesses saw him veering dangerously through the village, before hitting Kaylan as he mounted the kerb to avoid an oncoming vehicle.\nWhiteman then drove away, before later returning on foot to the scene, where he abused onlookers who were trying to help Kaylan.\nSarah Edwards, whose son Lucas had been with Kaylan at the time of the incident, said it was immediately apparent Whiteman was somehow involved.\n\"I actually stood up and confronted him and he gave me a few harsh words, and I asked him if he was the driver,\" she said.\n\"And he made a cocky comment to me 'well if I'm the driver, where\u2019s my car?' and laughed.\n\"It was devastating, an absolutely chaotic scene which Harley Whiteman made 10 times worse with his presence.\u201d\nThe court heard he continued to behave abusively towards police officers who arrested him, and refused to give a breath and blood sample.\nLater, Kaylan\u2019s mother Lisa Hippsley arrived at the scene.\n\"All I could remember was just blue lights everywhere, cordoned off the road. So I knew it was bad, I really knew it was bad,\" she said. \nAfter he was taken to hospital, the family were told that he had suffered a \"catastrophic head injury\" and they should prepare for the worst. \nKaylan died three days later, on 3 March.\nKaylan\u2019s grandmother Kay, with whom he lived, has still not been able to return to the family home since the night of the incident.\n\"The effect it\u2019s had on her and the rest of the immediate family has been devastating,\" said Kaylan\u2019s great aunt, Tracey Lewis.\n\"I don't think Kay is ever going to come back from this.\"\nSarah added there was a \"sense of eeriness\" around the community, with her son Lucas among those \"completely traumatised\" at having lost someone he considered a \"brother\".\n\"He feels like a piece of him has been taken, and he longs for his friend every day,\" she said.\nLisa said the image of her son lying in the road \"constantly\" plays over in her mind, adding: \"That\u2019s all I see before I go to sleep in the night. And I can't think of any happy memories anymore.\"\nDuring Whiteman\u2019s sentencing, Judge Jeremy Jenkins said his behaviour had been \"abhorrent and heartless\".\nDespite deeming it a Category A offence, Whiteman was handed a sentence towards the lower end of the scale for such a conviction. \nWith time deducted for a guilty plea, and a release on licence midway through, it could mean Whiteman spends less than three-and-a-half years locked up.\nJulie Craig, another of Kaylan\u2019s great aunts, was among almost two dozen family and friends in court to hear the sentence, which left them feeling \"absolutely disgusting\".\n\"I feel like we've lost Kaylan all over again,\" she said.\nTracey described the \"gut-wrenching\" feeling of having to relay the outcome to Kay, who could not bear attending.\n\"We\u2019ve got to go back and say to his nan that Kaylan\u2019s life was worth nothing \u2013 three years, four months,\" she said. \n\"I can\u2019t believe how angry I am. We believed in the system, and I really thought we\u2019d get some kind of justice, and that\u2019s just a joke.\n\"It\u2019s an insult to Kaylan\u2019s memory.\"\nGrandfather Ron Griffiths \u2013 who Kaylan affectionately called \"dad Ron\" \u2013 was among those most visibly emotional in court when the sentence was given.\n\"That sentence was a Mickey Mouse sentence. We want the judge to have a look at it and give what he should have.\"\nThe family are considering an appeal against the sentence, and have also launched a petition calling for harsher punishments for causing death by dangerous driving.\n\"The leniency of this sentence will sicken many people,\" said Andrew RT Davies, Member of the Senedd (MS) for South Wales Central, who called for a review of sentencing guidance.\nCynon Valley MS Vikki Howells said she understood the family\u2019s \"frustration at what they feel is an inadequate sentence\" and hoped the UK government would listen \"to the family\u2019s heartfelt pleas\".\nHeledd Fychan, who also represents South Wales Central, added she understood the family\u2019s desire for a \"sentence which reflects the seriousness of the offence\".\nAlthough the family have not had the closure they hoped for yet, efforts are already under way to leave",
    "Politics this week may seem to have been all about the controversial defection of a now former Conservative MP and the fall-out from the local and mayoral elections.\nBut behind the headlines a new front opened in the political skirmishing ahead of the coming general election.\nUnusually, it involved foreign policy.\nThree men gave three speeches - a former foreign secretary, the current holder of the office and the man who wants his job: David Miliband, who had the role from 2007 to 2010; David, Lord Cameron; and David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary.\nDespite their different perspectives, the three Davids shared a remarkable consensus about the challenges Britain and its allies face.\nAll three spoke of the collective dangers posed by China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. \nLord Cameron called them \u201can axis of authoritarian states\u201d acting together \u201cin an attempt to undermine us and our allies\u201d. \nMr Lammy spoke of the risks of an \u201cantihegemonic coalition united\u201d against the West. \nMr Miliband \u2013 currently head of the International Rescue Committee in New York - referred to \u201can aggressive Russia... bolstered by strong Chinese support\u201d.\nAll three also spoke of the need for Europe to do more to defend itself against this threat. \nMr Lammy and Mr Miliband were most explicit in warning that US support for European defence could diminish regardless of who wins the presidential election.\nMr Miliband said Europeans should \u201chedge against the prospect that it will not be plain sailing in the event that President Biden is re-elected\u201d. \nMr Lammy said the focus of the US was shifting to the Indo-Pacific and Europe had to \u201cdo more to look after our own back yard\u201d.\nYet if there was some shared analysis, there was less consensus about the remedy.\nLord Cameron\u2019s answer was for the West to be more assertive in defending its interests. Too many allies, he said, were adopting a kind of \u201cdefensive crouch\u201d when instead they should have the courage to act.\nIn his speech at the National Cyber Security Centre, he said western nations should give their foreign policies a harder edge. \nThat meant forging new alliances, making security a priority, defending values more boldly, and showing greater strategic patience.\nHis one specific call was for a new target for NATO members to spend 2.5% of their national wealth on defence. He claimed this was a point of difference with Labour.\nThe Conservatives promise to reach that target by 2030; Labour says it will do so the same \u201cas soon as resources allow\u201d.\nDavid Lammy\u2019s prescriptions had a different emphasis, with political signals for both sides of the Atlantic. \nIn his speech at the Hudson Institute, a highly conservative think tank in Washington he too spoke of the need for deeper cooperation with allies.\nFor his immediate audience, that meant emphasising a Labour government would work with Donald Trump if he won a second term. \nMr Lammy claimed Mr Trump was \u201coften misunderstood\u201d. He said Mr Trump did not want the US to abandon Europe, merely that Europeans should \u201cdo more to ensure a better defended Europe\u201d. \nFor voters back home, Mr Lammy promised deeper cooperation with European allies. He said a future Labour government would not re-join the EU, the Single Market or the Customs Union. \nBut it would seek \u201ca new geopolitical partnership with Europe, enshrined in a new UK-EU security pact\u201d.\nIn a lecture in London, David Miliband went much further.\nHe said a Labour government should indeed forge a new security pact with the EU.\nBut it should deal not just with defence and foreign affairs but also climate security, food security, health security and energy security. \nHe said the UK should agree a new high-level political declaration with the EU, setting out a framework for future cooperation. \nThat could involve regular dialogue between British and EU foreign affairs officials, the foreign secretary attending some meetings of EU counterparts, joint peacekeeping operations and defence procurement arrangements.\nThe problem is that while diplomats in London told me they liked much of Lord Cameron\u2019s speech, they also know he might not be in office for long. \nThe foreign secretary is trying to score fast diplomatic runs before he loses his wicket. But will his policy ideas survive the general election?\n\nAs for Messrs Lammy and Miliband, their focus on Europe poses a big question. Is the EU ready for a renewed relationship with the UK? One European ambassador told me: \u201cMy fear is that we are not ready to listen. There are still many people in the system bruised by Brexit who think it\u2019s too early.\u201d\nIt is a truism of politics that foreign affairs rarely change the minds of voters. But that may be less true this time around. \nThe war in Gaza shifted votes in last week\u2019s local elections. Spending more money on defence means less for schools and hospitals. \nThe jobs of many voters depend on access to foreign markets. Immigration, pandemics and climate change are at the front of many voters\u2019 minds.\nRight n",
    "Ukraine says it has repelled a Russian armoured attack in the north-eastern Kharkiv region, after Moscow's forces launched an incursion across the border and sought to break through defensive lines. \nKharkiv regional head Oleh Syniehubov said Russian reconnaissance groups had tried to penetrate the border, adding that \"not a single metre has been lost\".\n\"Russia has launched a new wave of counteroffensive operations in the Kharkiv sector,\" said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\nAlso on Friday, a huge fire broke out at an oil storage depot in Ukraine's occupied Luhansk region after what Russian-installed officials said was a Ukrainian strike. Three people were killed in the attack, they added.\nUkrainian commanders have been expecting a summer offensive for some time, possibly even a bid to capture the regional capital, Kharkiv. But officials are adamant Russia does not have the resources to do so.\nRussia had the capability to aggravate the situation in border areas but not the ability to capture Ukraine's second city, said the head of Ukraine's centre for countering disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko.\nUkrainian reports suggested Russia was trying to create a 10km buffer zone for its Belgorod region, after a series of Ukrainian cross-border attacks.\nFriday's small incursions over the Russian border form a familiar yet disturbing axis for Ukrainian forces.\nThe defence ministry in Kyiv said the attack started with the heavy bombing of the town of Vovchansk \"using guided aerial bombs\" with the support of artillery. Then, small Russian \u201cscouting groups\u201d moved in across the border, reportedly in several places.\nThe local head in Vovchansk, 75km (45 miles) north-east of Kharkiv, said the town had come under heavy attack from the early hours of Friday and civilians were being evacuated. Some 3,000 people live in Vovchansk and at least one person was killed and five more injured in the barrage, according to Kharkiv's regional leader.\n\"At approximately 05:00, there was an attempt by the enemy to break through our defensive line under the cover of armoured vehicles. As of now, these attacks have been repulsed, fighting of varying intensity continues,\" the defence ministry said.\nPresident Zelensky said the Russians had been engaged \"with our troops, brigades and artillery\", but added that a fierce battle was under way.\nCivilians were being evacuated from the Vovchansk district while reserve troops move in, officials added.\nIn the occupied Luhansk region, Russian officials reported that Ukrainian forces had attacked the city of Rovenky, killing three people and injuring seven.\nThe Russian-installed health ministry said four of those injured were in a serious condition.\n\"Because of the shelling, the oil depot was engulfed by flames and nearby houses were damaged,\" Russian-installed Governor Leonid Pasechnik wrote on Telegram.\nIt was the second such attack this week. On Wednesday, an attack on another oil depot in the region injured five people.\nUkrainian bloggers and Telegram channels reported Friday's attack and posted pictures of a large blaze.\nHowever, there has been no comment from Ukrainian officials.\n\nOn Friday, the US announced a new $400m (\u00a3319m; \u20ac371m) military aid package for Ukraine.\nIt will be Washington's third instalment of aid to the country after months of political deadlock and delays - adding to the previous package worth a total of $7bn sent in late April.\nIn a statement, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken announced that the \"urgently needed\" aid would include air defence munitions, artillery rounds, anti-tank weapons and armoured vehicles.\nOn Friday, the White House gave its assessment of the situation, with National Security Spokesman John Kirby telling reporters the US thinks Russia \"will make further advances in the coming weeks to try and establish a buffer zone along the Ukrainian border\".\nHowever, he said that Washington was confident in Ukraine's ability to withstand such attacks, and would be \"working around the clock\" to ensure the country had all the necessary tools and weapons to do so.\nMoscow has been looking to capitalise on the delayed arrival of US ammunition and weaponry by continuing to push in the eastern Donetsk region.\nThe return of heavy fighting in the north-east further illustrates Russia's growing confidence and ambitions.\nThe deputy chief of Ukraine's military intelligence, Maj Gen Vadyn Skibitsky, told The Economist last week that Russia was gearing up for an assault on both Kharkiv and the northern region of Sumy. That warning was repeated by the commander of Ukrainian ground forces, Lt Gen Oleksandr Pavliuk.\nTens of thousands of Russian forces are said to have gathered on the border.\nYou could be forgiven for seeing a repeat of 2022, when Russia failed to capture Kharkiv and Sumy in the early weeks of its full-scale invasion. Russian forces did occupy the border town of Vovchansk for several months, until they were pushed out in September 2022.\nOutwardly at least, offi",
    "Toronto, Canada's largest city, will be home to the next franchise of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), Canadian media has reported. \nThe new team is expected to start playing in 2026, industry sources told the CBC and the Toronto Star. \nThe addition is part of a larger expansion by the WNBA, which is hoping to grow to a total of 16 teams by 2028. \nThe expansion to Toronto brings the total number of teams in the league to 14. \nIt also marks the league's first expansion outside of the US. \nKilmer Sports Venture, a company founded by Toronto billionaire Larry Tanenbaum, will be spearheading the expansion to the city, according to media reports.\nMr Tanenbaum is a minority owner and chairman of Maple Leafs Sports and Entertainment, which owns several other Toronto sports franchises including the ice hockey team the Toronto Maple Leafs, the men's basketball team the Toronto Raptors, and the Major League Soccer team Toronto FC. \nAn official announcement is expected on 23 May. \nAsked about the reports on Friday, Toronto's mayor Olivia Chow was tight-lipped, saying: \"Hopefully there will be good news soon. Just wait.\" \nThe WNBA's commissioner Cathy Engelbert stated last month that her league intends to grow by three additional teams in the next four years.\nEarlier this year, the women's basketball league announced its 13th team in the San Francisco Bay Area. The team is expected to play in the 2025 season.\nOther cities that were considered alongside Toronto for the league's 14th team included Philadelphia, Portland, Denver and Nashville, Ms Engelbert has said. \n\"We're talking to a lot of different cities,\" she told reporters in April, adding \"it's complex because you need an arena and a practice facility and player housing and all the things, you need committed long-term ownership groups. The nice thing is we're getting a lot of calls.\"\nBasketball has enjoyed major success in Toronto in recent years, after the city's National Basketball Association (NBA) team the Toronto Raptors won the championship in June 2019 - a feat that was celebrated by hundreds of thousands of fans that packed the city's streets at the time.\nWomen's basketball has also seen a surge in fans in North America following the success of college player Caitlin Clark, who was selected earlier this year by the Indiana Fever in the WNBA draft \nThanks to Clark's rise in popularity, ticket prices for the women's championship this year cost twice as much as the men's on average, reaching as high as $11,000 (\u00a38,736).\nCanada has hosted WNBA games in the past, most recently a pre-season game between the Los Angeles Sparks and Seattle Storm, which took place in Edmonton, Alberta on 4 May. \nAccording to CBC, Toronto's team will play in the city's Coca-Cola Coliseum, an 8,000-seat arena that is currently home to Toronto's Professional Women's Hockey League team.\nThe BBC has reached out to the WNBA for comment on its reported expansion to Toronto.

    "The nails are out.\nLoreen isn't even performing today. She's meeting the press, mostly on Zoom, from a hotel room in Sweden. \nNonetheless, she's in full stage gear: Draped in black, with her hair carefully toussled and her trademark talons. \nToday, they're three inches long and shaped like icicles, reflecting sunlight onto the walls.\nThat's the sort of dedication it takes to win Eurovision twice - something that Loreen achieved with victories in Baku, Azerbaijan, in 2012 and last year in Liverpool.\nSince last year's contest, her winning entry, Tattoo, has been streamed 493 million times on Spotify, making it the third-biggest Eurovision song of all time.\nLoreen will be back at the contest this weekend, performing her new song Forever during the grand final, before setting off on a massive European tour.\nAhead of that, she spoke to the BBC about Forever, her attempts to write a boring song, and the demonstrations that have overshadowed this year's contest.\n\nSo you\u2019re back with a new song. Tell us everything.\nI created this song specifically for Eurovision on Saturday. I had a narrative in my head, I knew what the performance needed to look like and then I said, \u201cOkay, I need a song for this\u201d.\nSo you hadn\u2019t written any music at that point?\nExactly. So I went into the studio with my team and the funny thing was, I said \u201cLet's find the right chords\" and they just came. Then I took the mic and it was like [makes a coo-ing noise like a pigeon] \u201cYou make me feel like forever\u201d.\nAnd it was like, there you go, that\u2019s the song.\nCan I just say how much I enjoyed your pigeon impression?\nI don\u2019t know why I do that! It just does something to the energy in the room. Sometimes I make noises without knowing why.\nIt\u2019s a good way to communicate. If you don\u2019t have the perfect word, you can convey the feeling.\n[Loreen coos like a pigeon]\nYou\u2019ve said that Forever is a continuation of the story from Tattoo. Is that a narrative that\u2019s going to run through your new album?\nWell, there's a whole suite of songs. My album is definitely going to be a journey. There\u2019s some crying, some joy, I want all of those feelings to be. I might even have a song that is so boring that you\u2019re like, \u201cHuh, what is this?\u201d\nWhat would a boring Loreen song sound like?\nOh God, something with no passion, no drama.\nGive us an example. What counts as a dreary day for you?\nIt would probably be like, \u201cLoreen, gather up your receipts, we need to see your accountant.\u201d\nWell, The Beatles have a song called Taxman, so why not you?\nThat\u2019s a really good idea! Wouldn\u2019t it be funny if I had a song on the album called Tax Return?\nAnd the lyrics can be about how Eurovision has put you in debt.\nI wouldn\u2019t call it an expensive performance, though. More like super expensive!\nTake me back to last year. You arrived in Liverpool having already won Eurovision once. Did that put pressure on you to win again\u2026 or was it the opposite and the pressure was off?\nOh no, I always feel pressure. The reason why is that I\u2019m very aware that people are giving up their time to watch these performances. They have paused their lives to focus on this one point in time, and for me not to pressure myself for those three moments is a disrespect. I'm not going to waste people's time.\nHow unusual is that? Don\u2019t most artists create music to fulfil something inside themselves?\nThe way I see it, I can create all by myself - but what I create would not exist if it wasn't for a connection. Everything is about connection.\nBut at the end of the day, Eurovision is competition. How did you feel as the votes came in?\nThe thing is, I was sitting there and I thought, \u201cI can\u2019t control this. I have to let it be what it is going to be.\u201d\nBut let me tell you, the energy in that room was crazy. Everyone was so nervous, and that made me nervous too.\nThe vote was very close. In the end, there wasn\u2019t much separating you and the Finnish contestant K\u00e4\u00e4rij\u00e4. Did you hug it out afterwards?\nI was actually a bit sad when I won \u2013 because when I stood up, I wanted to go over to K\u00e4\u00e4rij\u00e4 and congratulate him. I knew how he\u2019d be feeling. Sitting there, you're so vulnerable. But there were so many people around him that I couldn't find my way through.\nBut we spoke afterwards. He was like, \u201cWhen are you coming to Finland to have a drink with me?\u201d\n\nAfter you won, an interviewer asked how you planned to celebrate and you replied, \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep\u201d.\nI\u2019m not a party chick at all. When I\u2019m on tour people get frustrated because I\u2019m like, \u201cDo you know what, I\u2019m going to go to bed now\u201d and people are going, \u201cWhat do you mean? The party\u2019s just started!\u201d\nOff stage, this year\u2019s contest has become very politicised, with a lot of criticism of Israel. What do you make of the protests that are happening in Sweden?\nI understand that. All of us are affected by what\u2019s going on [but] we don\u2019t know what to do because it\u2019s such a complex situation. Some react with aggression, some cry, some shut down. We are different in that way, so I understand where i",
    "The brother of Peru's under-pressure president, Dina Boluarte, has been arrested for his alleged involvement in a corruption network. \nProsecutors say Nicanor Boluarte used powers granted by his sister to release funds to regional leaders and mayors in exchange for bribes. He denies wrongdoing. \nArrest warrants have been issued for 21 other people, including President Boluarte's lawyer, Mateo Casta\u00f1eda.\nIt comes weeks after the embattled president's private home was raided in a scandal over Rolex watches, which she had allegedly not declared. \nHer older brother, Nicanor Boluarte, 64, is accused of leading a corruption and influence peddling scheme working to appoint officials to government positions in different parts of the country. \nProsecutors allege that this was in exchange for money and an agreement that the officials would help gather signatures to register a political party, known as the Citizens for Peru party, which Mr Boluarte would head up, according to the Associated Press news agency.\nMeanwhile, prosecutors accuse Mr Casta\u00f1eda of interfering with the investigation against Mr Boluarte.\nMr Casta\u00f1eda is advising President Boluarte in the corruption inquiry which has been dubbed \"Rolexgate\". She also denies wrongdoing.\nThe arrests of both Mr Boluarte and Mr Casta\u00f1eda, and police raids of their homes, were captured on local television. \nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, Peru's judiciary said it had ordered the \"preliminary detention\" of Nicanor Boluarte, and others, for a period of 10 days.\nAt a public event on Friday, President Boluarte did not make reference to the arrests but said she trusted Peru's justice system. \n\"We will not be distracted by minor matters, we believe in justice, we believe in the reasonableness of those who administer justice in the country, and in that regard the government will continue to bet on democracy and to respect the constitution,\" she said.\nThis is the latest saga in what has been a scandal-hit presidency for Ms Boluarte. \nIn January 2023, just weeks after taking office, an inquiry was launched into Ms Boluarte and some of her key ministers over charges of \"genocide, qualified homicide and serious injuries\".\nIt followed the death of more than 50 supporters of ex-President Pedro Castillo in a government crackdown on demonstrations calling for her resignation and fresh elections.\nMr Castillo, a left-wing politician, was arrested in December 2022 for trying to dissolve Congress.\nHe was dismissed by Parliament and is now imprisoned while being investigated for alleged corruption and rebellion.\nHuman rights groups accuse the military and the police of excessive use of force and of firing indiscriminately at protesters.",
    "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said that it will \"take time\" for people to \"really feel better\" as figures revealed the UK had emerged from recession. \nThe economy grew by 0.6% between January and March after shrinking in the second half of last year. \nMr Sunak told the BBC that the UK economy has \"real momentum\" but admitted there was \"more work to do\".  \nBoth Labour and the Liberal Democrats said there was little to celebrate. \"After 14 years of economic chaos, working people are still worse off,\" said Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves.\nGross domestic product (GDP) - which measures the amount of goods and services an economy produces - rose by more than expected in the first three months of the year. Analysts had forecast 0.4% growth.\nMr Sunak suggested that there was now some strength behind the UK economy, which saw the fastest pace of growth for two years between January and March.\nThe UK fell into recession at the end of last year after shrinking for two three-month periods in a row.\nMr Sunak said: \"Of course there's more work to do and I get that and that's why I'm keen to stick to our plan and keep delivering for people.\n\"But I think today's figures show that we now have momentum.\"\nHowever, Ms Reeves said: \"This is no time for Conservative ministers to be doing a victory lap and telling the British people that they have never had it so good.\"\nLib Dem Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney said it was the time to call a general election.\nThe economy will be a key battleground in the upcoming election, the date of which is yet to be revealed.\nMeanwhile, the FTSE 100 index closed on a fresh record high after the economic figures came out.\nIt closed 52.41 points, or 0.63% higher, at 8,433.76, with finance and industrial stocks among the biggest risers of the day.\nEarlier this week, the Bank of England's governor Andrew Bailey told the BBC that the UK was seeing a recovery, though not a strong one.\nThe Bank voted to hold interest rates at a 16-year high of 5.25%. It expects inflation - which measures the pace of price rises - to fall back to its 2% target in the next couple of months. \nThat had lifted forecasts of a rate cut next month. However, the stronger than expected GDP figures have dampened those expectations.\nRuth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said it showed \"the Bank of England doesn't need to rush to cut interest rates\".\nShe said the first rate cut would ultimately be determined by upcoming employment and inflation figures.\nMr Sunak said that the GDP figures show that the UK has the joint highest growth rate in the G7 developed nations, tying with Canada.\nHe added: \"Wages are going up, energy bills are coming down and taxes are going down.\"\nThe government has cut National Insurance by 4% since late last year.\nHowever, it has also kept income tax thresholds frozen so when a person's wage increases, they could be moving up into a higher tax bracket.

    "More than four years after the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ended the special status of Indian-administered Kashmir, the party has decided not to contest this year's general election there. \nPolitical analysts and opposition leaders say the decision hints at anger in the region over the move - and the party's acknowledgement of it. \nRelations between Kashmir and Delhi have been tense for decades. An insurgency against Indian rule and military action against it have claimed thousands of lives in the Himalayan region over the past three decades.\nThe situation worsened in 2019, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked nearly all of Article 370 - a part of the Indian constitution which had given significant autonomy to the region - and divided it into two federally-administered territories of Ladakh, and Jammu and Kashmir. \nThe government also imposed a strict communication blockade and jailed hundreds of political leaders, including three former chief ministers, for months. \nSince then, Mr Modi and his ministers have repeatedly championed the 2019 decision, claiming that it has brought peace to the region. \nIn the last few years, local BJP leaders have also worked extensively to expand its support base in Kashmir by launching door-to-door campaigns.\nSo the party's decision not to field any candidates in the ongoing general election - the first in the region since the abrogation of Article 370 - has come as a surprise to many. (The BJP has candidates in two seats in Hindu-majority Jammu, but none in the three seats of the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley.)\nThe BJP's chief spokesperson in Jammu and Kashmir claims that elections are not a priority and their main objective is to win the \"hearts of the people\". \n\"It took us 75 years to fully integrate Kashmir with the rest of the country and we don't want [to create] an impression that we have done this exercise just to win seats,\" Sunil Seth said. \nBut critics say this is because the party leadership realises that securing victory in the region would not have been easy.\nWhile the \"achievement\" may sell in other states, removing the special status of the Himalayan region hasn't gone down well with the people here, says Noor Ahmad Baba, a political analyst. \nOpposition leaders also allege that Mr Modi's party wanted to avoid the election from turning into a referendum on its 2019 decision. \n\"If people were happy with the abrogation of Article 370, the BJP wouldn't have hesitated to fight,\" says Omar Abdullah, a former chief minister of the region and a member of the National Conference (NC) party. \n\"But they don't want to expose themselves, and to save their face, they have decided not to contest.\"\nVoting in Jammu and Kashmir is being held in five phases. Apart from Mr Abdullah's NC, those in the fray include the People's Democratic Party (PDP), the Peoples Conference (PC) and Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party. India's main opposition party Congress is also contesting.\nLeaders from the NC and PDP have repeatedly claimed that the BJP is supporting the PC and Apni Party in the elections and have called them their \"proxies\". \nThe BJP hasn't made any formal announcements about an alliance. But sources in the BJP told the BBC that it would extend its support to some parties that have strongholds in northern and central Kashmir. Last month, the party's regional chief Ravinder Raina said they would rally behind \"like-minded parties\".\nThe party's decision to cede ground has caught off-guard many of its local members, who say they had been preparing for the polls since 2019. \n\"We had been going door-to-door, meeting people and telling them about the work done by the government,\" said Shabir Ahmad Zargar, a BJP worker from north Kashmir's Kupwara district.\n\"We are disappointed, but we have to accept the decision of the party,\" adds Fida Hussain, another party worker from north Kashmir's Baramulla district. \nThe move is also surprising because this is the first time the BJP has not contested a general election in the region since 1996. \nThe party traditionally does not enjoy much support here, but experts say its cadre base has increased in recent years.\nIts best performance was in the state elections of 2014, when it emerged as the second-largest party and formed the government with the PDP. The party won 25 of the total 87 seats - all in Jammu. \nThis marked the final assembly elections held in the former state. The coalition collapsed in 2018, and Mr Modi's government imposed direct rule in the region.\nThe party received a boost in 2020, after it won the local elections, including three seats in Kashmir.\nTwo years later, the government redrew the boundaries of assembly seats in a way that Jammu received six additional seats, while Kashmir was given one extra seat, taking the tally to 90. (Until 2019, Jammu had 37 seats and Kashmir had 46).\nThe exercise was widely seen as a move to increase the influence of Hindus in the region's electoral politics. \nBut desp",
    "The 75-year-old ringleader of an armed robbery in which a police officer was shot dead almost 20 years ago has been jailed for life for her murder.\nPiran Ditta Khan spent nearly two decades evading justice for his part in the killing of PC Sharon Beshenivsky in Bradford on 18 November 2005.\nKhan, who was extradited from Pakistan last year, was convicted of murder following a trial at Leeds Crown Court.\nHe was told he would serve a minimum term of 40 years in prison.\nThe judge, the Honourable Mr Justice Hilliard, said that PC Beshenivsky's \"courage and commitment to her duty that day cost her her life\".\nHe told Khan: \"The sentence I pass is no measure of the value of the life that has been lost.\n\"That's beyond measure and no sentence I pass can put right what you've done wrong.\" \nPC Beshenivsky had been responding to reports of an armed robbery at the Universal Express travel agents on Morley Street in Bradford with her colleague, PC Teresa Milburn, when she was fatally attacked.\nThe two officers arrived at the scene about 15:30 GMT, but as they approached the entrance, three men burst out of the premises, shooting them both. \nPC Milburn was seriously injured.  \nKhan's trial heard that although he was eating sandwiches in a lookout car when the two officers were shot, he had played a \"pivotal\" role in planning the raid and knew loaded weapons would be used.\nProsecutors said this made him guilty of the officer's murder \"as surely as if he had pulled the trigger himself\". \nNot long after the officer's killing, Khan, who has previous convictions for violence, fled to Pakistan and remained there until he was arrested by Pakistani authorities in January 2020 and extradited to the UK in 2023.\nPassing sentence, the judge detailed how Khan had a number of health ailments, including heart disease and back trouble, and said his \"physical condition will make custody hard to serve\".\nHe added: \"You are responsible for the fact that you are being sentenced at the age of 75 and not at a younger age.\n\"You have had your younger and healthier years at liberty because you chose to leave the country when you feared you were about to be arrested.\"\nPeter Wright, defending, had earlier told the court that due to Khan's age, his \"final years, in all probability, are to be spent in custody with the forbidding prospect that he will die there\".\nDuring Khan's trial, the court had heard how PC Beshenivsky was discussing her daughter Lydia's family birthday party with PC Milburn when she heard the call for assistance.\nIn his sentencing remarks, the judge said: \"We can say with absolute certainty that her thoughts were with her family very shortly before she died.\"\nEarlier in the hearing, a victim impact statement was read out on behalf of Lydia, who described her mum as a \"hero\" who \"paid the ultimate sacrifice\".\n\"I have been told by others that when I was told my mum had died and was not coming home, I screamed my head off around the house,\" she added.\nLydia said in her statement that she had a memory of asking \"often when her mum was coming home\".\nShe said she also remembered seeing her older brother Paul crying, but not understanding why.\n\"Since that day and throughout my life there has always been a void, a void that should have been filled by my mum's presence,\" she said.\n\"But as a result of your actions, Khan, and your associates that day, you robbed me of a future and precious time with my mum.\"\nIn a statement read outside court after sentencing, PC Beshenivsky's family said: \"18 November 2005 is a date that will remain etched in our memories forever. \n\"What started as a happy, special day to celebrate Lydia's fourth birthday, was a day that ended in devastating, sad consequences due to the callous actions of Piran Ditta Khan and his associates.\n\"Since then, 18 November is no longer a birthday celebration - for Lydia and us all - but now a day of remembrance and memorial.\n\"That was the day the lives of our family and those close to Sharon changed forever. As well as Sharon's friend and colleague Teresa, and her family.\"\nThe court had also been told of the impact of the day on PC Milburn, who had since suffered post-traumatic stress disorder.\nIn her victim impact statement, she said: \"I've never grieved for anyone as I have for Sharon. It has taken over my life.\"\nSpeaking after Khan's sentencing, ACC Patrick Twiggs of West Yorkshire Police said: \"Two mums set out to work that day - two ordinary people doing extraordinary work for the public. One didn't return home and one didn't return home in the same way.  \n\"All those years ago we made a promise to hunt down every last member of this gang and today we achieved that.\n\"West Yorkshire Police will continue to honour Sharon's memory, we still mourn the loss, we still miss her, she will be forever in our thoughts.\"\nIt's almost 20 years since PC Sharon Beshenivsky answered the call for help on that fateful day in Bradford. \nThe new officer was 30 minutes away from heading home for her d",
    "A security guard who pulled over a woman on an isolated country lane while impersonating a police officer has been convicted. \nChris Green, 32, of Nero Place, Peterborough, used a flashing blue light in his car to flag the driver down before informing her she had been \"driving dangerously\". \nSwindon Magistrates' Court heard he had been driving at 30mph in a 60mph zone in Wiltshire when she overtook him on 6 May 2023. However, he then overtook her and confronted her.\nWhen challenged, Green said he worked for a fictional undercover crime unit called \"The Brotherhood\" and was unable to produce a badge number. He denied impersonating a police officer but was found guilty on Thursday and is due to be sentenced on 28 June.\nThe court heard it was only after he noticed the victim's young son in the back of the car did he tell the victim he would \"let it go\". \nLater, officers found a blue LED light inside his car as well as police-style handcuffs, a dash cam and a baseball bat.\nOfficers were able to trace the car because the woman recorded his registration plate.\nGreen admitted in court he had illuminated the blue lights, but denied impersonating a police officer.\nSibylle Cheruvier, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"This was a wholly unnerving incident for the victim involved, who was in a vulnerable position as a lone female driver.\n\"I commend the victim for keeping her wits about her and recording Green's number plate, through which police were able to locate him shortly after.\"\n\nShe added: \"Impersonation of a police officer is clearly a cause of concern for the community, and we are pleased that the court has seen through Green's deception.\n\"I am very grateful to the victim for her support throughout this case, without which we would not have been able to prove Green's intentions.\n\"We urge anyone who is unsure if they have been stopped by a genuine police officer to contact the police immediately.\"\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A man accused of helping steal a statue of baseball player Jackie Robinson from a park in Kansas has pleaded guilty. \nRicky Alderete, a 45-year-old man from Wichita, told court that he helped swipe the statue from the park and loaded it in a pickup truck. \nThe bronze statue was cut off at the ankles before it was hauled away by the burglars in January.\nIts theft was met with outcry from community members, who have since raised money to replace it.\nMr Alderete is facing multiple charges including aggravated burglary, aggravated damage to property and theft, according to prosecutors. \nHe pleaded guilty to the charges on Thursday in the Sedgwick County District Court in Wichita, Kansas.\nDistrict Judge Tyler Roush told Mr Alderete that he faces a maximum prison sentence of over 19 years. \nHe also faces a fine of $41,500 (\u00a333,126) that would be paid to League 42, a youth baseball league that plays in McAdams Park, where the statue was stolen from. The league was named after Robinson's jersey number. \nSurveillance footage of the theft shows at least two people entering the park around midnight and stealing the statue, police had previously said.\nMr Alderete is the first to be arrested. He is scheduled to be sentenced on 1 July. \nRobinson, who played for the Brooklyn Dodgers, made history as the first black player in MLB, paving the way for generations of African American ball players.\nEarlier, authorities said there was no evidence to suggest the theft of the statue was a hate crime. Rather, the perpetrators were likely looking to make money.\n\"We believe this theft was motivated by the financial gain of scrapping common metal,\" Police lieutenant Aaron Moses said in February. \nAuthorities also said they believe the statue is no longer intact, and that it has been taken apart by the burglars and would need to be fully replaced.\nSince its theft, nearly $200,000 (\u00a3159,650) was raised by community members through an online fundraiser, and Major League Baseball (MLB), North America's professional baseball league, has since offered to replace it.\nThe new statue is expected to be erected by the summer, city officials have said.",
    "A woman whose husband was killed by their son who has schizophrenia, have called for an independent review into what happened.  \nDaniel Harrison, 37, fled from a secure mental health unit before fatally attacking his father, Dr Kim Harrison, at the family's home in Clydach, Swansea, in March 2022.\nAn inquest found failures in the care of Daniel had \"contributed\" to Dr Harrison's death.\nSwansea Bay University Health Board apologised for its failings and said it had put \"key actions\" in place for improvement.\nDaniel was detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act for manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility.\nHis mother, Dr Jane Harrison, said her son was let down at all stages of his mental health care.\n\"Our family has suffered immeasurable harm at the hands of managers and senior clinicians,\" she said.\n\"We are calling for an independent review of mental health services across Swansea Bay. \n\"Only through external scrutiny will the deep cultural issues that are clearly present be addressed and those responsible for the many professional and systemic failings be held to account.\"\nA prevention of future deaths report, written by the assistant coroner for south west Wales, detailed how a Swansea council mental health worker failed to access Daniel's full history before a formal assessment under the Mental Health Act in February 2021.\nDaniel's parents and brothers had repeatedly raised concerns with both the council and the health board about his behaviour, the report said, after Daniel stopped taking his medication and refused to engage with counselling services. \nThe assessment was also non-compliant, the report continued, because only one doctor was present.\nDaniel then became increasingly paranoid and aggressive towards his parents who, on two more occasions, tried and failed to get a mental health assessment before he was eventually detained in 2022.\nThe coroner's report said the history provided by the Harrison family \"was not afforded sufficient weight\", with \"reliance being placed solely on the records on the system which were out of date\".\nThe report also raised concerns about the health board's use of locum doctors, some of whom did not record notes of their interactions with Daniel.\n\"There is no system within Swansea Bay University Health Board (SBUHB) to ensure doctors are required to record the outcome of their assessment when there is a decision not to admit a patient to hospital,\" the report added.\nIt said the lack of a single medical records system created \"a risk that assessments may be flawed or may not detect that a person requires admission to hospital\".\nThe inquest found staff in the ward where Daniel was being held prior to his escape had no risk assessment training. \nThe report said that only 75% of staff were now trained,  \"which raises a concern that risk to self and others and the risk of absconding will not be properly identified... thus creating a risk that other deaths will occur\".\nThe report also raised concerns about Daniel's refusal to engage with mental health services when he was unwell.\nThe assistant coroner said authorities should refer such cases to \"assertive outreach\". \n\"I am concerned that if consent is required before a mentally unwell person in the community is able to receive assertive outreach then there may be a gap in the mental health services within SBUHB that creates a risk,\" the report stated.\nSwansea Bay health board \"unequivocally\" apologised for its failings and said it had put \"key actions\" in place for improvement, including additional security measures on the ward where Daniel Harrison was treated.\n\"We recognise that insights and information provided by family members about patients play a crucial role in planning and delivering care,\" a spokesperson said. \n\"We have strengthened our processes around ensuring this vital information is robustly recorded and shared with clinical teams.\"\nIt said it would be responding formally to the coroner's report in June. \nSwansea council said it again sent its \"sincere condolences\" to Dr Harrison's family and it would respond formally later to the coroner's report.\n\"We are in the process of reviewing our internal processes to determine what action is necessary in light of the concerns arising from the coroner's inquest and the subsequent report issued relating to the prevention of future deaths.\"",
    "NI's chief medical officer (CMO) has said he accepts that the Department of Health should have used more direct language about triggering pandemic preparation plans in correspondence with The Executive Office. \nProf Sir Michael McBride was testifying at the UK Covid-19 public inquiry.\nHe said Northern Ireland was on high alert from the end of January 2020.\nHe was asked when alarm bells started ringing within the department about the emerging threat.\nLead counsel to the inquiry Clair Dobbin KC put a letter from Liz Redmond, director of population health at Northern Ireland's Department of Health (DoH), to Prof McBride.\nThe letter stated that the \"DoH is responding to the rapidly evolving situation regarding the novel coronavirus as lead government department\". \nIt continued: \"I do not consider it necessary to activate NICCMA [NI Central Crisis Management Arrangements] at this time, unless or until the infection appears in NI and impacts are experienced here.\"\nThe CMO said \"what it wasn't saying was 'don't do anything'\".\nHe said he thought the letter was signalling that the DoH's assessment at the time was \"not just yet - but you need to get ready. You need to prepare\". \nThe first deaths from the new coronavirus were confirmed in January 2020 in China; the first nationwide lockdown was imposed in the UK in March that year.\nProf McBride told the inquiry he thought the department was \"clearly signalling there's a problem coming our way and we need to prepare for it - not just health but other departments need to prepare for this\".\nMs Dobbin put it to Prof McBride that the suggestion, contained in the letter, that \"'it would be helpful if you would consider convening a multi-agency meeting' hardly sounds alarm bells\".\nProf McBride said the department was clearly signalling that there was a potential problem and they needed to be assured of their preparedness, of readiness across government and of resilience throughout Northern Ireland's health sector.\nHe said the wording and its meaning would be \"clearly understood by those who needed to understand\" it.\nBaroness Hallett, who is chairing the inquiry, asked if, in hindsight, it would have been better if the letter had said \"we urge you, as a matter of urgency, to convene a multi-agency meeting\" as opposed to \"it would be helpful if\".\nProf McBride accepted that the letter \"could have been more direct\" or \"more action oriented\" but said that was the sort of language used within government.\nBaroness Hallett said: \"In an emergency you don't do things in a normal way, you get on with it and I'm afraid that language doesn't give any sense of urgency.\"\nProf McBride said he wasn't the author of the letter but accepted the point. \nMs Dobbin put excerpts of a DoH letter to the CMO outlining key public health advice and action to be taken by public authorities in Northern Ireland.\nThe advice given was that \"those public authorities that already have continency plans for responding to infectious diseases, such as pandemic influenza, should ensure that all relevant staff are acquainted with those plans\".\nIt added that \"no other action is recommended at this time to public authorities in general\".\nMs Dobbin said this was \"hardly sounding alarm bells\" for either NI government departments or public authorities.\nThe CMO said all that the letter was doing was \"scene-setting\" for a subsequent briefing meeting. He said that at that meeting \"assurances should be sought around contingency planning across the public sector and other organisations\".\nHe said this letter was not \"meant or intended to explain or set out the level of risk or the level of concern\"; rather, it was \"an enabler\" to facilitate the meeting at which there would be an update provided.\nGiving evidence earlier on Friday Prof McBride told the inquiry the scale of the response to the pandemic had never been planned for.\nHe said Northern Ireland had \"never before performed contact tracing at the scale that we were contact tracing.\"\n\"We had similarly never tested to the extent we were ultimately testing in this pandemic,\" he added. \"It had never been envisaged.\"\nProf McBride said there was initially a \"precautionary approach\" but that \"sitting and waiting was not an option\".\nHe also said he was surprised to hear there was a perception that his role during the pandemic was more than just an advisory one.\n\"I was very clear at every stage that ultimately the decisions were decisions for ministers and I have to say I'm somewhat surprised if there was any perception to the contrary,\" he told the inquiry.\nProf McBride said that not having membership of the UK government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) was a \"disadvantage in the early days\" of the pandemic.\nOn testing older people from hospital into care homes, Prof McBride said one of the learnings should be around the testing of care homes. \nHe said evidence will show that the contribution of discharge from hospital to care homes would show made a very small",

It features 37 performers chosen to represent their country.\nSongs must be original and no more than three minutes long.\nLead vocals must be live and a maximum of six singers and dancers are allowed.\nRecalling the 1994 Eurovision which Ireland, as the previous year's winner, hosted in Dublin, Harrington told BBC News: \"We had no idea how things would go on the night; the song would either walk it or it would do nothing.\" \nHe added: \"The crowd in the Point Theatre was the biggest I've ever played to and just to see the various dignitaries was great.\"\nHarrington and McGettigan's performance, combined with the introduction of Riverdance, which made its debut as the Eurovision interval act, brought Ireland to worldwide television viewers in an unprecedented way.\nTheir song, which tells the story of two lifelong friends reminiscing about their youth, struck a chord with many, combining evocative lyrics with soulful melodies.\n\"The roar of the crowd was like thunder because it was held in Dublin and I just happened to be a Dublin lad also,\" Harrington said.\n\"People still love the song and, in fact, it's become more popular in the past 10-15 years than it was 30 years ago.\"\nThe final tally of votes revealed a clear lead for Ireland, with 60 points ahead of the runner-up, Poland's Edyta G\u00f3rniak.\nThe win followed victories by Linda Martin in 1992 and Niamh Kavanagh in 1993.\nHarrington said he was astonished by how quickly time had past since his and McGettigan's win.\n\"The doors that Eurovision has opened for me since this is nothing but amazing. I actually met my wife at an event I was asked to take part in after the win,\" he added.\n\"Thirty years later and I will be announcing the points from the Irish jury and public live to Malmo in Sweden on Saturday night.\"\nIreland would go on to win for a seventh time in 1996 with Eimear Quinn, cementing Ireland's lead of most Eurovision wins for a country.\nThat has since been matched by Sweden, but no other country has come close to winning three in a row.\nBambie Thug is a self-described queer, \u2018ouija popstar\u2019, who uses the non-binary personal pronouns they and them.\nTheir genre-defying Eurovision entry Doomsday Blue will be performed on Saturday evening's final alongside 25 other countries.\nOn Tuesday evening, Bambie Thug became the first Irish entry to qualify for a Eurovision Grand Final in six years.\nThe Cork singer was among 10 acts to qualify from the first semi-final at the Malmo Arena.\nAnd, the odds are looking good for Bambie Thug - maybe more so than for the UK's Olly Alexander.\nBut to find out if they take home the gold medal position, you'll just have to tune into Saturday's final.",
    "The woman who has been alleged to have inspired the character Martha in hit drama Baby Reindeer has said she will sue its creator and Netflix.\nFiona Harvey told Piers Morgan that the series, in which Martha is shown as a stalker, was \"a work of fiction\".\nShe accused Netflix and Scottish comedian Richard Gadd, who wrote and starred in the show, of \"lying\" in their \"defamatory\" depiction.\nRepresentatives for Gadd and Netflix have been contacted by the BBC.\n\"They have billed it as a true story, and so has he, and it's not,\" Ms Harvey said in the interview. \"He is lying and they are lying.\"\nThe 58-year-old Scot gave the interview after being identified online by viewers who attempted to find out who Martha was based on, calling it \"absolutely horrendous\".\nIn the interview, she accused Gadd of \"making money out of my misery\".\nAfterwards, the Guardian's Stuart Heritage saidMorgan's interview \"reeked of grubby exploitation\", while Ryan Coogan wrote in the Independent that \"you can no more expect him to be sensitive than you can expect a fish to climb a tree\".\nBut Coogan added: \"Morgan isn't the issue here - the real problem with this interview is that there's a market for it at all.\"\nEd Power wrote in The Telegraph the \"60-minute conversation was less a sparring match between Morgan and Fiona Harvey than a dreary question-and-answer session\".\nThe BBC has asked Morgan for comment. \nMorgan repeatedly challenged Harvey about how many emails, phone calls and letters she sent Gadd. The comedian has said his stalker sent more than 41,071 emails, 350 hours of voicemails, 744 tweets, 46 Facebook messages and 106 pages of letters.\nMs Harvey told Morgan there \"may have been a couple of emails\" and later said there were \"less than 10\" emails.\nShe said she sent him one letter and 18 tweets but no Facebook messages, and said she \"doubts\" he has those voice messages because she didn't have his phone number.\nMorgan also questioned her about the fact she uses six email addresses, and pushed her on other questions such as the grade she got in her law degree.\nTowards the end of the interview, Harvey said she would also sue the Daily Mail newspaper. The BBC has contacted them for comment. \nIn a column for the Sun newspaper published on Thursday evening, Morgan wrote: \"On a human level, I felt sorry for her that she's been publicly dragged through the mincer like this.\n\"But there were moments in the interview where my suspicious alarm bells rang loud.\"\nThe BBC contacted Harvey following her interview but she was not immediately available for comment.\nShe reportedly told the Daily Record that she was \"not happy\" with the interview and that she had been paid \u00a3250 to take part.\nBaby Reindeer, a word-of-mouth hit for the streaming giant, has left many people fascinated and disturbed.\nShe emphatically denied the veracity in real life of key scenes in the series, including one where the Martha character is depicted as sexually assaulting Gadd along a canal and attacking his partner.\nShe also denied harassing Gadd's family, or turning up at his house. \"I'm not a stalker,\" she said.\nAt the end of the series, Martha is seen pleading guilty of stalking Gadd and is sentenced to nine months in jail.\nBut Harvey insisted she has never been charged with an offence, let alone going to prison.\n\"That is completely untrue, very, very defamatory to me, very career damaging,\" she said.\nWhen viewers began to speculate over the real people behind the series, Gadd, 34, posted a message to his Instagram story, urging people not to speculate.\n\"That's not the point of our show,\" he wrote.\nOn Wednesday Netflix policy chief Benjamin King told UK lawmakers at a parliament hearing focused on British film and television, that they took \"every reasonable precaution\" to disguise the identities of the people who inspired Gadd's work. \n\"We didn't want to anonymise that or make it generic to the point where it was no longer his story because that would undermine the intent behind the show,\" he said. \n\"Ultimately, it's obviously very difficult to control what viewers do, particularly in a world where everything is amplified by social media. I personally wouldn't be comfortable with a world in which we decided it was better that Richard was silenced and not allowed to tell the story.\"",
    "Late blight is an old foe of humans. This disease catalysed the devastating Irish potato famine that began in 1845.\nIt is caused by a fungus-like pathogen, which quickly kills a potato plant and turns the crop into inedible mush.\nMore recently, late blight has been creeping into higher parts of the Peruvian Andes, as warmer, wetter weather helps the pathogen spread.\nSo scientists at the International Potato Center (CIP), a research institute in Peru, were very motivated to develop potato varieties that could resist late blight.\nThey searched for this trait among so-called crop wild relatives \u2013 undomesticated plants that are distantly related to the ones now grown for food.\nAfter finding the disease resistance in potato wild relatives, they crossed the wild plants with cultivated ones. Local farmers then tested the newly developed varieties, voting for the ones they preferred to grow, sell and eat.\nThe result is CIP-Matilde, a potato variety released in 2021 that doesn\u2019t require fungicides to stand up to late blight.\n\u201cUsually it\u2019s easier to improve the resistance to a certain disease,\u201d explains Benjamin Kilian, a senior scientist at the Crop Trust, based in Bonn, Germany. The non-profit organisation partnered with CIP to develop the Matilde potato, and is working on many other crop varieties.\nWhile disease resistance might come down to a single gene, making resistance to stressors like drought or salinity, can involve working with hundreds of genes.\nTo tackle drought tolerance, for instance, scientists could explore traits like early flowering to escape the effects of drought, less loss of water from plant leaves, or long roots so that plants can extend further to reach water.\nMr Kilian leads the Crop Trust\u2019s Biodiversity for Opportunities, Livelihoods and Development (Bold) project, which brings together partners including community seed banks, national breeding programmes, and international research centres.\nCrucially, it also convenes farmers. They express their preferences for particular traits and test the different crop varieties under development (including voting by placing stones, sticks or seeds next to their favourite varieties).\nThese participatory processes involve listening to different kinds of farmers, Mr Kilian says.\nFor instance, \u201csometimes women and men, even within the same family, prefer different traits.\u201d Women might be more concerned about taste and nutrition, while men are often more focused on yield.\nYield \u2013 the amount of a crop actually harvested per unit of land \u2013 is never too far from conversations around agricultural production. However, attempting to maximise yield at all costs has led to a more monotonous food system, with high-yield varieties displacing a range of others.\n\u201cUnder optimal conditions with high input you can achieve great yields. But you can also risk complete crop failure,\u201d Mr Kilian says.\n\u201cFor most farmers, it\u2019s more important to have a stable, reliable yield under all kinds of different environments.\u201d\nOne crop that the Bold project is supporting is the grass pea. Mr Kilian explains that this nutritious legume can handle waterlogging and tough environments. \u201cIt was often the last crop that survived if there was a drought event.\u201d\nIt fell out of favour because of a toxic compound that could be dangerous if eaten in large quantities (such as during a famine). But the Crop Trust and partners are working to reduce the toxicity by cross-breeding grass peas with crop wild relatives.\nAnother neglected crop that scientists are heralding for its resilience is azolla, a fern that grows astonishingly quickly and doesn\u2019t require much water. The wild tepary bean, meanwhile, can withstand harsh desert conditions.\nTraditional crop breeding can be time-consuming and laborious. Brad Ringeisen, the executive director of the Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI) at the University of California (Berkeley and San Francisco), believes that gene editing using tools like Crispr-Cas9 is the most impactful way of ensuring that crops can withstand disasters.\n\u201cIt speeds up the innovation cycles. It is a precise tool.\u201d\nMr Ringeisen summarises the IGI\u2019s work on disease resistance in crops: \u201cThere are a tremendous number of emerging diseases, and climate change is not helping this.\u201d\nHe says gene editing is a more elegant way of tackling disease than spraying more pesticides.\nAs well as disease resistance, the IGI is working on drought tolerance. A rice variety that has been gene edited to reduce the number of pores on leaves, reducing water loss, is now in field trials in Colombia. Such tests are necessary to make sure that gene edits don\u2019t lead to unforeseen side effects in practice.\nThe IGI\u2019s project is one of a number of scientific efforts to make rice less vulnerable to unpredictable water cycles. Scientists at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines, for example, have developed a \"scuba rice\" strain that can withstand weeks of submergence in water during floods.\nSometim",

    "Coventry University's vice-chancellor has said the city's economy could lose out on  tens of millions of pounds, due to a government clampdown on international student visas.\nIn January, the government introduced restrictions to prevent most international students bringing dependents with them.\nProf John Latham said the rules, coupled with political rhetoric, were discouraging students from coming to the UK.\nThe Home Office has been approached for a comment.\nIn introducing the new rules at the beginning the year, the department said it also wanted to stop student visas from being a \"backdoor route to work in the UK\".\nIt has asked a committee to review the visa changes, and a report is expected to be released on Tuesday.\n\nCoventry University said international students were worth more than \u00a3150m to the city and blamed politicians for a 40% year-on-year drop in international student recruitment at English universities in January's intake.\nProf Latham said it had had an \"enormous impact\" on the university\u2019s finances and wider economy.\n\"The government is causing significant economic harm to communities like Coventry for the sake of chasing a few misguided headlines,\" he said.\n\"There is a perception that international students are a burden on the economy but the opposite is true as they spend money here and do not use many public services.\"\nHe said the university was a major employer in the area and supported many more jobs either directly or indirectly, adding that international students spent a \"lot of money in the city\".\nAccording to the Migration Observatory, in 2021-22 the university had one of the highest number of international students on roll - 9,845 - with just University College London and the University of Edinburgh attracting more.\nProf Latham said that the higher fees paid by international students helped support the education of UK students.\nHe added the university had cash reserves, which enabled it to adjust, but that it was having to accelerate its move to teaching abroad.\nIt already has branches and campuses in Egypt, Morocco and China, and is negotiating over future campuses in Kazakhstan and India.\nWhen the changes were announced last year, then Home Secretary Suella Braverman said they struck \"the right balance\" between bringing down migration and \"protecting the economic benefits that students can bring to the UK\".  \nThere were 135,788 visas granted to dependants in 2022, a rise from 54,486 in 2021, and more than seven times the 19,139 granted in 2020.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Britain's first adder tunnels have been built to help the venomous reptiles cross the road, in a bid to boost their numbers after a decline in recent years.\nThe two trenches have a cattle grid-like grate on the top and are designed to allow sunlight in, as adders can't generate their own body heat.\nA wildlife trust in Berkshire noticed the road - which runs through Greenham and Crookham Commons - was stopping two different populations of the species from mating.\nBerkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust is hoping other small mammals and reptiles will make use of the new crossing too.\nDebbie Lewis, its head of ecology, says genetic mixing between the two different groups of adders is important.\n\"They are a part of our native biodiversity and could be extinct here in 10 to 15 years if we don\u2019t do anything,\" she said.\nThe trust realised the road was a barrier for snakes after monitoring them with radio trackers. It became clear the adders were going close to the road but not crossing it.\nAdders (Vipera berus) are shy creatures covered in a distinct zig-zag pattern. The protected species lives in woodland, on heathland and moorland and has a good sense of smell. Cold blooded, they need the sun's heat to warm up and start hibernating in October - re-emerging in March.\nA 2019 study found that adders could disappear from the British countryside altogether by 2032. They can currently be found in England, Scotland, Wales but not in Northern Ireland.\nElsewhere, they can be found across Europe and Asia and even within the Arctic Circle.\nSo, how likely are you to see one if you live in Britain?\n\"They don\u2019t like people so they\u2019re more likely to disappear,\" said Mrs Lewis. \"The chances of you seeing them are very slim. They can feel you approaching through the vibrations in the ground and are likely to stay away.\"\nAlthough she said the public should still be cautious in the rare instance that they do see one, \"they are venomous. Admire from a distance but don\u2019t disturb them.\"\nThe Wildlife Trust says an adder bite is painful but \"really only dangerous to the very young, ill or old.\" It says medical attention should always be sought immediately.\nThe last recorded death from an adder bite in the UK was in 1975.\nThe money to create the tunnels came from Natural England's Species Recovery Programme, which was set up 30 years ago to help native species under threat.\nFor now, the trust in Berkshire has to wait and see whether its plan is successful.\n\"The two populations weren\u2019t mixing before so hopefully they will now,\" Mrs Lewis said. \"It\u2019s a bit of a trial as there are snake tunnels in other countries but not in the UK, this is the first one.\"",
    "Spain's Balearic Islands are expanding curbs on street drinking and further restricting party boats in a bid to crack down on alcohol-fuelled holidays in tourist areas.\nThe government says the toughening of a law passed in 2020 will apply to popular hotspots including Playa de Palma and Magaluf in Majorca and Sant Antoni in Ibiza.\nPeople caught drinking outside of authorised areas will be fined between \u20ac500-1,500 (\u00a3430-1290).\nUnder the new law, coming into force on Saturday, the number of sanctions taken against foreigners will be counted and submitted to the respective embassies.\nThe legislation introduces tougher rules against party boats, which will be banned from getting closer than one nautical mile (1.852 km) of the designated areas. Picking up or disembarking passengers will continue to be banned. \nParty boats had previously been banned from advertising in the three areas. \nLuis Pomar, a press officer at the Balearic Islands tourism council, told the BBC that the 2020 law had been working to curb anti-social behaviour. He added that he hoped the law would no longer be needed \u201cin three to four years, if we instil in people how to behave\u201d.\nUp to \u20ac16 million (\u00a313.7m) will be spent on improving areas which see the most tourism. \nThe areas the law applies to have been modified at the request of the local authorities, the Balearic Islands said.\nMr Pomar said a commission on \"the Promotion of Civility in Tourist Zones\" would be expanded to include representatives of the countries whose tourists are most associated with problems - the UK and Germany.\nThe government reiterated that the 2020 law bans shops from selling alcohol between 21:30 and 08:00 local time (20:30-07:00 GMT).\nAt the time of the introduction of the 2020 law, the regional government said it was the first in Europe to restrict the promotion and sale of alcohol in certain tourist zones.\nIt said the new measures would \"fight excesses\" and \"force a real change in the tourism model of those destinations\".\nBut some locals complained that the law would hurt businesses.

    "The Eurovision Song Contest reaches its grand final on Saturday night, with Croatia, Israel and Switzerland among the favourites to win.\nThe competition is back in its spiritual home in Sweden, 50 years after Abba's historic win in 1974.\nTheir winning entry, Waterloo, was the sort of oddity only Eurovision could produce: A glam rock anthem about the Napoleonic Wars, performed by two married couples in spangled trouser suits. \nIt just also happened to be one of the best songs ever written.\nAbba's golden anniversary will be celebrated on stage in Malm\u00f6 on Saturday, with former Eurovision winners Charlotte Perrelli, Carola and Conchita Wurst performing a special version of Waterloo.\nBut the competition has changed beyond recognition in the last five decades. \nIn 1974, only 17 countries took part in the competition, all accompanied by a live orchestra.\nThis year has seen 37 entrants, whose musical styles encompass heavy metal, hardcore techno, shimmering Europop and, in Norway's case, a gothic folk tale about a child who turns into a wolf and kills their stepmother. Fun times!\nSo here are some of the highlights to keep on your radar when the Grand Final kicks off on Saturday evening.\nEurovision loves nothing more than an outsider and an underdog - and Bambie Thug fits the bill perfectly this year.\nWhen they won Ireland's national selection in January, eyes were rolled and insults were thrown. A priest even declared \"Ireland is finished\", accusing the non-binary artist of \"shoving their orientation\u201d in people's faces.\nBut guess what? Bambie's song, Doomsday Blue, is an absolute blast. A witchy, spooky blend of electro-goth and grinding metal guitars, that unexpectedly segues into a sweet melody of regret and heartbreak. \nBambie sells it with a genuinely cinematic performance, summoning a demon then dancing ballet with it, before wrapping things up with a cathartic scream.\nImagine Kate Bush's evil twin singing an anti-lullaby and you'll get the idea.\nIf Irish goths aren't your style, maybe you'd prefer a drum and bass EDM opera from Switzerland?\nThat's what we get from Nemo, who has become one of the favourites to win the contest with their song, The Code.\nThe 24-year-old performs it while balancing on a giant, spinning turntable - while hitting the highest of high notes (the chorus is inspired by Mozart's The Magic Flute, typically sung by a soprano).\nAmazingly, there's no trickery involved. \n\"Someone asked me if I have magnets in my shoes,\" they said. \"And I was like, damn, that would have been an amazing idea - because then I wouldn't have to worry about balancing all the time.\n\"It's always a little bit scary, but that's what makes it special for me.\"\nIt all happened at the last minute.\nIn January, Croatian singer Zsa Zsa pulled out of the country's Eurovision selection process, and the gap needed filling. Producers called musician Marko Puri\u0161i\u0107, who performs as Baby Lasagna, and asked if he could step in.\nHe gave a tentative yes, then worked all weekend with his fianc\u00e9 Eliabeta to pull together a performance.\nAmazingly, his song - a techno-metal crossover called Rim Tim Tagi Dim - won by a landslide. Baby Lasagna scored 321 points, with the runner-up getting 82.\nNow he's the bookies' favourite to win Eurovision, too, thanks to his raucous stage presence and a killer hook. (Keep an eye out also for an on-stage tribute to his one-eyed cat, Stipe). \nAfter qualifying for the finals on Tuesday, Marko said it all seemed surreal. \n\"I remember writing Rim Tim Tagi Dim in my small room,\" he wrote on social media. \"Never could I imagine this would happen. It still feels like I'm living somebody else's life.\"\nAs he says in the song, \"there's no going back\".\n\nOne welcome development at this year's contest is an influx of traditional music, alongside the usual Europop bangers and windswept ballads.\nThat means you'll see a few unfamiliar instruments onstage.\nEstonia's 5Miinust x Puuluup (pictured) play a traditional bowed lyre called the Talharpas, while Norway's G\u00e5te brandish the Nyckelharpa - another bowed instrument, originally built and played by farmers in the 17th Century.\nOther countries, including Greece and Italy, fuse their country's folklore with modern sub-bass and Latin rhythms. \nArmenia's Ladaniva even include a recorder solo in their infectiously catchy dance number Jako.\nRepresenting the UK this year is Olly Alexander - who has some of the most ambitious staging of the night.\nThe official description of his set suggests he will \"transport viewers into a post- apocalyptic dystopian boxing gym locker room, aboard a spaceship hurtling toward Earth through a black hole in 1985.\"\nIn practice, this means he's writhing around with four scantily-clad men, while clever camera trickery makes it look like he's Lionel Richie, dancing on his ceiling.\nAlexander, who was formerly lead singer of the pop group Years & Years, comes with something very few British contenders have had in recent years: Stage experience. \nThat c",

    "The ringleader of an armed robbery in which a police officer was killed almost 20 years ago should be given a whole life order, a court has heard. \nPiran Ditta Khan, 75, was found guilty of murder last month for his part in the killing of PC Sharon Beshenivsky in Bradford in 2005.\nHe spent nearly two decades evading justice after fleeing to Pakistan shortly after the officer's murder.\nKhan is due to be sentenced at Leeds Crown Court later.\nAt the end of his trial, Khan was also found guilty of two counts of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life and two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon.\nHe is the last of seven men involved in the robbery and murder at the Universal Express travel agents on 18 November 2005 to be sentenced.\nAhead of Khan's sentencing, Robert Smith, prosecuting, told Leeds Crown Court on Friday that the combination of his convictions was \"exceptionally high\" and he should be given a whole-life order.\nMr Smith said the fact Khan was involved in planning and preparing the robbery \"distinguishes him from his co-defendants to a significant degree\".\nHowever, Peter Wright, defending, said a whole-life order was \"the last resort for cases of most extreme gravity\", and that he believed the minimum term would be the most likely. \nMr Wright added that Khan \"appreciates his final years are in all probability to be spent in custody, with the forbidding prospect he will die there\".\n\"No doubt there will be little or no public sympathy for such a state of affairs, nor do I seek it, but it is a factor I invite my lord to take into account when arriving at the appropriate order for this case,\" he told the judge.\nPC Beshenivsky was shot at close range as she arrived at the scene of the robbery at the travel agents.\nShe was left lying on the pavement, her injuries instantly fatal.\nThe officer's colleague, Teresa Milburn, then 37, was also shot and seriously injured at the same time, though she survived the attack.\nIn the huge manhunt that followed, the gang, whose members had escaped with little more than \u00a35,000, was eventually caught.\nSix people were subsequently convicted of charges including murder and manslaughter - with Khan the seventh.\nDuring the eight-week trial, jurors were told Khan was the mastermind behind the robbery and played a \"pivotal role in planning the raid and giving instructions to the others\".\nKhan told the court he was waiting in a car and \"eating sandwiches\" with Hassan Razzaq while the raid was being carried out.\nRazzaq and his brother Faisal Razzaq were later found guilty of manslaughter, robbery and firearms offences. Raza Ul-Haq Aslam was convicted of robbery.\nMuzzaker Shah and brothers Yusuf Jama and Mustaf Jama - the three armed men who went into Universal Express - were convicted of murder, robbery and firearms offences.\nPC Beshenivsky was killed on her youngest daughter Lydia's fourth birthday.  \nIn an impact statement read to court, Lydia said: \"I have little to no memory of her growing up, and I've had to rely on mum's friends and family telling me about her and the things she liked to do.\n\"I often think she was a hero that day and paid the ultimate sacrifice.\"\nHer statement added: \"Since that day and throughout my life, there has always been a void - a void that should have been filled by my mum's presence. \n\"But as a result of your actions - Khan and your associates that day - you robbed me of a future and precious time with my mum.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "A teaching union says its members are being \"morally blackmailed\" into working up to 25 hours free overtime a week.\nThe Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association (SSTA) also said the impact of council cuts to social services were being felt in schools.\nIt is holding a conference on the same day as the NASUWT teaching union is highlighting violence and abuse from pupils\nThe Scottish government said it was working to ease teachers' workloads and finalising a plan to address abuse in classrooms.\nMinisters are also finalising a national action plan to address verbal and physical abuse in the classroom.\nSSTA president Stuart Hunter told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme teaching was seen as a vocation rather than a profession.\nHe said: \"We have a 35-hour working week contract but the reality is that, in order to deliver all of the demands that we need for our students, our teachers are working about 20 to 25 hours free overtime every single week.\n\"Part of the reason we say there is moral blackmail taking place is that often pressure is put on from a variety of different sources.\"\nMr Hunter said the narrative was that teachers needed to step up and support children.\nHe also told the programme there was a \"serious lack of resources\" to support teachers and expressed concern at the ripple effect from council cuts, including psychological services.\nMr Hunter added: \"Teachers are being asked to step in and fill the void.\n\"Teachers are not trained to do this but again, teenagers are being asked to do it for the sake of the kids.\"\nHe also urged Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth to listen to the union's concerns.\nMr Hunter said: \"The bottom line is that teachers are exhausted because of the amount of work they are having to do.\n\"The violence on top of that and the misbehaviour that teachers are having to deal with adds to the stress levels teachers are experiencing.\"\nMike Corbett, NASUWT national officer, said Ms Gilruth heard the concerns of the union's members at its conference last year.\nBut he said an action plan pledged by the government six months ago had yet to be published.\nMr Corbett said teachers across Scotland were continuing to be sworn at, hit with projectiles and assaulted on a daily basis.\nHe called on ministers to set boundaries and introduce \"escalating consequences for serious misbehaviour\".\nThe Scottish government said it recognised the hard work of teachers and had ensured they were the \"best paid in the UK\".\nIt added more than \u00a32m has been spent on staff wellbeing since October 2020.\nA spokesperson said: \"The Scottish government is working with the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers on progressing the commitment to reducing class contact time and ministers are determined that planning for this is based on robust evidence.\n\"It is vital that school staff are able to access any wellbeing support they might need.\"\nA behaviour action plan is due to published in the \"coming weeks\".\nA spokesperson added: \"Changes in behaviour in Scotland's schools since the pandemic are well understood.\n\"This is why the cabinet secretary committed to holding a series of summits focused on behaviour, convened the headteacher's taskforce and published the behaviour in Scotland's Schools research last November - culminating in the commitment to this action plan.\" ",
    "The UK is out of recession after the economy returned to growth in the first three months of the year, official figures show.\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt said the economy was \"returning to full health\", but Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said this was no time for a \"victory lap\".\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes figures for the UK's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This is the value of all the goods and services the UK produces.\nWhen GDP rises, a country's economy grows and average incomes rise as a result.\nBut sometimes the economy shrinks, GDP falls, and that's a sign that the economy is doing badly, which could hit people's pockets.\nThe UK is in recession if GDP falls for two successive three-month periods - known as quarters.\nThe economy shrank 0.1% between July and September last year and then by a further 0.3% between October and December.\nThis meant the economy went into recession at the end of 2023.\nBut the latest figures from the ONS show the UK economy grew by 0.6% between January and March 2024, marking the end of the recession.\nThe previous UK recession was in 2020, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.\nIt only lasted for six months, although the 20.4% fall in GDP recorded between April and June 2020 was the largest on record.\nIn 2008 a recession started as a result of the global financial crisis, and went on for five quarters, or 15 months. \nEconomic growth can mean more jobs are available and companies can pay more to employees and shareholders. \nHigher wages and larger profits also generate money for the government through taxes. \nIt can choose to spend more on things like benefits and public services, or cut tax rates.\nWhen the economy shrinks and a country goes into recession, these things can go into reverse. \nSome people might lose their jobs, and unemployment could rise. \nOthers may find it harder to be promoted, or to get big enough pay rises to keep pace with price increases. \nHowever, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. \nBenefit recipients and those on fixed incomes are particularly likely to struggle, especially if the government decides to spend less on public services. \nIn a recession, the Bank of England - which is independent of government - typically cuts interest rates. \nThis makes it cheaper for businesses and households to borrow money which can boost spending and economic growth.  \nHowever, prices have been rising very quickly in the UK, and the Bank put interest rates up to tackle that inflation.  \nAfter 14 rate increases,the Bank has held interest rates at 5.25% six times in a row.\nWhen the economy is struggling to grow at the same time as there is high inflation, there can be a situation called \"stagflation\".\nThis can be very difficult to solve, because the two issues require different solutions. \nHowever in May 2024, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told the BBC that the UK economy had \"turned a corner\".\nWith growth of 0.6% from January to March this year, the UK was the joint fastest growing economy in the G7 group of industrialised nations.\nBut until then, the UK had been one of the weaker members of the G7.\nThe US economy grew by 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was much better than expected. \nThat put the US at 2.5% over 2023 as a whole, the best performance of all other advanced economies. It is also expected to outperform the rest of the G7 in 2024. \nIn October 2023, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that the UK would grow by just 0.6% in 2024.  \nThe independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) expects the UK economy to grow by 0.7% in 2024, but that is less than half of its earlier prediction of 1.8% growth.",
    "The moment Alok Shukla first saw the forest in central India stretching out before him, he knew two things instantly.\nOne: that this forest - known as the lungs of Chhattisgarh, home to thousands of tribespeople, endangered animals and rare plants - was one of the most beautiful places he had ever seen.\nAnd two: that he would dedicate his life to stopping the multi-billion dollar companies hoping to uproot it in search of the coal beneath its soil.\nThe only question was, how?\nTwelve years later, Alok can smile at the memory. After all, what he has achieved in the intervening years has been impressive.\nOn Monday, the 43-year-old was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize, otherwise known as the green Nobel.\nBut it started with small steps.\nBack in 2012, the Hasdeo Aranya forest in Chhattisgarh state and its 657 bio-diversity rich square miles (1,071km sq) were under threat, thanks to its massive coal deposits - totalling an estimated 5.6 billion tonnes.\nIn India, the world's second largest consumer of coal after China, those deposits are a highly valuable commodity.\nBut the value to the tribespeople - known collectively as the Adivasi - and the animals like elephants, sloth bears, leopards and wolves, not to mention the tigers which use it as a corridor between habitats, or the birds which live in the trees, was incalculable to Alok.\nHe wasn't the only one to recognise the value of the land: local authorities had declared it protected a few years earlier - although this was never formal.\nDespite this, so-called coal blocks in the forest were put up for auction. The powerful multinational Adani group would apply to build five mines in the area between 2010 and 2015. More companies, and more mines, would follow.\n\"I still vividly remember the day I went there,\" Alok says. \"It's such a beautiful forest - and unfortunately that forest is going to be destroyed by coal mining.\n\"But much worse than that, the local tribal communities there who have been conserving the forest for centuries - they're not even aware of what the impacts of mining would be... or what the legal provisions and protections [are that would help them save it].\"\nThe loss of their traditional home, Alok feared, would be devastating.\n\"The Adivasis have been living there for several centuries. They know nothing else, but these forests. It's part of their identity.\"\nAnd they were already trying to fight back - the problem was, each village was fighting alone.\nAlok realised they were doomed to lose the battle unless everyone came together. Two mines had already begun production because the resistance had failed.\n\"It's not just a fight for one village in fact, it's a fight for the entire region,\" he says.\nOut of this, the Save Hasdeo Aranya Resistance Committee - an informal alliance of grassroots movements - grew, teaching people about the local laws and rights available. It also linked the different groups together effectively for the first time.\nBut it wasn't easy. In 2020, more coal mines were proposed. \nWith Covid racing across India, Alok once again began organising.\nCommunity pressure led to three of the mines being shelved that September. The next month, the community fought to have almost a million acres designated as an elephant reserve.\nThen central government stepped in to push forward plans to auction off 21 coal blocks under emergency provisions.\nIt would take another 18 months - along with an online campaign united under the hashtag #SaveHasdeo, a march on the state capital, and even a tree hugging sit-in - for the 21 coal blocks to finally be cancelled.\nNone of it has been easy. The 12-year battle, he admits, has taken a steely resolve on his part, and on the part of the forest communities.\n\"This is a fight in some sense between the people's lives and livelihoods and forests on the one hand, and the corporate profits on the other hand,\" he explains. \n\"Naturally any company whose profits and viability is at stake will try to do all kinds of steps to make sure that they get the land.\"\nAnd even now, there are still fights to be won - land which needs to be rejuvenated after being destroyed and trees which are still in danger.\nAlok hopes winning the Goldman prize, which recognises a handful of grassroots campaigners from around the world each year, will inspire other movements globally - and once again focus attention on the forest.  \n\"Any tree being cut in Hasdeo Aranya is wrong, and our effort will be to save every tree,\" he vows.",
    "If you woke up on Saturday morning well rested but filled with regret over missing the Northern Lights - don't worry. They're set to return tonight.\nOn Friday night, the lights dazzled the country, and the internet was awash with photos of bright pinks, purples and greens splashed across the night sky.\nHere is everything you need to know about how to catch them on Saturday night.\nJust as on Friday night, the Northern Lights are set to light up the skies all across the UK.\nThat means you have a chance to see it no matter where you are, as long as the skies are clear (which is looking likely).\nOn Friday, we saw pictures from Inverness to Kent, and Omagh to Anglesey to Norwich, so it truly is a nationwide spectacle.\nOrdinarily, somewhere away from light pollution with a clear view of the night sky has the best opportunity to see the lights, but based on Friday night, that didn't matter.\nFor Saturday night, the Met Office says there's a good chance of sightings across Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of northern England and Wales in particular. \nAurora activity is expected again across the UK and while the geomagnetic storm is still expected to be in the 'strong' category, early indications are that it may not reach the 'extreme' of last night with activity declining.\nWeather conditions are ideal with clear skies but it needs to be dark, so you'll need to wait until at least 22:30 BST.\nAt this time of year, when nights are shorter, 23:30 into the early hours of the morning is when the night is darkest.\nThe activity of the lights itself is more unpredictable, the Met Office says, so expect it to ebb and flow with different colours in different places at different times.\nCoincidentally, if you are tuning into Eurovision tonight, the winner is due to be crowned just before the best time to see the lights (even better if the contest runs over time, as it often does, and you peek outside later in the night).\nOn Friday night, our BBC Weather Watchers captured the magic with more than 3,000 photographs sent into us between 21:00 and 1:00 on Saturday morning. \nGiven the lights are not expected to be as bright as they were on Friday, you may need to employ some camera tricks to get the most out of your photo if you are heading out on Saturday night.\nAmateur photographer Anne Wilkie was among those who captured the lights on her iPhone on Friday night.\nHer tips for getting the best photo include:\n\"I found that the camera is very sensitive and picks up the colours so much more than the naked eye, so, if you think you see light in the sky, point the camera in the direction and the pinks, greens and purples should show on the screen, if you're lucky,\" Ms Wilkie said.\nAll phone users will want to play with the exposure to capture the best of the lights \u2013 most phones will bring up this option by tapping the screen when in the camera app.\nSome more recent phone models may have even more advanced camera settings, which allow for shutter speed and the length of exposure to be adjusted. \nSetting a long exposure time can capture the dance of the lights, but you will have to keep the phone still to avoid blurring.\nThe Northern Lights are caused by atoms with electric charges, called charged particles. \nThe lights appear when these charged particles are shot out from the sun and hit gases in the Earth's atmosphere.\nIn this instance, the Sun is experiencing an extreme geomagnetic storm, which is sending out solar winds with those particles into the solar system.\nWe see different colours in the sky when the various gases in the Earth's atmosphere are energised by the charged particles.\nThe two most common gases in the Earth's atmosphere are oxygen and nitrogen. Oxygen atoms glow green - the colour most often seen in the Northern Lights, while nitrogen atoms emit purple, blue and pink.\nThe last time we had an extreme geomagnetic storm hit Earth was in 2003, so Friday's event was rare. We are much more used to seeing the Northern Lights limited to northern parts of the UK.\nThere have been more occasions in the last year or so where we have seen a weak showing of the aurora in southern parts of the UK.\nThis is because in the Sun's 11 year solar cycle, we are approaching the 'solar maximum', where there are naturally more sunspots on the Sun's surface. \nSunspots are like huge volcanos erupting charged particles in Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs).  With more of them at the moment, there is a greater chance of more frequent and strong auroral activity.\nIt is also worth pointing out that because we can forecast these events better and with most of us having a smart phone able to capture the bright lights of the aurora, there has been an increase in sightings over the last decade or two.",

    "Filmmakers could improve cinema experiences for deaf people by putting more thought into captioning, according to the University of Sheffield. \nResearch found that poor quality, missing or lagging captions led to deaf audiences feeling excluded through not fully experiencing film-making techniques like suspense. \nA team from the University of Sheffield and a research and design company based in the city worked with members of the deaf community on the project.\nTheir work has produced six recommendations for the media industry, highlighting opportunities to improve the accessibility of entertainment.\n\nMembers of the deaf community, who have been deaf all their lives and use British Sign Language (BSL) as their first language, took part in the research project.\nThey were asked about their experiences of watching some well-known films with captions such as\u00a0Jaws,\u00a0The Hunchback of Notre Dame and\u00a0A Quiet Place.\nOne of the research team, Dr Ryan Bramley, from the University of Sheffield's School of Education, is an expert on the social impacts of film.\nHe said their research found that certain descriptions of sound lacked key information that was central to the plot:\n\"For example, in\u00a0Jaws, the participants were aware that there was 'famous' music in the clip, but they told us that the captions did not convey that the music represented the shark getting closer. \n\"This impacted how much suspense they felt during the film.\"\nSheffield-based research and design company, Paper, also worked on the study.\nBeth Evans from Paper said: \u201cProgrammes like\u00a0Stranger Things have gone viral for their captioning being so immersive and creative. \n\"The captioners worked during the production and got advice from Hollywood orchestrators to help choose the best descriptions of sound to encompass the genre and feel of the moment for deaf audiences.\"\nHamza Shaikh, a trustee of the British Deaf Association, took part in the project and said he hoped it would diminish barriers for deaf individuals like himself who struggle to enjoy cinema outings fully.\n\"I hope this collaborative effort will catalyse the cinema industry to re-evaluate its practices and prioritise accessibility for all patrons,\" he said.\nThe\u00a0project has resulted in a new film Rethinking Subtitles and six guidelines for the media industry, highlighting potential commercial opportunities to improve the accessibility of films and TV programmes for deaf audiences.\nThe recommendations have also been submitted as evidence to parliament's Culture, Media and Sport Committee inquiry into British film and high-end television. \n",
    "Britain's coasts - once some of the most dangerous in the world to navigate for shipping - are littered with shipwrecks. This deadly legacy has left thousands of haunting artefacts and in some cases - lucrative treasure - resting on the sea floor. From time to time these relics re-emerge, found by divers on wrecks, walkers on beaches or they are mistakenly hauled up by fishermen or dredgers. A BBC Freedom of Information request has revealed the hundreds of fascinating items recovered in the last year alone. \nA 200-year-old elephant tusk, coins from the Spanish Armada, plane parts, iron swords and a jar of Marmite were among the items found and reported to the Receiver of Wreck last year. \nHuman bones, mammoth bones and a French-made 2.5 tonne 17th Century bronze cannon were also on the list.\nMore than 300 items were declared in the 2023 report and with no details of the locations or finders shared with the BBC due to data laws, the task of tracking down the items was tricky and in some cases, impossible. \nSome of the custodians of the items did not wish to share details of their finds but others like Ian Goodban, who stumbled across an elephant tusk on a beach were happy to share their stories.\nIn the receiver's 2023 report the elephant tusk is listed as 3.5ft (1.1m) long and \"blackened by mud\". \nMr Goodban was beachcombing in Sandwich Bay, Kent when he \"just saw something poking out the mud\".\n\"I put my hand down... and I thought, 'I think I know what this is' and then the sand cracked in a big semi-circle and that's when I realised I had an elephant tusk,\" he said.\nMr Goodban said finding something that's lain undiscovered for many years was \"always a real thrill\".\n\"I was walking back to my car, had the tusk over my shoulder because of the curvature of the tusk, it sort of lends itself to being carried over the shoulder, and I... just thought to myself, 200 years ago there would have probably been an African porter walking out the interior with one of these on each shoulder, taking it down to the coast for export to England.\"\nSurprisingly Mr Goodban's is not the only elephant tusk to have been found. \nAnother was found off Falmouth in 2019, 110m (361ft) underwater on a Royal African Company trader wreck.\nThe ship was believed to have been involved in the West Africa slave trade in the 1680s but sunk off Cornwall.\nThe 350-year-old tusk is now in Plymouth in the care of Peter Holt, a director of the Ships Project, a non profit that researches and explores maritime historical sites.\nHe said: \"It needs to go into a museum but because it is ivory and because it's been associated with the slave trade, finding a home for it has been difficult.\"\nPartly eaten by wildlife, the tusk has spent much of its time above surface desalinating in fresh water.\n\"You have to get the salt out of them, if the object is allowed to dry, salt crystals will form on the inside and quite often the object will fall apart,\" Mr Holt added.\nOther finds included ship's bells, crockery and ejector seat parts.\nRecoveries at sea, within territorial waters, or up to the high tide water mark, have to be reported to the Receiver of Wreck within 28 days. \nFinders who do not follow the rules can face a \u00a32,500 fine or even court action.\nStephen White, the Receiver of Wreck, said he had one year to decide what happened to items.\n\"What we do is we negotiate between the owner and the finder for potentially a salvage fee,\" he said.\n\"About 85% of finders get to keep the items, but sometimes the items have extreme historical value and we try to find homes for them in museums.\"\nMr White said there was a backlog in dealing with reported items from the last few years due to understaffing and Covid.\nOne of those waiting to hear an outcome is Brixham fisherman, Richard Fowler, whose boat, the Rebecca caught a two-tonne anchor in October 2021 while fishing off Lyme Bay. \n\"I\u2019d like to know, I\u2019d like to recover some of the money for the broken nets and storage but once I can pass it on I think it would look good in a pub,\" Mr Fowler said.\nOver the years fishing he said he had hauled up a whole cow, a sheep and a pre-prepared fish.\n\"We had a kipper in a bag once, complete with a knob of butter. The cow was dead, it was very wet, it had probably been washed down a river with heavy rain or dumped off the side of a ship carrying it. \n\"The sea is a mysterious place.\"\nIn the marine aggregate industry, where sand and gravel is brought up from the seabed, workers have been given training to identify culturally important items that end up in the dredged material.\nLast year workers found mammoth bones, an American submarine badge and a bomb shackle.\nAndrea Hamel, from Wessex Archaeology, who works as an adviser to the dredging industry, said: \"We have had some really amazing finds dating back to the Middle Palaeolithic period.\n\"So everything from hand axes to mammoth teeth, it's just really incredible to be the first person to touch something in say 300,000 years.\n\"There's",
    "On a balmy February evening in Sydney, a figure disguised in a black hoodie stole up to a row of iconic trees, drill in hand.\nUnder the cover of darkness, the man allegedly tried to kill nine of the beloved figs which have watched over Balmoral Beach for over a century.\n\"I get quite emotional actually,\" local mayor Carolyn Corrigan says, recounting the attack.\n\"I close my eyes and I just can't imagine Balmoral without those figs.\"\nIn recent months, a string of similar incidents in some of Sydney's leafiest and wealthiest suburbs has baffled a nation rather attached to its bushland.\nHundreds of trees have been ruthlessly cut down, drilled and laced with poison, or stripped bare - conveniently exposing the kind of harbour views that drastically increase property values. \n\"It's selfishness and greed, there's no other way to describe it,\" says John Moratelli, who runs an environmental protection group.\n\"It's just the worst of human nature really.\"\nIn Australia, laws enforced by local governments dictate how and when trees can be removed on private property.\nThose breaking the rules are usually clearing land for agriculture or development. Otherwise, it's a tree here or there in a suburban backyard or two.\nBut recently, Sydney councils have noticed an increasing trend of what they call \"tree vandalism\" - much of it on public land. More than 1000 reports of trees being damaged or killed were made last year, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.\nThe most shocking, a brutal mass clearing in Castle Cove.\nThe suburb is a slice of paradise just 10km (6.2 miles) from the heart of Sydney - sea eagles soar overhead, peckish swamp wallabies mow the grass on your front lawn, and everything from bandicoots to snakes are regular visitors.\nOne resident tells the BBC that he once even spotted a whale from his balcony.\nLast July, a pair of walkers heard a chainsaw at work inside a steep reserve sandwiched between multi-million-dollar mansions and the shore. They reported it to authorities, but it was weeks before the council discovered the carnage.\nSome 265 trees and plants, the equivalent of 14 tennis courts, had been razed - cut down or pierced with a drill and injected with poison, sometimes both. So much chemical was used that, initially, there were fears the run-off could wipe out the harbour's marine life.\nThe culprits left behind little evidence: just a pair of green gloves, a bottle of herbicide, and an old sign warning against tree vandalism which they'd apparently ripped out and tossed down the slope.\nA local was so stunned by the rumoured scale of the damage that he drove to the other side of the harbour to see it for himself.\n\"I thought: 'That can't possibly be right',\" said the man, who has asked to be called Bill - not his real name - because tensions in the community are so high.\n\"It was astounding\u2026 They'd really done a number on it.\"\nWilloughby Mayor Tanya Taylor was similarly \"gobsmacked\" when she heard about the destruction.\n\"It was actually, ironically enough, around National Tree Day that I found out,\" she says, gazing out over the bushland, which is still scorched brown nine months on.\nFaded pink ribbons marking vandalised plants shudder in the breeze as the sun beats down on the sparkling - now exposed - water below.\nThe natural environment here is \"invaluable\" and this loss unquantifiable, Ms Taylor says.\n\"That tree down in front of us here,\" she points to an iconic Sydney red gum, which is now skeletal, \"it's 100 years old, 20m (65ft) high.\"\n\"You cannot replace that. That's generations worth of growth.\"\nIn November, in nearby Longueville, authorities discovered a similar cull. This time, almost 300 trees and plants had been downed - again, next to harbourfront homes.\nA couple of peninsulas away, signs around the scenic Bay Run mark where mangroves have been ripped from the banks of Iron Cove. Behind the walkway sit what Canada Bay Mayor Michael Megna calls \"McMansions\".\nHe says even the new trees that his council plants often aren't safe from view-hungry vandals.\n\"It's been two steps forward and one step back.\"\nTo many, the killings are confusing because Australians famously love bushland.\nThe poetry of Banjo Patterson and Henry Lawson, quasi-national anthem Home Among the Gum Trees, the adventures of Skippy the Bush Kangaroo: an admiration and wary respect for the bush has long defined the country's culture and identity.\n\"It's in Australia's DNA,\" says Mr Megna.\nUrban bushland is a haven for wildlife, beautifies suburbs and has marked mental health benefits. And as climate change and pollution increasingly heat the nation's cities, it acts as both their lungs and their shade.\nAll the locations where these dramatic tree culls have occurred are coveted precisely for these reasons.\nSome people suggest the fire risk that thick bushland poses could be driving the behaviour.\nBut the councillors the BBC spoke to are unanimous: \"We should call a spade a spade\u2026 It's an increased sense of personal entitlement,\"",
    "Protest groups such as Just Stop Oil and Palestine Action could be banned in a similar way to terrorist organisations, under a proposal from the government\u2019s adviser on political violence.\nAn upcoming report from Lord Walney, which BBC News has seen extracts of, will recommend a new category for proscribing \"extreme protest groups\".\nIt defines these as those which routinely use criminal tactics to try to achieve their aims. \nThe sanctions could restrict a group's ability to fundraise and its right to assembly in the UK.\nThe Home Office said ministers would consider the recommendations.\n\"Militant groups like Palestine Action and Just Stop Oil are using criminal tactics to create mayhem and hold the public and workers to ransom without fear of consequence,\" Lord Walney said.\n\"Banning terror groups has made it harder for their activists to plan crimes - that approach should be extended to extreme protest groups too.\"\nJust Stop Oil said the government were the \u201cdangerous radicals that are endangering all of us\u201d through their climate policies.\nPalestine Action claimed its actions were in line with most of the British public who want an arms embargo between the UK and Israel, and the proposals would not deter their campaign.\nThe new restriction orders \"would be distinct from proscription on terrorism grounds\", the report will say.\nBut the mechanism could limit the activities of organisations that have a policy of using criminal offences or causing serious disruption to influence government or public debate.\nIf a group\u2019s actions were persistent, and used to promote a political or ideological cause, that would count against them, according to the recommendation.\nIt will come as part of a review into tackling political violence by Lord Walney - the former Labour MP John Woodcock - which was commissioned three years ago, but is yet to be published.\nA government source said ministers shared Lord Walney\u2019s objectives and would consider implementing his recommendations once the review was published.\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cExtremism of any kind has no place in our society and we will not tolerate tactics that set out to intimidate, threaten or cause disruption to the law-abiding majority. \n\"In recent months, we have also witnessed a small number of protesters display violent and hateful behaviour, and the police have our full support in tackling extremism and hate crime.\n\u201cWe are considering the report's recommendations extremely carefully and will respond in due course.\u201d",
    "A police officer was shot in the leg with a crossbow and a man was stabbed in what was described as a \"serious assault and weapons incident\".\nPolice attended School Close in Downley near High Wycombe on Friday after a man in his 60s suffered a stab wound.\nThe suspected attacker was shot by armed police and has potentially life-changing injuries.\nBoth the officer and the stab victim have now been released from hospital, police said.\nThe suspect, a 54-year-old man from High Wycombe, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and remains under police guard in hospital.\nAssistant Chief Constable Tim Metcalfe, from Thames Valley Police, said the police officer who was shot was in \"good spirits given the circumstances\".\n\"It is very fortunate no-one suffered life-threatening injuries.\"\nHe praised the \"incredible bravery\" of the officers who responded to the incident, and added: \"We are giving all the support we can to the officer who was injured during the incident.\"\nACC Metcalfe added: \"We are not looking for anyone else in relation to the incident at this time.\"\nBuckinghamshire commander Ch Supt Emma Burroughs said the incident had been \"hugely challenging and unsettling\" for the local community.\n\"We do not underestimate the impact it has had on the community so we are doing all we can to support people, such as the patrols in the area over the coming day and engagement with stakeholders such as councillors, the MP and our independent advisory group,\" she said.\nNeil, who lives in the area and did not wish to give his last name, told the BBC he had seen an armed police officer crouching in a nearby bush. \n\"I was playing in the park with my son and my partner and I knew something was about to go down. I grabbed my son and told my partner to get home, and within minutes it was kicking off and pandemonium everywhere, then gunshots.\n\"It happened so quickly. It was peaceful to mayhem.\"\n\"It escalated so quickly.\"\nFellow resident Andy Gupta told PA Media: \"We saw three or four armed police through our window. That's when we realised there was something serious going on.\n\"For the first time in my life, I felt like I was working in a movie.\n\"There were 15 to 20 police cars, armed police, three or four ambulances, and two critical care units.\n\"It was worrying - I've got family here. I know that kids play over there and my mate's kids are there so I was worried about them as well.\"\nMr Gupta's 13-year-old daughter, said: \"I saw a man coming out of a house and it looked like he had been stabbed in the stomach.\n\"And then the police officers came and said, 'Don't stand outside, don't come outside, it's dangerous'.\n\"They kept them all inside. And then armed police came and I heard two gunshots.\n\"We were shocked - we didn't think it would happen in such a quiet area.\" \nThames Valley Police has made a mandatory referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct over the incident, which happened at about 18:00 BST.\nWith additional reporting by Martin Heath.\nGot a story?

    "Parents of teenagers with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) are to be told to pay more for transport to college or sixth form.\nBirmingham City Council has confirmed cuts to its special needs transport budget, with taxis and minibuses no longer set to be routinely offered to those aged 16 to 18 from September.\nThe council-funded services, mainly used to transport pupils to special needs schools miles away from their homes, will remain for younger children.\nIn am email to families, the local authority acknowledged the changes would be \"difficult for some families\" and said it had given as much notice as possible.\nThe cash-strapped council declared itself effectively bankrupt last September by issuing a section 114 notice, before signing off on a wave of \"devastating\" cuts to address a \u00a3300m budget deficit.\nThe cuts, which have attracted protests, include slashed funding for some of the city's libraries.\nAnd the Children's Young People and Families department needs to find \u00a351.5m savings in the next financial year.\nUnder the transport changes, support for 16 to 18-year-old's will be provided through a personal transport budget (PTB) or a pass for use on public transport. \nBut families will be told to pay more, with their contribution deducted from the budget, increasing from \u00a3780 to \u00a31,028 per academic year.\nLow-income families will still pay \u00a3390 a year towards their travel arrangements.\nA public consultation on the review of the Labour-run council\u2019s travel assistance policy was launched earlier this year, with the authority admitting its proposal \u201cinvolves a reduction on what is offered\u201d.\n\u201cThat is not something the council wishes to do but rather considers itself driven to by the current financial situation,\u201d it said.\nThe council also admitted the proposed increase in parental contribution may impose a \u201csignificant financial burden,\" especially for families with more than one child, potentially discouraging pupils from pursuing higher education.\nConservative councillor Adam Higgs, said: \u201cEvery child, regardless of disability, should be given the opportunity and encouragement to thrive in educational attainment.\n\u201cThis is a very emotive subject on all sorts of fronts for families and carers,\u201d added Labour councillor Jayne Francis, during a cabinet meeting in April. \n\u201cBut, I was pleased to see we\u2019re still providing the same level of support to children of compulsory school age and for our young people aged 19 plus.\"\nCouncil leader John Cotton, previously blamed the government for causing wider financial issues at local council level, but Prime Minister Rishi Sunak insisted the authority had mismanaged its finances.\nThis news was gathered by the Local Democracy Reporting Service which covers councils and other public service organisations.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X, and Instagram, Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk",
    "A Scottish woman on vacation. A retiree carrying a Trump puppet. A 22-year-old film producer. A former criminal defence attorney. \nHundreds of people travel miles and wait hours in the early morning for a chance to be in the Manhattan courtroom for the first-ever criminal trial of a former US president. \nDonald Trump has pleaded not guilty to falsifying business records in relation to a hush-money payment made to a porn star.\nBoth ardent critics and devoted fans of Mr Trump have gathered daily for the trial, now entering its fifth week. But despite their differences, nearly all provided the same reason for being there: to catch a glimpse of history. \n\"The truth is, when you come and sit in this [court]room, you're not really expressing your support for any side,\" said Shmuel Munkis, a Brooklyn resident. \"It's just about being here, just to witness history.\" \nMr Munkis is among dozens of people who waited in line for the second day of testimony from Stormy Daniels, an adult film star who has alleged having sex with Mr Trump, who has denied this. \nMr Trump is accused of illegally covering up a reimbursement he made to his former lawyer who gave Ms Daniels the hush-money payment. \nThe adult film star's first day of questioning on Tuesday featured a series of salacious details about an evening she alleges she spent in Mr Trump's hotel suite. The testimony prompted the former president to curse and shake his head across the courtroom.  \nIt also sparked a frenzy outside the courthouse, with an even longer line on a brisk spring morning for a chance at a seat. \nMr Munkis arrived at 00:30 EDT (05:30 BST) on Thursday to help his chances of being one of only six people from the public in the main courtroom for Ms Daniels' last day of testimony. \n\"Some people were telling me that there was some inappropriate things being discussed. But I absolutely did not come for that,\" said Mr Munkis, a supporter of Mr Trump who believes the trial is \"a joke\". \nJoe Waldbaum, a semi-retired 77-year-old criminal defence attorney, took a week off and a plane from Massachusetts to come to the New York trial. \nCarrying memes depicting Mr Trump in prison while sitting in a foldable chair for the hours-long wait, Mr Waldbaum said the trial itself was the punishment for the former president. \n\"It's a spectacle,\" he said. \"He's got to be convicted.\" \nOthers travelled even farther. \nClare Gallagher, from Scotland, decided to spend her vacation visiting cousin Frances Graham in New York waiting in line at the courthouse. Ms Graham's sister, Barbara Anne Crowley, joined them from San Diego.  \n\"When I go home, I can tell my kids that we were there,\" Ms Gallagher said. \nIn Scotland, Mr Trump has a poor reputation because of controversies related to his golf courses there, the women said. \n\"We're looking at it and wondering how anyone like that could get to a position so high in the country,\" Ms Graham said. \nNia Fields, a 32-year-old marketing director, has long been exposed to Mr Trump and his real estate ventures, growing up in the New York City area. \nShe's been following the trial closely. \n\"This is like my real-life reality show,\" she said, adding that she had been waiting to come to the trial, but made an extra effort when she heard Ms Daniels was the witness. \n\"I'll be keeping my eyes on scene, on the body language with Trump and his team,\" she said. \nMina, a 33-year-old who is a frequent pro-Trump protester outside and an observer inside the court, was bothered by Ms Daniels' first day of testimony. \nShe noted that even Justice Juan Merchan said some details the adult film star shared would have been \"better left unsaid\". \n\"I found that her testimony was not consistent,\" she said. \"I don't feel [Mr Trump] is guilty at all.\" \nOn the other side of the political aisle was Rose Brennan, who carried a puppet resembling Mr Trump nicknamed \"Donald J Puppet\". \nIt comes with her to women's marches and other protests. \nBut once inside, it's all business. \nIn the main courtroom and the media overflow section, members of the public cannot speak, check their cell phones, or eat or drink anything besides water for hours at a time. \nFor Mason Kidd, a 22-year-old freelance film producer, those are small discomforts worth bearing to watch history. He took advantage of a day of no meetings, waking up at 05:00 EDT and biking over from New York's Hell's Kitchen neighbourhood.\nHis friends didn't understand why he was so motivated, he said. \n\"Nobody goes to these things, especially our age,\" Mr Kidd said. \"It just seems like a moment that I will want to remember that I went to, like 30 years from now.\"",
    "Hundreds of people are feared dead after flash flooding hit northern Afghanistan, with warnings the toll could rise after further storms across the region.\nTaliban officials say at least 150 have been killed, while the World Food Programme says more than 300 have died, after heavy rainfall hit five districts in Baghlan province on Friday night. \nPictures on social media showed torrents of water sweeping through houses in several villages, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.\nThe country has been hit by unusually heavy rainfall over the last few weeks, with floods killing scores of people since mid-April. \nAbdul Mateen Qani, a spokesman for Afghanistan's interior ministry, told the BBC that at least 131 people had died in Baghlan province and 20 in Takhar.\nMeanwhile, Rana Deraz, from the UN's World Food Programme, told the AFP news agency there had been 311 deaths in Baghlan.\nMs Deraz said 2,011 houses had been destroyed and an additional 2,800 damaged.\nThree mosques, and four schools were also affected.\nMany of those who had died came from the province's Borka district where more than 200 people had been trapped inside their homes. \nThere are also reports of severe damage in the provinces of Badakhshan, Ghor and western Herat.\nLocal official Hedayatullah Hamdard told AFP news agency emergency personnel including the army were \"searching for any possible victims under the mud and rubble\".\nTents, blankets and food were provided to some families who had lost their homes, the official added.\nThe main road connecting Kabul to northern Afghanistan is closed. \nIt comes after flooding last month in the west of the country killed dozens of people, leaving thousands requiring humanitarian aid. \nFlash flooding happens when rain falls so heavily that normal drainage cannot cope.\nExperts say a relatively dry winter has made it more difficult for the soil to absorb rainfall. Vast areas of farmland have also been submerged.\nTorrential rain and flooding kill people every year in Afghanistan, where badly built houses in isolated rural areas are particularly vulnerable.\nAfghanistan is among the globe's most at risk nations from the effects of climate change, according to experts. \nThe nation is one of the poorest in the world, having been ravaged by decades of war which culminated in the withdrawal of a US-led coalition and the Taliban retaking control in 2021.\nMany factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely.\nThe world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.",
    "The Northern Lights were visible in the skies over Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland on Friday night. \nMany people pointed their cameras skyward to capture the light show, also known as the Aurora Borealis.\nNot usually spotted over Northern Ireland, the lights were visible after one of the strongest geomagnetic storms for years hit Earth.\nIf you missed the display you are likely to have a chance to see it again on Saturday night.\nThe Northern Ireland BBC weather watchers\u2019 site has been inundated with pictures of the Aurora Borealis from all corners of Northern Ireland, not just the more remote places along the north coast where the phenomenon is more often visible.\nBelfast had a spectacular display too where normally there is too much light pollution to see the lights so clearly.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have rated it as in their top category of G5, the first extreme storm since October 2003, which are sometimes referred to as the Halloween Storms.\nWe are currently approaching the maximum of the 11-year solar cycle and that is when the most active conditions tend to occur.\nSo the aurora may be visible in the coming nights too.\nConditions in Northern Ireland may not be as good tonight as clouds are expected to increase after midnight, and there may be more pollution in the air from barbecues.\nSunday will be warm again, but thunderstorms are likely in some areas during the afternoon and evening. The Met Office have issued a thunderstorm warning for places west of Lough Neagh valid from 11:00 to 19:00.\nThe Northern Lights - or aurora borealis - appear as bright, swirling curtains of lights in the night sky and range in colour from green to pink and scarlet.\nIt is caused by charged particles from the sun hitting gases in the Earth's atmosphere.\nThe colours occur due to different gases in the Earth's atmosphere being energised by the charged particles.\nThe two most common gases in the Earth's atmosphere are nitrogen and oxygen. Oxygen atoms glow green - the colour most often seen in the Northern Lights, while nitrogen atoms emit purple, blue and pink.\nThe most impressive auroras occur when the Sun emits really large clouds of particles called \"coronal mass ejections\".",
    "Russian attacks in north-east Ukraine have prompted the evacuation of almost 1,800 people from the Kharkiv area, the regional head has said.\nHeavy fighting has continued in the border area following Russia's surprise incursions on Friday.\nKyiv has been expecting a Russian summer offensive for some time - including a possible attempt to capture Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city.\nBut Ukraine insists its forces are able to resist any attack. \nOn Saturday Russia said it had seized five villages near the town of Vovchansk in its latest offensive. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the claim.\nIt is still not clear how far the Russians will advance - whether this is a probing attack or the start of something bigger.\nUkrainian artillery guns are now firing back. The booms of exchanging fire echo loudly down the already bomb-damaged streets. \nA total of 1,775 people have been evacuated, Kharkiv regional head Oleh Syniehubov said on social media. Hundreds more remain in Vovchansk, just 6km (3.7 miles) from the Russian border.\nSerhii, a resident, told the BBC that his home and vehicles had been destroyed by a Russian glide bomb.\nHis wife had been rushed to hospital with more serious injuries. Small fires were still pouring smoke across the remnants of his home. \nSerhii said he did not want to leave because he was afraid of what might happen to their four goats.\nAs we surveyed the damage there was the screech of yet more glide bombs being released, followed by the heavy thud of the explosion.\nRussia's air force is having an increasingly deadly effect, and for now Ukraine has no answer.\nUkrainian officials say Russia had the capability to aggravate the situation in border areas but not to capture the city of Kharkiv itself.\nReports suggest Moscow is hoping to create a 10km (six-mile) buffer zone for its Belgorod region, after a series of Ukrainian cross-border attacks.\nIn his nightly address on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said fighting was continuing in seven border villages, Reuters reported.\n\"Our defensive operations continue in the Kharkiv region\", he said, adding the situation in Donetsk \"remains especially tense\".\nOn Friday, the US announced a new $400m (\u00a3319m; \u20ac371m) military aid package for Ukraine.\nIt will be Washington's third instalment of aid to the country after months of political deadlock - adding to the previous package worth a total of $7bn sent in late April.\nUS Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said the \"urgently needed\" aid would include air defence munitions, artillery rounds, anti-tank weapons and armoured vehicles.\nOn Friday, National Security Spokesman John Kirby told reporters that Russia would \"make further advances in the coming weeks to try and establish a buffer zone along the Ukrainian border\".\nMoscow has been looking to capitalise on the delayed arrival of US weaponry by continuing to push forwards in the eastern Donetsk region.\nThe return of heavy fighting in the north-east further illustrates Russia's growing ambitions.",
    "The Dutch artist Joost Klein has been disqualified from the Eurovision Song Contest after a backstage incident.\nAn allegation of intimidation was made to Swedish police by a female member of the production crew.\nThe Netherlands Songfestival said Klein had \"repeatedly indicated\" he did not want to be filmed and that he \"did not touch the camera woman\".\nMeanwhile, Ireland's entrant Bambie Thug missed their dress rehearsal, but hoped to be on stage for the show.\nOn their Instagram story, Bambie Thug explained that there had been a \"situation\" prior to the flag parade rehearsal \"which I felt needed urgent attention\" from the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).\nBambie Thug made no reference to Klein's exclusion and there is no suggestion the two incidents are related.\nSeparately, Norwegian media is reporting that their jury spokesman Allesandra Mele has pulled out, citing the \"inflamed situation\" in Malmo. She came fourth representing Norway last year with the song Queen of Kings.\nDutch broadcaster Avrotros called Klein's disqualification \"disproportionate\".\nIn a statement on social media, the company said it was \"shocked by the decision\" and would \"come back to this later\".\nThe contest organisers said \"it would not be appropriate\" for Klein to participate \"while the legal process takes place\".\nDutch broadcaster Avrotros, which sends acts to Eurovision, said: \"Against clearly made agreements, Joost was filmed when he had just gotten off stage and had to rush to the greenroom. At that moment, Joost repeatedly indicated that he did not want to be filmed. This wasn't respected.\n\"This led to a threatening movement from Joost towards the camera. Joost did not touch the camerawoman.\"\nThe statement said the body had \"consulted extensively\" with the EBU and \"proposed several solutions\" but the decision was still taken to disqualify Klein. \nKlein had been among the favourites to win this year's contest with his song, Europapa.\nA pro-Europe techno anthem, it was dedicated to his father, who he lost to cancer aged 12. \nNow 26, the singer had promised his father he would one day make it to the Eurovision stage.\nNews of his suspension emerged on Friday afternoon, during the first dress rehearsal for Saturday's televised grand final.\nKlein's props were being set up on stage inside the Malm\u00f6 Arena when a production manager indicated they should be removed.\nHis song was then skipped without explanation, and Israel's entrant Eden Golan, who was next in the running order, took his place.\nThe European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises the event, later issued a statement saying they were \"investigating an incident that was reported to us involving the Dutch artist\".\nOn Saturday, Swedish police confirmed that a man had been reported for making \"unlawful threats\" at Malm\u00f6 Arena, after Thursday's semi-final. \n\"The police have taken all essential investigative measures and questioned the suspect, plaintiff and witnesses,\" a spokesperson said. \n\"The investigation has been completed by the police... and the case will now go to the prosecutor within a few weeks.\"\nThe EBU subsequently confirmed Klein would not be taking part in Saturday's grand final.\n\"We maintain a zero-tolerance policy towards inappropriate behaviour at our event and are committed to providing a safe and secure working environment for all staff at the Contest,\" they said. \n\"In light of this, Joost Klein's behaviour towards a team member is deemed in breach of Contest rules.\"\nAlthough contestants have been disqualified from Eurovision in the past, none has ever lost their place this close to the final.\nMore commonly, songs are rejected at the selection stage. In 2021, the Belarusian entry was banned after refusing to change lyrics that the contest deemed to be political in nature; while in 2016, Romania was barred from participating due to outstanding debts owed to the EBU.\nSwedish and Dutch news outlets have said that the incident involved Klein and a member of the television production team.\nOrganisers stressed that \"contrary to some media reports and social media speculation, this incident did not involve any other performer or delegation member\".\nEarly reports suggested there had been antagonism between Klein and Israel's contestant, as feelings run high over the Israel-Gaza war.\nAt a Eurovision press conference on Thursday, Golan was asked whether she had \"ever thought that by being here you bring risk and danger for other participants and public?\"\nWhen the Israeli singer was told by the moderator that she did not have to answer the question, Klein chimed in: \"Why not?\"\nGolan replied: \"I think we're all here for one reason, and one reason only, and the EBU is taking all safety precautions to make this a safe and united place for everyone, and so I think it's safe for everyone and we wouldn't be here [if not].\"\nEarlier, when Klein was asked if his song could live up to the Eurovision slogan and unite people by music, he replied: \"I think that's a good question ",
    "Dozens of Virginia Commonwealth University students walked out of their graduation ceremony on Saturday, partly over a speaker's response - the state governor - to campus protests.  \nIt comes as US school officials brace for possible disruptions of commencement events over Israel-Gaza war protests. \nDozens of colleges roiled by protests are holding graduations this weekend.\nMore than 2,000 people have been arrested since protest began mid-April.\nSocial media posts on Saturday showed Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) students in caps and gowns leaving the room as Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin began his commencement address. \nSome students had criticised the selection of Mr Youngkin as that year's speaker, both for his opposition to a racial literacy requirement being considered by VCU as well as for saying that encampments on college campuses should not be allowed. \nVideo posted online show some of the VCU protesters chanting \"disclose, divest - we will not stop we will not rest\". \nMany students protesters in the US are demanding that their schools, many with massive endowments, financially cut ties from Israel.\nPeople were clapping so loudly, members of the audience couldn't hear Mr Youngkin speak, Sereen Haddad, a second-year VCU student who helped organise the protest, told the BBC on Saturday evening.\nMs Haddad said some 150 people marched outside the ceremony, including students who walked out.\nThirteen people, including six students, were arrested at VCU when the encampment there was cleared by police on 29 April. \nMr Youngkin's speech went on as planned despite the walk-out. He later posted a message on social media congratulating graduates and did not comment on the protest.\nAt another commencement on Saturday, the University of California Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ opened the ceremony by acknowledging the weeks of demonstrations from protesters. \n\"I'm saddened by how this conflict has divided students, faculty and staff,\" she said, according to the LA Times.\nThe remarks drew some applause as well as chants of: \"Hey hey, ho ho, the occupation has got to go\".\nSome 20 students stood up and began waving signs, Palestinian flags and chanting, \"Free Palestine\" as during another speech, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, and they were later joined in chants by more graduates.\nIn a statement, UC Berkeley said that the event continued despite being \"unfortunately disrupted\" and that protesters who left the ceremony did so voluntarily. No one was arrested. \nThe protest came a day after eight students wore shirts spelling out \"UC divest\" during the law school graduation ceremony.\nIn the past month, the BBC has counted more than 130 US colleges and universities with protests against the ongoing war in Gaza. \nCampus protests have led to some graduation ceremonies being cancelled, including at New York's Columbia University, which said last week it was ditching its 15 May commencement in favour of smaller celebrations to focus on keeping students \"safe\". \nMany schools have brought in additional measures for the graduation events, such as requiring identification, instituting clear bag policies, and issuing warnings that people causing a disruption will be removed.\nSome commencement speakers have also withdrawn, like author Colson Whitehead, who said he would no longer be the keynote speaker at the University of Massachusetts Amherst event after police cleared an encampment there. \nOthers have had their speeches cancelled. \nThe University of Vermont and Xavier University of Louisiana recently rescinded invitations to have the US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, speak under students pressure to drop the Biden administration official from the line-up. \nSome universities, including University of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had police clear encampments and arrest protesters on Friday ahead of graduation ceremonies. \nAt the University of Arizona, police used \"loud munitions\" and \"chemical munitions\" to clear remaining protesters from an encampment, the university said. \nWhile some universities have avoided clearing the protest camps, others have brought in police to help remove demonstrators. \nEarlier this week, the chief of police at Arizona State University was placed on paid administrative leave \"pending a review\" after the school received a number of complaints about his handling of the campus protests in late April, ASU said on Friday.

    "They have been blasted from car stereos on the streets of New York City, played by DJs at nightclubs across the US, dubbed into Chinese on TikTok and inspired merengue songs among Spanish-speaking audiences. \nA series of diss tracks from hip-hop's two biggest stars, Drake and Kendrick Lamar, has animated the most high-profile rap beef in a generation, drawing global attention and an avalanche of online discussion and dissection. \nThe two men's status in the rap world transcends that of the typical artist: Drake owns a record label and has collaborated with the Toronto Raptors and Nike, while Lamar was the first rapper to win a Pulitzer Prize for his level of artistry and produced an award-winning record for the Marvel film Black Panther. \nThat these two powerhouses would have such a public and angry spat has fascinated not just hip-hop fans but others around the globe - particularly as Drake and Lamar are castigating each other lyrically at such a sudden and blistering pace. \nThe rap rivals have released nine solo diss tracks aimed at one another in fewer than four weeks, but there are other collaborations and songs produced by other artists that stretch back to Drake and North Carolina rapper J. Cole's collaboration on the track First Person Shooter in October 2023.\nJ. Cole said on First Person Shooter that he, Drake and Lamar were the \"big three\" of hip hop. Lamar would reject that idea by rapping that \"it's just big me\" on record producer Metro Boomin and rapper Future's collaboration on the song Like That. \nIn the early days of rap, you might only catch diss tracks on a copied cassette, from an in-the-know radio station, or by seeing a performance at a club. Lamar and Drake's super-charged rap beef made it clear that this has now changed forever. \n\"I think when you look at this battle, it is going to surpass every other battle because of how it was able to crossover to pop culture so quickly,\" said Carl Lamarre, Billboard's deputy director of R&B and Hip-Hop.\nEven in the recent past, audiences might have had to wait months to hear a feud play out. Jay-Z released the diss track, Takeover, in September 2001 to ridicule fellow New Yorker, Nas. It took his target three months to reply on Ether. \nAt one time, releasing a diss was an element of performative competition within the hip-hop community. It was used to claim a hip-hop throne, often by rappers who were trying to grow their platform at a local level and to hustle for another show or record contract. \nAudiences, in turn, would have to put in work to follow if a rap beef progressed past a night at the club, Bill Stephney, a former executive at Def Jam Records, recalled. \nWhen he was coming up in New York City in the 1980s, Mr Stephney said fans would capture diss tracks on tape, and those who were interested were lucky to get a version that could be listened to. They were often copied hundreds of times from one cassette to another, each iteration decreasing the sound quality until the track was hardly audible. \nMr Stephney said he worked hard to obtain a prized cassette of Roxanne Shante, a female rapper who helped popularise the diss track at 14 years old in New York. She led a series of well-known rap feuds and rivalries called the Roxanne Wars in the 1980s.\nThe immediacy with which artists are now able to release songs directly on social media, even before they hit digital streaming platforms, means the two rappers can speak directly to each other and to their audiences. Their fans can also then react and respond in real time, and it can rapidly be picked up by popular culture\n\"Fast forward 40 years [from the Roxanne Wars], and now Kendrick and Drake can create something and rather than having it be dubbed 200 times for New York-area fans to check it out, they can just simply upload it within seconds,\" Mr Stephney said. \n\"That 100 million people can consume that so quickly is just such a profound technological change. It's hard to even fathom it.\" \nThe two men's diss tracks have produced countless Reddit forums, YouTube explainers and media think-pieces. And the songs that stem from their feud have led the streaming charts in recent weeks. \nLamar's most recent release, Not Like Us, is among the most streamed song in the world at the moment, coming in at #1 on Apple Music in 40 countries earlier this week, and it is expected to debut at #1 on the Billboard charts in the coming days. \nNot Like Us has also been played on US television during an NBA playoff game, it's been heard blasting from the speakers at the Los Angeles Dodgers' stadium and tennis star Naomi Osaka said she listened to it before taking the court at the Italian Open.\nLamar's other diss track Euphoria, meanwhile, was used by President Joe Biden's campaign in a video attempting to throw shade at Republican contender and former president Donald Trump.\n\"At one time, it was really those people who were really part of the subculture who would know about [rap beefs], and they followed it fer",
    "When Bambie Thug takes to the Eurovision stage on Saturday night, for many, it will be their first look at Ireland\u2019s \"goth gremlin goblin witch\u201d.\nTheir semi-final performance of Doomsday Blue has given rise to hopes that Ireland, who have not won since 1996, can finally break their Eurovision curse.\nThey are now among the bookmakers favourites to win in Malmo.\nFor Donegal fashion designer Mariusz Malon, the man behind their Eurovision look, the night will also bring his work to a global audience.\n\u201cThis is bigger than anything I have done before,\u201d he told BBC News NI.\nOriginally from Poland, Mariusz moved to Buncrana in the Republic of Ireland at the age of seven.\nAfter leaving school he studied fashion at the North West Regional College in Londonderry before moving to Manchester.\nHis work is hugely popular with some of the UK\u2019s drag queens, but dressing Bambie Thug brings his work to a new level.\n\u201cBambie and I have been following each other for a while on Instagram, they approached me with an aesthetic that was quite witchy, quite old Irish paganism,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI know they had liked some of my old designs, we sent ideas back and forth, settled on some things, changed some other about.\n\u201cWhat we have is a really amazing outfit, an outfit that starts conversations,\u201d he said.\nIn the semi-final, Bambie Thug performed inside a candlelit pentagram.\nThroughout their performance they remove a dress covered with black feathers to revealing a swimsuit adorned with the transgender flag - a reference to their non-binary identity.\nStrict Eurovision rules mean nothing can change for Saturday\u2019s final.\nMariusz has been in Malmo all week and spoke to BBC News NI in between rehearsals for the final. \nConfidence, he said, is growing among the team that Bambie Thug can win\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be insane, there are so many Irish fans in Malmo, it has been so encouraging,\" he added.\n\"Bambie has been getting so much love.\".\nBambie Thug is a self-described queer, \u2018ouija popstar\u2019, who uses the non-binary personal pronouns they and them.\nTheir genre-defying Eurovision entry Doomsday Blue will be performed on Saturday evening's final alongside 25 other countries.\nOn Tuesday evening, Bambie Thug became the first Irish entry to qualify for a Eurovision Grand Final in six years.\nThe Cork singer was among 10 acts to qualify from the first semi-final at the Malmo Arena.\nThe 68th Eurovision Song Contest final takes place on Saturday evening in Malmo, Sweden.\nIt will be broadcast live on BBC One, BBC Radio 2, BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds.\nThe UK's entry is Olly Alexander, who will be performing Dizzy.",
    "\"In the same way a nice view might catch your eye, sometimes people just look really sweet - like they're having a nice day or put on a fresh jacket they maybe weren't too sure about.\" \nThat's the approach taken by Mitchel Lucas, who has garnered hundreds of thousands views on TikTok for his heartwarming \"stranger portraits\".\nBristol's streets provide the backdrop for the series, with people captured in iconic spots such as the Harbourside.\nMr Lucas described the city as the \"perfect spot\" for his work, in which he surprises people on the spot with their portraits. \nSome of the most popular videos on his page show the process of finding a subject for a portrait, setting up the shot, taking the photo and then printing it instantly on a mini printer. \nMr Lucas then films himself surprising the people he photographed with the picture, capturing their reaction in real time. \n\"When I first started this I thought everyone would reject it. I was a bit sceptical to even try, but I decided to give it a go anyway,\" he said. \n\"It turns out the reactions are 90% positive - I don't think I've ever had an outwardly negative reaction.\"\nThere's a knack to taking candid pictures in this way, Mr Lucas explained - adding that it was best to be a \"people person\". \n\"If people notice you taking their picture from a little way away and you shuffle off people might think you're a bit of a weirdo.\n\"But if you smile and wave, go over to say hi and introduce yourself then it's a much easier and more fun way to go about it.\"\nIt's not the first time Mr Lucas has shared his portraits online, but the mini-printer allowing him to hand out the portraits is a new addition.\nHe previously worked as a musician \"so I'm used to freelance life\", he said, but turned to photography when gig opportunities like weddings suddenly vanished during the pandemic. \n\"I started doing [the stranger portraits] a couple of years ago when I first started photography because I couldn't get anyone to work with me so I had to go and take photographs of people on the streets myself,\" he said. \nWith photography being a relatively new venture, sharing his videos on social media has proven to be a valuable tool for finding new opportunities. \nThe whole process is \"a lot of work\", he said, \"but ultimately it's my way of marketing and advertising my paid services\". \n\"I'd much rather spend time making people smile online and stuff rather than putting money into Facebook advertising or something like that.\"\nAnd while his ultimate dream is to travel, \"telling stories about people and places\", it's Bristol that he credits with making his journey so far possible. \n\"Bristol is the perfect spot, if there's anywhere that was going to be open to it, it was going to be here,\" he said. \nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Striking historical treasures discovered at a nature reserve have returned home after being hidden away in a store 150 miles away.\nThe artefacts, including a frog figurine and a sculpture of a barbarian, have been transferred to a new archaeological resource centre at Chester House Estate in Northamptonshire.\nThe archive filled 3,000 boxes and included 2.5 tonnes of pottery and 3,750 coins.\nSome of the items are expected to go on display to the public next year.\nThe objects in the archive were excavated between 1984 and 1991 at Stanwick Lakes near Rushden.\nThey were then taken to Historic England's store in Portsmouth.\nThe return of the artefacts was funded by a grant from Historic England and is the result of a three-year project which involved teams from both the Northamptonshire Archaeological Resource Centre (Arc) and Historic England.\nThe finds included 16 partially reconstructed pieces of Roman mosaic and 280 large pieces of Roman sculpture.\nAlso found during the excavations were prehistoric beaker pots and jets and a pristine example of a flint dagger which research has shown was unused before it was buried within a grave.\nThe finds will now be accessible to researchers and some are expected to be displayed at the museum at Stanwick Lakes next year, while others may be put on show at Rushden Lakes.\nHelen Howell, deputy leader of North Northamptonshire Council, said: \"It is fantastic news that these historically important items have been able to return to the county and their new home is so close to where the items were originally excavated - it truly is a 'full circle' moment.\nBecky Gill, heritage manager at Stanwick Lakes, said: \u201cBeing able to display items in our Heritage Museum, on the site on which they were found, is a wonderful and engaging way for us to be able to tell the story of the area\u2019s rich heritage and history.\"\nFollow Northamptonshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The plan was called Project Cauliflower.\nIt began last October, when Olly Alexander accepted the invitation to become the UK\u2019s Eurovision contestant.\nHe\u2019d been in the running once before, in 2022, but the timing didn\u2019t seem right.\nInstead, the BBC sent a little-known TikTok singer called Sam Ryder, with a power ballad called Spaceman.\nIt went on to achieve second place - the UK\u2019s best result in more than 20 years.\nThe following summer, Alexander started recording his first album as a solo artist. Maybe one of these songs, he thought, would work at Eurovision?\nCalls were made. Deals were made. Project Cauliflower was born and, for the next two months, preparations began under the strictest secrecy.\n\u201cWe had to have meetings at Olly\u2019s manager\u2019s house so no-one could overhear what was happening,\u201d creative director Theo Adams told The Euro Trip podcast.\n\u201cIt was actually a very exciting period. I\u2019d never done anything before that had such secrecy surrounding it. I felt like I was a spy.\u201d\nAlexander went public in December during the grand finale of Strictly Come Dancing. For Eurovision fans, it seemed too good to be true.\nA likeable, chart-topping pop star, known around the world, with a track record of putting on elaborate performances and a lifelong love for Eurovision? \nHe couldn\u2019t have been a better fit.\n\"Having a bona fide pop star representing the UK this year is a great start,\u201d agreed Graham Norton in an interview earlier this week.\n\u201cOlly has already done all the things that it\u2019s impossible to prepare someone for - he has played to huge crowds, he can relate to the cameras, and he is used to high pressure situations.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great performer, and a great singer,\u201d agreed Neil Tennant, who duetted with Alexander on the 2020 Pet Shop Boys\u2019 song Dreamland.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great he\u2019s got the courage to do it because it\u2019s so high stakes, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nThe stakes got him in the end.\nIn Malm\u00f6 on Saturday, Alexander\u2019s song, Dizzy, stumbled into 18th place, out of 25.\nAll of his 46 points came from the jury. His score in the public televote was zero.\nEven so, it wasn\u2019t the worst result. The UK has had more embarrassing defeats. And Alexander has a career to go back to - unlike previous performers, whose musical ambitions have come to a screeching halt after Eurovision.\nBut the expectations were so high that this year's result feels particularly rough. \nIt's now 27 years since the UK last won the contest. \nSo what went wrong\u2026 and how can the country improve its chances?\nLook, Dizzy is a great radio track.\nCo-written by Danny L Harle (Charli XCX,  Dua Lipa) it pulses and throbs in all the right places. Musical nods to the Pet Shop Boys and London's church bells remind listeners of the UK's place at the epicenter of pop. \nAnd compositionally, it pulls a clever trick. The  constant chordal movement of the chorus prompts a feeling of dizziness. When Alexander sings that his lover \u201cpulls me back to the beginning\u201d, the chords resolve to the opening key of C minor.\nThat\u2019s why juries liked it. Songwriters in Sweden, another pop powerhouse, awarded Dizzy eight points out of a possible 12.\nBut audiences don\u2019t know or care about the nuts and bolts of songwriting. They sided with critics like the Guardian\u2019s Laura Snapes, who dismissed the song as \u201cperfectly fine\u201d or the Telegraph\u2019s Neil McCormick, who called it \u201cpleasantly unexceptional\u201d.\nDizzy wasn\u2019t a bad song. It just wasn\u2019t good enough to make people pick up the phone and vote.\nI'd like to think not. \nAfter years of sending untested, milquetoast reality show contestants to Eurovision, Alexander delivered a spectacular TV performance.\nWith computer-controlled cameras, synchronised to pin-sharp choreography, the star made it seem like he and his dancers were being flung around the interior of a spaceship plummeting through a black hole.\nFrom his commentary box, Graham Norton described the production as \u201cterrific\u201d but admitted it could suffer because it was \u201cso different to everything else in the contest tonight\u201d.\nThe performance drew a lukewarm reception inside the arena, as the complex staging meant Alexander was out of sight for the first two minutes.\nAnd at home, some viewers said they were put off by the sexual nature of the dancing.\nOthers said the physical demands affected Alexander\u2019s vocals. There were certainly a few wobbles - a bad look next to the powerhouse singers of France and Portugal and Switzerland.\nBut there were positive comments, too. \u201cOlly Alexander did an amazing job,\u201d tweeted journalist Emilia Kettle from inside the arena.\n\"Best performance of the night so far,\u201d added Craig Brown. \u201cMaybe not the best song. But the best live act.\"\nThat\u2019s a big step up. Eurovision performances have become increasingly elaborate and the UK needed to catch up. From here, things can only get better.\nI don\u2019t know what inspired Dizzy. It seems like an earnest and heartfelt declaration of love, but is that enough?\nListen to the acts who came in the top five, and you'll hear something -",
    "Three decades ago, Chinese dissidents were being smuggled out of the country in a secret operation called Yellow Bird - but as one of them tells the BBC, Beijing is still pursuing them. \nJune 1992: It was the middle of the night on the South China Sea, and a Chinese patrol vessel was approaching a boat en route from the Communist mainland to the then-British colony of Hong Kong.\nAs border troops came on board to talk to the crew, their voices could be heard by a group of people packed into a secret compartment below deck.\nA few minutes earlier, when the patrol boat was spotted, these secret passengers had been given an urgent order.\n\u201cI was told to hide,\u201d one of them, Yan Xiong, recalls. \u201cDon\u2019t make any noise!\u201d\nMost of those hiding were economic migrants, hoping to find work in Hong Kong \u2013 but not Yan.\nHe was a political dissident, and if he was discovered, he would be in serious trouble.\nYan was being smuggled out of China as part of a secret operation code-named Yellow Bird.\nThe patrol eventually sailed away, and in the early hours Yan - who had never travelled in a boat before that night - arrived in Hong Kong.\nAfter a hearty breakfast, he was taken to a detention centre. This was, he was told, for his own safety. Walking the streets could be dangerous.\nShadow War: China and the West\n\nGordon Corera looks at the growing tensions between China and the West.\n\nListen now to the Radio 4 podcast on BBC Sounds\nBeing in detention was not new to Yan. He had already spent 19 months in a Chinese prison for his part in 1989\u2019s Tiananmen Square protests. Students had called for greater democracy and freedom, but the Communist Party sent in tanks to crush them.\nAt the end of June 1989, the Chinese government said that 200 civilians and several dozen security personnel had died. Other estimates have ranged from hundreds to many thousands.\nOn his release, Yan had made his way to southern China where, in scenes that could have been taken from a spy film, he was sent from one public phone booth to another, to be put in touch with the people who could get him out.\nHe was not the only dissident to undertake this risky journey.\nSpeaking to the BBC for a new series, Shadow War: China and the West, Chaohua Wang recalls her escape.\nDespite being number 14 on a list of the 21 most wanted people after the Tiananmen Square protests, she managed to evade capture, hiding in tiny rooms for months before heading south and becoming part of the Yellow Bird escape line.\n\u201cI was like a parcel moved from one [person] to another,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI didn't even know the name Yellow Bird for quite some years.\u201d \nYellow Bird may sound like a classic spy operation, and many believed that an intelligence service - MI6 or the CIA - had come up with the idea. But they had not.\nIn fact, it was a private enterprise undertaken by concerned groups of citizens in Hong Kong, motivated by a desire to help out those who were on the run. Among them were the local film and entertainment industry and (more usefully) organised crime, in the form of the triads.\n\u201cThey [the triads] had a lot of Chinese police in their pockets,\u201d says Nigel Inkster, who at that time was an intelligence officer based in Hong Kong. This was what enabled them to move people out of hiding in Beijing and smuggle them across the border.\nThe UK and US only became involved when those people who arrived in Hong Kong needed to work out where to go next.\nYan remembers being visited by what he described as an \u201cEnglish gentleman\u201d who never gave his name but helped him with the paperwork.\n\u201cIt is better for you to go to America, not England,\u201d the man told him. Within days Yan was in Los Angeles.\u202f Chaohua Wang also ended up in the US.\nWhy not England?\nFormer officials have told the BBC the UK was reluctant to take in Tiananmen protesters because it was desperate to avoid upsetting China in the run-up to the 1997 handover of Hong Kong.\nAn agreement had been signed by the UK in 1984, but the events of Tiananmen Square five years later raised difficult questions about Hong Kong\u2019s future.\nIn 1992, a few weeks after Yan\u2019s arrival in the colony, the former Conservative cabinet minister Chris Patten became the last governor of Hong Kong.\nHe says he was determined to embed greater democracy, in the hope it would endure after the handover, and he announced proposals for the democratic reform of Hong Kong's institutions, aimed at broadening the voting base in elections. \nThere was opposition to the reforms not just from China\u2019s leadership but also from those in London who did not want to antagonise Beijing.\n\u201cMy main responsibility was to try to give people in Hong Kong the best chance of continuing to live in freedom and prosperity, and to do so after 1997,\u201d the former governor, now Lord Patten, tells me. He says he also was aware of - but not involved in - Yellow Bird.\nThe reluctance to allow dissidents to come to the UK - and the anger in some quarters about Patten\u2019s reforms - speaks to a central question from th",
    "Thousands of young people have been navigating their way across Dartmoor for the Ten Tors challenge.\nA total of 2,400 teenagers have stepped up to navigate themselves to take on routes of 35, 45 or 55  miles (56, 72 or 88km) across the tricky terrain.\nThey were buoyed by words of advice from Ray Mears, TV presenter, author and survival expert.\n\"Find the strength\", he urged the teams, before telling them \"I salute you\".\nMr Mears added: \"I think what you are about to do is amazing.\n\"The journey started when you volunteered.\n\"Now you have done your training and preparation.

    "The Northern Lights have made a rare appearance across the UK, delighting sky watchers up and down the country.\nExcited onlookers shared pictures of the lights, also known as aurora borealis, visible right across the country, including the south coast of England - and if you missed it you are likely to have a chance to see it again on Saturday night.\nThey could be seen after one of the strongest geomagnetic storms for years hit Earth, with the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issuing a rare solar storm warning.\nSuch storms increase people's chances of seeing the lights.\nThe extreme geomagnetic storm that happened on Friday was classed as the highest G5.\nStorms of this scale could potentially impact infrastructure, including satellites and the power grid, the NOAA warned. \nThe last big G5 storm caused a power outage in Sweden, but there have been no reports of disruption so far.\n\"The energy industry plans for a range of events far and wide - including into space,\u201d Ross Easton, a spokesperson for Energy Networks Association said, adding that space forecasts were being monitored carefully over the weekend.\nProf Carole Haswell, head of astronomy at the Open University, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a lot of satellites communicate using radio signals.\n\"All of these charged particles speeding around disrupt radio signals, particularly GPS which is used by planes.\"\nClear skies - like those on Friday evening - made sightings possible from almost everywhere in the UK.\nIn Thorngumbald, east Yorkshire, Sarah Sharp said seeing the lights was a \"dream come true\".\n\"It was truly spectacular, probably a once in a lifetime experience, it's certainly the first time I've seen them. We spent about an hour watching them move across the sky.\"\nAurora activity is expected again on Saturday and while the geomagnetic storm is still expected to be in the \"strong\" category, early indications are that it may not reach the extreme of Friday.\nWeather conditions are again expected to be ideal but it needs to be dark so you will need to wait until at least 22:30 BST.\n\nThe last time an extreme geomagnetic storm hit Earth was in 2003, so Friday's event was rare. We are much more used to seeing the Northern Lights limited to northern parts of the UK.\nThere have been more occasions in the last year or so where we\u2019ve had a weak showing of the aurora in southern parts of the UK.\nThis is because in its 11 year solar cycle, we are approaching the \u2018solar maximum\u2019 where there are naturally more sunspots on the Sun\u2019s surface.\nSunspots are like huge volcanos erupting charged particles in Coronal Mass Ejections (CME\u2019s).  With more of them at the moment, there\u2019s a greater chance of more frequent and strong auroral activity.\nIt is also worth pointing out that because we can forecast these events better and with most of us having a smart phone able to capture the bright lights of the aurora, there has been an increase in sightings over the last decade or two.\nHowever, as always, anywhere away from light pollution with a clear view of the night sky will give you the best chance of seeing them.\nIn the US, the NOAA said the lights could be seen as far south as Alabama and northern California.\nMany of Europe's northern countries were treated to the spectacle as well. \nCameras captured bright pink skies over Austria, and a purple wash over Germany, with watchers in Slovakia, Switzerland, Denmark and Poland among others who enjoyed the light show.\nThe lights were captured in China, too, with fuchsia skies photographed over the country's north.\n\nThe Northern Lights - or aurora borealis - appear as bright, swirling curtains of lights in the night sky and range in colour from green to pink and scarlet.\nIt is caused by charged particles from the sun hitting gases in the Earth's atmosphere.\nThe colours occur due to different gases in the Earth's atmosphere being energised by the charged particles. \nThe two most common gases in the Earth's atmosphere are nitrogen and oxygen. Oxygen atoms glow green - the colour most often seen in the Northern Lights, while nitrogen atoms emit purple, blue and pink.\nThe most impressive auroras occur when the Sun emits really large clouds of particles called \"coronal mass ejections\".",

    "A support group for people with mental health issues has been highlighting \"safe spaces\" out in the community. \nThe Phoenix Project, a social project in Ipswich, has a club that meets on Fridays offering morning activities and a chance to chat and have lunch at the Quaker Meeting House on Fonnereau Road.\nTracy and Paul, who attend, say it is really important to know where else you can go in town where you can get a warm welcome, especially if you have anxiety, stress or any mental health challenges.\nIn Suffolk, it is estimated that 106,250 residents (aged 16 or over) experienced at least one common mental health condition in 2020. The most common were generalised anxiety disorder, depressive episodes and phobias.\nAhead of Mental Health Awareness Week, which starts on Monday, Phoenix showed us a few of their favourite other places, starting at the Geek Retreat gaming shop and social centre.\nIt is a franchise that was set up about a decade ago offering food, games, or just somewhere to sit and spend time.\nSharon Lockhart, its manager, says she and her husband Rob liked this idea of coming together and helping others make friends while playing games, and as parents of a child with autism, they were looking for a suitable space and set up the Ipswich branch in 2021 on Upper Brook Street.\nShe says that for some people having activities to engage in takes the stress out of having to talk about themselves. \n\"Post-pandemic, it was important to meet again in a friendly, safe environment, especially with a dying town centre like Ipswich,\" said Ms Lockhart.\n\"You can proudly wear your [mental health] labels in this shop... and it's dog- friendly too.\u201d\nCoffee Crawl is a social group which gathers on Wednesday mornings for a cuppa and a chat at a different outlet each week - and it is actually at the Geek Retreat this coming Wednesday.\nThey say it is all about just turning up and meeting like-minded people in a relaxed, informal setting. You can make friends, which is great for everyone.\nThe community garden and physical health project ActivLives was established 16 years ago and is based in Maidenhall. \nJack, site manager\u2019s assistant, says that green activity such as its ActivGardens offer can dramatically improve your mental health - just by being in the fresh air  and close to nature.\nCarl who attends the group says it has changed his life: \"It is work and social at the same time, you feel like you are giving back and are also part of something. \n\"Sometimes if you are down here, you can just sit for10 minutes, then grab a tea. \n\"Everyone has been through something, but the mindset is just to try and enjoy a bit of the day.\"\nOn Norwich Road is The Hive - a cultural community centre based in the former West End Music shop. It offers free language groups, social sessions, sewing and craft workshops and has a lovely garden project that allows people to spend time outside in a very urban part of town.\nOmar O'Connor supports one of the social sessions on Tuesdays and says The Hive has a unique offer of bringing so many different people together.\nAnyone can come and meet others, get involved in arts and crafts, maybe make podcasts or help in the garden.\nThe Phoenix group says there are other safe spaces for your mental health in the town and they are talking about making a leaflet available in the future.\nFollow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The man at the centre of a long-running airport naming rights saga has called for an apology from the Tees Valley mayor. \nChris Joseph and the Tees Valley Combined Authority (TVCA) have been in a years-long debate over the intellectual property rights to the name Teesside Airport. \nMr Joseph said he received threats of physical violence from the public due to the way Ben Houchen talked about him. \nA Tees Valley mayor spokesperson said \"the name was rightly changed to Teesside International Airport\" in 2019.\nMr Joseph, who was raised in Stockton, bought the rights to the name Teesside Airport in 2015 when the site was still called Durham Tees Valley Airport and owned by Peel Group. \nIn 2019, the TVCA bought the airport for \u00a340m. That same year, the TCVA made Mr Joseph two offers for his intellectual property rights to Teesside Airport. \nThe first offer was for \u00a320,000 in March 2019, and the second offer was for \u00a31 in July 2019.\nMr Joseph rejected both offers. \n\"They didn't even negotiate,\" he said. \nThe businessman had been seeking \u00a3250,000 for the rights. This led to Mr Houchen publicly saying Mr Joseph was holding Teessiders \"to ransom\". \nMr Joseph said the characterisation by Mr Houchen led to threats from the public. \n\u201cEverywhere I went, there were people screaming and shouting at me in my face,\u201d he said. \u201cOnline, one person threatened to stab me.\"\n\u201cThe people around me got very frightened,\u201d he added.\nMr Joseph said he took a step back from the whole issue in 2019 to \u201calleviate the paranoia\u201d.\nIn July 2019, the airport was unveiled with the name Teesside International Airport. \nMr Joseph has reignited the debate in recent weeks, as time is running out for him to make a civil claim about the issue. \nHe has sent the TCVA a letter calling for \u00a345,000 for his not-for-profit dispute resolution firm, as well as an apology from Mr Houchen for the distress Mr Joseph faced. \nHe said he was considering legal action if the TCVA did not negotiate a deal. \nA spokesperson for the mayor said the name was changed to Teesside International Airport following \"overwhelming public support\" in summer 2019. \n\"We\u2019ve seen the airport go from strength to strength since, with new flights, new businesses investing millions of pounds and creating good quality well paid jobs for local people,\" they said. \nFollow BBC Tees on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "A frog that has been cooked and eaten for decades on the Caribbean island of Dominica is on the verge of becoming extinct, but there is now a frantic push to try to save it.\nThe mountain chicken frog (Leptodactylus fallax) was once considered Dominica's unofficial national dish, according to locals.\n\"When I used to cook it, I would just cut it and put it into a broth,\" says Alain Mellow as he sits selling fruit and vegetables in Roseau, the bustling capital city of Dominica.\nIt tasted \"just like chicken\", according to Mr Mellow, who is now in his 70s, and believes the nutrients from the mountain chicken frog have contributed to his good health.\nAnother local name for the mountain chicken is \"crapaud\" (the French word for toad), a reminder of Dominica's past as a French colony.\nThere were different ways to cook the four-legged creature. Some preferred to include it in a stew, while others salivated over the golden-brown fried option.\nIn this country nicknamed \"the nature island\" because of a vast presence of varied flora and fauna, the frog's importance is highlighted by its presence on the national coat of arms.\nHowever, anyone visiting a restaurant on the Eastern Caribbean island now, or over the last two decades, may not have even heard of the mountain chicken frog as a delicacy.\nKenasher Valmond, who works at a caf\u00e9 near the sea port in Roseau, says she has never eaten mountain chicken.\n\"I've never seen it,\" says Ms Valmond, who is in her 20s. \"I just heard people speaking about it.\"\nAccording to experts, the main reason for the frog's disappearance from dining room tables and its decline in popularity among younger people is an infectious amphibian disease called chytridiomycosis.\n\"In a span of a year-and-a-half we lost almost 90% of the mountain chicken population in Dominica,\" Jeanelle Brisbane, a wildlife ecologist in Dominica, tells BBC News. \n\"It was one of the fastest amphibian declines on record in our history.\" That has led to the frog now being listed as critically endangered.\nOn a warm April night, BBC News journeyed into the forest with Ms Brisbane and her team from Dominica's forestry division and the non-governmental organisation Wild Dominique.\nWe set out to find one of the few surviving frogs in the wild, but were advised not to disclose the exact location to prevent poachers from targeting it.\nAs we made our way through the pitch dark area, Ms Brisbane alerted us to the distinct calling sound of a mountain chicken, prompting us to halt our trek and wait in silence, but we were unable to determine where the frog was located.\nAs we continued along a river bank - after a couple of false alarms, seeing other frog species - there, on the other side of the river, sat a mountain chicken frog, illuminated only by the light from our headlamps.\nThe frog is one of the largest in the world, and can grow up to 1kg (2.2lb) in weight according to the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), but it was no match for the deadly microscopic fungus.\nThe chytrid fungus began wreaking havoc in Dominica around 2002, according to researchers. \nThe frog is also battling for survival on another Caribbean island to the north.\n\"The disease got to Montserrat as well and completely wiped the species off the map,\" says Andrew Cunningham, the deputy director of science at the ZSL.\nProf Cunningham says that fortunately some of the frogs were put into captive breeding programmes in Montserrat before they disappeared completely.\nHe describes the disease as a massive problem, saying it has caused the probable extinction of over 90 species of amphibians globally.\nIn Dominica, before the fungus struck, harvesting the frog from the wild was a booming business, with studies finding up to 36,000 frogs being hunted each year, according to Ms Brisbane.\nAfter coming under attack by the chytrid fungus, the frog's population took a further hit by the passage of Tropical Storm Erika in 2015 and Hurricane Maria two years later.\n\"Our forests have essentially grown silent because of the absence of the mountain chicken voice, it was a huge part of our soundscape, of what put us to bed at night,\" Ms Brisbane says.\nSeveral partners, including ZSL and Dominica's forestry division, have come together as part of the Mountain Chicken Recovery Programme.\nDuring a population count conducted last year in parts of the island the frog was known to inhabit, only 21 frogs were found alive in the wild. \nResearchers at ZSL say that while the total number of mountain chicken frogs in Dominica's forest is probably higher than the 21 they located, it is unlikely to add up to more than 30.\n\"They were one of the apex predators on the island, so losing those has potential ripple effects in terms of pest control,\" says Benjamin Tapley, a Curator of Herpetology at ZSL.\nIn March, ZSL announced the appearance of six mountain chicken froglets at London Zoo, after two of the frogs that were brought from Montserrat successfully bred for the first time in five years.\nAno",
    "The Eurovision Song Contest has seen a chaotic build-up towards Saturday's grand final.\nThe Dutch entry has been disqualified, another has withdrawn from rehearsals and a third has broken rules with an on-stage speech, calling for peace.\nAnd two former contestants have pulled out of announcing the jury scores for their countries. \nThe drama is unfolding minute by minute against a backdrop of protests over Israel's participation in the show.\nAhead of the show, thousands of pro-Palestinian marchers gathered in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, where the contest is being held.\nSome chanted \"Eurovision, united by genocide,\" reflecting the strength of feeling over the humanitarian toll of Israel's military campaign in Gaza, which was triggered by the deadly Hamas attacks last October. \nEurovision, which has always billed itself as non-political, has resisted calls for Israel to be excluded from the contest. \nHowever, they did demand that the country's performer, Eden Golan, change the lyrics of her entry, titled Hurricane, to remove references to the 7 October attack. \nGolan, who is just 20 years old, is under armed guard as she prepares to sing at the contest, with heightened security throughout the host city.\nSeveral other competitors have stressed their opposition to the Israel-Gaza war, although none have pulled out - choosing to abide by Eurovision's slogan, \"united by music\".\nHowever, French contestant Slimane broke with protocol during the final dress rehearsal on Saturday afternoon, by interrupting his song to make an impassioned speech.\n\"Everybody, I just need to say something,\" he told the audience. \"Every artist here want[s] to sing about love and sing about peace. We need to be united by music, yes, but with love for peace. \n\"United by music, yes, but with love for peace,\" he repeated. \"Thank you so much. Thank you Europe.\"\nThe statement itself may have broken Eurovision's rules on making political statements. \nThe BBC has contacted the EBU, which organises the contest, to ascertain whether Slimane could be sanctioned. \nEarlier, the Irish contestant Bambie Thug withdrew entirely from the dress rehearsal, after raising a complaint about coverage of their performance on Israeli television. \nThe singer, who is non-binary, said comments made during coverage of their performance at Tuesday's semi-final breached the competition's rules. \nIsraeli TV station KAN referred to a \"controversy\" over Bambie Thug's song, whose lyrics reference witchcraft and the occult, then noted that the performer had \"spoken negatively about Israel\".\n\"But we can talk about that later,\" their commentator said. \"Prepare your curses.\"\nThe comment may have been a reference to a lyric in Bambie Thug's song, where they put a hex on an ex-boyfriend, but the singer felt it had crossed a line.\n\"I'm angry with other teams breaching their rules of the EBU, and still being allowed in,\" they told RT\u00c9 news in Ireland.\n\"I hope the EBU will address it correctly.\"\nIn a statement, the EBU said: \"We've spoken to KAN, the Israeli broadcaster, about this matter and reiterated the importance of all commentators respecting all the artists taking part in the competition and abiding by the rules and regulations of the event.\"\nIn a statement on Instagram, Bambie Thug said they were waiting \"patiently waiting to hear what action is set to be taken by the EBU following this rule break\" and that they \"hope to see you on the stage tonight\".\nIn response, a spokesperson for Israeli broadcaster Kan told the PA: \"We wish everyone the best of luck tonight.\"\nThe organisers of Eurovision said that the singer \"missed the dress rehearsal due to a situation that is currently being discussed with the EBU and song contest organisers\" and that they \"hope that this will be resolved shortly and Bambie Thug will appear in the Grand Final show as planned\". \nSeparately, the Dutch contestant, Joost Klein, has been removed from the competition after a backstage incident on Thursday.\nAn allegation of intimidation was made to Swedish police by a female member of the production crew. \nPolice said Klein had subsequently been interviewed for making \"unlawful threats\" and the case would \"go to the prosecutor within a few weeks\".\nEurovision organisers said \"it would not be appropriate for him to continue in the contest\" while the legal process takes place.\nIn a statement, the Dutch broadcaster Avrotros, said that Klein had been filmed backstage when he had \"repeatedly indicated\" that he did not want to be.\n\"This led to a threatening movement from Joost towards the camera. Joost did not touch the camerawoman,\" they added, calling the decision to disqualify him \"very heavy and disproportionate\".\nVideos have circulated on social media of Klein being surreptitiously filmed by the Israeli delegation - but the EBU stressed in their statement that the backstage incident  \"did not involve any other performer or delegation member\".\nNorwegian media is reporting that their jury spokesperson Allesandra Mele has pul",
    "Homeowners affected by a cheap version of concrete have held a protest outside the Scottish parliament calling for compensation and a public inquiry.\nReinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC) was used mostly in flat roofing, but also in floors and walls, between the 1950s and 1990s.\nIt has also been found in public buildings sparking fears about the potential collapse of ceilings and walls.\nAs a result many local authorities are now moving to inspect council houses.\nCurrent tenants are having their repair costs covered but many people who bought former council houses say they have no-one to turn to.\nRonnie and Rosalind Bell, both 76, discovered their house in Chestnut Grove, Livingston, West Lothian, contained RAAC in January - 16 years after they bought it.\nRosalind told BBC Scotland News: \"You\u2019re living in fear that the roof is going to collapse, or the sides are going to come in. You just don\u2019t know.\"\nThe couple are calling for similarly affected homeowners to receive an alternative safe house or adequate compensation for their home.\nRosalind said: \u201cThey\u2019re decanting all the council tenants and we\u2019re going to be left with the houses boarded up, which could mean vandalism or vermin or damp coming through from next-door.\n\u201cOur house was built in 1961-63 and only had a 30-year lifespan. They should never have been sold at all.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cWe\u2019ve contacted the government and MPs and we get told it\u2019s not their problem. We get told that we\u2019re the homeowners, so it\u2019s on us.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t get building insurance. Obviously we have home insurance but you wonder - are they going to pay out if the roof falls in?\u201d\nRonnie said he was \u201cdisgusted\u201d with the situation and the couple felt unsafe in their own home.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve bought in good faith what\u2019s going to be our last home ever,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we passed on, we were going to sell it and give it to the kids.\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t now because it\u2019s worthless. We\u2019ve paid off our mortgage - and for what?\u201d\nRosalind added: \u201cYou really work hard and at the end of the day, nobody wants to help us. And we\u2019re having to fight now.\n\u201cTo put supports in for our house, you\u2019re looking at about \u00a350,000.\n\u201cWhere are we going to get that? We\u2019re 76-years-old, we don\u2019t have that kind of money.\u201d\nYvonne Middlemass bought her home in Chestnut Grove in 2017 after her husband retired.\n\u201cWe would never have moved there if we had an inkling that anything was wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were never advised of anything, it wasn\u2019t in any paperwork. So it was very recent.\u201d\nShe joined the protest to push for the government to step in and help the homeowners facing huge bills to address RAAC in their house.\n\"We\u2019re being advised to get our own structural engineers, but we don\u2019t have the money for that,\" she said.\n\"So we\u2019re left in limbo and we don\u2019t know if the roof is going to come in. \n\"My husband is a pensioner and I don\u2019t work due to ill health. What are we meant to do?\u201d\nWilson Chowdhry, from the UK RAAC Campaign Group, is calling on the Scottish government to take responsibility for the RAAC in homes across the country and compensate home owners.\nHe said his daughter bought a house in Aberdeen only to discover within two months that RAAC had been dound in the roof.\nMr Chowdhry added: \u201cWe started the campaign and it grew into something nationwide when we discovered it affected many other homeowners across the UK.\n\u201cThe only solution is to fund these homeowners, provide new roofs, or at least provide them with new homes.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWe want the government to initiate a public inquiry and look at how councils have dealt with RAAC since the beginning, how they\u2019ve dealt with homeowners and the process they followed since they discovered it, as they\u2019ve had early warnings since the 90s.\u201d\nA spokesman for the Scottish government said it took building safety \"very seriously\".\nHe said: \"The Scottish government\u2019s cross sector working group continues to meet regularly to ensure knowledge and best practice can be shared across those sectors affected by RAAC and we continue to engage with local authorities and social landlords to understand the extent of RAAC. \n\"We want everyone in Scotland to be safe in their homes, workplaces and other buildings.\u201d",

It should stay the course on the road to Europe,\" she posted on X.\nBut the Georgian Dream government has defended the bill, saying it will \"boost transparency\" over NGOs' foreign funding. It aims to sign the measure into law by mid-May.\nIf adopted, the law would require that any independent NGO and media organisation receiving more than 20% of its funding from abroad to register as an \"organisation pursuing the interests of a foreign power\".\nBut the protesters fear it could be used to crush critical voices ahead of parliamentary elections later this year.\nThe bill cleared its second parliamentary stage by a margin of 83 votes to 23. After a third reading, it has to be signed by President Salome Zurabishvili, who has vowed to veto it - although Georgian Dream has sufficient numbers in parliament to overrule her.\nIn 2023, mass street protests forced Georgian Dream to drop plans for similar measures.",

Great Victoria Street Station re-opened in September 1995.\nThere is no exact date yet for the opening of the new bus and rail ",
    "Brian Cox has said that being part of one of TV's biggest hit shows has taken away a cherished part of him.\nThe veteran actor is nominated in the leading actor category for a Bafta TV Award for the Sky Atlantic juggernaut Succession.\nThe programme has won numerous gongs, including a Golden Globe.\nBut while he is grateful for the recognition, he told BBC Scotland News it has come at a price.\n\"One thing I have lost is my anonymity, which I prized,\" he said.\n\"It is a double-edged sword. The success, I am not going to knock it, but at the same time everybody knows who I am now. \n\"People would say you're...? I loved the fact people didn't know what to say because I had done so much variation. \n\"But now Logan Roy is it, as far as the general public is concerned.\"\nThe 77-year-old Dundonian has enjoyed an illustrious career on stage and screen, with accolades including two Laurence Olivier Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and a Golden Globe Award to show for it.\nBut it is his latest high-profile role as the head of the Roy family that has made him a worldwide household name.\nHe said: \"I have done more than 200 films altogether so it was just another role, but it was a great one.\n\"He always made his punch. There was nothing elaborate about Logan - what you saw was what you got - whether you liked it or not.\"\nCox speaks fondly of his time on Succession.\n\"It was [a] great time, one of the best jobs, ever - no question - particularly because of the ensemble. It was a great cast to work with.\n\"We are close as a family and it was one of the happiest jobs ever.\"\nSo happy, in fact, that members of the cast recently flew to London to watch him on stage in Long Day's Journey Into Night.\nHe has also been spotted watching Succession daughter Sarah Snook in her London stage production of The Picture Of Dorian Gray.\nThe nomination at Sunday's Bafta TV Awards was a pleasant surprise.\n\"I thought that's gone and I'd moved on. But Logan keeps popping back up whether I like it or not,\" he said.\n\"I have won so many awards connected to the show but it would be great to win something on one's home turf as it were. But I treat these things with a dash of salt - I don't take them too seriously.\n\"It's nice to get awards but it's not about that, it's about doing the work.\"\nCox is nominated alongside several Scots.\nDavid Tennant is in the male comedy performance category for his Amazon Prime show Good Omens and Jack Lowden is up for supporting actor in Apple TV's Slow Horses .\nCox said: \"David has proved this with his Shakespeare work and great TV work. Jack is an amazing young actor who I think will go far.\"\nBut it is daytime queen Lorraine Kelly who gains his ultimate respect.\nThe 64-year-old Scots host will receive a Special Award to mark her long career in television.\n\"Lorraine, for me, is genuinely unique,\" he said. \n\"She is one of the warmest human beings ever. That comes across, that's her lasting quality and that is why finally she is being recognised in the way she deserves to be recognised. \n\"There's only one Lorraine Kelly and she is pretty special.\"\nThe same could be said for Brian Cox.

    "There were times when musician Vince Freeman's dream of finishing his debut album seemed impossible. The platinum-selling artist suffered six years of debilitating pain due to a spinal injury which left him unable to hold his baby son and then the Covid pandemic happened. But after successful treatment he has finally completed his first UK tour and finished his album.\nVince's career was at a high after competing in The Voice 2012 and releasing a hit single.\nThe singer, who lives in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, said he was \"just going out and doing as many gigs as possible\", averaging about 300 shows a year.\nHe had won the UK Indie Awards in 2008, beating the likes of Jamie Woon, Newton Faulkner and Ed Sheeran. \nThen, four years later, he was asked to go on the first ever series of The Voice, which he followed up with single The Singer, which charted at number two in Germany.\n\"I finally sort of felt like I was starting to get somewhere,\" he said.\nBut around 2015, aged 37, two severely prolapsed discs and an osteo-degenerative condition left him unable to do the most basic of daily tasks, let alone organise a tour. \n\"I just found that over a period of time I was more frequently coming home and saying to my wife, 'my back hurts',\" said Vince.\n\"It got to a point where it was more than just moaning.\"\nHe collapsed one morning and ended up in hospital.\nVince's injuries left him on morphine \"24/7\" and \"a whole cocktail of drugs\", as well as needing regular surgery.\n\"You kind of become your worst version of yourself,\" he said.\nThe musician could not drive or carry his equipment to gigs, so he had to hire someone to do this for him. He also had to walk with a stick at times.\n\"Day to day was awful,\" he said.\n\"I couldn't even carry Rory [his son] for the first 12 months of his life.\"\nAfter six years and a period of osteopathy, Vince finally started recovering and one day the pain was gone.\n\"I just was sobbing,\" he said.\nThings were looking up. Vince received a platinum disc for performing vocals on Sun is Shining by Lost Frequencies.\nHe said: \"I got asked to do a writing session for Alicia Keys' team before the Brits, and I remember saying to my wife, 'I've made it. I've done it. I finally got my toe in'.\n\"And then, like literally two weeks later, the whole world shut down. I feel like I lost 10 years.\"\nThe Covid pandemic left Vince, like many musicians, unable to play gigs.\nUndeterred, the artist bought a coffee truck and travelled around local events.\nOne day, at a festival, by luck he ended up selling coffee to an entertainment lawyer.\nThis led Vince to finding his manager and writing his debut album, Scars, Ghosts and Glory, which explores his journey over the years, including his six years spent in severe pain.\n\"I've never been prouder of anything that I've ever done,\" he said.\nThe album is due out in the summer.\nNow, he has a team in the US and one in the UK and has just completed his first country-wide tour - something he had been waiting so long to do.\n\"I just loved every single minute of it,\" he said, adding he was \"thrilled to be back out on the road\".\nVince said: \"It's wonderful to be able to sit at the table with my kids.

    "The burger giant McDonald's has submitted plans for a second drive-through restaurant on the outskirts of Dumfries in the south of Scotland.\nIt already operates one in the Lochside area - but now wants to open another near the Annan Road, close to the town's bypass.\nPlanning regulations dictate that an assessment must be carried out of potential town centre sites before developing at an out-of-town location.\nThe fast food firm has ruled out a wide variety of buildings or land in Dumfries before settling on its preferred location.\nBut what were the places that it found unsuitable or unavailable?\nRetailers Spar had an outlet on the Whitesands in Dumfries for many years.\nHowever, the site - with a post office counter inside - closed its doors in 2022.\nAn assessment carried out for McDonald's found the building was too big for its needs and also without the scope to accommodate a drive-through lane.\nIt said there was no potential to convert the building and even with demolition and redevelopment it was \"unclear\" whether the project would be acceptable in design or transport terms.\nThe property is now occupied by a gym.\nA category A-listed building on Nith Place was looked at as a potential location.\nThe baroque town house - probably built in the middle of the 18th Century - was more recently used as offices.\nHistoric Environment Scotland notes that it was built for Archibald Malcolm who was town clerk when Bonnie Prince Charlie visited Dumfries in 1745.\nMcDonald's ruled the site out as having too little ground floor space and noted that due to its historic significance demolition would not be supported \"except in exceptional circumstances\".\nDumfries has been without a large-screen cinema since the Odeon on Shakespeare Street closed its doors in 2018.\nThe building was left empty last year when the bingo club which continued to operate on the site also shut.\nIt too fell foul of insufficient floor space and was found to have no dedicated parking available or space for a drive-through lane.\nA former discount store on the town's Irish Street hit the headlines in 2018 when cannabis plants with a potential street value of about \u00a3300,000 were discovered inside.\nThe former Original Factory Shop - close to the sheriff court - had been empty for a number of years.\nThe assessment carried out for McDonald's found it also lacked sufficient ground floor space.\nQuestions were also raised about whether a drive-through would be an acceptable form of development in the area.\nThe former Home and Floor Store - once Blacklock and Farries book shop - on Church Crescent was also considered.\nIt was found to be \"significantly larger\" than the company would need.\nIn addition, it was concluded that its layout - over multiple floors - would not meet McDonald's \"operational requirements\".\nIt was also concluded not to be suitable for its plans.\nA range of other sites were also examined, including a former furniture superstore in Friars Vennel, units at the Cuckoo Bridge retail park, land at the Peel Centre and a vacant greenfield site at Heathhall.\nNone of them was found to be suitable and, after a \"comprehensive\" assessment, the company concluded there were no sites nearer the town centre which would suit its plans. \nIt has now settled on the Annan Road plot as its preferred one for a multi-million pound development it says will create the equivalent of 80 full-time jobs.\nDumfries and Galloway Council's planning committee will be asked to approve the scheme in due course.",
    "An historic tree, believed to be 500 years old, has fallen in Savernake Forest.\nThe Crockmere Oak was a well-known sight for generations of people visiting the woodland.\nIt was previously described as being in \"fair condition\" despite some rotting at its base. \n\"It is likely that the Crockmere Oak fell in one of the storms earlier this year,\" Becky Morris from Forestry England said.\n\"Although it is always sad to see one of Savernake\u2019s amazing veterans fall, it is a normal part of a tree\u2019s lifecycle, as is the rot you saw in the trunk - hollowing is one of the distinctive characteristics that defines a veteran tree.\n\"The likelihood of a tree coming down is influenced by many factors, including the weather it has to endure, the depth of its roots, any protection offered by neighbouring trees, and the size of the tree\u2019s own canopy, which can act like a sail in high winds,\" she added.\nThe oak is among 4,000 trees in the protected forest, with some dating back to the time of William the Conqueror.\nThe tree has fallen alongside a footpath that leads off into one of the avenues on the site, but there are no plans to remove it.\n\"I'm afraid we don't know exactly how old or tall Crockmere Oak is but, even on the ground, it will remain part of the forest\u2019s ecosystem for decades to come,\" Ms Morris said. \n\"As long as they are safe, fallen trees remain on the forest floor as important deadwood habitat. Deadwood supports saproxylic species, which are those that depend on dead or dying wood, such as fungi and invertebrates.\"\nSavernake is a surviving remnant of one of Wiltshire's ancient Royal Forests that dates back one thousand years. \nNow the forest is leased to the Forestry Commission and access is via many paths and tracks. Covering 4,500 acres, it is a Special Site of Scientific Interest (SSSI).\nIt also remains a place of mystery and imagination for visitors and an important diverse habitat for a number of wild birds, plants and animals. \nForestry England said it was working to extend the longevity of Savernake's veteran trees and not only the few that had been named.\n\"Our management plan also includes nurturing the next 'generation' of veterans that will succeed the current veterans in time.\n\"The long-term resilience of Savernake's veteran tree community is a high priority,\" Ms Morris said.",
    "The term \"as easy as riding a bike\" is often used when doing something which once learned, is not forgotten.\nAnd that was true - mostly - for Billy McDermott, who rediscovered cycling at the age of 72.\nEvery Wednesday he attends a cycling class at the Clyde Cycle Park with local charity group, LEAP.\nIt has been about 55 years since he rode a bike, but now thanks to the park, he is back on the saddle again.\nThe Clyde Cycle Park in Cambuslang is a project that has been developed over the last seven years.\nLocated on the south bank of the River Clyde, the previously derelict land is now home to a 250m (820ft) cycle circuit, an area for bike storage and a reception building.\nThe park has been operating for around 18 months, with different groups taking turns using the track daily.\nThey have a range of cycle programmes including 'on yer bike' coaching sessions, Rock up and Ride - a government scheme that offers deprived children free bikes after completing sessions - and autism cycle days.\nBilly found the park after seeing an advert at the local charity he works at, LEAP.\nLEAP provides services and activities for older people across Lanarkshire. There, Billy helps people with tasks they can't do, like building furniture and fitting lightbulbs.\nBilly retired two years ago at the age of 70, after working at Scottish Water for 35 years.\nWhen Billy first arrived at the park, he was measured for a bike. He describes himself on the new wheels as \"like a drunk man\". \n\"I hadn\u2019t been on a bike for 55 years so I thought, I\u2019m going to give it a go,\" said Billy.\n\"I always saw people whizzing by and it just looked that good. One of the first things I noticed when I was out on the bike going round the track was the wind in my face.\"\nFrom that moment, he was hooked and started to see progress within a month.\nBilly recalls getting his first brand-new bike aged 12.\n\"Before that it was probably second hand bikes or hand-me-downs,\" he said. \"I finished school when I was 15 and probably stopped cycling. I went to work straight away.\"\nBilly says the cycling group is \"something to look forward to\".\nHe said he couldn't believe he was given a bike for free.\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s given me an extra bit of health,\" he said. \"It's good for the mind, speaking to more people in the group is definitely a benefit.\"\nJohn Bachtler is the chairman of Clyde Cycle Park and Cambuslang Community Council.\nHe says the park has become popular quite quickly and believes the project is important for the community.\n\"The community here is Cambuslang has quite a lot of areas where particularly young people wouldn\u2019t get an opportunity to cycle.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not just young people. We\u2019re providing cycle coaching for all age groups.  We work with disability groups and we\u2019ve got adaptive bikes. We do Scottish bike trials coaching, so it\u2019s across the spectrum.\"\nThe aim of the cycle park is to create a national standard facility that will serve the West of Scotland, provide opportunities for road racing, cycle cross and other forms of cycling.\nSo far, the park has received funding to develop the first 250m (820ft) circuit. This came from the Scottish government under a programme called Clyde Mission, aimed at developing areas along the River Clyde.\nThey have also received funding from South Lanarkshire Council and private sponsors. \nFor the next phase of the development, which will cost cost \u00a31.4m, they are planning to develop a 1km circuit.\nJohn believes cycling is a great way to get about.\nHe said: \"It doesn\u2019t just keep you fit, it contributes to wellbeing more generally. Particularly here in Cambuslang you can commute into town along the national cycle route along the river.\n\"Even before we were trying to reduce carbon emissions, it was an important part of life and now we really need to move away from cars as much as possible.\"\nAt the end of last year, Scottish Cycling awarded the park their 2023 Recreational Cycling Award, as a tribute to the promotion of cycling that they offer to people in the community. \nThe team at the park is made up of coaches and volunteers.\nDuncan Stark, 68, is a member of the Cambuslang Community Council and volunteers at the the cycle park.\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s great for the community, I mean this was derelict land for years. The people from LEAP have been great.  \n\"They\u2019ve been coming down since summer and you just see the difference in what it\u2019s done to them; their fitness and mental wellbeing and how well they\u2019ve developed.\"",

    "Millwall FC has reached what it calls a \"landmark development agreement\" with Lewisham Council which grants the club a 999-year lease for its home ground.\nThe deal means the club will remain at The Den after years of uncertainty about its future in south Bermondsey.\nMillwall's CEO Steve Kavanagh said it was \"incredible news for the football club and everyone associated with it\".\nMayor of Lewisham Brenda Dacres said: \"We are delighted to have reached a positive outcome.\" \nMillwall said the decision \"allows the club to move forward with its exciting ambitions for the redevelopment of the land surrounding The Den, bringing to life the club's long-term plans of the wider regeneration of New Bermondsey\".\nThe Lions previously said the club was considering moving away from its base in south-east London. \nThe current lease has 120 years remaining but restricts potential development.\nIn 2017, Lewisham Council abandoned a controversial compulsory purchase order, which the club said would have jeopardised its future.\nMillwall's chairman, James Berylson, said: \"We are delighted that Lewisham Council has offered Millwall Football Club a new, long lease that will permit us to bring forward development plans in New Bermondsey for residential accommodation, a new community, and an ambitious football club.\n\"My family's involvement with Millwall goes back almost 20 years.

    "The Socialists of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez have won Catalonia's regional election as pro-independence parties lost ground.\nThe Catalan Socialist Party (PSC), under former Spanish health minister Salvador Illa, made substantial gains to emerge as the clear winner.\nWith 99% of votes counted, it has secured 42 seats.\nSupport for independence has dropped to 42%, from 49% in 2017, says the Catalan government's statistics institute. \nIn the campaign ahead of this election, the issue of Catalonia's relationship with the rest of Spain was pushed into the background by other challenges, such as the region's drought and housing crisis.\nThe hardline Together for Catalonia (JxCat) party of the former regional president Carles Puigdemont was second, with 35 seats, recovering its status as the primary pro-independence force in the region ahead of the Catalan Republican Left (ERC). \nBut overall, nationalist parties lost support, meaning they no longer control the regional parliament, in a blow for the independence movement.\nEven so, pro-independence parties have wrung substantial concessions from the central government in recent years and continue to demand a referendum on independence.\nThe minority ERC government of Pere Aragon\u00e8s called the snap election after failing to gather enough support to pass the region's annual budget.\nMr S\u00e1nchez will see this result as vindication of his policies in Catalonia - in particular, a controversial amnesty law benefiting nationalists who face legal action for separatist activity. \nThe amnesty, which is concluding its passage through the Spanish parliament, has drawn a fierce backlash from opponents on the right.\nMr Illa hailed the result as \"a new era for Catalonia\". He said that among the factors which had secured the result \"were the policies implemented by the Spanish government and its prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, to whom I send my acknowledgement and thanks\".\nThe amnesty law was a condition of the parliamentary support that JxCat and ERC gave to Mr S\u00e1nchez in his investiture, allowing him to form a new central government last November. \nMr Puigdemont, who fled abroad in 2017 after leading a failed secession bid, is expected to benefit from the amnesty and return to Spain. He campaigned ahead of this election from the south of France.\nDespite the Socialist win, it will not be easy for Mr Illa to form a government, given that he is likely to need the support of ERC and the far-left Comuns Sumar alliance.\nMr Puigdemont called for ERC not to be part of a coalition that included the unionist PSC. Instead, he suggested the two main pro-independence parties should try to form an administration, as they had done in the past before their relationship broke down.\n\"If ERC is willing to rebuild bridges, so are we,\" Mr Puigdemont said.\nHowever, the fragmented nature of the Catalan parliament, which is split by unionist-separatist allegiances as well as a left-right division, is likely to make post-election negotiations lengthy. If a new administration is not formed, there will be a repeat election.\nThe conservative People's Party (PP) made substantial gains to become the fourth party in Catalonia, followed by the far-right Vox. By contrast, the self-styled centrists of Ciudadanos lost their representation in the parliament, just seven years after becoming the region's primary force.\nMeanwhile, a new far-right party, Catalan Alliance, won two seats on the back of its uncompromising platform based on separatism and anti-immigrant policies.",
    "Workers for some suppliers of Chinese fast fashion giant Shein are still working 75 hours a week, despite the company promising to improve conditions, a report suggests.\nA new investigation by Swiss advocacy group Public Eye has followed up on its 2021 report, which found a number of staff across six sites in Guangzhou were doing excessive overtime.\nAccording to the group, who interviewed 13 employees from six factories in China supplying Shein for its latest investigation, excessive overtime was still common for many workers.\nShein told the BBC it was \"working hard\" to address the matters raised by the Public Eye report and had made \"significant progress on enhancing conditions\". \nShein has grown rapidly since it was founded in 2008, and was one of many online businesses to boom during the Covid pandemic lockdowns.\nIts formula of offering a wide range of cheap clothes - backed up with campaigns on Instagram, TikTok and other social media - has turned it into one of the biggest fashion retailers in the world.\nIt relies on thousands of third-party suppliers, as well as contract manufacturers, near its headquarters in Guangzhou, and is able to turn around a new item in a matter of weeks, rather than months.\nHowever, an employee who has worked at sewing machines for 20 years told Public Eye: \u201cI work every day from 8 in the morning to 10.30 at night and take one day off each month. I can\u2019t afford any more days off because it costs too much.\"\nThe 13 factory employees were interviewed in the summer of 2023.\nInterviewees worked at production sites west of Nancun Village in the Guangzhou area in southern China.\nPublic Eye did not return to Nancun itself, which was the location of the original interviews, claiming \"the atmosphere was too risky\" due to media attention from its initial report.\nInterviewees, aged between 23 and 60, said they worked 12-hour days on average, which did not include breaks for lunch and dinner.\nThey said they usually work six to seven days a week.\nShein's Code of Conduct for its suppliers states that workers should not work longer than 60 hours a week, including overtime.\nThe brand acknowledged this was a long-term issue when Public Eye first raised it in 2021.\nIn its response to the latest report, Shein said long working hours in the sector were a \"common challenge that brands, manufacturers, and other ecosystem players must work together to address\".\nIt added that this was not a problem unique to Shein, but said it was \"committed to playing our part to improve the situation in our own supply chain\".\n\nWorkers also claimed their wages had hardly changed since the first investigation and fluctuate between 6,000 to 10,000 yuan per month (\u00a3663 to \u00a31,104 a month).\nPublic Eye says the basic wage for workers after deducting overtime pay is 2,400 yuan (\u00a3265).\nAccording to the Asia Floor Wage Alliance, a living wage in China is around 6,512 yuan (\u00a3719).\nInterviewees claimed if they made a mistake, they would have to make any alterations to the clothes unpaid.\n\u201cWhoever makes the mistake is responsible for putting it right. You have to fix the problem in your own working time,\" a 50-year-old supervisor told the investigation.\nWorkers also claimed to have noticed a rise in surveillance cameras in the factories, and said they believed the footage was sent to Shein in real time so regulations could be enforced.\nPublic Eye also said it observed toddlers being babysat in the factories, teenagers packaging items and a smoking ban not being enforced.\nIn a statement to the BBC, Shein said it was investing tens of millions of dollars \"in strengthening governance and compliance across our supply chain\".\n\"We are actively working to improve our suppliers\u2019 practices, including ensuring that hours worked are voluntary and that workers are compensated fairly for what they do, and also recognise the importance of industry collaboration to ensure continuous improvement and progress in this area,\" it said.\n\"As a result of our efforts, research we have conducted with our third party auditors has found that workers at Shein supplier facilities in China earn basic salaries that are significantly higher than the average local minimum wage. \u201d\nShein told Public Eye that suppliers were required to ensure they met local laws and regulations governing wages and working hours.\n\"Where violations [of our governance policies] are found, we take firm action... [including] termination of the business relationship.\"\nWith regards to surveillance cameras, Shein told Public Eye that suppliers made their own decisions to install cameras in their facilities, and the company did not have access to suppliers\u2019 security camera feeds or footage.\nRegarding children in factories, the company told Public Eye: \"We strictly do not tolerate child labour. We treat any violations with utmost severity.\"\nIt acknowledged that some factory staff faced a challenge of balancing work and childcare, which \"can result in workers bringing their children to thei",

    "Russia is blaming a Ukrainian strike after an entire section of an apartment building collapsed following an explosion in Belgorod. \nCCTV from the scene shows a large blast near the base of the 10-storey block and then the building falling in. \nThe regional governor said two bodies had been pulled from the rubble. At least 19 people have been injured.\nThe Russian city is near the border with Kharkiv in Ukraine, where Moscow's troops launched an offensive on Friday.\nThe Belgorod region has often been targeted by Ukrainian forces since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but previously Ukrainian officials have said cross-border strikes do not target civilians.\nThe regional governor of Belgorod, Vyacheslav Gladkov, accused Ukraine of bombarding the region, describing the cause of the explosion as a Ukrainian shell.\nKyiv has cast doubt on that account, with one official suggesting it may have been a guided bomb dropped by a Russian plane, intended for Ukraine, but whose glide wings hadn't opened. \nPictures from the scene show rescuers removing debris by hand in a search for survivors. Surrounding apartments have been evacuated due to fears of the main building collapsing further. \nMr Gladkov added that people are believed to be trapped in the rubble.\nOne resident told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti her husband was in their bedroom in the building when the blast went off and was injured in the head and face. \"He did not have the time\" to escape, she said.\nA spokesperson for the Russian Investigative Committee said a criminal case has been launched.\nThe incident comes as \"intense battles\" continue just across the border in north-eastern Ukraine, where Russian forces have made incursions into the Kharkiv region.\nIn his evening address on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Russian offensive has displaced thousands. \n\"The idea behind the attacks in the Kharkiv region is to stretch our forces and undermine the morale and motivation of the Ukrainians' ability to defend themselves,\" he added.\nThe defence ministry in Moscow claims its forces have captured a number of villages there, while Kyiv says it has been carrying out counter-attacks.",
    "A teenage gamer with half a million YouTube followers says social media changed his life after he was sent \u00a310,000 by world-renowned content creator MrBeast.\nTom Gardiner - known as ReniDrag on YouTube - began streaming videos of himself gaming in 2017.\nBut the 18-year-old from Aberdare, Rhondda Cynon Taf, was inspired to make it a full-time career when he was set a series of gaming challenges by MrBeast in a \"surreal\" streaming experience.\nHe now earns up to \u00a325,000 a month and has been able to treat his family to holidays, a hot tub, and buy himself a car.\nMrBeast, who has more than 250 million YouTube subscribers, is the platform\u2019s current highest earner, and famous for hosting large giveaways and competitions.\n\"I felt so lucky,\" said Tom. \"Honestly, YouTube has changed my life.\"\nTom was initially inspired by his favourite content creators, such as PewDiePie, DanTDM and DougDoug.\nHe said: \"I had so much passion for editing and making videos. Even if no-one watched it - I didn't care.\n\"It was just a hobby at that point and I was really enjoying it.\"\nThe \"incredible turning point\" came in March 2021, as he was finishing Year 11 and getting ready to start sixth form.\nHe was streaming every day, and people would watch and donate to his account.\n\"Anyone can be in your chat box, people are watching you play, and they can donate, like a tip jar,\" he explained.\n\"But MrBeast is crazy, he takes that to the extreme.\"\nThe YouTube star \"jumped into my live stream randomly\", Tom said, and initially donated \u00a3700.\n\"Minecraft is all about mining, and the challenge was to find a diamond,\" he continued.\n\"I think I had a minute against the clock.\n\"He then donated another \u00a32,000 and set me the challenge to create a portal and I was able to do that too.\"\nIn total, MrBeast gave Tom $14,000 - then about \u00a310,000. \nHe was featured as part of one of MrBeast\u2019s videos, in a series where he gave fellow gamers extravagant donations and recorded their reactions - a video which has had 70 million views.\n\"The whole thing really inspired me to knuckle down and work hard to try and become a YouTuber full-time,\" Tom said.\n\"Before then, it was pocket money, something to do on the side. MrBeast\u2019s connection didn\u2019t give me much exposure, but it gave me the boost. And it snowballed from there.\"\nTom said his most profitable month so far saw him earn about \u00a325,000, but people he knew were earning as much as \u00a3300,000 a month.\n\"I like to think I\u2019ve been responsible and put most of it away. You never know what the future holds and I could never take this for granted,\" he said.\nBut he has splashed out on an upcoming family holiday to Florida, bought himself a car, and invested in a hot tub for his family home.\n\"That was probably my biggest purchase, and something my parents were like \u2018wink wink, nudge nudge\u2019.\"\nBut with the rewards come challenges, and Tom said a big one was having to stay \"relevant\" and \"trendy\" on YouTube.\n\"Trying to stay fresh is a massive thing because you are on this YouTube treadmill,\" he said.\nGav Murphy, from Maesycwmmer, Caerphilly county, produces videos and podcasts for his own film company.\nHe said people \"underestimate the amount of work that goes on behind the scenes\" of a YouTube career, and finding a niche was important, as well as \"making something you care about\".\n\"I think the worst thing possible is to go chasing subscribers or make content that other people are doing, because you think it will do well. The audience will see through that.\"\nTom\u2019s next goal is to hit a million subscribers, as well as travel more and meet other gamers at conventions.\n\"When people ask me why you\u2019d want to watch other people play games, I always compare it to sport. Why do we watch other people play sports? It\u2019s very similar in that sense,\" he said.\nHis love for games started with just an Xbox, and he said people should not be put off by lack of equipment.\n\u201cWhen it progressed into more of a career, I bought more stuff, but you don\u2019t need an over-the-top super set-up.\n\u201cHonestly, just a computer and a microphone and the sky's the limit.\"",
    "The Foreign Office is investigating a claim by Hamas that a British-Israeli hostage has died in Gaza.\nHamas, proscribed as a terrorist group by the UK government, claims Nadav Popplewell died of wounds sustained in an Israeli airstrike more than a month ago. \nMr Popplewell, 51, was seized with his mother Channah Peri on 7 October when fighters crossed the border fence and launched deadly attacks in Israel.\nThe Israeli military is yet to comment.\nA Foreign Office spokesperson said it was urgently seeking more information on the matter.\nIt added that the department's thoughts \"are with his family at this extremely distressing time.\"\nIn a brief statement via the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the family of Mr Popplewell asked media organisations not to publish footage of him released by Hamas on Saturday, which shows him in captivity with a black eye.\nSpeaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday morning, Foreign Secretary David Cameron confirmed that he had seen the video, but gave no further updates on the investigations.\n\"We don't want to say anything until we have better information,\" Lord Cameron said.\nHe described Hamas as \"callous\", to release the video and \"play with the family's emotions in that way\".\nMr Popplewell's sister Ayelet Svatitzky told the BBC last October how gunmen had attacked the kibbutz in southern Israel where they lived, killing her older brother Roi.\nOn the day of the attack, Ms Svatitzky said she received two pictures, sent by the attackers from her mother's phone, showing the pair sitting in her mother's living room. Underneath was written \"Hamas\" in English.\nHours later, a third picture was posted on her mother's Facebook showing them with an armed Hamas gunman in the corner.\nMs Svatitzky's mother was released last November during a temporary ceasefire agreed between Hamas and Israel.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities.\nMore than 34,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nIsrael says 128 hostages are unaccounted for.",
    "A horrible tragedy has singed two families, left three people dead and sent seven people to jail in India.\nThe incident on the night of 18 March in the northern city of Prayagraj (formerly Allahabad) has also sent shockwaves through the residents of two crowded middle-class neighbourhoods.\nWarning: This piece contains details that some may find distressing.\n\"It was around 11pm when about 60-70 people turned up at our home. They started beating us mercilessly,\" says Shivani Kesarwani.\nThe intruders, she says, included family members and relatives of Anshika, her brother Anshu's wife, who had been found hanging at the Kesarwani home an hour earlier. \nShivani and the police say Anshika died by suicide - but her family and neighbours allege that she was murdered for dowry.\nThe Kesarwanis had a family business dealing in timber and lived in a joint family. The ground floor and the basement were taken up by the shop and the warehouse and the family lived above it. Each floor had one bedroom - Anshu lived on the top floor with his wife since their marriage a year back, his parents lived on the first floor and his sister Shivani had the second floor.\n\"Anshika usually came down around 8pm for dinner but on that day, she didn't show up and we thought she must have fallen asleep,\" Shivani told the BBC.\nWhen her brother came up from the store at 10pm, she said, he went up to call his wife.\n\"When his knocks and calls went unanswered, he broke a glass pane above the door to release the lock. He found Anshika dead. He screamed and all of us went rushing up.\"\nAnshu and his uncle reported the death to the police station, less than half a kilometre from their home, and Anshika's parents were informed.\nLess than an hour later, police say, Anshika's family turned up along with dozens of relatives and within minutes, an ugly fight is said to have broken out between the families.\nOn her mobile phone, Shivani shows us videos of men shouting, hitting each other with wooden sticks. A policeman stands in the middle, trying - and failing - to bring order.\nOnce Anshika's body was taken out of the house, police say her relatives set fire to the house.\nThe timber, stored in the ground floor and basement, burned furiously, trapping Shivani, her parents and an aunt in the house.\nShivani and her aunt broke the window of the second floor and crawled to safety in the adjoining house which belongs to her uncle. Her parents were not so lucky.\nWhen firefighters, who took more than three hours to put out the blaze, entered the house around 3am, they found the elderly couple's charred bodies.\n\"My mother was found sitting on the steps. She was carried to the mortuary in a sack,\" says Shivani, wiping her tears.\nShivani's complaint to the police names 12 members of Anshika's family and \"60-70 unknown people\".\nA police official told the BBC that seven people, including Anshika's father and uncle and their sons, have since been arrested and remain in jail.\nThey say Anshika's father has lodged a counter-complaint accusing \"Anshu, his parents and sisters\" of harassing his daughter for dowry and murdering her.\nShivani denies the accusations against her family, although she admits that they had received gifts, including a car, from Anshika's family at the wedding. \"They gave whatever they wanted to their daughter. We didn't ask for anything,\" she says.\nAnshu has not returned home since the night his wife died. \"He's in hiding because with most of Anshika's relatives out of jail, he fears for his life,\" she adds.\nDowries - both giving and accepting - have been illegal in India since 1961, but 90% of Indian marriages still involve them, according to a recent study.\nPolice receive thousands of complaints of harassment of wives every year and crime data shows 35,493 brides were killed in India between 2017 and 2022 for bringing in insufficient dowry.\nBut this kind of supposed gruesome revenge in a case of alleged dowry death is unheard of.\nShivani, who is now living with her uncle's family next door, takes us for a walk through what - until recently - used to be her home. The remnants of that night's tragedy are strewn about everywhere. The walls are blackened with soot and the floor is covered in thick ash, dotted with metal pots and pans and burnt out skeletal remains of furniture.\n\"I want justice. My life is ruined, my home and family are gone. I want a free and fair investigation and everyone who's found guilty must be punished,\" she says, adding, \"Why did they burn the house down? How would we find any evidence now?\"\nShe's also angry with the police. \"There were at least two dozen policemen outside our home but no-one went in to save my parents. They just stood and watched,\" she alleges.\nPolice strongly contest the accusation. \"It was a sensitive issue and emotions were running high. We were focused on removing the body from the scene and taking it to hospital for post-mortem. Our aim was to reduce the crowd and defuse the situation,\" a senior police off",
    "Increasing the number of Senedd members is a \"full stop\" that will future proof Welsh devolution for the next 100 years, according to its presiding officer.\nMembers of the Senedd (MSs) voted last week to increase their numbers from 60 to 96 from the next Welsh election, in 2026.\nElin Jones said the reforms which were backed by a cross-party majority of MSs but opposed by the Conservatives, made the Senedd a \"fit for purpose\" parliament, even if Wales were to become independent.\nSpeaking to the BBC Walescast podcast, Ms Jones said the vote, which coincided with the 25th anniversary of the first elections to Cardiff Bay, was \"hugely significant - and a long time in coming\".\n\"It rectifies, probably, the wrong of 1999, where we were too few members in that very first assembly.\n\"We should have had a higher number of members then so we've had to wait and develop the argument and rectify that wrong.\n\"And now, finally, in the same week as we celebrate our 25 years of existence as a parliament, we are also taking the next step to make this a fit for purpose parliament for the next 25 years - I'd even say the next 100 years.\"\nShe added: \"I don't think that there will need to be a significant change to the numbers of people elected to this parliament.\n\"Even if the parliament becomes a parliament of an independent Wales or a parliament with far greater powers that today.\"\nSpeaking ahead of the expected return of a Senedd politician suspended after complaints about his behaviour, Ms Jones said the case had prompted reflection on whether the system was working properly or needed to be changed.\nRhys ab Owen was banned from the Senedd for six weeks in March after an investigation found he inappropriately touched and swore at two women while drunk on a night out in June 2021.\nIn a statement at the time, Mr ab Owen said his behaviour was \"not up to the standard the public expects of a member of the Senedd, and for that I apologise unreservedly\".\nThe case led former Plaid Cymru MS Nerys Evans - who in 2023 led a review which found a \"culture of harassment, bullying and misogyny\" within Plaid which eventually led to the resignation of leader Adam Price - to claim that victims did not feel confident raising issues through the Senedd's complaints system. \nIn response, Ms Jones told Walescast the complaint against Mr ab Owen had been taken seriously but that it was \"a proper question to ask\" whether the system could be improved.\n\"The Senedd has dealt with that.\n\"Whether it dealt with it as quickly, as appropriately as it should have, is something now that our standards committee has to reflect on,\" she said.\n\"I'm not saying that everything is perfect.\n\"I think we need to think about how we've had experience of looking at this in the past and whether we need to make any changes.\n\"And we're perfectly open to doing that and doing things better.\"",

In 2018, he had a human kidney transplant, but it began to fail after five years.\nFollowing his pig kidney transplant on 16 March, his doctors confirmed he no longer needed dialysis after the new organ was said to be functioning well.\n\"Mr Slayman will forever be seen as a beacon of hope to countless transplant patients worldwide and we are deeply grateful for his trust and willingness to advance the field of xenotransplantation,\" MGH said in a statement.\nXenotransplantation is the transplanting of living cells, tissues or organs from one species to another.\nMGH said it was \"deeply saddened\" at his sudden death and offered condolences to his family.\nMr Slayman's relatives said his story was an inspiration.\n\"Rick said that one of the reasons he underwent this procedure was to provide hope for the thousands of people who need a transplant to survive,\" they said.\n\"Rick accomplished that goal and his hope and optimism will endure forever.\n\"To us, Rick was a kind-hearted man with a quick-witted sense of humour who was fiercely dedicated to his family, friends, and co-workers,\" they added.\nWhile Mr Slayman received the first pig kidney to be transplanted into a human, it is not the first pig organ to be used in a transplant procedure.\nTwo other patients have received pig heart transplants, but those procedures were unsuccessful as the recipients died a few weeks later.\nIn one case, there were signs the patient's immune system had rejected the organ, which is a common risk in transplants.",
    "Internet access and use is consistently associated with positive wellbeing, a new study of data from 168 countries by the Oxford Internet Institute (OII) suggests.\nIn many parts of the world, including the EU and UK, concerns about online harms have prompted new laws.\nThe OII says some of its findings are \"consistent\" with reported links between social media use and depressive symptoms among young women.\nBut it concludes the overall benefits of being online show regulators contemplating tougher laws should rely on data and not be \"guided by anecdote.\"\n\"I anticipate that this work will be in some ways seen in contrast to the kind of the current social conversation surrounding tech,\" said professor Andrew Przybylski, of Oxford University, who led the research. \n\"If we\u2019re going to make the online world safe for young people, we can\u2019t just go in guns blazing with strong beliefs and a one size fits all solution -  we really need to make sure that we\u2019re sensitive to having our minds changed by data,\" he said.\nThe study did not look specifically at social media - which is what much of the most heated debate around online safety is focussed on - but took a broader approach to assessing access to the internet. \nResearchers analysed data gathered between 2006 and 2021 from two million individuals aged 15 to 99 worldwide, including from countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa\nThey found that people who had internet access or actively used the internet reported greater levels of life satisfaction and social wellbeing.\nStatistician professor Kevin McConway said it was very \"broad brush\" research, but useful nonetheless. \n\"It\u2019s a starting point, and if nothing else it casts very serious doubt on the view, held by some people, that the Internet is bad for us all,\" he wrote.\nThe researchers studied eight indicators of wellbeing including life satisfaction, daily negative and positive experiences and community wellbeing.\nThey looked at a \"multiverse\" of nearly 34,000 different statistical models and subsets of data.\nIn 85% of cases these showed associations between internet connectivity and wellbeing that were positive and statistically significant.\nBut 5% of associations linking internet use and community wellbeing were negative, with most of those observed among young women aged 15 to 24.\nWhile this does not prove that internet access causes them unhappiness, the paper notes that it is \"consistent with previous reports of increased cyberbullying and more negative associations between social media use and depressive symptoms among young women\".\nDr Ruth Plackett, Senior Research Fellow at University College London, said it was important to understand the limitations in what the research could reveal - for example the fact it looked at the \"average\" person about in a given country.\n\"For instance it doesn't isolate social media use\", she told the BBC.\n\"We do know young people can be exposed to harmful content on these platforms which may give more negative associations with internet use\".\nHowever, she told the BBC she welcomed calls for a more nuanced discussion about the use of the internet.\nSimone Vibert, head of policy and research at Internet Matters, which offers online safety advice, said their research similarly showed that being online came with many benefits but there were also negatives.\n\"There is a clear need for an evidence-based approach, making evidence such as this and further research vital.\"\nThe researchers also acknowledge the study has limits, notably not being able to prove cause and effect. \nFor example, the authors could not entirely discount the possibility that increases in incomes, which were also linked to rises in internet access, were behind people feeling better.\nBut it had clear lessons for policy makers looking at increasing protections for young people online, Prof Przybylski said.\nHe pointed to a lack of peer-reviewed studies on the subject, and the fact the majority of the research that had been carried out focussed on English-speaking, wealthier nations.\n\u201cWe really do want the best for our kids,\" he explained, but said that meant following the data.\n\"If our policy and if our resources are guided by anecdote we\u2019re going to be letting a lot of families down\u201d.\nPrevious OII work carried out by Prof Przybylski found there was no evidence that the global spread of Facebook was linked to widespread psychological harm.\nLike Prof Przybylsk's earlier research, this work, carried out with co-author Professor Matti Vuorre, is based on information from the Gallup World Poll, a survey of millions of people around the world.\nThe study will be published in the peer-reviewed journal Technology, Mind and Behavior.

    "Scotland's health secretary is \"open to ideas\" about NHS reform but vowed it would remain in public hands and free at the point of delivery.\nNeil Gray also told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show John Swinney's leadership was an opportunity for the Scottish government to \"refocus\" its priorities.\nEarlier, Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes said she wanted to boost the Scottish economy and pledged to get it \"firing on all cylinders\".\nBut Labour's Jackie Baillie said John Swinney's new cabinet offered continuity rather than change and warned NHS patients and staff were continuing to be let down.\nAnd Scottish Conservative health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane called on Mr Gray to be \"honest\" about the scale of the challenge facing the health service.\nMr Gray said he had briefed cabinet colleagues on the future of the NHS and hoped to lead a Holyrood debate on the subject later this month.\nHe told the programme: \"I am relatively open to ideas as long as they don't cross the red lines that I have - but also that I think the people of Scotland have - around making sure that our NHS remains in public hands and free at the point of use.\n\"Aside from that I am relatively pragmatic around what else we can do to drive that improvement and sustainability for our health service.\" \nThe health secretary said he wanted to harness innovation and technology from the private sector to benefit the NHS.\nMr Gray, who succeeded Michael Matheson in February, added the government was investing in reducing waiting list times. \nHe said: \"I acknowledge that for too many people they are waiting too long and that is unacceptable.\"\nThe minister also said he wanted to continue to work with the British Medical Association to reach a \"sustainable pay offer\" for junior doctors.\nAnd Mr Gray pledged to reflect on the recommendations of Dr Hilary Cass, who last week said Scotland could benefit from adopting a more \"holistic\" approach to gender services in relation to children.\nMr Swinney was elected SNP leader unopposed last week following the resignation of Humza Yousaf.\nHe was formally sworn in as Scotland's seventh first minister on Wednesday but later confirmed a largely unchanged cabinet, with the exception of Ms Forbes.\nWriting in the Sunday Times, the ex-finance secretary said she left the backbenches and returned to government \"to get stuff done\".\nShe said: \"Everything is an economic policy - tackling poverty, reaching net zero, raising the revenue to invest in our public services.\n\"The plan is simple. Get the economy firing on all cylinders, and it will power a better future.\"\nMr Gray also said ministers would seek to build consensus following the collapse of the Bute House Agreement with the Greens.\nHe said: \"John Swinney's leadership is an opportunity for us to refocus, for us to make sure that we are focused in on the priorities of the people of Scotland.\n\"That's what minority government also does by making sure that we are reaching out across the parliament and finding consensus.\" \nScottish Labour's deputy leader Jackie Baillie later criticised the government's health record.\nShe told The Sunday Show: \"I don't doubt people\u2019s ambition to bring down waiting lists, but the fact is they\u2019ve failed.\n\"We\u2019ve had the SNP in charge for 17 years - what we\u2019ve got now is a continuity first minister, a continuity cabinet, because it\u2019s largely the same faces sitting round the table.\n\"The people who have been in charge of the NHS are still the same party and the same people.\"\nDame Jackie, who is also the party's health spokeswoman, called for greater investment in primary and social care, including hiring more GPs, and better workforce planning.\nShe added: \"We\u2019re letting down patients across Scotland, but we\u2019re also letting down the staff who do such a tremendous job but without the support and resources that they require.\n\"It isn't just about throwing more money at it, we need to drive efficiency through the NHS and the staff are the very ones who actually have the ideas about how to do that.\"\nDr Gulhane, of the Scottish Conservatives, said: \"If Neil Gray is going to fix the mess the SNP has made of the NHS, he needs to be honest about the scale of the challenge.\n\"His claim that waiting times are coming down is fooling no one. \n\"On A&E, cancer treatment, delayed discharge and cancelled ops things are getting worse, which is a damning indictment of both the SNP\u2019s dire workforce planning and Humza Yousaf\u2019s flimsy Covid recovery plan.\"\nThe practising GP also warned the higher taxes imposed by the SNP were an obstacle to recruiting and retaining more medics.\nAnd he urged ministers to follow the Cass review on gender care rather than \"ignorant ideology\".",
    "Rishi Sunak will say the UK \"stands at a crossroads\" ahead of \"some of the most dangerous years\", in a pre-election pitch to voters on Monday.\nIn a speech, the prime minister will argue his \"bold ideas\" can \"create a more secure future\" for Britons.\nIt will be his biggest intervention since the Conservatives' bleak showing in the local elections.\nLabour said the Tories cannot fix the UK's problems as \"they are the problem\".\nMr Sunak's speech in London will focus on security and broad challenges facing the UK, as he argues voters face a stark choice in who will lead the country.\nHe will say: \"I feel a profound sense of urgency because more will change in the next five years than in the last 30.\n\"I'm convinced that the next few years will be some of the most dangerous yet most transformational our country has ever known.\" \nThe prime minister is also expected to talk about foreign policy, describing China, Russia, North Korea and Iran as an axis of authoritarian states who threaten the UK; global immigration and artificial intelligence.\nNational polling puts Labour as much as 20 points ahead of the Conservatives in general election voting intentions. \nThe Tories also lost 470 councillors in the local elections, as well as the key mayoral race in the West Midlands. \nThe prime minister is seeking to portray himself as the best person to deal with the challenges after the general election - expected before the end of the year.\nHe will say he has \"bold ideas\" that can \"create a more secure future\" for Britons and restore their \"confidence and pride in our country\".\n\"I feel a profound sense of urgency because more will change in the next five years than in the last 30,\" he said.\nMr Sunak will vow to safeguard the UK against threats of war, a global rise in immigration and \"those seeking to undermine our shared values and identities\".\nAnd he will pledge to capitalise on opportunities presented by technologies such as artificial intelligence.\nHe will say: \"Over the next few years, from our democracy to our economy to our society - to the hardest questions of war and peace - almost every aspect of our lives is going to change.\n\"How we act in the face of these changes - not only to keep people safe and secure but to realise the opportunities too - will determine whether or not Britain will succeed in the years to come.\n\"And this is the choice facing the country.\"\nDowning Street has argued Mr Sunak has a track record of delivering bold solutions, from furlough during the pandemic to the Rwanda scheme - which was first launched by Boris Johnson's administration.\nThe prime minister has sought to convince voters that Britain's economic prospects are improving in a bid to reverse the Tories' electoral fortunes.\nMeanwhile Sir Keir Starmer will meet Labour mayors later - and will portray the choice as being between \"a changed Labour Party\u2026 or more chaos and decline under the Tories\".\nHe will hold roundtable talks with the mayors about improving regional growth if Labour wins power.\nSir Keir is expected to tell them: \"Be in no doubt that this is the key choice at the next election: a changed Labour Party that will raise living standards for everyone, everywhere or more chaos and decline under the Tories who will never be able to match the ambition of this country. \n\"We saw the public turning to Labour last week as a first step to getting the change Britain needs. And voting Labour is the only way to end the chaos, turn the page and start to renew all our communities.\"\nForeign Secretary Lord David Cameron on Sunday argued it would be \"absolutely right\" for the general election to be held in the second half of the year to give voters time to see \"the economic plan is working\".\nOfficial figures last week showed the economy grew by 0.6% over the first quarter, ending a technical recession recorded in the final half of last year.\nBut Mr Sunak has faced repeated setbacks - including the recent local election results. His woes deepened with the defection of Natalie Elphicke in protest against his record on housing and stopping small boat Channel crossings - the second MP to desert the Tories for Labour in as many weeks.",
    "A UK ban on selling arms to Israel would only strengthen Hamas, the foreign secretary has told the BBC.\nLord Cameron said while he would not support a major ground offensive in the Gazan city of Rafah, the UK would not copy US plans to stop some arms sales.\nHe said the UK supplies just 1% of Israel's weapons and warned Israel must do more to protect civilians and allow humanitarian aid through.\nLabour's Jonathan Ashworth said he did not want UK-made arms used in Rafah.\nThis week US President Joe Biden upended part of one of the world's most significant strategic relationships by saying the US are \"not supplying the weapons \" if Israel went ahead with a planned invasion of Rafah - the southern Gazan city where about 1.4 million people have been sheltering. \nThe UN says more than 80,000 people have fled Rafah since Monday, with Israeli tanks reportedly massed close to built-up areas.\nIsrael has said it will proceed with planned operations in Rafah despite the US and other allies warning that a ground offensive could lead to mass civilian casualties and a humanitarian crisis.\nIts prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has pledged to eliminate Hamas battalions he claims are based in Rafah.\nSpeaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Lord Cameron said he would not support a full-scale offensive on Rafah until he saw Israel's \"plan to protect people\".\nBut he argued the US, which he called \"a massive state supplier of weaponry\", is in \"a totally different position\" to the UK.\nThe UK government does not directly sell arms to Israel but grants licenses to weapons companies based on legal advice. In contrast, the US uses a less restrictive government-to-government deals to sell arms.\nLord Cameron said the last time he was urged to end weapons sales to Israel, when three Britons were killed in an air strike on aid workers in Gaza, \"a few days later there was a brutal attack by Iran on Israel\".\n\"Just to simply announce today that we will change our approach on arms exports, it would make Hamas stronger and it would make a hostage deal less likely,\" he adds.\nHe said he wanted instead to focus on \"hammering away every day\" on getting humanitarian aid into Gaza.\nOn Friday, the US State Department released an investigation which found Israel may have used American-supplied weapons in breach of international humanitarian law during the war in Gaza.\nPressed on whether he agreed with the findings, Lord Cameron said Israel's \"performance is not good enough\", arguing \"Israel has not had a clean bill of health\" on allowing humanitarian aid into the country. \nBut the UK \"has a different approach\" and Lord Cameron said he was \"not really interested in message sending\" through political moves like ending weapons sales.\nLord Cameron said: \"I'm interested in what can we do to maximise the British pressure and the outcome that will help people in their lives - including getting the hostages, including British nationals, released.\"\nHe dismissed the idea of British boots on the ground in Gaza, saying it was \"a risk that we should not take\".\nIt comes after the BBC last month reported the government was considering sending British troops into Gaza to help deliver aid via a new sea route.\nLabour MP Zarah Sultana accused the government of not following its own rules by supplying weapons to Israel.\nThe government's Strategic Export Licensing Criteria prevents weapons sales \"if there is a clear risk that the items might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law\".\nMs Sultana said the scale of arms sales to Israel \"does not matter\".\n\"We are aiding and abetting what are war crimes happening on a daily basis\" she told the BBC.\nLabour's position on Gaza has shifted since the 7 October Hamas attacks, in which 252 people were kidnapped and about 1,200 killed, sparked a full-blown Israeli military operation in the area.\nSince then more than 35,000 people have been killed and 78,000 others wounded in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nLast year, 10 Labour frontbenchers quit over the party's failure to call for a ceasefire in Gaza as it instead backed a \"humanitarian pause\" to allow aid to flood into the country. \nBut in February, Labour began calling for an \"immediate ceasefire\" after the situation in Gaza \"evolved\".\nMr Ashworth, a senior member of the shadow cabinet, said he did not \"want to see British-made weapons used\" in an invasion in Rafah.\n\"A full-scale offensive into Rafah will be a catastrophe beyond description,\" he said.\nHe called on the government to publish the legal advice it has been given on arms sales to Israel.",
    "Lauren Mayberry was 27 when she was sent rape threats after wearing a black mini dress in a music video.\nThe frontwoman of synth pop band Chvrches had become the target of a torrent of online abuse, following the release of the track Leave a Trace from the band's acclaimed second album.\nOne person offered to hand her a gun, if she couldn\u2019t deal with the backlash.\nShe decided to respond in an interview with Channel 4's Cathy Newman, in which she branded the abuse \"ludicrous\".\nBut Mayberry also warned \"cyber misogyny\" was experienced by women and girls every day, with harmful and isolating effects.\n\"I don\u2019t think the 'just ignore it and it\u2019ll go away' argument is working,\" she said.\nAs good as her word, Mayberry, from Thornhill in Stirling, is continuing to challenge the extreme threats of violence and abuse she has received in over a decade in the music industry.\nShe is one of a number of artists taking part in Change The Tune - an on-air, digital and social media initiative by BBC Radio 6 Music to raise awareness of the impact of online abuse.\nMayberry, now 36, told the BBC that even at the beginning of her career, \"a lot of men\" wanted to tell her she was sexually desirable - and if she was deemed not desirable this was \"the worst thing\" they could say.\nMayberry added: \"It\u2019s all very sexual and sexualised all the time.\n\"And I look at that and I\u2019m like, I was a 23-year-old girl, trying to do my job, just to write some silly songs. I didn't know.\n\"I didn't know that that was going to be such a big part of it.\"\nChvrches were highly regarded on home turf, but also grew in popularity in the US after performing at the SXSW festival and appearing on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon in 2013.\nAs their visibility increased, so did the abuse - aimed largely at Mayberry.\nIn 2019 she received rape and death threats after expressing disappointment in EDM star Marshmello\u2019s decision to work with Chris Brown and Tyga.\nBrown, who previously admitted assaulting his then girlfriend Rihanna, hit back at the band, calling them a \"bunch of losers\".\nTyga, who was sued for sexual assault, said: \"Everyone makes mistakes\".\nMayberry shared some of the messages she received following the exchange on social media.\nOne person said he would \"bash her skull in\" if she continued to make comments about Brown.\nIt prompted Chvrches to increase security at their shows while Mayberry also hired private security at her home in California.\nThen, at the start of 2021, she learned she had appeared in \"deepfake\" pornography.\nA deepfake is an image or video that has been digitally altered with the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to replace the face of one person with the face of another.\nIn recent years the technology has been increasingly used to add the faces of celebrities or public figures - most often women - into pornographic films.\nMayberry told the BBC it was damaging but would have had a far more powerful effect on her when she was younger.\nShe said: \"It just felt like another version of the same thing, if that makes sense. And I do think that\u2019s odd. It's like a decade of intermittently receiving rape or death threats on the internet.\n\"Even though people say 'It's not real, it's not real' Your brain does not perceive that, I don't think. The impact of it on your psychology, it doesn't really matter whether you think that's real.\"\nInitially Mayberry said Chvrches were not so well known that they could afford to hire security, even when she was receiving \"specific\" death threats about venues and timings.\nShe added: \"Something like that was very scary and people saying to you 'oh it's just the internet, it\u2019s probably not going to happen' doesn't really make you feel better when you have to go on stage.\n\"I definitely did a lot of panic crying before gigs and then I think I do remember us specifically getting to the end of that tour and it was the first time in the band that I was like, 'I'm gonna take two weeks off and I'm not going on my emails' - and I\u2019m never not on my emails.\n\"I took two weeks off and went to a little remote location and cried a lot in baths.\"\nMayberry shared her experience alongside a number of artists - including Self Esteem and Craig Charles - in a special interview with BBC Radio 6 Music, as part of the Change the Tune initiative.\nDJ Jamz Supernova told the programme of the racist abuse she had experienced including being called a \"token\" or \"diversity hire\".\nAnd composer Nitin Sawney said comments made about him online had triggered memories of violence and racism in his childhood.\nMayberry, on the cusp of launching a solo career for the first time, has also made an iPlayer film about her experiences of online abuse and misogyny in the music industry.\nInitially, she said she did not want to draw any more attention to the subject that had taken up so much head space over the years - but was persuaded to do so because she believed the women in bands she loved would have taken action.\n\"If we\u2019re going to have a conversatio",
    "Georgian opposition leaders have called on the UK to do more to oppose what they say is a crackdown on civil society in the former Soviet country.\nThey urged the foreign secretary to show the governing party that the international community was united against the proposals.\nThe Transparency of Foreign Influence Bill is expected to pass its final parliamentary hurdles in coming days. \nOpponents have staged mass protests in the capital Tbilisi against the law.\nThe legislation would force non-governmental groups and media to register as \"organisations serving the interest of a foreign power\" if more than 20% of their funding comes from overseas. \nThe governing Georgian Dream party says the measure would increase transparency and defend Georgia's sovereignty.\nBut opponents say it will be used by the government to crush opposition voices and parties ahead of a general election in October. \nThey say it is also designed to disrupt Georgia's ambition to join the European Union, which could not accept the new law. \nThe legislation has been dubbed \"the Russian law\" because it is similar legislation used by the Kremlin to silence its own critics. \nThe proposal has brought tens of thousands of people out onto the streets in the small country on the eastern coast of the Black Sea. \nThe US has been vocal in attacking the bill, with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan writing on X at the weekend that the US was \"deeply alarmed about democratic backsliding in Georgia\". \nHe said MPs had to choose between \"the Georgian people's Euro-Atlantic aspirations or pass a Kremlin-style foreign agents' law that runs counter to democratic values... we stand with the Georgian people\".\nIn contrast, the UK has been more discreet in expressing its opposition. \nIn a written parliamentary answer published quietly last week, the Minister for Europe, Nusrat Ghani, said the UK's ambassador in Tbilisi had \"consistently voiced our concerns about the proposed law\" in recent meetings with the prime minister and president. \nShe said she had discussed the issue herself with the Georgian ambassador in London last month. \nHer only other public remarks came 10 days ago, in a post on social media warning against \"excessive use of force by police against peaceful protestors in Tbilisi\", which she said was \"not in line with democratic values and risks Georgia's Euro-Atlantic aspirations\".\nBut Georgian opposition MPs want Ms Ghani and Foreign Secretary David Cameron to go much further.  \nGiorgi Vashadze, an MP and leader of the Strategy Builder party, said: \"Lord Cameron was one of the leading international supporters of Georgia when we were invaded in 2008. \n\"We were thankful for his support, which did so much to raise the country's spirits. \n\"As foreign secretary, I ask him to please do the same to highlight the government's attempts to clamp down on opposition during an election year.\" \nTina Bokuchava, Georgian MP and parliamentary leader of the United National Movement, said: \"These written answers show that the UK government has been privately concerned about the situation in Georgia. \n\"We now need these concerns to be made public, so that the ruling party understands that the international community is united in opposition to such authoritarian actions.\"\nA spokesperson for the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office told the BBC the UK is \"gravely concerned\" about the foreign influence bill.\n\"The accompanying rhetoric and excessive force used by police against protesters are deeply concerning,\" they said. \n\"We urge the Georgian authorities to show restraint in policing peaceful demonstrations.\"\n\"The UK continues to engage with the Georgian government and civil society groups in Tbilisi, and our ambassador has consistently made our concerns about the proposed law known to the Georgian government, most recently to the prime minister on 22 April.\"",
    "When Emma Marshall's children urged her to jump into a cold river on a hot spring day in 2020, her first instinct was a resounding no.\n\"My friends, my family will all tell you, 'Emma hates cold water'. I'd do anything to avoid it,\" she says.\nSo how is it the Bangor University head of development and alumni relations has gone from cold water-phobic to an author of a book about wild swims? \nThat day, in the beautiful environs of her native Eryri, or Snowdonia, she had a road to Damascus moment.\nOn their daily lockdown walk to the Afon (River) Ogwen near her home in Bethesda, Gwynedd, \"my kids forced me to go in basically\", she laughs.\nAnd far from hating it, she says: \"As soon as I got in, I thought, 'oh my god, this is amazing'. I just got hooked straight away.\n\"The Afon Ogwen is beautiful and it changes throughout its course, but near us it's very wooded, and quite wide and rocky, and it's just divine.\n\"It was a very good place to start.  You couldn't help but love that. Snowdonia, Eryri, it is a paradise for wild swimming.\"\nEmma was already a keen runner and hiker, and as a consequence knew many routes around Eryri already. But now the focus of her outings changed to incorporate a mountainside dip wherever she went.\n\"I would think about all those places I could remember from my walks and just started doing walks or runs into the mountainside to get to those places,\" she explains.\nAlthough she is happy to swim anywhere, her favourite type of dip is one that involves a waterfall.\n\"Hands down, always waterfall pools,\" she says. \n\"I think they're just so exciting.\"\nThere is \"a little bit of science\" behind the attraction too, she says. \nEmma added: \"It's something to do with running, crashing water. Apparently there are negative ions created by that but that is a good thing.\n\"It's why you get that feelgood factor. It's that sharpening of the brain as a result of that rushing water.\n\"I think that might be why I love waterfalls so much, but also, they're just so pretty.\"\nDespite her commitment to year round immersion, Emma does not think of herself as a stereotypically good swimmer, and has plenty of safety tips in the book.\n\"I never stay in long. I'm not really a strong swimmer. I'm a good dipper,\" she explains. \n\"But in the winter particularly it is sometimes a case of dunking and coming straight out again.\n\"It still gives you that dopamine hit. It's a good drug to have.\"\nAnd as her joy in taking a dip increased over time, the idea of sharing some of her knowledge began to form. \nBut she was conscious she also wanted to protect the environment she loved.\n\"I love doing it so much, you know, and I post a lot of pictures on Instagram of my swims and my walks,\" Emma adds. \n\"I never actually say where they are though because I think that sort of responsibility you have - it's too easy on Instagram for people just to go 'right I'm going there', no research.\"\nBut even spots Emma considered to be well-known attracted curiosity and it occurred to her to see if there was a wild swimming walks book available.\nWhen she saw there were some covering other parts of the country but not Eryri, she started to think she might just be the person to fill the gap.\nShe added: \"This book is going to be written by somebody else if I don't do it, and I know I can do it properly.\n\"I can do it in a way which talks about the importance of how you treat your environment, and choosing the places carefully about where I take people to.\"\nShe has deliberately not shared all the places she goes to, as she considers the delicate balance of nature in some areas could get overwhelmed by too many visitors.\nThe book, Wild Swim Walks Eryri has just been released, and details 28 routes across the national park.\nAnd while she says the last swim she has done is always her favourite while it is in her head, if she had to pick one it involves a walk in the Glyderau mountains, to the north-east of Yr Wyddfa, or Snowdon.\n\"This is one of the more challenging walks in the book. It's more of a pool than a lake,\" she says.\n\"It's called Llyn Caseg-Ffraith, which means the lake of the speckled mare.\n\"It's just the most perfect mountain pool. It's backdrop is Tryfan [mountain]. I've swum there quite a number of times at sunrise, and the sun rises and is reflected on to Tryfan and it glows pink.\n\"Then we go over to Llyn Bochlwyd and the topography changes; it gets a bit busier and the topography changes. There's a really tumbling stream which comes down into Llyn Ogwen.\n\"It's such a treat for the senses.\"",
    "Denys Yaroslavskyi is angry.\nAs the Commander of a Ukrainian Special Reconnaissance Unit, he fought in Ukraine\u2019s surprise offensive in Kharkiv in the autumn of 2022, which pushed back an initial Russian invasion all the way back to the border.\nBut now Denys and his men are facing the prospect of doing the same all over again.\nRussian forces have, in recent days, made small but significant gains right along the border in the Kharkiv region. \nTheir advances are only a few miles deep but have swallowed up around 100km (62 miles) of Ukrainian territory. In the more heavily defended east of Ukraine, it\u2019s taken Russia months to achieve the same.\nRussia claims its forces have now entered the border town of Vovchansk, which Ukraine disputes. \nThe town has come under heavy bombing in recent days, and several thousand residents have been evacuated. \nDenys wants to know what happened to Ukraine\u2019s defences.\n\u201cThere was no first line of defence. We saw it. The Russians just walked in. They just walked in, without any mined fields\u201d he says. \nHe shows me video from a drone feed taken a few days ago of small columns of Russian troops simply walking across the border, unopposed.\nHe says officials had claimed that defences were being built at huge cost, but in his view, those defences simply weren\u2019t there. \u201cEither it was an act of negligence, or corruption. It wasn\u2019t a failure. It was a betrayal\u201d.\nEveryone knew that this incursion was likely to happen. Both Ukrainian and Western intelligence knew Russia had been building forces across the border \u2013 with estimates of it massing up to 30,000 troops. \nPresident Vladimir Putin had also publicly stated his goal to create a buffer zone inside Kharkiv region to protect Russian territory from Ukrainian artillery strikes.\nBut Ukraine appears to have been ill-prepared - despite official denials.\nDenys, speaking from a park in Kharkiv, says within an hour he\u2019ll be back on the front line with his men close to the town of Vovchansk, just 5km (3 miles) from the Russian border.\nRussian troops are already reported to have entered the edge of the town. Denys tells me he fears it could soon be back in Russian hands.\nWe\u2019d visited the town earlier, joining a local policeman, Oleksii, who was picking up residents who wanted to flee to safety. He was driving fast to avoid the Russian drones flying overhead and the constant barrage of artillery.\nThe population of the town before the war was around 20,000. Most had left at the start of the war, and it went down to 3,000 residents - but hundreds more have been leaving over the past few days. Oleksii says \u201cit\u2019s easier to leave now, before they get killed or injured\u201d.\nIn Kharkiv, Russia is using all too familiar tactics to advance \u2013 reducing Ukrainian villages and towns to rubble. Oleksii estimates that Russia\u2019s been firing around 50 to 60 shells every hour into the town. And then there\u2019s glide bombs, fired from Russian jets tens of kilometres from the front lines, well out of range of Ukraine\u2019s limited air defences.\nRussia\u2019s been launching around 100 glide bombs a day across the 1,000 km front. We heard half a dozen of their jet-like screeches over the course of an hour, followed by earth-shattering explosions.\nSerhii\u2019s house was destroyed by one such glide bomb. Standing in the smoking rubble he told me his wife, Svetlana, had been seriously injured. He was nursing wounds on his hands, burnt by the explosion.\nHe told me he\u2019d like to leave, \u201cbut what can I do?\u201d. He pointed to his three goats which he didn\u2019t want to kill. Somehow, they\u2019d miraculously survived along with his cat. Serhii was still clinging on to his final possessions.\nMost of those who\u2019ve stayed behind in Vovchansk are the elderly and the poor.\nBut 65-year-old Oleksandr has had enough. We watched as he made the sign of the cross, leaving the home he\u2019d grown up in. He tenderly touched the ground, picked up two bags, and climbed into the police car.\nHe said he wanted to go to Germany but had no idea of how he\u2019d get there.\nOpening a new front here in the north is stretching Ukraine\u2019s limited resources. The US delay in approving more military support has starved Ukrainian troops of ammunition. \nOn average, Ukraine has only been able to fire one artillery round to Russia\u2019s 10. That is now slowly being addressed, with the US support now coming.\nBut the Kharkiv offensive also highlights problems Ukraine itself has been too slow to address \u2013 mobilising enough troops and building adequate defence lines. Re-enforcements being sent to Kharkiv have had to be pulled from other parts of the front and limited reserves.\nUkrainian officials still insist Kharkiv city is not under threat of a ground invasion. But the further the Russian\u2019s advance, the more likely that it will come within range of Russian artillery.\nBack in a park in Kharkiv, Denys says he believes Russian forces will try to focus on the East and to capture the entire Donbas. But he says Russia is also trying to exploit Ukrainian weaknesses ",
    "A pioneering project is making an eco-friendly concrete from crushed shells that would otherwise be set for landfill - and could help prevent flooding.\nA team at the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) have developed the sustainable concrete which is made from crushed scallop and whelk shells sourced from Fleetwood.\nBy using the shells, which would usually be discarded by fishmongers, the concrete would allow water to drain through it, and could be used for footpaths, car parks and gardens to alleviate flooding. \nIt is being tested in the garden of People's Pantry, a community food initiative, in Blackpool, which is prone to flooding.\nScallops and whelks are often removed from their shells by fishmongers before they are sold.\nUsually, these shells are then crushed and sent to landfill, but the project would give them another use.\nProf Karl Williams, who is leading the project, said: \"When it rains, the water will permeate through and then will dissipate into ground so stopping flooding and this particular garden area was very prone to flooding.\"\n\"We have to wash them and crush them and then we have to sieve them to the right size, so that they can go into the concrete.\"\nUCLan wants companies to look at using this as a way of preventing flooding and  also stop millions of tonnes of shells discarded by the seafood industry going into landfill.\nAs well as the community garden at the People's Pantry in the Bostonway area of Blackpool, extensive trials are being done at the university in test tanks.\nArts company Leftcoast designed and built the People's Pantry which has a community pantry and garden space where residents can grow their own produce.\n\"We needed a flooring that would be something which would be slip and trip proof,\" Helen Jones of Leftcoast said.\n\"We've also got waterlogging locally, or was prior to sorting out the garden now, so it needed to tick that box as well.\"\nShe said they also needed a ramp for accessibility.\n\"The fact that it also takes shells from a local fishing industry and stops it going to landfill and repurposes it fits with everything else we've been doing inside.\" \nMaggie Gregson, a Bostonway resident, said the shells had made a big difference to the community garden.\n\"It was bad before because it kept flooding - we were walking about in mud.\n\"We were doing some tests the other week and we were pouring water in... and it works.\n\"I think it's an absolutely brilliant idea.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds\u00a0and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram?

    "A display has opened to celebrate the work of a group of women who risked their lives being flown into battle to treat soldiers during World War Two.\nKnown as the Flying Nightingales, the women delivered supplies to troops and evacuated injured men, all while coming under enemy fire.\nThey began the work after D-Day nearly 80 years ago, but since then many of their stories have been forgotten.\nThe exhibition is on show at London's Florence Nightingale Museum.\nThe women had been working as nursing orderlies as part of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) when in March 1944 the Air Council approved for them to be flown into scenes of battles to deliver equipment and bring back casualties for treatment in the UK.\n\"Their sole role was to basically keep the men comfortable and administer basic fist aid,\" explains Florence Nightingale Museum's general manager Katie Edwards.\n\"They had specific training on battle wounds, how to deal with burns, how to give injections, that kind of thing. And then they would have been required to stay with the men all the way back to the UK.\"\nThe first flights took place a week after the Normandy landings in June 1944, with Cpl Lydia Alford among three women landing on the north coast of France.\nRecalling what happened later, she described how she was particularly struck by \"the dust which was everywhere, coming up in great clouds\".\n\"While the freight was being unloaded I tried to make the wounded men as comfortable as possible in all that dust. I had water to give them and panniers of tea,\" she said.\nFor the rest of the war the three women and many others were flown across Europe in specially adapted RAF planes that could carry up to 24 casualties. Soon they became known as the Flying Nightingales after the famous \"Lady of the Lamp\".\nTwo of them, Margaret Walsh and Margaret Campbell, were killed in action and Ms Edwards says the women had to carry out their work in the face of \"extraordinary risk\".\n\"On the flights out to France they were carrying ammunition, which meant that they weren't allowed to display the Red Cross at all, so basically they were considered fair game to be shot down,\" she explains.\nAnother of the Flying Nightingales featured in the display, Cpl Elsie Beer, spent nearly 400 hours in the skies and on one occasion was shot at by a sniper as she walked back to base for her plane home.\nIn spite of such heroics, relatively little is known about the women.\n\"We don't actually know for certain how many there were,\" says Ms Edwards. \"The most trusted source we found was about 500 women that did it across the last year of the war.\"\nNo Flying Nightingales are thought to still be alive today and many of their stories have been lost. \nThe museum's collections manager, Hannah Amos, believes customs in 1940s Britain added to the reasons why many tales have not been passed down the generations.\n\"The women weren't able to both marry and continue their nursing careers [after the war] so it might be that those stories obviously haven't been passed down through family members if they weren't able to go on and have children and grandchildren,\" she says.\nAs such, Ms Edwards considers it important for the museum to celebrate the Flying Nightingales, with the exhibition's opening coinciding with International Nurses Day.\n\"Being the Florence Nightingale Museum, named in her honour, we really feel that they were carrying on her legacy of just being really ordinary women who did extraordinary things,\" she says.\n\"They've been mostly forgotten about and this is just a really nice opportunity to highlight those different stories around D-Day.\"\nIn Focus: The Flying Nightingales will be on display at the Florence Nightingale Museum, based on the site of St Thomas' Hospital, until December.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Thirty thousand rare oysters are being reintroduced to the Firth of Forth having been wiped out by overfishing and pollution.\nOnce native to Scotland, it has been estimated that 30 million European flat oysters were being harvested towards the end of the 1800s.\nBut by 1957 they were declared extinct in the area.\nSo far, 14,000 oysters have been reintroduced with plans for the rest to be added by the end of the year.\nThe project is part of efforts to increase biodiversity in Scottish waters.\nIt is being led by Edinburgh's Heriot-Watt University and WWF Scotland, along with other partners.\nIt has so far involved 128 people, a team of marine biologists and a skipper who have put in 500 hours of manual labour.\nThey also aim to restore four hectares of seagrass as there is a synergistic relationship between the species.\nIn 2009, a scientist from Stirling University believed she had discovered some of the oysters in the Forth.\nHowever, WWF Scotland said the information had been incorrect and there were no verified records of oysters in the Forth since 1957.\nLoch Ryan in Dumfries and Galloway has retained a population of oysters but numbers have vastly reduced everywhere since the 1800s.\nOysters are known as filter feeders and each oyster can filter about 200 litres of water per day. As they filter, they feed on different particles in the water column.\nAs well as improving water quality, oysters increase biodiversity, which means a surface for seaweeds and other animals to settle on.\nNaomi Kennon, Restoration Forth\u2019s research assistant at Heriot-Watt University, said: \"They can clean water at an incredible rate compared to some other shellfish so that means if there\u2019s something like an algal bloom, they\u2019ll eat all the algae and the water will be clearer for it.\"\nThe oysters can also feed on organic particles, which could potentially come from untreated sewage outflow into the Firth of Forth.\nMs Kennon said that although it was not clear if the oysters would have an impact on an area the size of the Firth of Forth, even a small difference would be beneficial and could improve water quality.\nShe said oysters and seagrass had \"synergistic ecosystem services\", as the oysters clear the water as they feed and allow more light to reach the seagrass.\n\"It would seem sensible to assume there is a connection there, but we don\u2019t know for sure as they are both incredibly rare,\" she said.\nOyster beds once existed along the east coast of Scotland, including the Firth of Forth and on to the River Dee.\nEdinburgh\u2019s connection to oysters are embedded in local songs and stories.\nThere are tales of the Fishwives of Newhaven and oyster wars where people ventured into each other\u2019s territories.\nEcologist Leoni Anderson is a volunteer from Project Shoreline which partnered with Restoration Forth and wanted to maintain the tradition.\nShe said: \"There are choirs now who keep those memories alive and sing the old songs and when the oyster fishermen went out, they would sing or say incantations.\n\"The fishermen believed it\u2019s good to sing to the oysters and they would catch them so there was a kind of partnership thing going on, a bit of magical stuff.\"\nThe oysters being reintroduced begin their journey at Little Loch Broom in Ullapool, where they travel more than 200 miles to Heriot-Watt University to be processed through biosecurity.\nThey are scrubbed clean by volunteers to remove any disease before moving to their news homes in the Firth of Forth.\nMs Kennon  said: \"The volunteer turnout we\u2019ve had has been absolutely incredible, whether that\u2019s been physically cleaning the oysters, sticking oysters to string or to each other.\n\"It's just been fantastic because we know these oysters will benefit communities and to see that the volunteers so encouraged by what we\u2019re doing and want to help us.\"\nMelanie McAinsh, who has helped to scrub boxes of oysters, said: \"I\u2019m a year-round outdoor swimmer, I\u2019ve been in the water all my life, and I\u2019ve had the chance to improve the water in my lifetime, so I had to jump at it. \n\"It just makes me feel really hopeful.\"\nMs Arnold added: \"We\u2019ve wiped those beds out of existence because of things like overfishing so I think in part we have a responsibility to put them back but will also benefit from the ecosystem services they provide.\"",

Ofcom, the regulator for online safety, has told tech firms to hide \"toxic\" content from children and published draft codes of practice. \"James\" shared his experience of being approached on Roblox and being asked for sexual images.\nEight-year-old James is sat in his bedroom playing on Roblox - a game aimed at children that allows them access to \"the ultimate virtual universe\". \nA message pops up: \"Do you want to be friends?\"\nJust a couple of weeks later, this person will ask James for intimate, sexual photos of himself.\n\"I was young and I thought these people were my friends,\" James, not his real name, said.\n\"It started off very innocent... then it was like, 'let's take this conversation to Kik [a mobile chat app]'.\n\"They asked for sexual pictures, they wanted to see my naked body, that was the words they used, and they tried to portray it as being OK and normal.\"\nFor those unfamiliar with the platform, Roblox allows people to play and create a variety of games in a 3D world. \nThere are no age restrictions, allowing adults and children to play and communicate together.\nPolice forces across the country count it as one of a number of children's gaming sites where grooming is a growing problem. \nIf you have been affected by issues in this story you can find help and support at the BBC Action Line. \nJames, who is from Gloucestershire and now in his 20s, is one of thousands of children who have been asked for sexual photos online by someone pretending to be their own age. \n\"At a young age, all you want is friends, so I spoke to that person,\" James said.\n\"They asked questions like how old am I, where am I from, my name, which I answered because at a young age you don't think anything of that information, you don't think people will use that maliciously against you. \n\"It was a kids game, I didn't think any adults would play it.\"\nAsking for intimate or sexual photos of a child is an offence under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 - even if the photos are not sent.\nJames said he knew this was wrong even aged eight and quickly blocked the person he now believes to have been an adult man. \nBut that was not the end of it.\n\"They were persistent in trying to communicate with me back on Roblox,\" James said.\n\"They would come on the account I originally met them on... they would then harass me by following me into the games I was playing and continuously talking to me to the point I couldn't play for a while.\n\"I felt vulnerable because I was constantly being followed by this person who was just horrible. It was terrifying.\"\nFeeling embarrassed about what happened, James did not tell anyone.\n\"I wanted to lock it away,\" he said.\n\"You think 'how did I let that happen', 'why did I do that', but I do now realise that none of it was in my control.\n\"You get told as a kid don't talk to strangers, but when you're online you think everyone is your friend.\n\"They knew what they were doing, they knew how to work around it.\"\nDespite what happened, James did not feel turning away from Roblox was an option. \nIt was where his real-life friends were and he did not want to miss out. Although he felt pressured and uncomfortable, he kept on using the game until he was about 13.\nIn its purest form, Roblox has a lot to offer. There are more than 4.4 million \"active immersive experiences\", from gaming to social hangouts, to sports, education, and entertainment.\nRoblox said: \"The wellbeing of the Roblox community is our first priority, and we are deeply saddened to hear about this case.\n\"We are continually investing in and evolving the safety tools, teams and policies we dedicate to catching and preventing attempts at malicious or harmful activity on our platform to protect members of the community.\"\nBeing online is part of everyday life for the majority of children. \nData from Ofcom shows nearly all children (99%) spend time online, and that nine in 10 own a mobile phone by the time they reach 11. \nOfcom also found three in five secondary-school-aged children (11-18 years) have been contacted online in a way that potentially made them feel uncomfortable. \nSome 30% have received an unwanted friend or follow request. Around one in six secondary students (16%) have either been sent naked or half-dressed photos, or been asked to share these themselves.\nAvon and Somerset Police is one of many forces proactively reaching out to help.\nIt said there were 93 reported offences of sexual grooming in the past 12 months that carried a \"cyber flag\". \nOf those, four were also identified as involving child abuse, and a further 39 included reference to child sexual exploitation. \nThe force has been holding workshops at schools for children and parents in an effort to raise awareness of risks varying from online grooming to bullying and financial loss.\nIn the past year, more than 150 schools were visited, reaching more than 25,000 people.\nThe BBC was invited to Bailey's Court Primary School in Bradley S",
    "Residents living near an illegal waste site on the Isle of Sheppey coast say it will take many years to clean up the rubbish-strewn beaches.\nThey say dumped waste, ranging from tyres and shredded fabrics to asbestos and different types of plastics, has washed around the coast \u201clike a giant soup\u201d from the site known locally as Eastchurch Gap.\nA court order was issued last year banning anyone from entering or tipping waste in the area, but large quantities of waste had already built up on the cliff base, with weeds and grass now beginning to grow over much of it.\nThe Environment Agency said it was determined to stop such \u201corganised criminality\u201d.\nBelinda Lamb, from Medway Swale Estuary partnership, which organises monthly beach cleans, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of shredded carpet, material, fake grass, fake Christmas trees, work wear, hard plastics, very industrial stuff. It\u2019s all been dumped off the cliffs in recent years and it all comes in on the big tides.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be continuous beach cleans that will do it because so much has come off the cliffs into the sea. It\u2019s all just floating out there like a giant soup. So it\u2019s just going to be a continuous job for many, many years.\u201d\nThe local MP Gordon Henderson said tipping began in 2020 after a series of cliff collapses due to erosion caused a family home to slide down the cliff-face.\nHe said: \u201cAt one time, people living in Warden Road were seeing up to 50 lorries a day going up and 50 lorries a day going down. It wasn\u2019t all about tipping rubbish off a cliff, it was the destruction of the local environment.\u201d\nSwale Borough Council said it was part of a multi-agency group working on the issue.\nIt said it \"took advice from a range of agencies, and it was determined the best course of action was to leave the tipped material where it is, due to the complexity of the coastal erosion in the area\u201d.\nA council spokesperson added: \u201cWe appreciate the efforts that the local community are making.\"\nIt comes as investigations continue into other illegal waste sites elsewhere in Kent.\nThe Environment Agency said it was compiling a file for prosecutors over a long-running site at Borstal near Rochester.\nMeanwhile, a site at Hoads Wood, near Ashford, has also been closed, and last month another large site came to light at Iwade, near Sittingbourne.\nThe Environment Agency said: \u201cWaste crime spoils the natural environment, and we are aware of the impact this organised criminality has on communities and people\u2019s enjoyment of their environment.\n\u201cWe are steadfast in our fight against waste criminals.

    "All Sam Rushby can remember about his family are fleeting memories of hospital corridors and waiting rooms.\nIn 1994, at just two years old, he lost his mum to Aids. His dad died with the condition a year later at Liverpool Royal Infirmary.\nHis sister had also been infected with HIV, then a new and untreatable virus, and had died.\n\"My family was literally torn apart and ripped away from me,\" he tells BBC Panorama in his first-ever interview.\n\"It just feels like they've been disposed of and that's the end of it now.\"\nSam's father Gary was one of more than 1,200 people infected with HIV as part of the infected blood scandal, most after being given a drug made from US blood plasma in the late 1970s and 1980s.\nA long-running public inquiry into what has been called the worst treatment disaster in NHS history is preparing to report its findings.\nOne of the key areas it is examining is whether the authorities were too slow to act at the time.\nNow, BBC Panorama has seen evidence that the British Embassy in Washington warned the UK government about the risk of Aids from contaminated blood in the early 1980s.\nAn embassy official wrote a five-page memo to a senior figure at the Department of Health after meeting a member of the US Aids taskforce. \nThe warning - one of several - came a decade before Sam was born. \nInfected Blood: Time for Answers\nJim Reed meets the families of some of the children with bleeding disorders who were infected with HIV, to discuss their campaign for justice and what they hope for from the inquiry.\nWatch on BBC One at 20:00 BST on 13 May or on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) \nIt wasn't until he was in his teens that Sam, now 32, started to learn the truth.\nHis father Gary was born with haemophilia, a genetic condition that damages the blood's ability to clot. It almost always affects men, although women carry the haemophilia gene and can pass it on.\nIn the late 1970s, Gary started on a new treatment meant to radically improve his life.\nFactor VIII was marketed as a wonder drug. Patients could simply take a bottle of the white powder from the fridge, mix it with distilled water and inject themselves.\nThe bleeding would stop and, for the first time ever, haemophiliacs could live a more normal life.\nBut those patients would later learn that entire batches of the new treatment had been contaminated with HIV and hepatitis C.\nAbout two-thirds of those infected with HIV in the 1980s developed Aids and died before modern antiretroviral drugs became available.\nSam struggled to comprehend the truth about what happened to his family when he was finally told by his grandparents.\n\"I didn't believe it, I couldn't believe it,\" he says. \"I just can't get over, why did it have to happen?\"\nIn the early 1980s, the UK could not keep up with demand for Factor VIII, which was made by pooling - or mixing - the blood plasma of thousands of individual donors.\nInstead the treatment was shipped from the US.\nIn the UK, blood donations have always been voluntary, but in the US, drug companies were allowed to pay cash for plasma.\nHigh risk groups, from prisoners to drug users, had a clear financial incentive to give blood and potentially lie about their medical history.\nEvidence uncovered by campaigners and seen by the ongoing public inquiry into the wider contaminated blood scandal shows that, as the risk from Aids started to become known, a series of clear warnings were sent to the UK government.\nIn May 1983, Dr Spence Galbraith, the director of the UK's Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, wrote to Dr Ian Field, the senior principal medical officer at the Department of Health, urging that all US blood products should be withdrawn from use until the risk of Aids was \"clarified\".\nThe letter from the British embassy in Washington - which Panorama has now seen - was also sent to Dr Field, just a month later on 28 June 1983.\nIn it, an embassy official describes a meeting with a representative from the US Centers for Disease Control's Aids taskforce.\nThe transmission of HIV in blood was discussed, he writes. Haemophiliacs were \"most at risk\" from the \"dubious habits\" of some paid American blood donors, and the mixing of thousands of those donations to make Factor VIII.\nThe Tainted Blood group, which represents hundreds of survivors and their families, says the letter shows a \"staggering level of awareness and detail\" about the dangers.\nBut this - and other - warnings were not acted on. NHS patients continued to be given untreated Factor VIII imported from the US until at least 1985.\nMany of those involved in decisions in the 1980s are no longer alive, including Dr Ian Field.\nIn 1983, knowledge of HIV and Aids was still emerging.\nAt the time, a Department of Health official described the call to withdraw American Factor VIII as premature and said it did not take into account the risks to haemophiliacs of removing a major source of their treatment.\nSam says his dad didn't know he had been infected with HIV for many years.\nGary unw",

So they're not only solid, they're almost like glue.\"\nEngineers at the motor museum sprayed a solution with magnetic particles onto the metal which, when viewed in ultraviolet light, reveals any cracks.\u00a0\nThey also found a spanner which had been \"glued\" to the chassis by oil since the world record run.\u00a0\nMr Stanfield said the car has completed fewer than 70 miles in its 97 years. \nThe restoration work comes after a museum in Wolverhampton launched an initiative to track down relatives of workers who helped build the car.\nThe National Motor Museum is now campaigning to raise \u00a3300,000 to complete the work, with \u00a350,000 raised so far.\nChief engineer Doug Hill said: \"The best way to preserve a motor vehicle is to have it in running order. \n\"The ambition is to take this car to Daytona three years from now, and run it down the same part of the beach, 100 years to the day after Segrave took it and won the land speed record at 203 miles an hour.\"\nThe car's chassis is currently on display in the Beaulieu museum, with only the wooden steering wheel still in place.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

    "A school said its book club is \"thriving\" after a fuselage of a plane was transformed into a library.\nSt Helen's Primary School, in Alveston near Bristol, saved up to buy the unique space which arrived in January 2023. It also doubles as an outdoor classroom.\nRichard Adams, deputy head teacher, said the students get a \"real sense of pleasure\" from reading there.\nThe official opening was held on World Book Day, earlier this year.\nMr Adams said the idea came about after the school ran a competition for the children to choose new house names and the pupils came up with a \"marvellous idea to name them after planes\". \nThere is a great history in the area with the link to planes and after a school trip, they came up with a \"great idea to rescue a plane that had finished its useful service from a plane graveyard,\" he added.\nAs a large part of the fuselage was built in nearby Filton - where Concorde was designed and built - it was very much in keeping with their local plane angle too, he said.\n\"Originally it was decaying slightly so a previous head teacher and the local community got a project together to buy it and renovate it then move it the school.\n\"It's been completely redone inside as a library,\" he said. \nThe fuselage was then pulled to the school on a big crane and lifted onto the school field. \n\"It was a lot of work but we're really grateful to the community for raising the money for that,\" he added.\n\"We have more than 30 children in our book club now\" and being able to learn on the plane is the \"highlight of their week\", he added.\nCatherine, a student at the school, said: \"I really enjoy reading...

    "\nA number of the front pages feature Rishi Sunak's speech, due to take place on Monday. The Daily Telegraph focuses on the prime minister's claim that - as the world enters one of its most dangerous eras - Britain would be safer under the Conservatives than under Labour over the next Parliament. The paper says Mr Sunak will highlight \"dividing lines\" between the two parties, including what he sees as Labour's \"failure\" to match his commitment to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by the end of the decade. \n\nThe Times concentrates on Mr Sunak's warning about autocratic states. He is expected to say collusion between China, Russia, North Korea and Iran poses the most dangerous threat since the end of the Cold War - and the West must face up to these adversaries. \nThe Daily Mail says it will be a \"landmark\" speech, highlighting the challenges of AI, migration and \"authoritarian states\".\nThe Guardian carries a warning from England's former chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, that Covid-19 will \"look minor\" compared with increasingly drug-resistant superbugs. Dame Sally - who is now the UK's special envoy on antimicrobial resistance - says the issue is more \"acute\" than climate change.

The research - carried out by academics in Austria - looked at data from more than 122,000 people across 26 European countries. It found that those who were obese were twice as likely to take time off than people who were a healthy weight. \n\nThe paper argues that with 2.8 million people signed off work in the UK, absenteeism among people who are overweight is fuelling a \"worklessness crisis\" in Britain which is stifling economic growth.

The union's president Matt Wrack is reported to have written to the Labour leader at the weekend, saying Ms Elphicke's support for anti-strike laws - seen as recently as March - should be \"incompatible\" with the party whip.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph says it understands that the Lib Dems have been reported to the equalities watchdog for allegedly deselecting a candidate because of his Christian faith. David Campanale, an Anglican former BBC journalist, is set to be replaced as the prospective MP candidate for Sutton and Cheam after allegations he did not sufficiently disclose his faith during the selection process - a claim which he denies.

    "Dave Myers's widow has said she misses the Hairy Bikers star \"terribly\" following his death from cancer at the age of 66.\nLili Myers spoke to BBC Radio Cumbria ahead of Dave Day on 8 June when thousands of bikers will travel from London to Myers's home town of Barrow, raising money for charity.\nShe said it would be an opportunity for her to celebrate the celebrity chef's life \"with a nation\".\n\"He always said, 'let's make the most of today, we don't know what will come tomorrow',\" Mrs Myers said.\nIt has been more than two months\u00a0since the death of Myers, who was one half of the Hairy Bikers TV cookery show duo along with Si King.\n\"He was the same person on and off screen,\" Mrs Myers said. \"Larger than life. I miss him terribly now. I miss that energy.\"\nMrs Myers said her husband had wooed her with a sandwich.\nThey had first met when Myers and King were filming part of their first series, 2006's The Hairy Bikers' Cookbook, in Romania.\nTheir Romanian producer had \"let them down\", so she took over, helping set up locations and interpreting.\n\"And that's how we started, just like that,\" she said.\nThey kept in touch for a couple of years by email, as the Hairy Bikers took Myers to places like India, Turkey, Mexico and Argentina.\n\"I got these beautiful emails from exotic parts of the world, talking to me about the culture, about the food, about the people that he met and that was magical for me,\" she said.\n\"It was seeing the world through his eyes. He was a genuinely beautiful man, beautiful soul, and it came across in his emails.\"\nWhen they met again in person, at his home in Barrow, he cooked her a meal.\n\"He put all his soul into that sandwich,\" she laughed.\nThey were married in Barrow in 2011.\nMyers and King's dynamic on and off screen was \"amazing\", Mrs Myers said, adding: \"They completed each other, they even completed each other's sentences because they knew each other so well.\"\nWhile best known for his cookery shows alongside King, Myers also appeared in the 2013 series of Strictly Come Dancing.\nMrs Myers said she had been in the studio for every episode, calling it a \"fantastic\" experience.\n\"Oh my god, that man could not dance, but he was dancing,\" she laughed.\nShe revealed Myers had gout, a form of painful inflammatory arthritis, when he was filming for the dancing competition.\n\"He made the most of every moment, and that's what I have learned from him,\" she said.\nMrs Myers said it had been difficult to hear of her husband's cancer diagnosis, but they had \"made the most of every day\".\n\"It wasn't an easy period of time,\" she said. \"I've watched this man die for a couple of years, every day, little by little.\"\nShe said she had been \"in awe\" when he had found the strength to film more episodes of the Hairy Bikers in between chemotherapy sessions.\nRecalling how she had driven him to wherever he was filming and then back to the hospital for treatment, she said she had encouraged him to keep shooting the series because \"it was his life\".\nShe said she had not watched the last episode of the Hairy Bikers, because it had been aired on a day when she was celebrating Myers with friends and family.\n\"I want to remember the man as he is,\" she said.\nNow Mrs Myers is looking forward to Dave Day, which she started setting up after friends and family asked if there would be a bike ride in his memory.\nThe event will raise money for The Institute of Cancer Research, London and NSPCC Childline, with thousands of bikers expected to take part.\n\"I never thought it would be this big and it's just a testament to how Dave has touched so many lives,\" she said.\nBarrow residents have offered to take in Dave Day bikers after many were left unable to find somewhere to stay for the night, with Mrs Myers saying the accommodation situation had \"surprised her completely\".\n\"I wanted to give Barrow something in return for the friendship and the kindness I felt, that we felt, when we lived there. And by god, I have so much in return,\" she said.\nMrs Myers has also apologised to people who will be travelling on the M6 during Dave Day, predicting it will be \"very busy\".\n\"It feels like I am not mourning on my own,\" she said. \"Mourning is not the right word... celebrating, I'm celebrating with a nation.\"\nHer husband would have loved the event, Mrs Myers said, adding: \"I think he's watching from wherever he is.

    "Women are being targeted and exploited by a rise in poorly evidenced, alternative treatments online as NHS services struggle to keep up with demand, doctors and campaigners have said.\nSome alternative treatments can clash with prescribed medications or mask more sinister symptoms.\nLiz O\u2019Riordan, a former breast surgeon who later developed breast cancer three times, said she had \"no idea\" what her patients were looking at online before becoming unwell herself.\nShe said: \"The minute I was diagnosed with cancer, there were people online telling me to use iodine, or to detox and cut out sugar or do a keto diet \u2013 had I tried this drug, or that drug?\n\"I had no idea how much misinformation was out there. It can be like conspiracy theories and cults \u2013 and cancer is really terrifying.\"\nShe said she understood the appeal of glowing testimonials for products online, with promises of cures at great cost, so had tried to use her experience to bridge the gap.\nSome of the herbs and supplements advertised can interact with cancer treatments like tamoxifen, she added.\n\"I used to have 10 minutes to tell someone they\u2019ve got cancer and what treatment they\u2019re going to have.\n\"It\u2019s not enough \u2013 we don\u2019t have enough time to go through the medical treatments, let alone survivorship issues.\"\nShe added the internet had \u201cexploded\u201d with targeted ads on social media and testimonials that \"could be written by AI\".\nMs O\u2019Riordan is one of those speaking at the Everywoman Festival in Cardiff, now in its second year, started by colorectal surgeon Julie Cornish.\nMs Cornish said she had seen a small number of patients in her clinics in recent years who had paid for alternative treatments with unqualified practitioners.\nShe said some had cancers that could have been successfully treated had they come sooner and some \"red flag\" symptoms not being overlooked.\n\"Irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS, is one of the key areas,\" she said.\n\"The concern I have is that patients are self-medicating, but it\u2019s a diagnosis of exclusion and you have to make sure you\u2019ve ruled out an underlying cancer or condition first.\n\"Once you\u2019ve got an IBS diagnosis, some of the complementary therapies can be useful for some people, but some advertise 'successful' regimes that are expensive and don\u2019t necessarily have the evidence to back it up.\"\nShe said she had seen a rise in expensive probiotics with supplements and claims of \"100% treatment success\", but \"these bespoke vitamin complexes can be somewhat misleading\".\nShe set up the Everywoman Festival, a series of talks and workshops on a range of health issues, to educate women on what is normal and reduce the associated stigma.\nOnline health misinformation is not just limited to cancer patients or to a certain age range.\nMolly Fenton, 21, founded Love Your Period at 16 and said she had seen girls as young as eight being given advice on supplements to \u201cbalance their hormones\u201d on social media.\n\"I hold my hands up and say that I\u2019m one to search on TikTok for anything, before I search on Google, but it\u2019s very hard to fact-check what someone is putting into a video,\" she said.\n\"You could get some really good content, but then you could also get some really harmful or bad content and deciphering between the two is really difficult because there\u2019s no tool in place to allow that to happen.\n\"Women\u2019s health is the perfect marketing opportunity at the moment,\" she said.\n\"It\u2019s a very vulnerable space because there is a huge gap in the market due to there being a lack of education and a lack of knowledge.\"\nMs Fenton said she was regularly approached to endorse products on social media, but never had due to concerns over credibility.\n\"If it\u2019s got a pink box, they\u2019ll essentially try and get you to sell it.\"\nMenopause Support founder Diane Danzebrink, said conversation around the condition had increased, but also become a \"very competitive, commercialised landscape\".\n\"I\u2019ve seen lots of headlines in trade publications about the menopause bandwagon and how much the menopause space is worth. So it\u2019s clear that brands and marketers are very aware of this space,\" she said.\n\"Social media has expanded significantly around menopause, and it can be very positive and make people have their light-bulb moment and recognise what\u2019s happening to them. \n\"But it\u2019s also really important to recognised there can be a lot of misinformation as well.\"\nMs Danzebrink said the health risks to these products may be low \u2013 though some products can have contraindications with prescribed medicines \u2013 but there are other issues.\n\"I remember one person who came to talk to me about their menopause experience and she brought 12 different supplements that she was taking, with a significant monthly cost.\n\"I asked which ones are working and her response was, 'I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m too scared not to take them'.\"\nThrough a campaign called Make Menopause Matter, she has long called for mandatory training for healthcare practitioners, which she said would help reduce waiting times a",

    "Plans for a new film studio backed by Titanic director James Cameron have been given the thumbs down by local residents.\nIn a parish poll, 85% of those who voted opposed plans to build Marlow Film Studios on greenbelt land near the Buckinghamshire town.\n\"This sends a clear message to councillors and to the developers,\" said a spokesperson for the campaign group Save Marlow's Greenbelt.\nHowever, film studio chief Robert Laycock said turnout was low, and the poll was being used by groups to \"suggest widespread opposition to our planning application\".\nEighteen per cent of the electorate turned out for the Marlow parish poll, with 1,730 people voting against Marlow Film Studios being built and 302 voting in favour.\nThe studio has said the studio, on the site of former gravel pits next to the A404 near Marlow,  would generate \u00a33.5bn per decade and create 4,180 jobs.\nIt has also outlined plans to invest more than \u00a320m in roads and other public infrastructure. \nIn April, Cameron, who also directed Aliens, wrote a letter to Buckinghamshire Council telling them how he was impressed with the plans for the studio, which he said could be a base for his company Lightstorm 3D and could also host a training centre.\nHe told the council he hoped the studios would be the \"next evolution of 3D storytelling\".\nFollowing the poll on 9 May, Mr Laycock said: \"The low turnout, and the limited numbers who voted against the questions on the parish poll, do not suggest a high level of public opposition.\" \nHe added that independent polling carried out over the last week indicated that \"over 80% of local residents within a five-mile radius of the studios surveyed support the film studios\".  \n\"They know the benefits our proposals will bring to the local area in terms of long-term careers, jobs and economic prosperity.\"\nHe added the council had received 4,982 letters in support of the application and 2,792 against.\nBuckinghamshire councillors deferred their decision on the studio so they could consider greenbelt and road issues, despite the site being recommended for refusal by planning officers.\nSave Marlow's Greenbelt said the results of the poll were revealing \"ahead of the strategic sites committee meeting on 30 May\".\nJoy Morrissey, the Conservative MP for Beaconsfield, has also opposed the plans on three occasions because of her concerns for the greenbelt.\nIn a statement, the MP said she was pleased so many people had taken part in the parish poll.  \n\"For over 2,000 residents to vote in such a small five-hour voting window, with no postal votes available, shows this is an important issue for the local community,\" she said.  \n\"Eighty-five per cent of those residents voting to say they do not want the development to go ahead is a decisive message.\"\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Scientists say they have identified the biggest climate change threats to one of Scotland's most fragile environments.\nSt Kilda more than 40 miles (64km) west of the Western Isles is home to thousands of sea birds, and also unique sub-species of mouse and wren.\nA new study suggests rising temperatures, more frequent and severe storms and changes to ocean currents pose the greatest risks to the archipelago.\nNational Trust for Scotland (NTS), which manages St Kilda, said it was already seeing the impact of warmer seas on the food chain that supports the islands' birds.\nSt Kilda, a group of small islands and rocky sea stacks, were abandoned by its last 36 islanders in 1930.\nThe main island of Hirta is inhabited on a temporary basis by visiting NTS workers and also volunteers, scientists and contractors who work at small Ministry of Defence site.\nThe archipelago is a Unesco dual World Heritage Site, the status recognising its cultural and natural qualities.\nScientists looked for climate change threats using an assessment tool called the Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI).\nSusan Bain, NTS manager for St Kilda, said the study warned that in the future the trust would face increasingly difficult challenges managing the archipelago.\nShe said: \"Warming sea temperatures are already impacting on the food chain for the hundreds of thousands of seabirds who breed here each summer, and some species are at risk of disappearing from St Kilda forever. \n\"Changing currents could compound this even further, fundamentally changing the habitats and with that the types of birds that can thrive here.\"\nA 2023 count of four seabird species suggested numbers had declined overall by 61%.\nMs Bain said stormier weather could damage historic properties on Hirta and make it harder for staff, volunteers and tourists to visit the islands.\nCVI assessments have been applied to world heritage properties in 15 countries.\nIn Scotland, Historic Environment Scotland (HES) and Australia's James Cook University have used the tool to examine the vulnerability of Neolithic heritage in Orkney, Edinburgh's Old and New Towns and the Roman Antonine Wall.\nCVI co-developer Prof Scott Heron said: \u201cPreparations continue for additional CVI applications, including analyses for... two other [Scottish] world heritage sites, New Lanark and the Forth Bridge.\"",
    "Prosecutors in Tunisia have arrested seven more sport officials over the failure to display the national flag at a swimming competition on Friday. \nThe heads of the Tunisian swimming federation and the national anti-doping agency were detained on Saturday after President Kais Saied reacted with fury to its absence.\nSeven other officials were summoned on Monday. \nIn response to sanctions by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), which had banned the Tunisian flag from competitions, it was covered on Friday during a championship organised by the national swimming federation at the Rad\u00e8s Olympic pool.\nHours after the incident,  Mr Saied visited the pool, raised the flag and sang the national anthem. \nCalling the flag-covering an \"act of aggression\", he declared: \"Tunisia cannot tolerate this.\"\nIn a meeting with Prime Minister Ahmed Hachani and other cabinet members, Mr Saied said \"Tunisia comes before the Olympic Committee and before any other committees\".\nIn a statement issued in the early hours of Saturday, the Tunisian youth and sports ministry announced the dissolution of the swimming federation board, as well as the dismissal of the head of the Tunisian anti-doping agency Anad and a sports official based in Ben Arous, near Tunis.\nThe decision followed \"instructions\" by President Saied \"to take immediate measures... against those responsible for the incident of hiding the national flag\", the statement said.\nMr Saied controls almost all levers of power in Tunisia.\nAnnouncing the ban on 30 April, Wada said Tunisia would not host major sporting events and is barred from flying its flag at sporting events, including the upcoming Paris Olympics and Paralympic Games in Paris in July and August, until it complied with the revised global anti-doping code introduced in 2021. \nOn 3 May the Tunisian sports ministry announced that it had issued a decree mandating adherence to the new code, in response to the sanctions, and urged \"expedited procedures\" to ensure sanctions were lifted ahead of the Olympic and Paralympic games. \nThe sanctions have not yet been lifted. \nTunisia has one defending Olympic swimming champion, the 2021 400m freestyle gold medallist Ahmed Hafnaoui.\nThe 21-year-old said on 8 May that he was suffering from an unspecified injury and might not compete in Paris.\nPresident Kais Saied came to power in 2019 and in July 2022 Tunisians voted to give him sweeping new powers in a move critics say risked the return of authoritarian rule to the country.\nMr Saied has justified his actions by saying he needed new powers to break a cycle of political paralysis and economic decay.\n\n",
    "Shares in GameStop, the video game retailer whose popularity among pandemic-era traders helped coin the idea of a meme stock, are surging again. \nTheir rise follows the online reappearance of Keith Gill, known as \"Roaring Kitty\", who was credited with helping the struggling firm's shares explode in January 2021, contrary to the bets of many professional Wall Street firms. \nGameStop shares jumped more than 70% in morning trade on Monday, to more than $30, as investors piled into the stock.\nThough the price later fell a bit, it marked their highest level since 2022.\nMr Gill was one of the most high-profile figures among the swarm of independent traders who swapped investment tips online and drove a buying frenzy for Gamestop and other firms, putting pressure on hedge funds who had been expecting the shares to fall.\nShares in GameStop crashed back to earth within weeks. \nThey have spent much of this year trading for less than $15 apiece, after the firm announced job cuts and a decline in sales at the end of last year.\nThe story of the surprise rise in GameStop shares, which led to similar moves for other companies including Odeon Cinemas-owner AMC, sparked congressional hearings about market manipulation and inspired the 2023 movie \"Dumb Money\", which starred Paul Dano and Seth Rogen.\nMr Gill told Congress he used social media for fun and called the idea he was pushing the shares on unwitting investors \"preposterous\".\nHe has not posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, since mid 2021. \nThen on Sunday Mr Gill posted a drawing of a man leaning forward in a chair, as if gearing up for action.\nHe later followed up with two posts on Monday morning, which appeared to allude to his return.\nThe meme-stock phenomenon has been part of a wider increase in trading by retail investors - people not working for investment houses or other private firms.\nAnalysts had argued the original rise of meme stocks was driven by the surge in savings and time many households had during the pandemic, thanks to government support programmes and the shutdown of many in-person activities.\nHowever with markets rising again this year, trading firms such as Charles Schwab and Robinhood have reported another uptick in new accounts and activity by retail investors.",
    "A mother whose nine-month old baby died after choking at a nursery in Kent was concerned that his food was not being pureed by staff, an inquest has heard.\nOliver Steeper died six days after he choked at Jelly Beans day nursery, in Ashford, on 23 September 2021.\nZoe Steeper said she found chunks of pineapple in her son\u2019s vomit when he was violently sick on 16 September.\nMrs Steeper was asked at the inquest if anyone at the nursery had sought her permission to start trying Oliver on non-pureed food. She said no.\nAsked if Oliver had any previous history of choking, her response was again no.\nMrs Steeper said: \"The majority of his food at home was purees.\"\nThe inquest heard Oliver, who only had two front teeth, had been eating pureed meals at home, and his parents had been assured by nursery workers that solids could be blended before being fed to him.\nShe said: \"We assumed that food would be pureed. He wasn't able to chew. That made us extra cautious.\"\nThe inquest heard how Mrs Steeper intended to speak with staff at the nursery after finding the pineapple chunks in her son\u2019s vomit.\nShe said: \"He had been given fruit salad at nursery. It was clear it wasn't pureed. I said I was going to speak to the nursery the following week.\"\nJurors heard Mrs Steeper considered emailing the nursery immediately, but did not want to \"rock the boat\" or make staff feel she was \"being pushy\".\nOliver then spent some time off nursery with tonsillitis.\nMrs Steeper said she tried to raise the issue with staff in person when she dropped him off on 23 September, but said: \"I felt rushed because I was dropping him off late. The lady I gave him to seemed rushed. Another child was holding her leg.\"\nMrs Steeper said she received a phone call at about 11.30 BST the same day saying her son had choked on his lunch and was with paramedics.\n\u201c[The paramedic] was running out with Oli in his arms doing chest compressions.

    "The close relationship between a Saudi-backed football club and a local authority  has been criticised by human rights campaigners.\nBBC File on 4 has discovered a senior Newcastle City Council officer wrote to Newcastle United (NUFC) co-owner Amanda Staveley asking her to lobby government ministers over repairs to the Tyne Bridge when funding from the Department for Transport stalled.\nSaudi Arabia's human rights record was raised when the club was taken over in 2021, but there are concerns it is being ignored by a council desperate for investment.\nNUFC declined to comment. The Saudi Embassy in the UK and Ms Staveley have not responded. The council said close co-operation with the football club was beneficial for the city. \nA spokesman for the local authority said the investment it brought to the city \"ultimately puts money in the pockets of all our residents\".\n\nLast year, Ms Staveley, a minority shareholder who has become the face of the club\u2019s Saudi ownership, asked senior council officer Michelle Percy to prepare a briefing ahead of a meeting she was having with Lord Dominic Johnson, a UK investment minister.\nThe briefing concentrated on attracting Saudi investment to the north-east of England.\nEmails obtained through a Freedom of Information (FOI) request by the campaign group NUFC Fans Against Sportswashing, and seen by File on 4, reveal Ms Percy then wrote to Ms Staveley in January.\nShe complained a grant for the restoration of the Tyne Bridge had not been signed off by the government and asked for help in \"reaching out to the PM and ministers at a high level\".\nMs Staveley then wrote to two figures in government, whose names have been redacted, asking for help to \"expedite the process of releasing this vital funding\".\nWithin three weeks, the government confirmed it was awarding the council \u00a335m to help restore the bridge.\nThe Department for Transport (DfT) said, by the time Ms Staveley\u2019s email was received, the business case for the Tyne Bridge was already in the final stages of approval and the email played no part in the release of the funding.\nFile on 4 has discovered the council backtracked on plans to create a forum to discuss human rights with supporters and campaigners, which it proposed when the football club was bought by the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) in October 2021.\nAt the time, the Premier League received \"legally binding assurances\" from the PIF, which provided 80% of funds for the deal, that the Saudi state would not control Newcastle United.\nHowever, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed Bin Salman, is the chairman of the PIF and its governor is Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the director of Newcastle United.\nSaudi Arabia has been widely criticised for human rights abuses, including the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Embassy in Istanbul in 2018. \nIt was accused last week of ordering the killing of villagers who stood in the way of a futuristic city under construction in the desert called NEOM.\nThe council said it \"shares\" concerns about human rights across the world but argued it was up to the UK government to address these issues.\nResults from another FOI submitted by the campaign group suggest the council asked the club for \u00a323m to help fund a free meal for every child in the city every day for a year.\nThe local authority has had to cut \u00a3369m from its budget since 2010.\nDirector of human rights research group Fair Square, Nick McGeehan, said: \"I think it's a huge problem when a cash-strapped local council has very strong links to a capital rich, very wealthy foreign state, particularly when that foreign state is deeply autocratic and anti-democratic.\n\"That poses a risk to the council because it means, in certain situations, the council is not going to stand up for local values or principles, but will keep quiet in order to satisfy the commercial interests of its foreign partner.\"\nFollow BBC Newcastle on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Lebanon is worried that Israel might intensify its offensive against the Lebanon-based Shia militant group Hezbollah, the country\u2019s foreign minister has said, as the conflict between the two sides escalates along the border.\nIn an interview with the BBC, Abdallah Bou Habib said it was unlikely Israeli forces would cross into Lebanon but that there could be more fierce air strikes.\nIsrael and Hezbollah have exchanged near-daily strikes and counter-strikes since October, when Hezbollah launched rockets at Israel in support of the Palestinians in Gaza a day after the deadly Hamas attack on Israel.\nThe violence has killed civilians, Israeli soldiers and Hezbollah fighters and led to the displacement of tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border, raising fears of another major confrontation between Hezbollah and Israel, which fought a devastating month-long war in 2006.\n\u201cAs a government, we\u2019re concerned,\u201d Mr Bou Habib said in the interview in Beirut. \n\u201cIf there\u2019s an escalation, it\u2019ll be from the skies... I don\u2019t think Israel will [carry out] a land invasion... Whatever they want to achieve from land, they can achieve from the skies, and they have dominance in the skies.\u201d\nAbout 60,000 people from northern Israel remain evacuated and Israel has reinforced military positions near the frontier, while repeatedly threatening to expand the offensive against Hezbollah if diplomacy fails to de-escalate the situation.\nLast week, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant warned of a \u201chot summer\u201d along the border, days after saying a war would mean \u201ccatastrophe\u201d for Hezbollah and Lebanon.\nIt remains unclear, however, what an escalation of Israel\u2019s campaign could involve, and whether the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would be able to fight on two fronts simultaneously, as the war against Hamas in Gaza continues.\nA wider conflict would be damaging for Israel too. Hezbollah - Iranian-backed and long considered by Israel to be a much more formidable enemy than Hamas - has an arsenal that includes precision-guided missiles able to strike deep into Israeli territory.\n\u201cThe [Israeli] minister of defence has been saying, \u2018We\u2019ll return Lebanon to the Stone Age' [in the event of a war with Hezbollah]. [But] we\u2019re neighbours, no matter what, geographically, and I don\u2019t think he wants a country in the Stone Age next to his. [Because] that means he\u2019ll be in trouble as well,\u201d Mr Bou Habib said.\n\u201cI think these words, a lot of [Western] ambassadors tell us, are for domestic consumption, more than for us.\u201d\nMr Bou Habib\u2019s comments came at the end of a particularly violent week on both sides of the border. \nIsraeli attacks killed at least seven people in southern Lebanon, including two Hezbollah fighters and a technician who had been fixing a phone tower, according to local authorities. In Israel, the IDF said Hezbollah attacks killed three of its soldiers in the north of the country.\nSince October, Israeli strikes have killed more than 350 people in Lebanon, mostly fighters belonging to Hezbollah and allied groups but also more than 50 civilians. In Israel, attacks from Lebanon have killed more than 20 people, including at least a dozen soldiers.\nHezbollah says the attacks with rockets, anti-tank missiles and explosive drones are in support of Hamas, aimed at diverting Israeli troops from Gaza to the border with Lebanon. Both groups are considered terrorist organisations by the UK, the US and others, and are part of the so-called Axis of Resistance, an alliance of factions across the Middle East supported by Iran.\nIn southern Lebanon, a Hezbollah stronghold, villages are empty as an estimated 90,000 residents have fled. Houses and other buildings lie destroyed while agricultural fields have been burned by white phosphorus dropped by Israel, Mr Bou Habib said. Experts have warned that those strikes are likely to have a long-term impact on the environment, which could make the areas uninhabitable.\nUntil now, the attacks have been largely contained to areas along the Lebanon-Israel border, as Hezbollah has taken steps to avoid sparking an all-out conflict. Israeli strikes, however, have increasingly hit targets deep inside Lebanon, including the eastern city of Baalbek, another Hezbollah stronghold.\nLebanon\u2019s government, which has limited influence over the group, has called for the full implementation of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, to solve the current Israel-Hezbollah conflict. The text was approved to end the 2006 war, which started after Hezbollah killed eight Israeli soldiers and kidnapped two others in a cross-border attack.\nThe resolution includes the withdrawal of armed groups from southern Lebanon, between the Litani river and the Blue Line, the unofficial frontier with Israel. Both countries have accused each other of violations, while Lebanon says Israel still holds Lebanese territory, after the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000 - something Israel and the UN deny.\n\u201cAs long as we have occupied lan",
    "The destruction of community and people being priced out of the area they have lived in for decades - these are the fears voiced by residents after regeneration plans were unveiled for their housing estate in Birmingham. \nThe transformation of Druids Heath, which was recently the backdrop for BBC drama This Town, has been in the pipeline for generations.\nPeni Whelan said plans to demolish 1,800 homes and replace them with 3,000 new ones would be the death of the estate\u2019s history and culture, while others said they faced losing homes they had lived in all their lives.\nBirmingham City Council said plans were still subject to an extensive consultation.\nArtists' impressions unveiled two weeks ago showed the authority's vision for the estate, with the homes due to be built with higher specifications alongside more green space.\nAll the homes in the south and north east of the estate will be demolished in several phases that will take up to 20 years to complete. \nMs Whelan, who runs the community radio station Hope Radio, said people would not be able to afford to move back once the work was complete.\n\"It's not a regeneration. It's a demolition,\" she told the BBC.\n\"It's a destruction of an entire community. People here love their houses, families live here and there is a sense of community that has been built since the 1960s.\n\"All our history, culture, connections - our network will die.\"\nThe 56-year-old said when the demolition began, locals would be \"dispersed\".\n\"As far as we\u2019re concerned it's pretty pictures and promises,\" she added.\nDavid Pitt, whose property is included in the third phase of the demolition, said he was worried about losing his family home.\n\"I've lived here all my life, my parents moved in here in 1967 when the house was brand new,\" the 53-year-old said.\n\"I'm worried and stressed because I don't want to move. \n\"This is my family home and there are no concrete promises on whether I'll be able to come back.\"\nThe former carpenter, who lives on Manningford Road, said the plans were \"daunting\" and questioned whether there would be enough social housing for him to come back to.\nWhen asked whether the plans could have a positive impact on the community, he said: \"When its completed, it will be an area everyone will want to live in - but will we be even be able to afford it?\".\nBirmingham City Council's initial plans to demolish the estate's tower blocks were approved by its cabinet six years ago. \nBut one resident said plans for its transformation had been around for much longer. \nPat Hollinshead, who has lived on the estate since 1986, said: \"We've had promises about the regeneration since my daughter was 18 months old. \n\"She's 45 years old now and still nothing's been done.\"\nThe 68-year-old, who runs Manningford Community Centre, said that while she backed the council's plans for change, the timescale was concerning.\n\"I agree with the plans - they\u2019re lovely. But by the time they\u2019re done, I\u2019ll be kicking up the daisies. \n\"People around here are worried to death.\"\nJulien Pritchard, Green Party councillor for Druids Heath & Monyhull, said: \"When I saw the plans I was taken aback by the extent of the demolition being proposed, and so are many residents.\n\"Druids Heath absolutely needs investment, having been forgotten for decades. \n\"But the council has to do this regeneration with residents, not to them. \nA spokesperson for Birmingham City Council said the current version of the masterplan was still only a proposal that was \"subject to extensive consultation with the community of Druids Heath and costs are not yet finalised as a result\".\nOn the funding behind the project, they added: \"The regeneration will be part funded by the council. \n\"The council will need to seek additional investment to fund the regeneration by working with private sector developers as well as other partners like housing associations.\"",
    "A group of current and former politicians from nine countries have demanded to be called as witnesses in the trial of Hong Kong\u2019s imprisoned media mogul and democracy activist, Jimmy Lai.\nThe group, including former UK Conservative party leader Iain Duncan Smith and Japan\u2019s former defence minister Gen Nakatani, say that they have been cited dozens of times in evidence presented during Mr Lai\u2019s national security case.\nDespite this, they have not formally been contacted about the trial - which the letter says \"undermines the integrity of the investigation\".\nMr Lai has been accused of colluding with foreign forces under the Beijing imposed national security law.\nIf found guilty, the 76-year-old founder of the now defunct pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily, is facing possible life in prison.\nHis case, which began last December after a year-long delay, has sparked an international outcry and is widely seen as a test of Hong Kong's judicial independence.\nIn a joint letter - seen exclusively by the BBC - the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance (IPAC) on China say its members have been cited more than 50 times in Jimmy Lai\u2019s national security trial, and have requested to submit evidence to the court.\n\u201cThe fact that IPAC as 'witnesses' or 'accomplices' to an alleged crime have never been approached by the Hong Kong authorities is revelatory of the degree to which the integrity of this trial is in question,\" said Luke De Pulford, the executive director of the IPAC.\n\"This case was never about the truth,\" Sir Iain added. \"But we now have an opportunity to see how far English common law used in Hong Kong, respected by the world over, has been traduced by the national security law of China.\"\nHong Kong insists it is still underpinned by the rule of law, upheld by a common law legal system inherited from the British.\nBeijing has also previously dismissed IPAC as being \"anti-China\".

    "Testifying just a few feet away from his former boss of a decade, Michael Cohen walked a Manhattan courtroom through the highs and lows of working behind-the-scenes for Donald Trump, a man for whom he once pledged to take a bullet. \n\"The only thing that was on my mind was to accomplish the task, to make him [Trump] happy,\" Cohen told the court on Monday.  \nMr Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges of falsifying business records, relating to a hush-money payment Cohen, his former lawyer and fixer, claims he made to an adult-film star on the former president's behalf. \nLeading up to Cohen's testimony, Mr Trump and his ex-attorney traded fiery insults on social media. \nBut on Monday, the former friends didn't even glance at each other as Cohen - calm and collected - told the court about their tumultuous past. \nOver five hours of testimony, he shed light on what being the New York businessman's fixer involved, including burying women's stories that could be damaging and lying when necessary. \nMonday was one of the few times the two have been in the same room recently, since Cohen, 57, came to work for Mr Trump, 77, decades ago. \nThe son of a Holocaust survivor from Long Island, Cohen never wanted to be a lawyer, he testified, saying his grandmother pressured him into it. \nBut after going to law school, he found himself working at a personal injury firm, where he did some \"legal\" and \"non-legal\" work for Mr Trump, he testified. \nIn 2007, Cohen said he accepted a job as Mr Trump's special counsel, a role with a base salary of $375,000 (\u00a3298,000).  \nIt was a coveted job for Cohen, who would remain in the role for 10 years. \nMr Trump sent staff to pack up his old office and gave him his daughter Ivanka's office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower, not far from his boss, Cohen said. Eventually he moved to an office even closer to Mr Trump, whom he called \"the Boss\".  \nIt was \"an amazing experience in many, many ways\", Cohen said, calling the Trump Organization a \"big family\". \nHe reported directly to Mr Trump, on \"whatever concerned him, whatever he wanted\", Cohen said, calling his ex-boss a micromanager. \n\"Everything required Mr Trump's sign-off,\" he said. \nAt the same time, Mr Trump was careful about paper trails, Cohen said. The Trump Organization founder never had an email address, telling Cohen that \"emails are like written papers\". \n\"There are too many people who have gone down as a direct result of having emails that prosecutors can use in a case,\" Cohen said Mr Trump once told him. \nBBC News reporters are in the Manhattan courtroom covering the historic first criminal trial of a former US president. You'll find their updates and analysis on the BBC news website and app, and across TV, radio and podcasts.\nAt first, Cohen's work involved negotiating bills from vendors that Mr Trump thought were unreasonable, he said. \nWhen he did well, Mr Trump told him so, he said. That left Cohen feeling \"on top of the world\", he told the court. \nBut working for Mr Trump sometimes required unethical practices, Cohen alleged. Asked by prosecutors whether he would lie on Mr Trump's behalf, Cohen said yes. \nThat was sometimes required to \"resolve the task\", he said. \nAfter Mr Trump announced his run for president in 2015, Cohen's role expanded to include other scandalous practices: facilitating catch-and-kill schemes, which meant buying women's stories of alleged sexual encounters with Mr Trump to ensure they were never published. \nIt was an arrangement designed to boost Mr Trump's chances of winning the election, Cohen testified. \nThe point was to \"do everything within our power to protect Mr Trump\", Cohen said.

    "US President Joe Biden has ordered a Chinese-owned cryptocurrency miner and its partners to sell land they own near a US nuclear missile base, citing spying concerns.\nMineOne Partners, which the White House says is majority-owned by Chinese citizens, has been given 120 days to sell the property, where it runs a crypto-mining operation.\nThe land is less than a mile (1.6km) away from an air force base in Wyoming, where intercontinental ballistic missiles are stored.\nBBC News has contacted MineOne Partners and China's embassy in the US for comment.\n\"The proximity of the foreign-owned Real Estate to a strategic missile base... and the presence of specialised and foreign-sourced equipment potentially capable of facilitating surveillance and espionage activities, presents a national security risk\", the White House said in a statement.\nFrancis E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming is home to Minuteman III nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles.\nMineOne bought the land close to the military base in 2022 and later installed cryptocurrency mining equipment.\nThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS), a powerful body that scrutinises deals for national security security threats, was not notified about the purchase by the company, the White House said.\nAuthorities were alerted to the transaction after a tipoff from a member of the public.\nThe inter-agency panel, which is led by the US Treasury Department, determined that the purchase had national security implications.\nPresident Biden's decision to force MineOne to sell the land \"highlights the critical gatekeeper role that CFIUS serves to ensure that foreign investment does not undermine our national security\u201d, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.\nThere has been growing concern among US lawmakers about Chinese purchases of property near sensitive military facilities.\nThe latest announcement from the White House comes just a day before the Biden administration is set to sharply increase tariffs on several Chinese imports, including electric vehicles.",

The great thing is he's a very good pilot indeed. So that's encouraging,\" said the King.\nHe spoke in front of an Apache helicopter on display at the Army Flying Museum at the corps' base in Middle Wallop.\nPrince William was formerly an RAF search and rescue pilot, spending three years at RAF Valley in Anglesey.\nAhead of Monday's handover, Kensington Palace posted images of his last two visits to the Army Air Corps - in 1999 and 2008 - with the caption \"time flies\". \nLater in the day, the Prince of Wales embarked on his first engagement with the Army Air Corps - receiving a briefing on its work and inspecting training and operational aircraft.\nThe King did not mention his younger son, Prince Harry, who flew Apaches in Afghanistan, where he served two tours of duty.\nThere was also no meeting with the King when Prince Harry was in the UK last week, with Prince Harry's spokesman saying the King had too full a diary.\nPrince Harry and his wife Meghan then went on a visit to Nigeria, including events linked to charities and his Invictus Games project.\nAfter the King left the handover ceremony, Prince William went on to carry out his first engagement in his new role - viewing training and getting a briefing on the current work of the Army Air Corps.\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis straight to your inbox every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

    "Billionaire philanthropist Melinda French Gates has said she will resign as a co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\"This is not a decision I came to lightly,\" Ms Gates wrote in a statement posted to X on Monday. \nHer last day of work will be 7 June. \nMs Gates started the foundation - the largest private body of its kind - in 2000 with her then-husband Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder.\nIn 2021, after 27 years of marriage, the pair announced their separation, but pledged to carry on with their joint philanthropic work. At the time of their split, the former couple said they would remain co-chairs and trustees of the organisation and that no changes to the foundation's structure were expected. \nThe Gates Foundation is among the most powerful groups in public health, with an endowment of more than $75bn (\u00a359.7bn) as of December. It spends billions of dollars every year on initiatives aimed at eradicating infectious diseases, reducing poverty and combatting climate change.\nAccording to the foundation's website, the couple donated more than $36bn (\u00a328bn) of their own wealth to it from 1994 to 2018.\n\"I am immensely proud of the foundation that Bill and I built together,\" Ms Gates wrote in her statement adding that under an agreement with Mr Gates, she will now have an additional $12.5bn for her own charitable work on women and families. \nIn 2015, Ms Gates founded investment company Pivotal Ventures, a separate entity from the Gates Foundation, which focuses on removing barriers to opportunity for women and minority groups. \n\"This is a critical moment for women and girls in the US and around the world - and those fighting to protect and advance equality are in urgent need of support,\" she wrote in Monday's statement. \nMr Gates said he was \"sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work\".\nThe Microsoft founder remains one of the world's richest men, with a net worth of more than $130.3bn, according to Forbes.

    "The UN says it is hopeful a newly opened crossing from Israel to Gaza will lead to a sustainable flow of aid into the north of the territory.\nScott Anderson, deputy head of the Palestinian refugee agency, told the BBC he hoped the entry of 36 flour trucks on Sunday was a positive sign.\nThe flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza has been hampered by the war, with Israel and aid groups trading blame.\nIsrael opened the Western Erez crossing point on Sunday.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Anderson said the refugee agency Unrwa hoped that a constant flow of aid would be established through the new crossing. \n\"We are very much hoping it is sustainable as it would allow us a way to get food and other needed supplies to the population that is in the north of the Wadi Gaza,\" he said, referring to a riverbed which spans the territory just south of Gaza City.\nFood, water and other basic supplies are most scarce in the north, where Israel's operation against Hamas began after the group's deadly attack on 7 October, and where fighting has recently resumed. \nLast week, the head of the UN's World Food Programme said displaced Palestinians there were experiencing a \"full-blown famine\".\nIsrael has long maintained that it is committed to facilitating deliveries of humanitarian aid into and within Gaza and has accused Hamas of stealing the aid designated for civilians.\nIn the south, where most Palestinians have sought refuge, the aid situation is worsening.\nDespite warnings from international allies, last week Israel instructed Palestinians sheltering in the east of Rafah to evacuate so that it could begin what it called a \"limited\" operation to eliminate Hamas from the area. \nIsrael then drove tanks to the Rafah crossing, which had been the main entry point of aid via Egypt, and shut it down on the Palestinian side. \nThe other point of entry in the south, Kerem Shalom, was closed prior to that after four Israeli soldiers were killed by rockets launched from Rafah by Hamas, according to the Israeli military.\nIsrael says the crossing has since reopened, but it now requires aid convoys to navigate an \"active combat zone\", Mr Anderson said.\nHe said the UN needed a \"fixed corridor\" of access to Kerem Shalom to be established, which would need the agreement of both Hamas and Israel.\n\"We need all the parties to the conflict to agree to make sure the truck drivers and the UN staff undertaking this operation are safe,\" he said.\nPart of the UN's operations in Gaza throughout the war has been to survey displaced Palestinians who are on the move, and track those who say they do not have access to food and water.\nUnrwa is currently tracking some 370,000 Palestinians in Gaza, Mr Anderson said.\nHundreds of thousands of Palestinians have heeded Israel's warnings to evacuate eastern Rafah and have begun their journey to what Israel has called an \"expanded humanitarian zone\".\nThis includes al-Mawasi, a coastal area largely made up of sand dunes, and parts of Khan Younis, which only recently was the focus of Israel's operations in Gaza.\nMr Anderson said neither area had the infrastructure to support the masses seeking shelter.\nIn al-Mawasi, \"everything people have access to, we have to truck in... which includes food, water, moving solid waste, so it's very much a makeshift camp,\" he said.\n\"People who are displacing to Khan Younis, it's very similar \u2013 there was infrastructure there, but that is still recovering from the Israeli operation that took place a few months ago.\"\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities.\nMore than 35,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",
    "Russia has said its forces have entered the north-eastern border town of Vovchansk, near Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv.\nUkraine's military said it had \"pushed the enemy back\" from the northern outskirts of the town, adding it had \"tactical successes\" in several areas.\nRussia has intensified its attacks on the region following Friday's surprise incursions across the border, seizing at least nine villages and settlements in one of the most significant ground attacks since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.\nThousands of civilians have fled towards Kharkiv.\nThere are concerns among Ukrainian commanders about what could happen if Russian troops get within artillery-range of the city.\nUkraine's army has said that Russia has deployed \"significant forces\" - up to five battalions - in its latest offensive and has acknowledged Moscow's troops have had some \"tactical success\".\nBut in an evening statement, the army said Russia had lost more than 100 soldiers since the start of the day, adding that Ukrainian forces were restoring old positions.\nIt said fighting was ongoing in 12 areas and had spread to the settlement of Staritsa, to the west of Vochansk.\nEarlier, it had said reserve forces were being moved to the Kharkiv region to reinforce its defences.\nSeparately, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced in his evening address that a new commander had taken charge of forces in Kharkiv.\nHe did not say when Brig Gen Mykhailo Drapatyi took over from his predecessor, Yuriy Halushkin.\nVovchansk, located 74km (45 miles) from Kharkiv, has been heavily bombed in recent days and officials in the surrounding region say Russia is now targeting settlements with glide bombs.\nWhile it is a significant town in the region, Vovchansk is not of specific military importance, though its capture would be a blow to Ukrainian morale.\nKharkiv regional head Oleh Syniehubov said Russia was deliberately trying to stretch the front line by attacking in small groups in new directions.\nHe told local TV that Ukrainian forces were holding Russian troops back but warned that fighting could spread to new settlements, according to Reuters. \nOn Telegram he described the situation as \"quite complicated\" with Russia continuing to advance.\nNearly 6,000 people having already been evacuated, he said, adding that 30 settlements had been struck by mortar or artillery shelling.\nSome 200-300 people remain in Vovchansk itself, he added.\nWhile it is thought this Russian cross-border incursion is unlikely to result in Kharkiv being captured, their gradual approach on this new, north-eastern front line only increases the anxiety for those living there. \nResidents fleeing towns and villages close to the fighting have been arriving in their hundreds at an aid hub in Kharkiv city. \nThey are being given food, and registering for shelter after leaving their homes.\nVeniamin, an 87-year-old resident of Vovchansk told the BBC he had left the besieged town by bicycle on Sunday \u2013 cycling 15km to safety. \nHe said as well as heavy shelling \"machine gun fire could be heard from both sides\".\n\"I had to run because it was impossible to be there,\u201d he said, adding the town had been cut off from electricity and water supplies.\nLiuda, another resident of Vovchansk, fled the town with her family, who lived in a village nearby. \n\"We escaped when we heard machine guns, the fire was coming close,\" she said. \nLiuda had remained in Vovchansk when the Russians first invaded in early 2022.\n\"We survived and got used to it,\" she said. \nLife improved when Ukrainian forces returned later that year, but she said this new Russian offensive \"was very scary\".\nNadia, her husband and mother had fled the village of Liptsy \u2013 near to where Russian forces have also made another incursion across the border. \nThey packed their belongings, including two dogs, into an old rusting Lada car and made the journey to Kharkiv. \nHer husband had wanted to stay \u201cbecause everything we had would be lost\u201d if they left. \nHowever, she said they were told by the local administration to leave or risk being stranded. \nNadia said: \"We lived under occupation in 2022, I don\u2019t want to be under occupation again.\"\nKostyantyn Tymchenko, who has also left Vovchansk, said he was shocked by how close the fighting was.\n\"On the one side [of the Vovcha River] are [Russians], on the other - ours,\" he said.\n\"Tanks are constantly approaching, shooting back and then leaving. I thought it would be okay. I was shocked. I wish I had known in advance.\"\nAway from Kharkiv, two people were killed by shelling in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, the Moscow-installed mayor has claimed. \nAnd at least three people were killed by a strike on an industrial zone in Krasnodon, known as Sorokyne in Ukrainian, a Russian-held part of eastern Ukraine, the Moscow-backed local governor said.\nSeparately, a Ukrainian security source said Ukrainian forces had struck an oil terminal and electrical substat",
    "One of Europe\u2019s most notorious people-smugglers has been arrested in Iraq following a BBC investigation.\nBarzan Majeed was arrested in Iraqi Kurdistan on Sunday morning, a senior government official said.\nFor several years, he and his gang were heavily involved in the people-smuggling trade - in boats and lorries - across the English Channel.\nThe BBC tracked down Majeed - also known as Scorpion - to the city of Sulaymaniya, where he said he had transported thousands of migrants across the channel.\n\u201cMaybe a thousand, maybe 10,000. I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t count,\u201d he said.\n\nA senior member of the Kurdistan Regional Government said that officials were able to use the BBC's findings to locate Majeed.\n\u201cIt was at 7am this morning that the arrest was made outside his home, they arrested him the moment he stepped out of the home and arrested him without any major problems,\u201d the official said.\n\u201cWe are now looking at charges against him here first and foremost, and then we will be discussing with European police and prosecutors who want to question him and deal with him.\u201d\nThe UK\u2019s National Crime Agency (NCA) also confirmed the arrest.\n\"We are grateful to the BBC for highlighting his case, and remain determined to do all we can to disrupt and dismantle the criminal networks involved in smuggling people to the UK, wherever they operate,\u201d it said in a statement.\nBetween 2016 and 2021, Scorpion's gang is believed to have controlled much of the people-smuggling trade between Europe and the UK.\nA two-year international police operation resulted in convictions for 26 members of the gang at courts in the UK, France and Belgium.\nBut Scorpion himself evaded arrest and went on the run.\nIn his absence, he was tried in a Belgian court and convicted of 121 counts of people-smuggling.

    "The European Union has lodged an official complaint with the organisers of the Eurovision Song Contest over its refusal to let participants wave the bloc's flag at last Saturday's final. \n\"Such actions cast a shadow over what is meant to be a joyous occasion for peoples across Europe,\" European Commission Vice-President Margaritis Schinas wrote to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).\nThe complaint comes after politician Dorin Frasineanu from the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party said he had been \"denied entry to Eurovision with the EU flag\".\nAccording to EBU rules only flags of \"participating countries and the rainbow/pride flags\" are allowed inside the contest venue. \nA spokesperson for the EBU said the flag policy this year was \"the same as 2023\". \n\"With the EU being targeted by malicious and authoritarian actors, EBU's decision contributed to discrediting a symbol that brings together all Europeans,\" said Mr Schinas in his complaint.\nHe demanded the broadcaster \"explain the rationale behind this decision and attribute responsibility where it is due\".\n\"The incoherence in the EBU's stance left myself and millions of viewers wondering for what and for whom the Eurovision Song Contest stands,\" Mr Schinas added.\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday afternoon, European Commission spokesperson Eric Mamer said it was \"completely regrettable that the flag of all the EU members taking part in the competition... could not be shown\".\nThe European Commission will \"make the point very clearly that there's no reason not to allow this flag, in fact we would encourage the EBU to allow and ensure it is shown\", Mr Mamer said. \nHe also clarified that as the Eurovision Song Contest was not organised by the EU, they could only make their views known and encourage the EBU to \"understand it was a mistake\".\nIn an interview with Politico, Mr Schinas said the EBU's decision to ban EU flags during Saturday's Eurovision final was a gift to \"the enemies of Europe\". \n\u201cWho wins from banning the EU flag from Eurovision?\u201d the commissioner added. \u201cOnly the Eurosceptics and the enemies of Europe.\u201d\nIn a statement to the BBC, the EBU said the flag policy had been agreed with SVT, the Swedish broadcaster and host of this year's contest, but stressed this did not feature an explicit provision to ban EU flags. \n\"As in previous years such as 2023, SVT's policy was to allow the flags of the participating countries and the rainbow flags. \n\"There has never been an express ban on the EU flag in the written policy,\" an EBU spokesperson said. \n\"Due to heightened geopolitical tensions, the flag policy was more rigorously enforced by security at this year's event.\"\nMEP and former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt wrote on X: \"As the EU flag is banned from Eurovision, people risk being beaten to demand a European path for Georgia. \n\"Freedom, democracy can never be taken for granted!\"\nThe row follows a string of controversies that marred this year's song contest, including the last-minute expulsion of Dutch entrant Joost Klein, the withdrawal of a contestant from rehearsals and another contestant breaking the rules with an on-stage speech calling for peace. \nThere were also tensions over Israel's presence in the competition and pro-Palestinian protests outside the venue.\nThe EU flag was not the only one under scrutiny, with the contest's winner Nemo - a 24-year-old Swiss musician who uses they/them pronouns - said they had to smuggle their own non-binary flag into the venue because Eurovision had refused to allow it.\nNemo said they \"did it anyway\", before calling out the \"double standards\" of the organisers who were reported to have forced some fans to throw away their non-binary flags before being allowed in.

    "Internet users in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda have been complaining about poor connectivity as service providers across East Africa acknowledge there has been a problem.\nThey have said they are working to fix it.\nThe patchy service was a result of faults in the under-sea cables that connect the region to the rest of the world through South Africa, industry expert Ben Roberts  told the BBC. \nA similar outage was experienced in parts of West and Southern Africa in March.\nOn Monday, some East Africans were still experiencing slow internet speeds with some telecom providers indicating that the issue was yet to be fully resolved and asking subscribers to be patient.\n\u201cWe are still working with undersea fibre cable team to have them resolve the issue,\u201d Airtel Kenya responded to a Kenyan user concerned about the problem. \nVodacom Tanzania  sent a similar message on social media to such queries.\nCloudflare Radar, which monitors internet connectivity, on Sunday said that Tanzania was one of the worst-affected countries with traffic falling to 30% of expected levels. \nTanzania's Citizen newspaper described what has happened as an \"internet blackout [that] has affected major network channels\".\nOn X, formerly known as Twitter, service providers have been fielding queries from frustrated customers.\nIn response to one Kenyan user who wanted to know if they would be able to watch Sunday's Manchester United versus Arsenal English Premier League match, Airtel Kenya said its team was working on the \"network issue\" and apologised.\nSafaricom, also in Kenya, said it was \"experiencing a challenge\".\nAirtel Ugandan has said it was aware of the \"intermittent internet service\".  And MTN Rwanda said there was \"an issue of degradation of international links\".\nMalawi, Mozambique and Madagascar have also been affected according to Cloudflare Radar.\nMr Roberts, from the pan-Africa company Liquid Intelligent Technologies, said that he had confirmed that one cable that runs alongside the coast of East Africa, known as Eassy, had been cut earlier on Sunday some 45km (28 miles) north of the South African port city of Durban.\nAnother cable was also cut. He ruled out the idea that it could be sabotage and said it was rather an unhappy coincidence.\nOther cables linking East Africa to Europe are also available and gradually the service should improve as data is re-routed. But as a lot of big companies have data centres in South Africa the damage to the vital link that Eassy provides had a big impact.\nIn March, widespread outages were reported in countries including South Africa, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Benin, Ghana and Burkina Faso.\nThis was also put down to cable failures.

    "The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is officially suspected of extremism, a German court has ruled.\nThe move, which upholds a lower-court ruling the party had challenged, means intelligence services can continue to monitor AfD activities and communications. \nThe party was founded in 2013 as a Eurosceptic group objecting to German-backed EU bailouts for southern Europe.\nBut as refugee numbers rose after 2015, the AfD morphed into a strident, ever-more radical anti-migration force.\nToday influential blocs within the AfD hold ethno-nationalist beliefs that define anyone with a migrant heritage as not \"properly German\" - even if they hold German citizenship.\nBecause of Germany's experience of dictatorship and oppression in the 20th Century, there are high legal hurdles to state surveillance of any political party.  \nBut on Monday the court in M\u00fcnster ruled that there was reason to believe that \"at least a significant part of the AfD\" aimed to \"grant German citizens with a migration background only a legally devalued status\".\nIn other words, the court suspects large parts of the AfD of wanting to create a two-tier society, where people judged to be \"ethnically German\" would have more rights than people whose families originally came from abroad. \nThis, according to the German constitution, would be illegal discrimination. \nMonday's court decision is a blow for the AfD, but the German government sees it as a victory. \"Today's ruling shows that we are a democracy that can be defended,\" said Interior Minister Nancy Faeser.\nIt shows that the German state has the tools needed to protect democracy from threats from within, she added. \nThe AfD denies that it is anti-democratic. Party leaders reject the ruling, accusing the judges of not providing enough evidence for their decision.\nLawyers for the AfD have said they will appeal against this ruling. But any further challenge can only focus on procedural problems, not the legal content of today's decision. \nThe AfD has been slipping recently in polls from the low-20s earlier this year to around 16%.\nThis is possibly partly because of mass anti-AfD protests across the country after it was revealed that party officials had attended a secret meeting where the deportation of people with non-German heritage was discussed. \nA numbers of scandals over alleged spying for China and suspected links to the Kremlin have also dented support.\nArguably a bigger problem for the AfD is that other right-wing parties are eating into their poll numbers.\nNew insurgent parties peddle a similar anti-migrant message and some mainstream conservatives are sounding increasingly radical when it comes to asylum seekers, in some cases even pushing for a UK-style Rwanda scheme.\nThe ruling could simply boost the far-right's support among core voters of the AfD, who tap into a narrative of victimisation and believe the party is being targeted by mainstream Germany. \nBut AfD leaders are rattled by such cases. While the party has become more radical over the years, its leaders are at the same time trying to detoxify the brand to appeal to undecided voters.\nIn rural parts of eastern Germany, the AfD is already a dominant force in some councils, sometimes even co-operating with other parties on grassroots local issues.\nBut on a regional and national level, no other party will work with the AfD to form coalitions, so until now it has been shut out of real political power.\nThis is why upcoming regional elections in three large eastern German states in September are so important.\nThe AfD comes first in polls in some regions and in the short term wants to enter a regional governing coalition. In the long term its aim is to enter national government.\nAnnouncements such as Monday's ruling make that more difficult - not only by putting off moderate voters, but also by firing up the debate about banning the AfD altogether.\nFor years discussions about a ban have surfaced regularly. Critics of the idea say that would simply play into the AfD's hands by boosting its narrative of victimisation.\nLegally it would also be difficult, time-consuming and possibly be rejected by the constitutional court.\nBut with each new scandal involving the AfD, calls grow louder from all mainstream parties to investigate whether there are at least sufficient grounds to try.",
    "A teenager who stabbed a British mother to death after breaking into her home in Australia has been jailed for 14 years.\nEmma Lovell, 41, was killed when confronting two intruders in Brisbane on Boxing Day in 2022.\nShe had emigrated from Suffolk in 2011 with her daughters and her husband Lee, who was also injured in the attack.\nThe offender, who cannot legally be named as he was 17 at the time, pleaded guilty to her murder earlier this year.\nHe also admitted to three other burglary and assault charges.\nIn the Brisbane Supreme Court on Monday, Justice Tom Sullivan said the man - now aged 19 - had committed a \"particularly heinous\" crime against the Lovells, who he described as a \"loving family\" building a life for themselves in a new country.\n\"They were ordinary citizens enjoying their family life in their home where they were entitled to feel safe. What happened... violated that entirely.\"\nJustice Sullivan noted that the offender had himself witnessed violence from a young age and began abusing drugs and alcohol at the age of 14 after the death of his grandmother.\nHowever, his childhood of \"deprivation\" did not outweigh the seriousness of the offence or warrant leniency in sentencing, he concluded, ruling that the teen serve a minimum of nine years and nine months in prison before being eligible for parole.\nAnother teenager charged over the incident is yet to enter pleas, with his case listed for a hearing in Brisbane later this month.\nThe court heard that Mr and Ms Lovell had been woken by their dogs on the night of the murder, confronting the teenage intruders and forcing them outside of their house, where a struggle then broke out in the garden.\nThere, Ms Lovell was fatally stabbed in the heart with an 11.5cm (4.5 inch) knife. \nPolice and paramedics responding to the attack had arrived to find her two teenage daughters sobbing over their dying mother. \nMedics performed open heart surgery on the front lawn of the home, but Ms Lovell died shortly after arriving at hospital.\nThe attack in the suburb of North Lakes, about 45km (30 miles) north of Brisbane, sparked community outrage and was among several cases which prompted the state of Queensland to controversially introduce stricter youth crime laws.\nThe court heard the teen responsible for Ms Lovell's death had been convicted of 84 offences in the past - more than a dozen of them break-in charges - although none of them had been violent crimes.\nMs Lovell's family had previously called for her killer to be jailed for life. Adults in Queensland face a mandatory life sentence for murder, however the offender had to be sentenced as a child due to his age at the time of the incident. \n\"I don't feel justice has been served one bit,\" Mr Lovell said, speaking outside of court in Brisbane - pointing out that his family had just one day earlier spent Mother's Day in grief.\n\"It was good to get 14 years but it's never going to be enough... it isn't going to bring Emma back.\"\nIn an emotional victim impact statement, Mr Lovell last week told the court he felt \"so lost in life\" without his best friend and wife of 22 years.\n\"The girls and I have had our futures robbed of us.\"\nA statement was also read out on behalf of Ms Lovell's mother, Marjorie Dowson, who said the loss of her daughter had \"left a big hole that can never be filled\".\n\"Her death has ruined my life,\" she said.",
    "Protests in Georgia have continued in a last-ditch effort to prevent the passing of a controversial law.\nAfter an overnight standoff with protesters outside parliament in Tbilisi, security forces pulled out from the main square on Monday morning.\nCritics of the governing Georgian Dream party say the foreign influence bill - which they describe as the \"Russia law\" - could be used to stifle dissent.\nThe final voting on the proposed legislation is scheduled for Tuesday. \nOn Monday morning, Georgian Dream lawmakers rushed it through a committee vote, approving it in 67 seconds.\nThe bill - now due to go for its third and final reading - targets civil society organisations and independent media that receive foreign funding.\nProtesters are concerned that it would be used by the government to clamp down on opponents, and would harm Georgia's hopes of joining the European Union.\nTens of thousands of demonstrators spent the night outside Tbilisi's parliament building, dancing as it rained through the dark hours. \nOnce the sun rose on Monday, MPs from the governing party arriving ahead of the session were met with shouts and chants of \"slaves\" and \"Russians\".\nRanks of police with shields and water cannon were stationed to allow legislators to get into the parliament building.\nPhotos and footage online appeared to show violent altercations between protesters and police.\nTwo US citizens and one Russian were among 20 people arrested at protests, Russian state news reported, citing the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs.\nProtesters plan to continue their noise through the parliamentary session in the hopes the sound will encourage MPs to reconsider voting for the bill.\nOpponents of the bill say the measures are inspired by Russian legislation passed in 2012, which they say has been used since then to crack down on critics of the Kremlin.\nThis proposed law would force non-governmental groups and media to register as \"organisations serving the interest of a foreign power\" if more than 20% of their funding comes from overseas.\nGeorgian Dream says the measure would increase transparency and defend Georgia's sovereignty.\nOn Sunday, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze vowed that his party would successfully pass it into law, despite the massive demonstrations that began nearly a month ago.\nThe country's opposition leaders have asked the UK to do more to oppose the bill, calling on Foreign Secretary David Cameron to speak out against it.\nLast week, the US said it was \"deeply troubled\" by the treatment of protesters and called for an independent investigation into reports of \"harassment and physical assault\".\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said the Georgian people want a \"European future\" and has called on legislators to \"stay the course on the road to Europe\".\nThe EU granted Georgia candidate status in December, but has warned the bill could jeopardise further progress within the bloc.\nGeorgian Dream has been in power since 2012, when it defeated a pro-Western government and vowed to normalise relations with Russia.\nThe party last won re-election in 2020. The opposition accused it of fraud and voter intimidation, but international observers - while criticising aspects of the process - said it had been competitive.\nThe next general election is due in October.",
    "A woman tricked out of her life savings by a conman who claimed to be a spy believes she will never get her money back.\nMark Acklom persuaded Carolyn Woods he was an MI6 agent and successful businessman in order to take her savings.\nShe says she lost \u00a3850,000 to him 12 years ago, and court action against him has been delayed until at least December 2024.\nAcklom, once named on the National Crime Agency\u2019s list of 10 most wanted fugitives, has been dubbed 'Britain\u2019s most notorious conman'.\nHe admitted defrauding Ms Woods of \u00a3300,000 in 2019, when he was extradited back to the UK from Spain.\nAcklom convinced Ms Woods to lend him money for renovation work at a string of properties he owned after he promised to marry her during their year-long relationship.\nShe said: \u201cThis has dragged on now for about 12 years. I don\u2019t really think I\u2019ll get any of the money back.\u201d\nMs Woods had recently split from her partner and sold her house when she met Mark Acklom at the shop where she worked in Tetbury, Gloucestershire in 2012.\nShe said: \u201cHe was very exciting at the time - until I realised how evil he was.\n\"He appears to give you what you want, but he just walks away with everything.\u201d\nShe said the lies he told her included claiming he was an undercover MI6 agent, often serving overseas with the British security services.\nOn one occasion, Ms Woods said she saw him walk calmly past armed guards outside the spy agency's HQ in London.\nShe now believes the guards were actors and the incident was staged.\n\u201cI look back and I think - especially with the money - how on earth did I behave like that? I\u2019m an intelligent, rational person.\n\u201cBut Mark Acklom told me he can read people like books within minutes. He knows people better than they know themselves.\n\"He knows exactly which buttons to press.\u201d\nMs Woods said Acklom put her up in a luxury flat in Bath and promised to marry her. He then persuaded her to loan him hundreds of thousands of pounds in a series of agreements.\nIn reality, he was living with his wife nearby while repeatedly lying to Ms Woods about why he couldn\u2019t spend time with her.\nHe was even using the money she had loaned him to pay for the flat in Bath.\nAt the same time, Acklom was also running a number of other scams in Bristol, Bath and Gloucestershire, with many small businesses and entrepreneurs left thousands of pounds out of pocket.\nAt one time, he claimed to have had a brain tumour removed. \nA fluent Spanish speaker, he eventually fled to Spain.\nMs Woods has never recovered any of her money, and says it has been hard to get her life back on track.\nAcklom was released from prison in Spain in 2023 after being extradited back there.\nThis came after he was jailed for nearly six years in the UK for defrauding Ms Woods.\nSince he pleaded guilty to fraud in 2019, efforts have been under way to recover money through the Proceeds of Crime Act.\nThese court proceedings can force criminals to repay money earned through crime - or face an additional jail sentence.\nA final hearing aimed at setting the amount of money Acklom needs to repay had been scheduled for April 2024, but has been pushed back until December because the judge was unavailable, following a diary clash.\nMs Woods said: \u201cI don\u2019t feel as though I\u2019m on an even keel. You just have to try and be positive and have some hope.\n\u201cAs you get older, all the things that I thought I'd be doing at this stage of my life are just impossible because there isn't the money.\n\u201cMost of all, I would just like to be independent and have my own place to live.\u201d\nForensic Accountant Claire Berrington has been involved in around 70 Proceeds of Crime confiscation hearings. She says the Proceeds of Crime Act allows for a default prison sentence if criminals fail to pay the money they are ordered to.\nShe said: \u201cIn many cases, these sentences are far more than the sentence for the original crime they committed. The prospect of spending more time in jail focuses the mind like nothing else.\u201d\nBut she acknowledges that criminals like Mark Acklom are adept at hiding their assets.\nShe says, \u201cI think it\u2019s very unlikely [Carolyn] will get it all back because in simple terms, [criminals] take the money and spend it.\n\"They tend to spend it on holidays and lifestyle. They\u2019re called lifestyle offences for that reason.\u201d\nBut she says the Proceeds of Crime Act is \u201cbroadly successful\u201d as a method of recovering criminal assets.\nMs Woods believes that as a lifelong fraudster, Acklom will know how to hide his money from the authorities.\n\u201cHis advice to me was never to have anything in your own name because somebody will come and steal it. So, I\u2019d be very surprised if they find he has got assets in his own name.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really think I\u2019ll get any of the money back.\n\"However I do think he should be obliged in law to pay me back whether I ever see the money or not.\u201d\nIn a statement, a Government spokesperson said, \u201cMore people are being brought before the courts... and our latest figures show the Crown Court sat more da",
    "Dozens of pro-Palestinian students at a US university commencement ceremony staged a walk-out ahead of a speech by veteran comedian Jerry Seinfeld.\nFootage on social media showed some robed graduates at Duke University, North Carolina, chanting and waving Palestinian flags in protest as the actor received an honorary degree on Sunday. \nSeinfeld has been a vocal supporter of Israel since the 7 October Hamas attacks and throughout the course of the war in Gaza.\nMany of the students at the ceremony stayed to listen to his speech, with several chanting words of support.\nThe incident happened as the 70-year-old was introduced on stage at the university's football stadium by the institution's president, Vincent Price. \nLoud booing and chants of \"Free Palestine\" could be heard in videos posted on social media.\nSome people sat in the surrounding rows could also be seen leaving as the actor began his speech. \nSeinfeld, who is a Jewish actor and among 700 entertainment industry figures who signed an open letter in support of Israel's right to defend itself following Hamas's attack, managed to deliver his speech without further interruption. \nSeveral in the crowd chanted \"Jerry, Jerry\" as he received his degree.\n\"A lot of you are thinking, 'I can't believe they invited this guy.' Too late,\" he said on Sunday, after pledging to \"defend\" the concept of privilege.\n\"I say, use your privilege. I grew up a Jewish boy from New York. That is a privilege if you want to be a comedian,\" he told the graduates.\nSeinfeld, who is the father of two students at Duke, visited a kibbutz in Israel in December and met with some of the families of hostages taken into Gaza by Hamas. \nIn a statement to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, following the ceremony, Duke University's vice president for communications, Frank Tramble, said: \"We understand the depth of feeling in our community, and as we have all year, we respect the right of everyone at Duke to express their views peacefully, without preventing graduates and their families from celebrating their achievement.\"\nThe demonstration was the latest in a series of pro-Palestinian protests that have rocked campuses across the US over the last few weeks.\nStudents have been calling for universities to boycott companies and individuals with ties to Israel amid the ongoing war.\nNational politicians called on colleges to take action, highlighting disorder and reports of antisemitism at some of the protests, and police have been used to clear encampments.\nColumbia University and the University of Southern California are among several to have cancelled or restructured their main graduation ceremonies.\nWaves of Hamas gunmen stormed across Gaza's border into Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people.\nMore than 34,900 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\n",
    "At least 41 people were killed after flash floods and \"cold lava\" flowing from a volcano hit the western Indonesian island of Sumatra.\nHours of heavy rain on Saturday swept torrents of ash and rocks down Mount Marapi, the most active volcano in Sumatra.\nThe mudslides inundated two districts, swept people to their deaths and damaged more than 100 homes, mosques and public facilities.\nSeventeen people are still missing.\nSurvivors recounted how they fled as the \"cold lava\" - a mixture of volcanic material and pebbles that flow down a volcano's slopes in the rain - flowed towards their homes.\n\"I heard the thunder and the sound similar to boiling water. It was the sound of big rocks falling from Mount Marapi,\u201d Rina Devina, a 43-year-old housewife from the Agam district told AFP news agency.\n\u201cIt was pitch black, so I used my cellphone as a torch. The road was muddy, so I chanted \u2018God, have mercy\u2019 over and over again,\u201d Ms Devina said.\nThe mother of three added that a neighbour's house had been \"flattened by big rocks\" and four of her neighbours died.\nThe phrase cold lava is a translation of the term \"lahar\" in Indonesian and Tagalog. Temperatures range between 0\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C, according to how they are formed, but are typically below 50\u00b0C, according to several academic reports on the phenomenon.\nA moving lahar resembles a \"roiling slurry of wet concrete\" that can grow in volume as it incorporates other debris in its path, said the US Geological Survey.\nBy Sunday afternoon, rescuers had found 19 bodies in the worst-hit village of Canduang in Agam district and recovered nine other bodies in the neighbouring district of Tanah Datar, according to the National Search and Rescue Agency.\nBerliana Reskyka, another Agam resident, spoke of his experiences helping his injured neighbours.\n\"There were some who were crying, hysterical, because some of their family members were not yet accounted for. There were also those who discovered their loved ones have died,\" Berliana told BBC Indonesian.\nThe deluge is the latest in a series of natural disasters that have resulted, at least in part, from human activities, environment experts told BBC Indonesian.\n\"Flash floods and cold lava mudslides continue to recur and increase in intensity due to excessive exploitation of natural resources and haphazard development,\" said Wengki Purwanto, the director of the West Sumatra branch of the Indonesian Forum for Environment.\n\"As a result, disasters repeat themselves every year. In fact, they increase in frequency every year. The distance between one disaster and the next becomes closer,\" he said.\nThe area around Mount Marapi has seen several similar disasters in the past six months. \nLast 5 December, 23 hikers were killed when the volcano erupted while in February this year, flash floods damaged dozens of homes in the Tanah Datar.\nJust last month, days of eruption threw huge clouds of ash - up to a height of 2km - into the sky. Flights in the region were disrupted, roads closed, and more than 11,000 people were told to evacuate.\nMarapi translates from the local Minang language to \"Mountain of Fire\".",
    "Russian President Vladimir Putin is to remove his long-standing ally Sergei Shoigu as defence minister, the Kremlin has announced.\nThe 68-year-old had been in the role since 2012 and will be replaced by Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov, an economist with little military experience. \nMr Shoigu is to be appointed secretary of Russia's Security Council.\nThe Kremlin said the defence ministry needed to stay \"innovative\". \nReshuffles in Russia don't happen very often so this is a big moment at the top of Russian politics.\nBut Vladimir Putin remains the person who ultimately calls the shots. It was his decision to start the war in Ukraine and all the big decisions are taken by him.\nThe appointment of Mr Belousov as defence minister will come as a surprise to many, given his previous experience. \nBut analysts suggest President Putin is seeking to align the Russian economy more closely with the war effort.\nThe decision to put an economist in charge of the Ministry of Defence reflects the changing priorities of the Kremlin and the huge amounts of money the Russian authorities are now pouring into the war in Ukraine - and Russia's need to boost efficiency in the armed forces. \nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the proposed appointment of a civilian showed the role of defence minister called for \"innovation\".\nHe said Russia was becoming more like the Soviet Union in the mid-1980s, when a high proportion of GDP went on military spending.\nAs a result, it was necessary to make sure that military expenditure was better integrated into Russia's overall economy, he added.\n\"The one who is more open to innovations is the one who will be victorious on the battlefield,\" he said.\nIn recent months, there had been rumours that Mr Shoigu's position was growing weaker and that he could lose his job. \nIn April, one of his deputies - Timur Ivanov - was arrested on corruption charges in a rare move against such a senior official.\nAnd Russia's campaign in Ukraine was meant to last a few weeks at most. Instead, it is now in its third year and has been plagued by military setbacks and big losses in men and materiel.\nAlthough Mr Shoigu will remain in a powerful role as secretary of the Security Council, the move appears to be a demotion for him. \nIt's not yet clear what will happen to the council's current head, Nikolai Patrushev. \nMr Shoigu has close links with President Putin, often taking him on fishing trips in his native Siberia.\nHe was given the defence portfolio despite having no military background, which rankled with some of his top brass.\nA civil engineer by profession, Mr Shoigu rose to prominence as the head of the emergencies and disaster relief ministry in the 1990s. \nIn 2023, Mr Shoigu became embroiled in a public feud with Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin over Russia's conduct of the war. \nPrigozhin, who led a short-lived mutiny against Moscow, accused Mr Shoigu of being a \"dirtbag\" and \"elderly clown\" in audio messages that went viral.\nThe mercenary chief died in a plane crash while flying from St Petersburg to Moscow in August 2023. The Kremlin denied it was to blame.\nAccording to unnamed government officials quoted by independent Russian website The Bell, Mr Belousov is seen as a \"hard-line defender of the state, who believes that Russia is encircled by enemies\".\nLike President Putin, he is close to the Russian Orthodox Church. He is said to be a martial arts enthusiast - as is President Putin - who practised karate and the Russian combat sport sambo in his youth.\nBefore becoming deputy prime minister, he worked for several years as an aide to Mr Putin and was reportedly the only member of the president's economic entourage to support the annexation of Crimea in 2014.\nMr Putin was sworn in as president for a fifth time on Tuesday after winning Russia's recent election with 87% of the vote without facing any credible opponents. He has led Russia since January 2000.",
    "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in Ukraine as weapons from a new American aid package begin arriving at the front line.\nHis visit comes as the country struggles to hold back a major Russian incursion near its second biggest city of Kharkiv. \nAmerica's top diplomat is expected to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky and other officials.\nMr Blinken will deliver a message of reassurance, US officials say.\nThe secretary of state's arrival on Tuesday marks three weeks since the US Congress finally agreed a new $61bn (\u00a349bn) aid package for Ukraine.\nThe breakthrough followed more than a year of partisan paralysis in Washington with some Republicans adamantly opposed to the funding.  \nAhead of Mr Blinken's arrival in Kyiv, a senior US official said the American-funded weapons now arriving at the front line included air defence interceptors, artillery and ATACMS long-range precision guided missiles. \n\"We have already started to flow in artillery [and] long-range ATACMS that can range any part of Ukraine, and also other air defence capabilities that are meant to meet the most pressing needs, particularly with an eye towards Russia's activities right now in Kharkiv,\" the official said. \nMr Blinken arrived by sleeper train, rolling into Kyiv after a nine-hour journey from the Polish border. \nHe touched down on Monday in the south-eastern Polish town of Rzesz\u00f3w, whose airport is now a major logistical hub bringing defence supplies and humanitarian aid into Ukraine. \nThe airfield's perimeter bristles with US Patriot missile defence batteries - a stark reminder of America's role in shoring up defences at Nato's frontier, more than two years into the war in Ukraine. \nMr Blinken will deliver a message of \"strong reassurance\" to the Ukrainians \"in a difficult moment\", a US official said. This will include talks on helping the country take back the military \"initiative\", said the official.\nUkraine was facing not only a \"grinding battle on the eastern front\", the official added, but also the latest cross-border attack towards Kharkiv. \nAsked by the BBC whether the delay in weapons supply by Congress could have contributed to Moscow's decision to carry out the assault, the official said they would not \"draw any direct correlation\", but added \"the Ukrainians have certainly been in a more difficult position because they waited a long time for this assistance\". \nWashington hopes a surge of US-supplied arms will enable Ukraine to move towards an \"active defence\" against the Russians and become \"increasingly more confident holding their positions, pushing back as they get more assistance\".

    "It wasn't just the past they were remembering today. Beside the rows of fresh graves at Israel's Mount Herzl military cemetery, new plots were still being marked out - too recent for a memorial stone, their empty shapes heaped with flowers.  \nNext to them, the vacant space stretched, shadowed with the future losses of Israel's ongoing war.\nThe crowd packed around them - some in uniform, some in tears - saluted or bowed their heads as the morning siren sounded to mark Remembrance Day; the price of Israel's previous conflicts laid out in the cemetery, beneath the pines, across the years.\nIsrael's defence ministry says the names of 826 people from the security forces were added to the list of the country's fallen this year, along with 834 victims of terrorist attacks - almost all of them from the 7 October Hamas attacks and the Gaza War that followed.\nFaced with the human cost of his current war, Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, offered a reminder of why he was asking families to pay it.\n\"It's either us - Israel; or them - the monsters of Hamas,\" he said. \"It's either existence, liberty, security and prosperity; or annihilation, massacre, rape and subjugation. We are determined to win.\"\nHis speech was noticeably less belligerent than usual - his calls to continue \"until victory\" toned down - but he again justified the continuation of the war by quoting those paying the highest price. A soldier who had both legs amputated, he said, had urged him to \"continue until the end\".\nDoron Perez said he had only been half-listening to the prime minister - his mind had been on his son, Daniel, a tank commander who was killed during 7 October attacks.\nTwo months ago the family buried Daniel's bloodied uniform beneath his memorial at Mount Herzl - his body is still being held by Hamas in Gaza.\n\"[Almost] 25,000 soldiers have lost their lives since the establishment of the State of Israel,\" Doron said. \"And for me, this particular battle was the most obvious in terms of the need to put our lives on the line. This is not a political issue, this is about the very existence of Israel. It was one of those 'to be or not to be' moments.\"\nDespite the support from some families, this Memorial Day is a sensitive moment for Israel's prime minister. Beneath the national unity shown for the country's war dead are growing questions - and growing divisions - about Israel's war aims, and their results.\nIsrael's army is currently fighting Hamas in areas of northern and central Gaza that were previously declared clear.   Fourteen Israeli soldiers were reported dead last week alone. The deaths of many more Palestinians last week barely figure here.\nStanding before the grave of his daughter Rebecca, Robert Baruch said there was family history scattered around the cemetery - an uncle buried yards away, killed during Israel's war of independence in 1948.  \n\"I don't know how we'll look back on this in twenty years - I hope we'll say this was a last terrible phase in something that ended in good. But at what cost?\"\nWithout a clear plan for the day after the war, and with more than 130 hostages still being held there, Mr Netanyahu's determination to continue fighting in Gaza is creating growing conflict at home too.\nOn Sunday night, Israel's military chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, said he felt the weight of the Hamas attacks on his shoulders every day. \"I am responsible for answering the poignant questions that drive sleep from your eyes,\" he told bereaved families.\nIsrael's prime minister, by contrast, has been full of praise for his forces' sense of responsibility, almost silent on his own.\nBut his focus on fallen heroes does not address the accusations against him: that it was on his watch that Hamas grew strong enough to launch last October's attack; on his watch that Israel's intelligence failed - and that his choice to continue the conflict now is rooted in his own political survival.\nBenjamin Netanyahu is facing a military war in Gaza, and a growing political war at home.",
    "A whistleblower who helped expose allegations of Australian war crimes in Afghanistan has been sentenced to five years and eight months in jail.\nDavid McBride pleaded guilty to stealing and sharing military secrets on the eve of his trial last year, after legal rulings sank his defence.\nAn ex-military lawyer, McBride said he felt a moral duty to speak up.\nA landmark inquiry later found evidence that Australian forces had unlawfully killed 39 Afghans during the war.\nMcBride's case has sparked uproar in Australia, putting a spotlight on what some say are flimsy whistleblower protections and slow progress towards prosecuting soldiers alleged to have killed with impunity under its flag. \nMcBride, 60, admits he gave troves of document to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), saying he was concerned about the attitudes of commanders and what he then thought was the \"over-investigation\" of troops, the court heard.\nBut instead the information he provided underpinned a series of reports in 2017 called The Afghan Files, which gave unprecedented insight into the operations of Australia's elite special forces in Afghanistan, and contained allegations of war crimes.\nProsecutors argued McBride was motivated by \"personal vindication\", and that the way he gathered, stored and then leaked the documents endangered Australia's national security and foreign policy.\nBut McBride's lawyers asked for leniency, saying he shared the information with \"honourable\" intentions and out of a sense of personal duty.\nDuring sentencing in the nation's capital on Tuesday, Justice David Mossop agreed McBride was of \"good character\" but said that he seemed to have become obsessed with the correctness of his own opinions. Sharing military secrets was \"a gross breach of trust\" for which he has shown \"no contrition\", he added.\nMcBride will be eligible for release on parole after 27 months.\nAfter the sentence was read out, some in the public gallery shouted \"shame on you\" towards the judge as he left the bench.\nHis support dog nearby, McBride hugged his friends and family before being led off into custody.\nHe has maintained that his leak was justified as it had ultimately exposed wrongdoing.\n\"I did not break my oath to the people of Australia and the soldiers that keep us safe,\" he said on Tuesday ahead of his sentencing, addressing a crowd of supporters which included relatives of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and fellow whistleblower Jeff Morris.\nEven before he became one of Australia's most high-profile whistleblowers, McBride led a colourful life.\nAfter graduating from Oxford University with a law degree, he started his career with a stint in the British army. Leaving after reaching the rank of captain, he then tried his hand at everything from private security to reality TV and politics, before coming full circle and joining the Australian Defence Force (ADF). \nAs a legal officer, he did two tours of Afghanistan in 2011 and 2013, the latter with the special forces. It was then that he began to form the impression that \"a line had been crossed\" by commanders.\nOver the next few years, while suffering from undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and abusing drugs and alcohol, McBride said he became more and more convinced he needed to speak up.\nWorking late into the night at an army base near Canberra, he started covertly copying hundreds of sensitive documents, smuggling them home in a backpack over 18 months.\nHe tried an internal complaint first. When that failed, he went to the police and the defence minister, before turning to the press.\nHe believed the dossier he compiled would show the ADF's chain of command was so concerned about the perception of unlawful killings that they were scapegoating soldiers and undermining special forces' confidence to do their work.\nInstead, ABC journalist Dan Oakes found they contained evidence that Australian forces had committed war crimes and lied to conceal them.\n\"The more I looked into it, I couldn't conceive how anyone would think these guys were being too tightly monitored. It was precisely the opposite,\" he recently told the Four Corners programme.\n\"What happened out in the field stayed in the field.\"\nThe Afghan Files included revelations military leaders themselves had concerns about a \"warrior culture\" within the force, and details of how soldiers were allegedly covering up the unlawful killings of unarmed men and children - including a six-year-old boy who was allegedly shot in his sleep in 2013.\nUntil that point, there had been very little reported about allegations of war crimes.\nMcBride was quickly fingered as the man behind the leak and he fled to Spain shortly before the Australian Federal Police (AFP) descended on his apartment. There officers found four plastic tubs filled with classified documents stashed in a cupboard.\nAfter a year in hiding, McBride returned to Australia and was charged with stealing Commonwealth property, breaching the Defence Act and disclosing conf",
    "A coroner has called for new screening tests to detect blood clots in children after the death of a 13-year-old\u00a0girl. \nLilly Proctor died on 3 April 2022 in Pinderfields Hospital, Wakefield, after earlier collapsing at home.\nShe had previously been admitted to hospital on 1 April with shortness of breath and chest pains.\nCoroner Oliver Longstaff said she had been discharged from hospital \"with no formal diagnosis and no prescribed treatment\" before her death.\nHe said more action would be needed with other cases to \"prevent future deaths\" after he recorded a narrative conclusion following the inquest into Lilly's death in April 2024.\nMr Longstaff said his concerns were that there was no child-specific screening tool available in the UK and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance for these types of cases was specific only to adults and not applicable to children.\nHe also cited a lack of resources to treat a circulating blood clot, known as a thromboembolism, meant \"clinicians working with children may be disadvantaged in diagnosing and treating the condition\".\nHe was also concerned that Lilly's family had a strong family history of thromboembolic disease, but only one of the five doctors who saw her at hospital picked up on her mother's past experience of blood clots due to having an inherited condition.\nMr Longstaff added in his report that it \"cannot be said on the balance of probabilities that any step taken as an alternative to discharging Lilly on 2 April 2022 would have prevented the tragedy of her terminal collapse the following day\".\nA joint paediatric and forensic post mortem examination gave the cause of her death as a massive pulmonary thromboembolism, deep vein thrombosis, and having a genetic mutation that affected blood clotting.\nMr Longstaff's Prevention of Future Deaths report ended with him calling on NICE and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) to respond to his findings within 56 days details of \"action taken or proposed to be taken\".\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "Hundreds of women have contacted BBC News with their stories of experiencing trauma during childbirth - from their pain at not being believed, to being left bleeding and alone after their baby was born.\nIt follows a report by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Birth Trauma which calls for an overhaul of maternity care in the UK, and safe levels of staffing.\nThe report cited research evidence that 4-5% of women suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after childbirth, which it says amounts to approximately 30,000 women in the UK each year.\nSkye Curtis, 33, who lives in Bexhill, has a two-year-old son, born in June 2022.

It was an awful experience.\"\nAfter the birth, Skye says she was put in a bay with no working light and had to change nappies with her phone flash: \"My son ended up with jaundice because he was not getting sufficient milk from me. There was no-one there to guide me.\n\"All in all it was a horrendous experience.\"\nJane (not her real name), 35, has a four-year-old who is happy and healthy - but the birth was difficult and she is now taking legal action.\n\"In 2020 I was having my first child who was predicted as large. I had/have a phobia of vaginal birth and wanted a C-section. I was laughed at. \n\"My birth ended up resulting in me being left so long I developed sepsis, had an emergency forceps delivery and I bled heavily, losing 1.5 litres. \n\"I am truly traumatised,\" she says.\nDanielle Palmer, 27, from Norfolk, said staff were caring and attentive throughout her three-hour labour in December 2021, but she felt let down afterwards.\n\"The sheets on the bed were blood-stained and there was blood all over the floor which my husband had to clean up,\" she says.\n\"I couldn't lie in the bed so had to spend the night after giving birth on a plastic chair.\"\nDanielle was discharged the next morning feeling exhausted. \n\"My overall thoughts were that staff were kind, but there was a lack of staff,\" she says. \nAmy, 31, from Suffolk, who gave birth to her son in July 2021, said the worst part was \"not being listened to\".\nAmy says she has been left with diagnosed postnatal depression, anxiety and PTSD, and is currently taking antidepressants, having \"never ever struggled with mental health before\".\nShe describes herself as \"physically disfigured\" after her C-section: \"The scar is like a flap - it's completely numb, it's not a nice neat line.\"\nAt her six-week check-up, she was told she would need plastic surgery, but that had to be done privately.\nIn September, Amy started a midwifery course at the University of East Anglia: \"I wanted to be a midwife since I was 19 but my experiences in childbirth and miscarriage have propelled me into wanting to do it even more.\n\"I want to make a change, I want to be able to provide the care and attention that I didn't get, I suppose\u2026\"\n\"It's really sad to see that actually the midwives are burnt-out - they are working way past their hours.\"\nRachel Coles, 29, said her contractions were \"the most horrific pain I have ever experienced\" when she gave birth in September 2021. \nBy the time she was told to push, the epidural had \"completely worn off\".\nAfter birth, her placenta started to disintegrate inside her and left a small tear in her uterus, she said, causing her to lose three litres of blood. \n\"All I remember, as I was losing blood, is my son being whisked off me and handed to my husband, about 20 doctors running into the room trying to stop the bleeding and being handed a form that I needed to sign to consent to surgery where it could end in a full hysterectomy if they could not stop the bleeding,\" Rachel says.\nThe next thing she remembers is waking up in order to breastfeed, which she did \"whilst in and out of consciousness, knowing that somehow I was still alive\".\nWomen have been calling BBC Radio 5Live with their experiences too, like Sima Mansouri, from north London.\nShe told Nicky Campbell she had been left with severe incontinence because of the lack of care when giving birth: \"I was there for several hours with my newborn in my arms, wasn't sewn up or anything after birth. Nothing was done. \n\"I'm bleeding, getting weaker, and they just left me there for several hours until someone else came in to clean the room. \n\"She said: 'Oh, you're still in here?' \n\"I said, 'Yes, I've been waiting.' \n\"And they couldn't believe it that they had just left me there, still bleeding.\"\nAmanda, in Northampton, said she told staff she was in pain and wanted to push, but they didn't believe her.\nShe ended up giving birth in a toilet, catching her son's ",

    "Fierce fighting has been reported in Jabalia in northern Gaza, after the Israeli military went back into areas where it said Hamas had regrouped.\nResidents who fled said they had seen tanks advancing towards Jabalia's refugee camp, which has come under heavy bombardment since Saturday.\nPalestinian armed groups also said they were battling troops in the camp.\nMeanwhile, the UN has said 360,000 people have fled Rafah, in the south, since an offensive began a week ago.\nThe Israeli military has ordered the evacuation of the eastern third of the city, which is swollen with more than a million Palestinians taking refuge.\nOn Sunday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Israel that a full-scale offensive in Rafah might provoke \"anarchy\" without eliminating Hamas.\nHis comments echoed briefings to Israeli media by unnamed senior Israeli military figures, who said Hamas's resurgence in northern Gaza was due to a lack of a specific plan from Israel's government for the \"day after\" the war.\nThe military scaled down operations in the north in January after declaring that it had \"dismantled\" Hamas's battalions there. But that left a power vacuum in which the group has been able to rebuild.\nAn estimated 300,000 people trapped in the devastated region are also experiencing a \"full-blown famine\" due to a lack of aid deliveries, according to the head of the World Food Programme. \nResidents who were filmed fleeing Jabalia on foot on Monday morning said they had decided to leave after seeing tanks advance into the area.  \n\"We don't know where to go. We have been displaced from one place to the next,\" one woman told Reuters news agency. \"We are running in the streets. I saw it with my own eyes. I saw the tank and the bulldozer.\"\nThe military wings of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad - which are both proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK, US and other countries - said their fighters were targeting Israeli forces in and around Jabalia camp with mortars, anti-tank missiles and machine-guns.\nHamas-affiliated Safa news agency also reported clashes between Palestinian armed groups and Israeli tanks east of Jabalia camp's market, near several UN-run schools which were being used as shelters by civilians.\nThe official Palestinian news agency Wafa meanwhile reported that two people were killed in Israeli strikes on homes in Jabalia camp on Monday and that a number of other people were killed in a strike in Jabalia town.\nIt also cited ambulance crews as saying the bodies of 20 civilians had so far been recovered in Jabalia and taken to Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahia.\nThere was no immediate comment from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).  \nOn Sunday, the IDF said troops had begun an operation in Jabalia the previous evening \"based on intelligence information regarding attempts by Hamas to reassemble its terrorist infrastructure and operatives in the area\".\nIt came after civilians there were told to evacuate to western Gaza City.\nThe IDF also said it was operating in the Zeitoun area, in eastern Gaza City, to \"eliminate terrorists and dismantle terrorist infrastructure\".\nSafa reported that Zeitoun was hit by Israeli shellfire on Monday morning.\nThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said the bombardment and evacuation orders had \"created more displacement and fear for thousands of families\" in northern Gaza.\nUnrwa also warned that the civilians affected, like the estimated 360,000 who have fled Rafah in the past week, had \"nowhere safe to go\".\nAfter seven months of war in Gaza, Israel has insisted victory is impossible without taking Rafah and eliminating the last remaining Hamas battalions. But UN and Western powers have warned that an all-out assault could lead to mass civilian casualties and a humanitarian catastrophe.\nThere have been desperate scenes in Rafah since the IDF said last Monday that it was beginning a \"precise operation against Hamas\" in eastern Rafah.\nOn Saturday, flyers were dropped ordering residents to evacuate more eastern neighbourhoods, including those close to the city centre.\nUnrwa's deputy Gaza director Scott Anderson, who is based in western Rafah, told the BBC on Monday that the Israeli operation now extended \"about a third of the way across Rafah\" and encompassed the old town.\nHe said he could hear explosions and air strikes, and that the fighting had affected the operations of hospitals and many of Unrwa's facilities in Rafah refugee camp, including a primary healthcare facility.\nPalestinian media reported that four people, including a child, were killed on Monday in an Israeli air strike on a home in the Brazil neighbourhood, which is just south-east of the camp. \nHamas's military wing also said it had targeted Israeli forces east of Rafah.\nMany people sheltering in central and western areas that are not subject to evacuation orders have also been leaving out of fear that the Israeli operation will soon expand into a large-scale offensive.\nGhada el-Kurd, a mother-of-two, t",

    "A year after undergoing a world-first treatment for glioblastoma, Australian doctor Richard Scolyer remains cancer-free.\nThe esteemed pathologist's experimental therapy is based on his own pioneering research on melanoma.\nProf Scolyer's subtype of glioblastoma is so aggressive most patients survive less than a year.\nBut on Tuesday the 57-year-old announced his latest MRI scan had again showed no recurrence of the tumour.\n\"To be honest, I was more nervous than I have been for any previous scan,\" he told the BBC.\n\"I'm just thrilled and delighted... couldn't be happier.\"\nProf Scolyer is one of the country's most respected medical minds, and was this year named Australian of the Year alongside his colleague and friend Georgina Long, in recognition of their life-changing work on melanoma.\nAs co-directors of the Melanoma Institute Australia, over the past decade the pair's research on immunotherapy, which uses the body's immune system to attack cancer cells, has dramatically improved outcomes for advanced melanoma patients globally. Half are now essentially cured, up from less than 10%.\nIt's that research that Prof Long, alongside a team of doctors, is using to treat Prof Scolyer - in the hope of finding a cure for his cancer too.\nIn melanoma, Prof Long - herself a renowned medical oncologist - and her team discovered that immunotherapy works better when a combination of drugs is used, and when they are administered before any surgery to remove a tumour. And so, Prof Scolyer last year became the first brain cancer patient to ever have combination, pre-surgery immunotherapy.\nHe is also the first to be administered a vaccine personalised to his tumour's characteristics, which boosts the cancer-detecting powers of the drugs.\nAfter a tough couple of months of treatment at the start of the year - spent dealing with epileptic seizures, liver issues and pneumonia - Prof Scolyer says he is feeling healthier.\n\"I'm the best I have felt for yonks,\" he said, adding that he's back to exercising every day - which for him often means a casual 15km (9.3 mile) jog.\n\"It certainly doesn't mean that my brain cancer is cured... but it's just nice to know that it hasn't come back yet, so I've still got some more time to enjoy my life with my wife Katie and my three wonderful kids.\"\nThe results so far have generated huge excitement that the duo may be on the cusp of a discovery which could one day help the roughly 300,000 people diagnosed with brain cancer globally each year.\nProf Scolyer and Prof Long have previously said the odds of a cure are \"minuscule\", but they hope the experimental treatment will prolong Prof Scolyer's life and will soon translate into clinical trials for glioblastoma patients.\nThey currently have a scientific paper under review, which details results from the first weeks of Prof Scolyer's treatment, but Prof Long stresses that they are still a long way off developing an approved and regulated course of treatment. \n\"We've generated a whole heap of data, to then make a foundation for that next step, so that we can help more people,\" she said.\n\"We're not there yet. What we have to really focus on is showing that this pre-surgery, combination immunotherapy type of approach works in a large number of people.\"\nRoger Stupp - the doctor after whom the current protocol for treating glioblastomas is named - earlier this year told the BBC Prof Scolyer's prognosis was \"grim\", and that it was too early to tell if the treatment is working.\nHe added that while Mr Scolyer's earlier results were \"encouraging\", he wanted to see him reach 12 months, even 18, without recurrence before getting excited.\nProf Scoyler said he's already proud of the data his treatment has generated and grateful to his family and his medical team for supporting \"this experiment\".\n\"I feel proud of the team that I work with. I feel proud that they're willing to take the risk in going down this path.\"\n\"[It] provides some hope that maybe this is a direction that's worth investigating more formally.\"",
    "The government has watered down planned police powers to deal with \"nuisance\" rough sleepers after opposition from Tory MPs.\nUnder changes to the Criminal Justice Bill, forces in England and Wales will no longer be able to move people on because of \"smells\".\nOfficers will also have to inform them of support services first before they can move them on for other reasons.\nThe move comes ahead of the bill's return to Parliament on Wednesday.\nIt follows meetings with potential Conservative rebels who had threatened to team up with opposition MPs to vote through similar changes.\nHowever, homelessness charity Crisis said rough sleepers would \"continue to be viewed as a nuisance\".\nThe bill, drafted under former home secretary Suella Braverman, would deliver a longstanding government promise to get rid of Victorian-era legislation that currently criminalises rough sleeping.\nIt would replace this with new powers for police and council officials to direct \"nuisance\" rough sleepers to leave a place and not return for up to three days.\nThose failing to comply could potentially be fined up to \u00a32,500 or jailed for up to a month. \nThe draft law hit the headlines last month after some MPs objected to provisions that said rough sleepers causing \"smells\" could be considered a nuisance and therefore ordered to move on.\nThe Home Office now says this reference was only intended to tackle rubbish or \"human waste\" - but will now be removed entirely. \nPowers to move people on for other reasons - including for damage to property or using threatening language - will remain.\nBut an amendment will specify that before this power can be used, rough sleepers will have to be told how they can access support services, such as addiction treatment or shelters.\nA reference to giving \"the appearance of\" sleeping rough will also be removed, following warnings from critics this was too vague.\nPolicing Minister Chris Philp said ministers had \"listened carefully\" to critics of the bill and had agreed to make changes to ensure the new powers are \"properly targeted\".\nHe added the amendments would \"ensure vulnerable people are directed towards support, while protecting communities from antisocial behaviour\".\nCrisis, the homelessness charity, said it was pleased that \"some of the more outrageous measures\" in the bill had been removed.\nHowever, chief executive Matt Downie said rough sleepers would \"remain at risk of fines and prison sentences,\" calling this \"unacceptable\".\n\"We have said time and time again that these powers are not needed,\" he added.\n\"If the Westminster government really wants to end rough sleeping, then it should focus on the things we know work - such as building thousands more social homes and increasing funding for support services like Housing First.\"",

    "A motion calling for an \u201cecological and biodiversity crisis\u201d to be declared in Northern Ireland has been passed by the NI Assembly.\nIt was tabled by the opposition Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP).\nThe \u201cbiodiversity and ecological breakdown in Lough Neagh\u201d was highlighted in the motion debated at Stormont on Monday.\nThe motion also urged NI's Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs Minister Andrew Muir to bring forward legislation to establish an independent Environmental Protection Agency, as outlined in the New Decade, New Approach agreement that restored Stormont in 2020.\nThe UK watchdog, the Office for Environmental Protection, has responsibility for scrutinising environmental targets and law in Northern Ireland.\nIt has launched two investigations into potential breaches of environmental law here, both involving the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs.\nThe SDLP's Patsy McGlone, who proposed the motion, told the assembly that \"the establishment of an independent environment agency\" is key to the response to \"the ongoing ecological crisis\" in Northern Ireland's environment.\nHis party colleague, Mark H Durkan MLA, said the \"glaring failures in this area to date are unequivocal proof that the current structures just aren\u2019t working\".\n\"We have a moral obligation to tackle environmental degradation head on,\" he said. \n\"It\u2019s imperative that we can confront the crisis before us and use every tool at our disposal to do so.\"\nIn 2023, algal blooms in Lough Neagh were visible from space.\nSo far in 2024, several sightings of the potentially toxic blue-green algae have been confirmed in Lough Neagh, near Strabane in County Tyrone and in County Fermanagh, although not at a large-scale bloom level.\nMr Muir has previously called for more funds to address the crisis and a report on Lough Neagh is due to be published soon.\n\"I remain committed to strengthening environmental governance both administratively and through the introduction of new legislation where that is necessary following full engagement and consultation,\" he told the assembly during Monday's debete.\nAhead of Monday's motion, members of the campaign group Friends of the Earth gathered outside Parliament Buildings to demonstrate their support for it.\nThe assembly declared a climate emergency in 2020 and backed the creation of an independent body at the same time.\nSinn F\u00e9in MLA Linda Dillon told the assembly that \"we can save lough Neagh but it\u2019ll require us all to work together\". \nShe called the lake - the largest freshwater lake in the UK and Ireland - \"a treasured gem of Ireland\u2019s natural landscape\" and said establishing an independent environmental protection agency is \"the right thing to do\".\nGerry Carroll, of People Before Profit said \"glossy PR photos of ministers wearing water boots by the lough shore\" won't fix the environmental problems in NI.\nDUP MLA, Michelle McIlveen, said Northern Ireland has a \"wider environmental issue\" as well as the issues with Lough Neagh.\nOn the topic of establishing an independent environment agency, she said: \"the blind creation of another body to take resources out of a limited pot is not the right thing to do\" and that \"what is in place needs to be reviewed before we add another layer\".\nIn a proposed amendment to the motion, UUP members called for an \"immediate review\" of current environmental agencies.\nTom Elliott MLA said legislators needed to \"be exact about who is responsible for what or just we are just going to blame each other\".",
    "The government is spending \u00a35.5bn less on health in England than it suggested it would be at this stage, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.\nPlans set out in the 2019 election campaign indicated the budget would increase by 3.3% a year above inflation during this Parliament, the IFS said.\nBut despite extra being put in to cover the high inflation seen, spending had risen by only 2.7% a year on average.\nThe government defended its record, saying it was making extra investment.\nFunding had reached record levels and was making a \"real difference\" in cutting waiting lists, the Department of Health and Social Care said.\nThe health budget for this year stands at \u00a3179.6bn. \nMost of this is going on the NHS but it also includes money for public health, social care and training.\nThe IFS said England was not unique in facing this challenge, given the high rates of inflation globally, and had, in this Parliament, increased health spending more than many parts of Europe - including Northern Ireland and Scotland but not Wales. \nBut the pressures on the NHS and the commitment to increase staffing made under the 15-year NHS workforce plan, backed by both the Conservatives and Labour, meant tough decisions would be needed.\nMore than 40% of public-service spending was already on health,  IFS research economist Max Warner said.\nAnd to keep increasing the budget, other areas of government spending would have to be cut.\n\"Whichever party takes office after the next election, budgets for the next fiscal year and the choice of how much to give to the Department of Health and Social Care will effectively dominate everything else,\" he said.\n\"Neither the Conservative Party nor Labour Party have been keen to set out spending plans. \n\"But the next government will have to confront this reality - and fast.\"\n'Mounting demand'\nSaffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said the health service desperately needed extra funding.\n\"The NHS has been through its toughest financial year ever as budgets and services are stretched to the limit in the face of mounting demand and pressure,\" she said.\n\"We can't go on like this.\"\nLabour shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: \"Rishi Sunak has broken every promise he's ever made on the NHS. \n\"It appears he has given up on turning the health service around.\"",
    "Identity politics have proven divisive in the SNP and across the Scottish Parliament. Navigating the issue is one of the major challenges facing Scotland's new first minister.\nBoth of John Swinney's predecessors, Nicola Sturgeon and Humza Yousaf, spent much political capital in this area.\nMs Sturgeon pursued controversial gender recognition reform legislation, and Mr Yousaf persevered with a subsequent legal challenge after the UK government blocked the new laws.\nSo far, Mr Swinney has been cautious, saying he will \"wait and see\" what the political landscape is like after the general election when it comes to pursuing gender recognition.\nHe has described the Cass review into gender identity services for children as a \"significant piece of work\" on a \"complex area of policy\" that should be taken seriously.\nHe says the Scottish government is committed to legislating on conversion therapy but must now reflect carefully on the responses to a recent consultation on the proposals.\nBut there is one particularly ideologically and politically-loaded question that's hard for today's politicians to avoid giving a definitive answer.\nNicola Sturgeon previously refused to be drawn and Mr Swinney himself avoided answering it during his leadership campaign launch.\nBut asked on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme if a transwoman is a woman, Mr Swinney ventured: \"I believe a woman is an adult female born as a woman, and I also accept that transgender women are defined as women.\"\nHis response is unlikely to be satisfactory to either side of the debate - and, with his answer being described by some as confusing, it's likely the FM will face further exploration of his views on this topic.\nEventually Mr Swinney will also have to spell out his government's position on gender policies - and deal with the consequences.\nHe may hope that by then the general election will have been and gone - an event that marks another major challenge for his premiership.\nThat challenge is not just about delivering a strong election result in itself but also defining what that result means for the SNP's core aim - Scottish independence.\nHis strategy is to demonstrate he can deliver a thriving Scottish economy and good public services as a means of convincing more Scots of the case for leaving the union.\nBut he's also committed to the SNP's policy that winning a majority of seat at the forthcoming election would be a mandate for another push on independence.\nWhat happens if they don't get that majority? The first minister won't countenance that right now but it could have a considerable impact on his own future, as well as that of the independence movement.\nMr Swinney has already made it clear that economic growth is one of his top priorities - and a visit to the ground-breaking for the new Ardersier Port is very much on message.\nThe project exemplifies investment in the transition from oil and gas to renewables, with government funding boosting private investment.\nIn that Good Morning Scotland interview, Mr Swinney said: \"I want to make sure that the power of government, which is very significant if aligned properly and aligned effectively, can deliver those approaches that are good and attractive for investors.\"\nThe focus on growth may be music to the ears of the business community but questions remain over exactly how the first minister intends to alter the Scottish government's current approach.\nAnd the devil, as always, is in the detail. Setting that out is another of his major challenges.\nWill he address concerns over business rates? \nWill ministers look again at tax policy after the Scottish regime was described as \"bewildering\" by the entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter? \nAnd will the current presumption against new oil and gas projects continue?\nThe answers to those questions remain unclear.",

Are they going to move out of Port Talbot or Wales even just to find regular work?\" he said.\n\"It\u2019s going to be huge.

To be honest, we don\u2019t really speak about it a lot. It\u2019s like a dark cloud looming in the background at the moment.\n\"We\u2019ve gone on a few marches as players and committee men.

    "Up to 96% of taxi driver licences issued in Wolverhampton in the last year were for people living outside the city, figures show.\nBetween April 2023 and the end of March this year, 813 licences were for drivers based in the city and 20,375 for drivers living elsewhere, the City of Wolverhampton Council said.\nRegulations mean local authorities must not withhold issue based on residence, but some areas have raised concern that such practice prohibits their ability to monitor drivers' standards.\nA spokesperson for City of Wolverhampton Council said: \u201cWhile [the council] has never actively encouraged applications from drivers outside the city, existing legislation requires that if an application is submitted and requirements are met, then the application must be granted.\"\nThe figures, first reported by Taxi Point and verified by the BBC, have increased from the previous 12-month period, when 19,592 licences were linked to applications outside Wolverhampton and 778 inside the city.\nLast year, the council registered about a third of England's taxi drivers, taking on new staff to cope with demand.\nCouncil papers in January 2023 suggested slower processing times and higher fees elsewhere had encouraged many drivers to choose Wolverhampton.\nIn October, Transport for Greater Manchester called for a change in the law, saying under the present system, councils could \"not guarantee a high standard\" from out-of-town drivers.\nThe government, which permitted the system in 2015, has announced tighter checks for drivers. \nThe majority of the 32,351 taxi licences issued in Wolverhampton during the '23-'24 period were for private hire vehicles - 32,169 in total, with 182 for Hackney Carriages. \nA spokesperson for City of Wolverhampton Council said it was illegal for licensing authorities to impose a limit on the number of private hire licences issued, and the city council, they added, offered an efficient online application process.\nDrivers, they said, must attend in person for training and strict assessment before an application can be processed and they were expected to \"always maintain the highest standards\".\nThe spokesperson explained: \u201cThis is irrespective of the administrative boundary within which they are operating at any particular time.\n\"City of Wolverhampton Council takes its enforcement responsibilities seriously and our officers are out... every Friday and Saturday night, working to protect the public.\u201d\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Eurovision Song Contest organisers have said they \"regret\" that some delegations \"didn't respect the spirit of the rules\" in Sweden. \nItaly's Angelina Mango and Ireland's Bambie Thug are among contestants who complained of a \"tense\" and \"horrible\" atmosphere backstage. \nThe Dutch singer Joost Klein was also sent home after being accused of intimidating behaviour by a female member of the production crew.\nIn a statement on Monday, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which runs Eurovision, acknowledged that several contestants had lodged complaints.\n\"We spoke to a number of delegations during the event regarding various issues that were brought to our attention,\" it said. \n\"The EBU\u2019s governing bodies will, together with the heads of delegations, review the events surrounding the ESC in Malm\u00f6 to move forward in a positive way and to ensure the values of the event are respected by everyone.\"\nIt added that individual cases will be discussed at a later date. \nThe contest was overshadowed by protests over Israel's participation, due to the humanitarian cost of its war on Hamas.\nThousands of people protested on the streets of Malm\u00f6, and the country's representative, Eden Golan, received a mixture of boos and cheers from the audience.\nAfter the grand final, Bambie Thug, who has been outspoken in their pro-Palestinian views, also accused Israel's national broadcaster, Kan, of \"inciting violence\" against them during its coverage.\nDuring the first semi-final, one of the station's commentators noted that the performer had \"spoken negatively about Israel\".\n\"But we can talk about that later,\" the commentator added. \"Prepare your curses.\"\nThe comment might have been a reference to a lyric in Bambie Thug's song, which involves placing a hex on an ex-partner, but the singer felt it crossed a line.\n\"The broadcaster [Kan] has disobeyed the rules and I hope next year they won\u2019t be able to compete because of that,\" they told reporters after the contest.\nOther participants accused the Israeli delegation of filming them and posting clips online without their permission.\n\nGolan, who ultimately came fifth in the contest, also acknowledged the controversy over her appearance had taken a toll.\n\"To say it was easy would be a lie,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"But with your support and love it gave me the strength to continue and put on the absolute best performance I knew I can do.\"\nSeveral entrants, including the UK's Olly Alexander, signed a joint statement calling for a ceasefire in Gaza in the run-up to the contest. \nAnd Golan appeared to face criticisms from her fellow contestants during a press conference on Thursday night.\nGreek singer Marina Satti was seen yawning and pretending to fall asleep while Golan spoke.\nAnd when the Israeli singer was told she did not have to answer a question about whether her presence \"posed a risk\", Joost Klein interrupted to ask: \"Why not?\"\n\nTwo days later, Klein was disqualified from the contest over an alleged run-in with a female member of the production crew, who made a complaint to Swedish police. \nDutch organisers The Netherlands Songfestival said Klein had \"repeatedly indicated\" he did not want to be filmed and that he \"did not touch the camera woman\".\nAt the time, the EBU felt it necessary to clarify that the incident \"did not involve any other performer or delegation member\".\nLithuania's entrant Silvester Belt, meanwhile, said he regretted taking part in the grand final altogether.\n\"Going after that country, with the crowd being so intense, was one of the worst things I had to go through,\" he wrote on social media, referring to the fact that his performance followed Israel's. \n\"I really did the best that I could in this situation,\" he added, calling the contest a \"traumatic experience\" and adding: \"[I] wish it all ended after the first semi.\"\nSwiss singer Nemo won the

    "Staff are allegedly bringing drugs into a privately-run prison where nine people died in two months, a Conservative MP has said.\nStephen Crabb said a prisoner had claimed that drugs are \"everywhere\" at HMP Parc.\nThe House of Commons was told that of the deaths, four have been linked to substance misuse.\nA spokesperson for the prison said the \"vast majority of our staff are hard working and honest\", and that a range of tactics were used to \"tackle the ingress of drugs\".\nConservative prisons minister Ed Argar said 400 members of staff had been trained to use an anti-opioid medicine amid concerns over a lab-made drug.\nHe said the government was looking \"very carefully\" at nitazenes - which were linked to dozens of deaths in the UK last year.\nTwo MPs said they had heard from the parents of prisoners who feared for their safety at the Bridgend prison, run by G4S.\nLabour's Nick Smith said a prisoner from his area of Blaenau Gwent had described inmates \"walking around with shanks\" - a handcrafted bladed-weapon - \"just to feel safe\".\nHis party colleague Jessica Morden, from Newport East, said a parent told her on Monday: \"Every day I expect a phone call fearing the worst, is my son going to be another statistic?\"\nMr Argar expressed his condolences to the families and friends who had lost loved ones at HMP Parc, where nine have died since March.\nHe said he had to be a \"little careful\" not to pre-empt investigations by the prisons and probation ombudsman, and coroner's inquests.\nWhile he said two recent deaths at the prison in May were \"not currently linked to substance misuse\", he said the issue should be considered \"in the wider contest of the threat synthetic opioids pose\" to prisons and the country \"more widely\".\n\"There have been extensive searches of prisoners and staff. Any suspicious substances are tested on site with rapid scan,\" he said.\nMr Crabb, the MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire, told the Commons there had been \"multiple allegations of the staff themselves bringing in illegal substances into the prison\".\nHe said a current prisoner had written to the Welsh Affairs Committee, which he chairs.\nReading the prisoner's evidence to MPs, Mr Crabb said: \"Drugs are everywhere in prison - from cannabis to heroin, and so called spice. Dribs and drabs may enter through visits, and some by way of drone. But let us not confuse the issue - far more comes in by people employed in prison.\"\nHe asked why no staff were currently searched using x-ray body scanners.\nMr Argar replied that the \"vast overwhelming majority of the staff that work in [HM Prisons and Probation Service - HMPPS] do so honestly and with good intent\".\nThe prison service does not have legal powers to use x-ray scanners on staff. \nThe minister told the Commons the body scanners were in use for \"visitors and others\", and handheld detectors had been rolled out to track down drugs or locate drugs in a \"much more effective manner\".\nThe minister was responding on Monday to an urgent question from the Labour MP for Ogmore Chris Elmore.\nGiving his condolences to the families of those who died, Mr Elmore raised concerns from the public about the use of the drug spice within and around the prison.\nHowever, he urged caution on what he said was an \"absolute wild west assumption\" on social media about what is happening inside the prison.\n\"One of the concerns is that the prison is a catalyst for spice being transferred in and out of the prison,\" the MP said.\nHe urged the minister to do what he could to try and bring \"calm\" to the prison estate and the wider community in Bridgend.\nMr Argar said they had significantly increased the number of staff at the prison: \"I do recognise a number of those staff are new in post. There's a need to ensure that they are supported by experienced officers.\"\nLabour Shadow minister for justice Ruth Cadbury said it was \"shocking\" that the prison ombudsman had to warn prisoners at HMP Park to \"throw away drugs immediately due to the serve risk that those particular ones posed to public health\".\nThe Conservative MP for Bridgend Jamie Wallis said social media speculation was not just a case of some \"irresponsible people\".\n\"There is genuine concern and genuine worry there about what it means for the communities, what it means for the town\".\nAsked who was responsible - G4S or the Ministry of Justice - Mr Argar said it was a \"shared responsibility between G4S, HMPPS, the council, the health board, the police and others\".\n\"Because this is a challenge for both the community and the prison\".\nWhile prisons are the responsibility of UK government, health care services are managed by the devolved Welsh government.\nLiz Saville Roberts, of Plaid Cymru, said: \"The nine deaths at HMP Parc in less than three months highlight how prisoner welfare in Wales is fragmented, with responsibilities split between the Welsh government and the [Ministry of Justice].\"\nShe called for deaths in prisons to be the subject of scrutiny in the Senedd as well as the UK Parliamen",
    "He is the Welsh poet and writer name dropped by Taylor Swift in her new album, The Tortured Poets Department.\nAnd on International Dylan Thomas Day, a new play for voices about his final years, will be premiered in New York on Tuesday evening.\nIt will be on the same stage that Under Milk Wood was performed for the first time in 1953 by the poet himself.\nIn the new play, Dear Mr Thomas: A New Play for Voices, Dylan will be portrayed by Welsh actor Matthew Rhys, who admitted he has a \"giddy obsession\" with the poet.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Wales' Lucy Owen, Rhys said he hopes the music icon namechecking Thomas in the chorus of the title track from her album, will introduce the poet's work to a new generation.\n\"There was a 12-year-old girl in our household and when the album dropped, there was great reverence on that day when we're all told to be quiet so that lyrics can be listened to.\n\"So when I heard Dylan mentioned I went 'woohoo' and was told to be quiet straightaway.\n\"Then what happened was the greatest gift to me, a 12-year-old went 'well, who is Dylan Thomas?' and wow did she ever regret asking that question.\n\"Eight hours later, I was still orating some of his greatest poems,\" he said.\nRhys said he was \"incredibly happy\" that Taylor Swift did that.\n\"What I hope is, as the way you know, she mentioned the Chelsea Hotel, and the Chelsea Hotel has now exploded in Manhattan, I just hope that a number of people Google Dylan Thomas, and an entirely new generation have their eyes open to this incredible poet.\n\"I'm thankful for the fact she's hopefully opened up an entirely new generation to his work.\"\nOn playing the poet, Rhys said he could not quite believe he would be on the very stage 71 years to the minute, reading some incredible lines from Under Milk Wood.\nHe will be starring alongside his partner, actor Keri Russell, who he also starred with in the hit TV spy drama The Americans.\n\"She's playing the part of Liz Reitell who was very influential on Dylan, especially in the last months of his life, and incredibly influential in getting that first production of Under Milk Wood on at the 92NY stage.\n\"And obviously it was rumoured that they did have an affair,\" he said.\nRhys said Russell had told him that one of the first things he started to talk with her about was Dylan Thomas, and on her first visit to Wales he had insisted the first place she came to was Laugharne, and to see Dylan's writing shed and drink at Brown's hotel.\n\"I really couldn't believe I did this,\" he added.\nDear Mr Thomas is written by Christopher Monger, from Taffs Well in Rhondda Cynon Taf.\nThe premier of his new play will also be read by Kate Burton, daughter of renowned Pontrhydyfen actor, Richard Burton.\nHe was First Voice in a recording Under Milk Wood for BBC Radio in 1954, delivering those immortal opening words: \"To begin at the beginning.\"\nBut the journey leading to the very first performance of Under Milk Wood in America with Dylan himself as First Voice was a long and arduous one.\nIt was a letter from 92NY Poetry Centre Director John Malcolm Brinnin, who first brought Thomas to the states in 1950.\nThe play has been commissioned to make 150th anniversary of 92NY, and Rhys was instrumental in getting the work commissioned.\n\"It's been a remarkable journey to get this production to this moment.\n\"This incredible art and culture institution in New York was solely responsible for bringing Dylan to New York.\n\"The poetry director at the time was so obsessed with Thomas and hell bent on bringing him to New York that he arranged everything for him to come,\" he said.\nThe title of this play is taken from all those letters that Brennin wrote to Dylan imploring him to come.\nThe poet arrived in New York determined to finish Under Milk Wood, the play follows a day in the life of the characters in a fictional Welsh fishing village, Llareggub, and had been rattling around in his head for some time.\nBut right up to that first performance at 92NY, Thomas was still working on it, and Rhys said it is only by chance there is a recording of him reading the work.\n\"It was really so last minute, Dylan was scribbling the final words up until the very end and somebody just had this idea which put a microphone on stage and record this.\nThomas died months later, in November 1953, but stories of his tours of America remain to this day, and Rhys said he was treated like a rock star by fans when he performed in New York.\n\"The first trip and consequently the other two kind of exploded him onto the scene and turned him into this rockstar poet.\n\"There were people standing in the aisles and chanting his name and chanting the names of poems that he hadn't read.\n\"It was the remarkable moment where a kind of lyric poet never experienced, I don't think has experienced since, it's reserved now for the kind of rock stars and pop stars.\n\"That kind of stature that he had, it was an early Beatlemania really.\"",

    "Large parts of the UK government's Illegal Migration Act should not apply in Northern Ireland because they breach human rights laws, a judge has ruled in a major defeat for ministers. \nThe judge at NI's High Court said the law breaches the Windsor Framework.\nIt is the revised post-Brexit deal agreed between the UK and EU last year.\nThe ruling raises significant questions about the long-term viability of the plan to refuse some asylum seekers a hearing and send them to Rwanda.  \nIn his ruling, Mr Justice Humphreys also declared parts of the act to be incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights - an ultimate sanction from a UK court which sends unworkable legislation back to UK Parliament to be rethought. \nThe 2023 Illegal Migration Act (IMA) is a key part of the UK government's plan to stop English Channel crossings by people seeking asylum without prior permission to arrive. \nIt created laws that mean the Home Secretary must detain and remove anyone who arrives by that route and the plan had been to send them to Rwanda. That was until the Supreme Court ruled last year that the country was unsafe. \nParliament has since passed a law designating Rwanda as a safe country.\nThis key part of the IMA has been in limbo since then but is widely expected to come into action because it would make it easier to transfer people to the African nation. \nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said the NI court decision would not change the government's plan to send illegal migrants to Rwanda.\nThe Windsor Framework deals mostly with trade issues but also includes a human rights element.It commits the UK not to water down the human rights provisions that flow from the Good Friday Agreement, the 1998 deal which brought an end to 30 years of conflict in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles.\nThe judge found that several elements of the act do cause a \"significant\" diminution of the rights enjoyed by asylum seekers residing in Northern Ireland under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.\n\"I have found that there is a relevant diminution of right in each of the areas relied upon by the applicants,\" he said.\nDr Tony McGleenan KC, representing the government, indicated that an appeal may be considered.\n\"We'll be taking our instructions on the judgment and the position in terms of any further litigation will become clear,\" he said.\nThe legal challenge was brought by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and a 16-year-old asylum seeker from Iran who is residing in Northern Ireland.\nThe commission has welcomed the judgement.\nIt said it issued the legal challenge in \"its own name due to the significant concerns it has with the Illegal Migration Act and the effect on asylum seekers in Northern Ireland\".\nIt said it would now be \"considering the judgment in full and its implications\".\nMr Sunak said the court decision changes nothing about the government's plan to send illegal migrants to Rwanda.\nHe said the government is working to get flights off the ground to Rwanda soon and \"nothing will distract us from that or delivering to the timetable I set out\". \nHe added: \"We must start the flights to stop the boats.\"\nMr Sunak also said the government has been clear that its commitment to the Good Friday Agreement should not be interpreted as expanding to cover issues such as illegal migration.\n\"We will take all steps to defend that position, including through appeal,\" he said.\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Gavin Robinson said that the judgement \"does not come as a surprise\" but does \"blow the government's irrational claims that the Rwanda scheme could extend equally to Northern Ireland completely out of the water\". \nHe said that the government must \"prevent a fracture in immigration policy\" between different regions of the United Kingdom.\nMr Robinson said the UK Parliament should have the ability to make decisions on immigration that are \"applicable on a national basis\".\n\"If that were not the case, it would not only be a constitutional affront but would make Northern Ireland a magnet for asylum seekers seeking to escape enforcement,\" he said.\nThe teenage asylum seeker was represented by Phoenix Law.\nIts head of immigration and asylum, Sinead Marmion, welcomed Monday's ruling.\n\"The Good Friday Agreement has always been a beacon of human rights protections and hope,\" she said. \n\"Today, the court, through the Northern Ireland Protocol, has ensured those rights apply to the whole community - including asylum seekers.\"\nWhile the judgement covers specific issues in NI, it raises questions about how the courts will deal with what are likely to be a major assault on the wider Rwanda plan in the coming months. \nIt is likely to form part of a wider attack from critics who say ministers have created a series of laws as part of the Rwanda strategy that breach basic safeguards for all refugees in the UK.  \nThe First Division Association, the union representing senior officials in government, is already asking judges to rule whether the R",
    "People claiming universal credit and working fewer than 18 hours a week will be expected to look for more work, after a change to the welfare system that starts on Monday.\nBefore now, claimants only had to work 15 hours.\nThe new rule is part of broader reforms to the welfare system that the government announced last month.\nThe Department for Work and Pensions said the rule change meant 180,000 people would have to work more.\nThe government was also \"radically expanding\" the support available to help people \"on their journey off benefits\", said Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride.\nBut the charity Turn2Us urged the government to reconsider the policy, which it said could have a \"drastic impact\" on people with long-term health conditions, caring responsibilities or with irregular incomes.\nThe 18 hours a week - which is around half a full-time working week - applies to people earning the minimum wage. Someone earning more per hour can work fewer hours, as long as their total earnings meet the Administrative Earnings Threshold (AET) set by the government.\nFrom Monday the AET will be \u00a3892, which is what you would earn in a month if you worked for 18 hours a week at the minimum wage.\nIf a claimant is earning less than the threshold they will be asked to look for more, or better paid, work.\nIf a couple is earning less than \u00a31,437 between them, they will be expected to try to increase their earnings.\nClaimants who earn less than the threshold will be given more \"intensive\" Jobcentre support, the DWP said, including more frequent meetings with a work coach.\nIf someone does not engage with the process, or take work that is available, they could lose some of their benefits. \nThe prime minister said the changes to the minimum hours requirement would help people on universal credit \"progress towards financial independence, which is better for them and for economic growth\".\nHowever, Michael Clarke, from Turn2Us, a charity which supports people in financial difficulty, expressed \"serious concern\" over the change.\n\"It\u2019s vital that the support system truly supports, rather than penalises those it's meant to help,\" he said.\n\"These changes severely challenge those managing jobs with irregular or fluctuating incomes and carefully balanced responsibilities like childcare.\nHe said the system failed to allow for \"the reality of those on the financial edge\".\n\"For single mothers and others on razor-thin margins, these adjustments risk tipping them into crisis, exacerbating financial instability and mental stress as they struggle to meet these new demands,\" he said.\nLast month Mr Sunak outlined his plans to reform the welfare system further, if the Conservatives win the next election.\nHe said welfare should not be \"a lifestyle choice\". He plans to change the rules so that welfare recipients who do not take work, or try  to meet the conditions set out, for a year would lose all of their benefits.\nMr Sunak also wants to tackle what he called the \"sick note culture\", by changing the process for being certified as too ill to work. He plans to reform the payments system for people unable to work due to long-term physical or mental illness or disability.\nDisability charities described the plans as \"a full-on assault on disabled people\".",

    "A UK aircraft has tested ground-breaking quantum technology that could pave the way for an unjammable back-up for GPS navigation systems.\nThe government, which helped fund the research, said it was the first test of its kind to be publicly acknowledged.\nWhile GPS is satellite-based, the new system is quantum-based - a term used to describe tech that is reliant on the properties of matter at very small scales.\nScience minister Andrew Griffith said the test flights were \"further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum\".\nGPS is a critically important system, used on planes ships and road vehicles and by the militarily, as well as helping your smartphone determine your location.\nBut signals from GPS satellites can be  jammed, or \"spoofed\" to give misleading location data.\nIn March, an RAF plane carrying UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory.\nFinland's flag carrier Finnair even had to suspend daily flights to Estonia's second largest city, Tartu, for a month, after two of its aircraft suffered GPS interference.\nExperts have accused Russia of causing disruption to satellite navigation systems affecting thousands of civilian flights. \nMany military technologies, including drones and missiles, use GPS.\nBut GPS jamming can also be carried out on a small scale, for example by people driving vehicles their employers have fitted with GPS trackers.\nGPS relies on receiving signals from space, but a GPS satellite emits no more power than a car headlight, meaning it can easily be jammed, experts say.\nThe new system uses a group of atoms, cooled to -273C, almost as cold as its possible to get. Because they are carried on the plane itself, they can't be interfered with by spoofing or jamming.\nThe aim is to use these atoms to measure the direction the plane is pointing in and its acceleration.\nAll of that combined could be used to determine where the plane is with a high degree of accuracy.\nIt is called a quantum system because that is the name of the science of very small particles.\nIndividual atoms are mind-boggling small - a hair is about a million atoms wide - and working on this scale is difficult enough on the ground.\nThe flight demonstrated that these atoms could be used in the very limited space, and generally challenging, environment of an aircraft.\n\nAccording to the government, this is the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and \"the first such flights worldwide that have been publicly acknowledged\".\nThe trials, which concluded earlier this month, involved quantum tech firm Infleqtion, in collaboration with aerospace companies BAE Systems and QinetiQ.\nBut at present, despite the tiny scale of quantum technology, the equipment itself is large. Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the project, said for that reason he thought the first application could be aboard ships, \"where there's a bit more space\".\nHowever, he told the BBC that in five to ten years it could be the size of a shoebox, and a thousand times more accurate than comparable systems.\nThere has been concern about the vulnerability of shipping to attacks on satellite navigation.\nMr White sees the system primarily as a back-up to GPS.\n\"You're not going to get rid of your satellite systems, they are very convenient,\" he said.\nSignals from GPS satellites can also be used as an extremely accurate way of telling the time.  The test flight also took a quantum clock on board to see if it could work as a backup if GPS were blocked. In the lab, Mr White said the best quantum clocks can be incredibly accurate.\n\"If you started them at the beginning of the universe, they may have lost a second by now,\" he said.\nMr White believes the test is a \"major milestone\" but acknowledges it will take time before the technology is in active use.\nKen Munro of Pen Test Partners, a cybersecurity firm that works in aviation, said the test was a \"big step in the right direction\", but added \"it would still be 10 to 20 years before we see any practical implementation\", in commercial aviation in the UK.",
    "A few thoughts about Russian reshuffles.\nThought number one: whoever's sitting around the cabinet table in Russia, there's only one man taking the key decisions in the country - and that's President Putin. \nIn modern Russia the entire political system is constructed around him. It's worth keeping in mind when discussing who's in and who's out of the government. Central policy is unlikely to change. \nDoes that mean that a Russian government reshuffle isn't interesting, or significant?\nNo, it doesn't. Sergei Shoigu's departure from the defence ministry is fascinating on many levels. \nAfter all - and this brings us on to thought number two - reshuffles are a rare thing in Russia. At least, as far as the most prominent political players are concerned.\nTake Sergei Lavrov, Russia's veteran foreign minister. He's had the job for 20 years. Sergei Shoigu had been defence minister for 12 years (in that time, the UK has been through six secretaries of defence).\nMr Shoigu is considered a close ally of President Putin.\nCue to thought number three: being close to Putin, going on fishing and hunting trips with the president (yes, Sergei Shoigu did that - they even, famously, went mushroom-picking together), none of that is any guarantee you'll keep your job.\nSergei Shoigu has been replaced as defence minister by technocrat economist Andrei Belousov. Mr Shoigu hasn't been made redundant. He'll head the Russian Security Council in place of the hawkish Nikolai Patrushev. \nBut it doesn't feel like a promotion. \nSo why has a Putin loyalist been moved out of the defence ministry? Why has an economist replaced him? And what does this tell us about Vladimir Putin?\nIt's not a complete surprise. Rumours abounded that Sergei Shoigu could be sidelined. One of his deputies, Timur Ivanov, was recently arrested on corruption charges. \nWhat's more, replacing Mr Shoigu with an economist makes sense, when you consider the huge amount of money the authorities have been pouring into Russia's war in Ukraine.\nDefence spending in Russia has been ratcheted up to an estimated 7% of GDP. Increasingly it feels as if the Russian economy is being placed on a war footing. \nThere is a logic to having a defence minister who understands finances, economic planning and the need for efficiency - someone, too, unconnected to allegations of corruption currently under investigation. \nBut what's interesting is that Vladimir Putin chose this moment to make the switch. The president had stuck by Shoigu in 2022 when Russia was suffering military setbacks in Ukraine.\nHe'd stuck by him again in 2023 during the minister's very public spat with the late Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, who had accused Shoigu of corruption and demanded he be sacked.\nNow, when Russia claims to have seized the initiative on the battlefield, the Kremlin leader has replaced his defence minister. It shows once again that Vladimir Putin doesn't like acting under pressure. He takes decisions at a time of his choosing.  \nBut there is one more feature of a Russian government reshuffle. It always leaves you asking questions. There are plenty after this one. \nSo here we go.\nWhat next for Sergei Shoigu? Can he carve out a new power base in the Security Council, or is it inevitable that in his new post his power will be vastly reduced?  \nWhat next for the man he replaces in the Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev?

    "A man who stabbed his father multiple times with a hunting knife following a row over his inheritance has been jailed for life.\nShazhan Hussain, 34, drove to Bradford from his home in South Wales to carry out the attack on 19 April last year.\nHe was jailed for life with a minimum term of 12 years and 345 days after pleading guilty to attempted murder at Bradford Crown Court.\n\"This was a horrific and sustained attack and the victim is very lucky to be alive today,\" Det Insp Laura Casey said.\n\"Hussain drove hundreds of miles to carry out the attack and had previously threatened the victim over a number of years.\n\"I hope today\u2019s lengthy sentence provides the victim with some comfort in knowing that he will be behind bars for a very long time.\"\nThe prosecution had alleged that Hussain resented his father for re-marrying following a divorce and that he had started to demand his inheritance before his father died.\nAbdul Rouf, 52, said he believed his son intended to kill him because he would not do what his son had wanted about the inheritance.\nHe suggested that his son may have had mental health issues and said the threats had intensified over the last four or five years.\nWhen armed police later stopped Hussain\u2019s car as he drove back to South Wales after the attack they found a knife with blood on it matching Mr Rouf\u2019s DNA.\nIn a victim impact statement made last July Mr Rouf said he had struggled with the fact that his own son had attacked him.\nHe said he had nightmares about the incident and flashbacks when he walked into his kitchen.\nThe court heard that Hussain changed his pleas after a mobile phone recording came to light relating to him visiting his father\u2019s home in Harrogate Terrace, Bradford, while the complainant was working abroad.\nDuring that visit Hussain said he had disowned his father and made threats to murder both his father and his second wife.\nBarrister Gary Bell KC, for Hussain, said his client had formed the view that his father had ruined his life and subjected him to physical and mental abuse.\nMr Bell said Hussain had expressed remorse and accepted that it was a terrible thing for him to have done.\nJudge Jonathan Gibson said Hussain had had an extremely strong grievance against his father arising from his divorce and subsequent re-marriage.\nHe added: \"I am satisfied your offence is so serious that a sentence of life imprisonment is required and that\u2019s the sentence that I impose.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes has called for an investigation into emergency medical provision on Skye after a woman died at a music festival.\nAn ambulance was sent shortly before midnight on Saturday after the woman took unwell at Portree's Skye Live festival.\nMs Forbes said she was \"hugely concerned\" by reports that emergency access to Portree Community Hospital was limited at the time.\nNHS Highland said ambulance crews had responded to the incident, but declined to give further comment due to patient confidentiality.\nCampaigners have called for improvements to Portree hospital services, that were previously recommended in a review six years ago.\nThese include out-of-hours urgent care being available 24 hours a day, all week. \nMs Forbes said she was saddened by the death and thanked emergency services involved.\nHowever, she said she was \"hugely concerned by reports that during a medical emergency, access to Portree hospital was limited for vital life-saving equipment\". \nShe said: \"This is extremely serious if so.\"\n\"My first aim is to get all the facts so that I understand precisely what happened, and secondly there must be accountability.\"\nMs Forbes said she had asked NHS Highland to investigate medical provision in north Skye, and had raised the weekend's incident with the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) and Health Secretary Neil Gray. \nMs Forbes said: \"The full implementation of the Sir Lewis Ritchie report recommendations is something local campaigners and I have been pushing for some time now.\n\"Enough is enough. It has been six years, and the timescales for delivering the recommendations keeps shifting. \n\"North Skye in particular needs to know there is resilience and confidence in their local health service.\"\nThe festival was held over Thursday, Friday and Saturday and attended by about 1,000 people from Skye and further afield.\nThe event featured Scottish Traditional, folk and indie-folk music.\nNHS Highland said the SAS attended Saturday's incident and, also another medical emergency in Portree at the weekend.\nA spokesman said the SAS had been helped by an off-duty nurse and a doctor sent from Broadford Hospital, which is 25 miles from Portree.\nThe spokesman said: \"Emergency care is available 24/7 by contacting 999 in the event of a life-threatening emergency.\"\nThe health board said non-emergency out-of-hours urgent care was available at Portree hospital by appointment on Saturdays, Sundays, and bank holidays from 08:30 to 19:30.\nSkye Live told BBC Scotland News: \u201cWe are heartbroken by the tragic incident that occurred at our festival. \n\"Our thoughts are with the person\u2019s loved ones, and we continue to cooperate fully with the authorities.\"\nPolice Scotland said the woman's death was not thought to be suspicious.\nA spokesperson said officers' inquiries were continuing and a report would be sent to the procurator fiscal.",
    "The right for terminally ill people on the Isle of Man to be helped to die could be a step closer after crucial votes in its parliament on Tuesday.\nMembers will debate whether lethal drugs should be self-administered or given to those eligible by doctors.\nThe island could become the first part of the British Isles to pass assisted-dying legislation.\nIf royal assent is received next year, its first assisted death could come as soon as 2027.\nAnother crown dependency, Jersey, is set to vote on proposals next week, although it has yet to introduce a bill. Both islands set their own laws.\nDr Alex Allinson, a politician and doctor, introduced the private members' bill at Tynwald, the Isle of Man parliament.\nHe told the BBC that \"fewer than a dozen\" people a year would be expected to opt for an assisted death, which was now \"a step closer\" to becoming reality.\nLast week, members of the House of Keys (MHKs), roughly equivalent to the House of Commons at Westminster, began debating the clauses of the Assisted Dying Bill, which passed its second reading in October.\nThis is a pivotal stage of the legislation as politicians vote on the details of who would be eligible. \nThe bill allows for the provision of assisted dying for terminally ill adults with capacity and a \"clear and settled intention\" to end their lives.\nTwo key changes to the original bill have been approved so far. Firstly, MHKs voted to increase the required residency period on the Isle of Man from one year to five, after concerns that it could encourage so-called \"death tourism\".\nSecondly, politicians backed a change to allow those with less than a year to live the right to die, rather than six months as originally proposed.\nDr Allinson said the legislation would help \"a very small number of people\" to have \"autonomy and control over how and when they die\".\nBut Julie Edge, another member of the House of Keys, described it as a \"kill bill\" saying there were not enough safeguards in place, adding that it could put \"additional cost and pressures on the health service\", and deter doctors from coming to the island.\nThe clauses yet to be voted on concern the involvement of the medical profession in assisted dying. \nThe bill currently states that two doctors must verify that people meet the eligibility criteria.\nOne of the most controversial areas to be voted on is whether patients could ask a doctor to give them a lethal injection, a form of voluntary euthanasia. The other option is to restrict it to patients self-administering the drugs.\nOnce the clauses stage is completed at the House of Keys, the bill will then go for Third Reading - usually a formality - before being sent to the Legislative Council, the equivalent of the House of Lords. After that it would require the Privy Council in London to grant Royal Assent.\nThere would then follow a period of at least a year while the health service on the island sets up the system and decides how it should operate. \nHowever, the island's chief minister, Alfred Cannan, has said the bill should be put to a public vote before it becomes law. His proposal for a referendum may not be voted on until next month. \nA third of doctors who responded to an Isle of Man Medical Society survey last year said they would consider leaving if the legislation was introduced.\nDr Duncan Gerry, a geriatrician, fears that the legislation will be a \"slippery slope\". He told the BBC: \"When you allow people to be killed by their doctor, it begins a journey that doesn't stop.   \n\"Vulnerable people will start out with an offer, which becomes a suggestion, which becomes an obligation to die.\"\nHowever, Sue Biggerstaff says the current law forces people like her husband Simon to die in excruciating pain.\nSimon was diagnosed with motor neurone disease, or MND, in July 2021 and within a month was paralysed from the neck down. She says his final months were \"hateful\" because he was in constant pain despite \"wonderful\" support from district nurses, doctors and a hospice team. \n\"Simon had intravenous morphine in both legs, and both arms and patches. And he was still in pain. It was unbearable to watch.\"\nShe says Simon had open wounds which would not heal: \"They told me that Simon's body was decomposing while he was still alive. Nobody should be made to go through that.\"\nSue says he asked a doctor how long it would take to die if he refused food, and was told about 30 days.\nSimon, 65, died 11 months after his diagnosis.  She concluded: \"I hate having to relive this but I will do it over and over again if it just stops other people having to go through it.\"\nClare Barber, a former nurse, is another member of the House of Keys who is backing the legislation.  She says she has seen \"first-hand\" some people unable to have a pain-free death.\n\"I have worked in intensive care, hospice, nursing homes, and I've come across people who have openly expressed a will for assisted dying, because they're suffering.  \n\"They have absolute capacity and the ability to make",
    "Parents in the Borders claim they are being punished for choosing country living after their local nurseries were earmarked for closure.\nScottish Borders Council announced at Easter that early years centres in Westruther and Fountainhall would close this summer.\nParents now face trips of up to 15 miles to the closest alternative nurseries.\nMum-of-two Rebecca Brinson, whose son had just started at Fountainhall, said: \"One of the draws of moving here was the small country school and nursery along the road.\"\nLike many local authorities Scottish Borders Council is facing budget pressures. \nDepartments have been tasked with finding significant savings.\nEducation officials at the Newtown St Boswells HQ identified a reduction in early years provision - which includes the loss of five full-time posts.\nParents at Fountainhall and Westruther say a lack of consultation has led to mistakes being made.\nMum-of-three Natasha King, whose daughter attends Fountainhall early years centre, said: \"The whole reason for our children going to a school nursery is so they can progress to the school with their peers.\n\"If the council had spent five minutes talking to us, they'd realise this is a big mistake - they are working from inaccurate figures.\n\"I feel we're being punished for choosing a rural life.\"\nAlthough numbers at both pre-school centres have dropped in the past two years, parents claim new housing being built and other families recently moving to both areas would see the rolls swell in future years.\nPleas to education bosses to reconsider the decision have not been sucessful. All pre-school children are now being offered alternative arrangements.\nParents of children at Fountainhall are being offered places five miles (8km) away at Stow Primary School.\nParents in Westruther  will have to take their children eight miles (13km) further to Lauder.\nThey approached local MSP, Rachael Hamilton, to take up their fight.\nThe member for for Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire said: \"We\u2019ve had over one hundred signatures for our campaign to keep the Westruther nursery open so far.\n\u201cNursery provision and childcare in rural towns and villages is incredibly important to ensure that our children get the best start in life.\n\u201cWorking parents often rely on local childcare support to look after their child while they\u2019re at work.\n\u201cWithout these basic services available to new families, it only makes it harder for people to settle in the Borders.\"\nMany parents are angry about the inconvenience of changing nurseries along with the additional cost and time before and after work.\nBut changing to larger facilities - where the rolls are around four times higher - will cause further difficulties for some children. \nRebecca Brinson explained: \"My son is not keen on big settings and lots of people - that's why we're so pleased with him going to Fountainhall.\n\"Starting at a new place won't be easy for him.\n\"And the idea of him being at Fountainhall nursery for one term, then moving for a year to Stow, and then coming back  to Fountainhall to start primary school is far from ideal.\"\nAgnes Dun, who lives on a farm near the village of Heriot, was hoping to return to work after maternity leave for her third child.\nShe said: \"This couldn't have happened at a worse time. My daughter just started at Fountainhall and she loves it - she's settled in really well.\n\"Stow is too far away for us, so it looks like we'll have to try to get hours at the private nursery over at Pathhead.\n\"We've not had much notice from the council so we're still not sure exactly how we're going to manage things.\"\nAll three and four-year-olds in Scotland are entitled to 1,140 hours of fully funded early learning and childcare.\nThe Scottish government also provides funding for some two-year-olds.\nScottish Borders Council said the decision was made to close both early years centres due to 'very low numbers of children'.\nAnd both nurseries have been moved to 'inactive'.\nA spokeswoman added: \"The enrolment period was taken up until the end of Easter term to allow for any late preferences being expressed but the numbers were too low to ensure the children attending received the high quality experience we require of our settings. \n\"All children have been offered their second choice setting and will continue to be able to  access their full entitlement of funded early learning and childcare.\"\nA further review will take place next year to gauge whether they can be re-opened.",
    "An Ipswich Town and Colchester United photographer who attended almost 1,500 games will hang up his cameras as he retires \"on a high\".\nWarren Page has been capturing the two football clubs in Suffolk and Essex respectively for the past 30 years, covering 1,456 games so far.\nMr Page will finish up his career just before Ipswich Town moves up into the Premier League.\nDespite this he said he felt it was the right time. \n\"I've been thinking about it for a few years, it's not the easiest of lives,\" Mr Page explained.\n\"I've spent an awful lots of Saturdays photographing both Colchester and Ipswich away and it was hard on the family life.\n\"It's about the timing - we finished at Hull and got home at 4am so there's a lot of late nights.\n\"I take longer to recover at my age,\" he joked.\nMr Page said the emotions of retiring hit him during Ipswich's game against Coventry away in April. \n\"That was the first time it really sunk in that I won't be doing this anymore,\" he said.\n\"It's been a major part of my life.\"\nMr Page started off his career as a press officer for a local team, taking photos of the matches and writing up reports before he moved into sole photography. \nHe said the industry had changed a lot in his career partly thanks to advances in digital photography.\n\"My lovely wife used to sit in the car outside the old Layer Road ground and 10 minutes before kick off I would run into the ground and photograph as much as I could for the first 15 minutes because we had no processing facilities in Colchester,\" he explained. \n\"I would drive back to Ipswich, run into a dark room and we had the whole black and white processing by hand, film on a spool in the dark and I look back now and wonder why there were only five or six photos for any particular game.\n\"Whereas now for a game, like the Coventry game, I sent 59 pictures through.\"\nHis career has provided many brilliant moments to look back on. \n\"Shefki Kuqi was brilliant as he did his swan dive and leap in the air - it was great knowing it was coming and being able to capture [the goal],\" Mr Page explained. \n\"Lomana LuaLua who played for Colchester was probably the best player I had ever seen. \n\"He used to do somersaults and all manner of stuff when he scored.\"\nMr Page was also the first person to capture former Ipswich Town chairman and owner Marcus Evans.\nHe also was able to capture when former Ipswich player David Norris celebrated a goal against Blackpool with a handcuffs celebration that ultimately saw him fined. \n\"They were the two big [moments],\" Mr Page added.\nFor aspiring sports photographers, Mr Page shared the industry secret to getting the perfect shot: \"Anticipation, knowing the game and your timing.\n\"Timing is split second especially with things like goals.\n\"I've had trouble with Ipswich this year because their build ups are so good and they'll cut the ball back with someone on the end of it to tap it into the net.\n\"You have to predict where that player is going to be and it is not easy.\n\"I hate missing goals, all the people that travel with me will know I don't take it lightly and if I miss two it's even worse.\"\nFollow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A life-saving anti-overdose drug is to be made available for use at home in England without a prescription.\nThe medicine, known as naloxone, will be given to addicts at risk of an opioid overdose for use in an emergency.\nPolice officers, social workers and probation officers are among those who will be allowed to distribute the medicine.\nThe measure was a key recommendation in a 2020 review of drug services.\nOpioid-related deaths \u2013 for example from heroin or powerful synthetic opioids like fentanyl - make up the biggest proportion of drug fatalities across the UK.\nThere is an average of 40 deaths a week across the country.\nBut administering the drug naloxone to someone who is overdosing can be life-saving, by easing potentially fatal breathing difficulties.\nMany police officers and ambulance crews already have supplies for emergency use.\nUntil now, only drug and alcohol treatment services could provide naloxone for home use.\nIn March I reported on the efforts of the Blackpool-based charity Empowerment to help people come off drugs like heroin.\nThe \"Lived Experience\" team in Blackpool is made up of former drug addicts, many of whom told me that Naloxone had saved their lives, sometimes on multiple occasions.\nThe staff at Empowerment were among those who could give doses of the drug to their clients, knowing that if an overdose was to occur at home, this could be a lifesaving intervention.\nThe law is being changed to allow paramedics, the police, social workers, probation officers and those working with the homeless to provide take-home supplies.\nEngland's Health Secretary Victoria Atkins said the aim was to reduce annual drug-related deaths by 1,000 by 2025.\n\u201cOpioid addiction can ruin lives and is responsible for the largest proportion of drug-related deaths across the UK,\" she said.\n\u201cWe are working hard to reduce those numbers by expanding access to naloxone to save the lives of the most vulnerable.\u201d\nThe measure was a key recommendation in a 2020 review of drug services by Prof Dame Carol Black, who welcomed Tuesday\u2019s announcement.\n\u201cWhen I did my independent review of drugs, I heard first hand what a life-saving intervention naloxone is,\" she said.\n\u201cWidening access to naloxone is key to reducing the number of lives lost to overdose and will help support the government's ambition to prevent nearly 1,000 deaths in England by the end of 2025.\n\"I am pleased to see such a strong positive response to the consultation and welcome the government moving forward with these important changes.\u201d\nThe Black report also called for changes to the recruitment and training of the workforce that specialises in helping those struggling with drug and alcohol addiction.\n\nThe government has now revealed what it says is a 10-year plan to transform the workforce, including funding for 800 more medical and mental health drug workers, 950 additional drug and alcohol and criminal justice workers, and more posts to organise and co-ordinate teams in local councils.\nThere will also be improved and more formalised training and accreditation for drug workers.\nClare Taylor, chief operating officer at Turning Point, a social enterprise that works with those struggling with drink and drug addiction, said the workforce plan should help to improve the services that are available.\n\u201cThe new workforce plan sets out a clear set of actions to increase capacity in the system and the quality of services,\" she said.\n\u201cIt recognises the need for the right mix of medical and mental health professionals working alongside key workers and peer support workers, and should help strengthen clinical governance to enable the best possible outcomes for the people we support.\n\u201cWorking in this sector can be incredibly rewarding, and formalising training routes and developing better opportunities for career progression will help ensure it\u2019s a sector people want to join.\n\u201cContinued funding of the drug strategy beyond March 2025 is now essential in ensuring these plans can come to fruition and we as a sector are able to reach more people.\"\n",
    "River levels are on the rise again in the flood-stricken Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul after more heavy rains on the weekend. \nThe Taquari and Ca\u00ed rivers have burst their banks and are causing fresh flooding in the interior of the state.\nMore than half a million people have been displaced from their homes and 147 are confirmed to have died in the floods.\nRescue workers continue to search for people who are missing. \nThe rise in the water levels of the Taquari and Ca\u00ed is particularly worrying because the two rivers flow into the Gua\u00edba, which has already caused severe flooding in the state capital, Porto Alegre.\nLarge parts of the city, which is home to 1.5m people, remain under water, with the historic centre particularly badly hit. \nSoldiers have been patrolling flooded neighbourhoods in boats after reports of lootings. \nBrazil's President, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, has delayed his planned visit to Chile to co-ordinate the government's response.\nThe president said that emergency funds would be made available to rebuild damaged infrastructure.\nUS President Joe Biden on Saturday said that his government had been in touch with his Brazilian counterpart to provide assistance.\nLocally, residents who have access to boats have been helping rescue people stranded by the rising water.\nIvan Brizola told BBC News Brasil that he had rescued hundreds of people by kayak, even though he cannot swim. \n\nThe 59-year-old from Porto Alegre said he had borrowed the kayak to help people in nearby Canoas \"as the water started to flood their neighbourhoods\".\nHe estimated that the water in the streets of Canoas was between eight to 10m (26-33ft) deep in places.\nTogether with other volunteers, Mr Brizola managed to ferry people from areas which were hard to access to bigger boats.\nHis son estimates that Mr Brizola has rescued more than 300 people and countless pets over the past week.\nThe flooding has been caused by torrential rains which started at the end of April.\nMeteorologists say that the beginning of May has been the wettest that Porto Alegre has experienced in the past 63 years.\nResearchers at ClimaMeter, who study weather extremes, have said that the cyclical rains this area is prone to have become more intense due to climate change. \nThe world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.\n",
    "Health Minister Robin Swann has said executive meetings in November 2020 on Covid rules were the \"lowest days\" he's ever experienced in politics.\nHe told the UK Covid-19 inquiry the behaviour at and leaking of the meetings in \"live time\" was wrong.\nThe meetings happened on 9-12 November 2020 when NI was experiencing a second surge in Covid cases.\nMr Swann criticised the DUP for deploying a cross-community vote to block some restrictions being extended.\nHe told the Covid inquiry: \"From my time in politics there have been some highs and lows - but those four days were the lowest I've ever experienced in politics, in regards to the behaviour... and how those meetings were actually portrayed.\"\nHe said that while the deployment of a cross-community vote was a legal tool available to parties at the executive, he questioned whether it was \"morally right\".\nIt is a mechanism that can be deployed on any issue in the executive, if three or more ministers ask for a vote to be taken on that basis.\nIt was originally designed to protect minority rights, but effectively gives parties with enough ministers a veto.\n\"The fact I, as a unionist minister, was bringing forward a recommendation that was then subject to a vote by another unionist party steps outside the rationale as to what that mechanism was created for,\" said Mr Swann.\nHe said the period was particularly challenging and that it allowed people who were looking an excuse not to follow Covid rules a reason, as the executive was not \"joined up\".\nHe also told the inquiry that the attendance of senior Sinn F\u00e9in politicians at the controversial funeral of republican Bobby Storey in June 2020 meant the executive lost confidence of the public.\nBut he welcomed an acceptance from Sinn F\u00e9in MLA Car\u00e1l N\u00ed Chuil\u00edn that she should not have attended the funeral in her capacity as a minister.\nEarlier Mr Swann told the inquiry the leaking of information from executive meetings during the Covid pandemic was \"tolerated rather than challenged\".\nHe said it was frustrating that information was often leaked \"in real time\" to the media.\nHe often felt it was a \"deliberate\" attempt to condition how the conversation about restrictions would go when the executive met, the minister said in evidence on Monday.\nHe said papers were often shared late with executive colleagues and would be leaked to the media, allowing a \"narrative\" to be established.\nHe added there were various attempts to stop the leaking of information, which became \"so endemic that it became tolerated rather than challenged\".\n\"At times there was a live feed from the meetings, which left it extremely challenging at times for ministers to be open\", Mr Swann said.\nInquiry chair Baroness Hallett asked him if banning electronic devices was ever discussed as an option, to which the minister responded that various attempts to stop leaking were made.\nMr Swann said there was one attempt at a leak inquiry undertaken by the then permanent secretary of the Department of Finance, Sue Gray.\nHe said he did not believe a finding ever came from that.\nMr Swann went on to describe how \"opportunities were lost\" during the pandemic as there had been no government in place for three years prior. \n\"Green sites could have been up and running to deal with cancer cases\" while simultaneously dealing with Covid, he said. \nHe added that social care was reduced to a \"Cinderella service\" due to the mounting pressure on the healthcare system. \nThe health minister said it was a \"lonely and challenging position\" as the sole Ulster Unionist minister in the executive during the pandemic. \nMr Swann was appointed health minister in January 2020 when power sharing at Stormont returned.\nBut he added that on recollection it was also a \"strength\" as he did not have to answer to party political colleagues.  \nHe said that during the pandemic, he believed he did have support from other parties.\nFirst Minister Michelle O'Neill is due to give evidence on Tuesday, with her former partner in the Executive Office, Baroness Foster, due to appear on Wednesday.\nDuring the pandemic Ms O'Neill was deputy first minister from January 2020 until February 2022, while Baroness Foster was first minister from January 2020 until June 2021.\nThe inquiry is due to conclude sitting in Belfast on Thursday, when Sue Gray, who is now chief of staff to Sir Keir Starmer, is due to give evidence.",

    "A fire officer called to a blaze at a car dealership says it might have been started by an electric vehicle.\nLee Alford, station manager at Avon and Fire Rescue Service, said crews have \"reason to believe\" it was started by an EV, but added that investigations were ongoing and no conclusions had been reached yet.\nA major road was closed in north Bristol when the fire began at the Drive Vauxhall Bristol North premises off Gloucester Road in Patchway at about 10:00 BST.\nMr Alford said at least 25 cars were involved and the fire service believed the fire was \"accidental\". The dealership has confirmed nobody was injured.\nCrews from Patchway, Southmead, Temple and Thornbury went to the scene and thick black smoke was seen rising from the site.\nAn eyewitness, who had been working nearby, told the BBC he saw \"huge great plumes of black thick smoke going up for about 20 minutes\" and when he drove closer to the site he saw \"two or three\" cars on fire.\nMr Alford said by the time the fire crews arrived, the first car was \"fully engulfed\" and the heat had quickly travelled to surrounding cars.\n\"The smoke plume was considerable and it looks quite dramatic, given the amount of cars involved in the fire,\" he said.\n\"We've got fire investigations ongoing at the moment. \n\"Due to the capacity of how the cars are parked and the location of where they are, once a fire is fully engulfed on a car then the radiated heat tends to travel quite quickly. \n\"Hence the full involvement, we believe more than 25 cars in the entirety were involved.\"\nHe added: \"We have reason to believe it may have been an electric car that started the fire at the moment, but fire investigation is currently ongoing.\"\nMr Alford said the fire service would re-inspect the cars in the next few days.\nHe said the Drive Motor Group was helping with the investigation into the fire on the dealership site located close to the Rolls Royce base and Royal Mail postal office.\nAvon Fire and Rescue Service said: \"Ten of our firefighters wore breathing apparatus for safety.\"\nIt said the service was still on site \"to check for any remaining hotspots and to ensure the safety of the scene\".

    "A mother says she would be \"apprehensive and worried\" to have another baby at a hospital which was recently rated as \"inadequate\" by inspectors. \nAlice Sands, from Taunton said she had a \"tricky\" experience when she gave birth to her son at Musgrove Park Hospital in March. \nThe Care Quality Commission (CQC) found expired milk in the fridge and concluded there had been a \"deterioration\" in the quality of care provided at the hospital.\nSomerset NHS Foundation Trust's chief executive, Peter Lewis, apologised and said \"significant action\" had been taken in response to the concerns raised. \n\"We know we haven\u2019t delivered to the standards we\u2019d expect to deliver to, let alone what the CQC would expect us to deliver, but nevertheless it is still a disappointment,\" he added.\nSpeaking about her experience at the hospital, Ms Sands said due to the delivery suite being full, she had to wait two days until they broke her waters.\nShe said her son was born within 28 minutes of going into the delivery room.\nMs Sands said she would be worried to have another baby at the hospital after the long wait time and she pain she experienced last time.\nShe said: \u201cAll the midwives did try their best, they did go above and beyond with what they had.\"\n\"But it seems like it was the facilities that put them down,\" she added. \nInspectors noted the buildings at Musgrove Park were in poor condition and required regular maintenance, which \"posed an ongoing challenge for the quality of maternity services they were able to provide.\"\nMeanwhile, Alicia Mason, from Wellington, Somerset, who had her first baby via a c-section at Musgrove Park Hospital 18 months ago, said all the staff were \"amazing\" despite going through the \"quite a traumatic experience\" of giving birth.\nIn October, she plans on having her second child there. \nShe said: \u201cI think maternity services are a bit all over the place in general at the moment.\"\n\"I\u2019m still confident that I\u2019ll have a positive experience,\" she added. \nDanielle Bond, from Creech St Michael, gave birth to her son 10 months ago.  \nShe was induced at Musgrove Park for five days, and after more than 12 hours of labour, underwent an emergency c-section. \nAlthough she said she was looked after \"really well\", she added: \u201cIt\u2019s a daunting time anyway having a child, whether it\u2019s your first or second. \n\"Every birth is different, every labour is different, so it must be difficult.\"\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "The mother of an autistic teenager who took his own life after being treated in an adult psychiatric ward has welcomed the announcement of an inquiry into his death.\nHarris Macdonnell, 19, died in August 2020, which his family say was caused by his fear of being sent back to the Huntlyburn ward by NHS Borders.\nHarris, from near Melrose, had been admitted to an adult psychiatric ward three years earlier after suffering a breakdown, and was later diagnosed with autism.\nHis mother Dr Jane Macdonnell said she was \"relieved\" that the Crown had confirmed a Fatal Accident Inquiry (FAI) would now go ahead.\nShe had campaigned for the inquiry to be held into his death\nScotland's Lord Advocate confirmed it would be \"in the public interest\" to review the death. \nAt the age of 16, Harris became acutely unwell but was admitted to the local adult psychiatric inpatient unit as there were no beds in any young person's unit in Scotland.\nHis mother said this had a devastating effect on the teenager, who had been a keen rugby player and musician.\nDr Macdonnell told BBC Scotland News: \"We have some specific issues that we would like addressed.\n\"We believe that there needs to be better inpatient facilities for children and young people. What Harris experienced was really unacceptable.\"\nDr Macdonnell said there was a \"real lack of specialist knowledge\" for young people and autism. \nShe previously told BBC Scotland News that his stay in the ward left Harris with \"significant short and long term difficulties in his mental and physical health and his ability to engage with local services\".\nThe Covid lockdown for coronavirus also had an adverse effect on Harris' mental health, as he became withdrawn and struggled to fit in socially. \nSince her son's death, Dr Macdonnell has established the Harris Trust, a charity that uses music and sport to provide young people with activities.\nProcurator Fiscal Andy Shanks, who leads on fatalities investigations for the Crown office, said the inquiry would \"ensure that there can be a full public hearing of the facts of the case\".\nA notice will now be lodged with the sheriff court, followed by the timescale for the first preliminary hearing being set out in legislation.\nDr Macdonnell said she did not expect the FAI to proceed until early in 2025.

    "A 16-year-old was arrested after entering a Catholic church in Louisiana with a gun, inciting panic among children gathered for their First Holy Communion last weekend. \nWhen police arrived to St Mary Magdalen in Abbeville, they found a teen unarmed and pinned to the ground by parishioners, according to local news.\nNo one was harmed during the incident, which was captured on a livestream.\nThe FBI is assisting Abbeville Police with the investigation.\nFootage from the incident over the weekend shows a man walking up to the priest mid-ceremony to whisper something in his ear. The priest then stops the ceremony and asks the congregation to join him in prayer - then panic erupts.\nAccording to a St Mary Magdalen Catholic Church Facebook post, ''a suspicious person opened the back door of the building\". Witnesses told local news that he was armed and dressed in black.\nChurchgoers slowly noticed him, and in the footage, cries and screams erupt from the church pews as the priest is seen slowly ducking behind the altar. Multiple children are seen running across the screen. \nThe church described the encounter over the weekend as a \"frightening experience\" that \"understandably caused a panic\" in the post.\n\"The individual was immediately confronted by parishioners, escorted outside and the police were called,\" a church Facebook post said. \n\"It was the scariest thing I have ever gone through,\" one woman wrote on social media. \nWhen police arrived at 10:35 CST (16:35 BST), they \"made a sweep through the church to make sure there was no additional threat\", the Abbeville Police Department said. \nAbbeville Police Chief Mike Hardy told local news that the suspect said there was a second shooter nearby. However, police said they didn't find evidence of that.\nThe suspect was taken into custody and questioned, then taken to be medically evaluated. He is charged with terrorizing and two counts of possession of a firearm by a juvenile, police said.\nIn the Facebook post, St Mary Magdalen thanked its parishioners and police for \"acting quickly to ensure safety for all\" and said uniformed police will be at all upcoming Masses \"out of an abundance of caution\". \nThe encounter follows a similar scene also captured on video in Pennsylvania. On 5 May, a man walked into a church service, aimed a gun at the pastor and pulled the trigger. The gun jammed, sparing the pastor. \nThe man was restrained by parishioners until police arrived and placed him under arrest.",
    "A bereaved mother who found the grave of her baby son 53 years after he was stillborn is calling for an official apology for the practices of the past.\nGina Jacobs, from Wirral, Merseyside, said she wants the government to say sorry for what she describes as \"lies, disrespect and a lack of dignity\" towards mothers who suffered a loss.  \nBefore the 1980s, stillborn babies were taken away from families who were not given any details of what happened to their babies or where they were buried.\nFor more than 50 years Mrs Jacobs carried the grief of not knowing the whereabouts of her stillborn baby son, until she finally found him almost two years ago. \nShe found him at Landican cemetery in Birkenhead after watching a series on the issue on BBC North West Tonight.\nThe 79-year-old named him Robert and decided to share her story online.\nSince then she\u2019s gone on to help other bereaved mothers to find more than 60 babies at her local cemetery.\n\u201cSo many people got in touch and I couldn\u2019t refuse. \n\"I had to help. But there was so much joy in it.\u201d\nIn March, Mrs Jacobs received the Wirral Award in recognition of her efforts. \nIt is a civil award intended to recognise individuals for an outstanding achievement.\n\u201cI felt the award was in honour of the babies and the families and the people who suffered so much through the arrangement of the time. \n\"The memory of those little precious faces has been stolen from us because we weren\u2019t allowed to see them.\u201d\nBack then, it was the belief of medical professionals that it was in the best interests of the mother to keep them from seeing their babies, and knowing what happened to them afterwards.\n\u201cThe mums were told to go home and get on with it. \n\"I mean, one lady was told \u2018plenty more where those came from\u2019.\u201d\nNow, she is hoping for an official apology which her MP, Margaret Greenwood, is supporting. \nEarlier this month, the MP took the issue to the Commons, raising it at Prime Minster's Questions. \nShe asked Prime Minster Rishi Sunak whether he would apologise on behalf of all previous governments for the former practice which left grieving parents with nowhere to visit their buried children.\nThe Wirral West MP said she wanted to make sure Mrs Jacobs received national recognition for what she\u2019s achieved.\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t an apology but there was a good response. I think it was great that [the Prime Minister] paid tribute to her,\" the Labour MP said.\nMr Sunak said that \"one of the most incredible things about doing his job was meeting people like Gina\".\nMr Sunak said in response to the question: \u201cShe deserves nothing but our praise and admiration and I am so pleased that she has brought comfort to so many other people, too.\u201d\nThe great, great grandmother never gave her baby boy a name until she finally found him in 2022, when she named him Robert.\n\u201cRobert was mentioned. His name was actually mentioned in the House of Commons. That meant so much to me.\u201d\nShe said she was pleased with the comments of the prime minster but that the issue of the apology was skirted around.\n\u201cIt has to be, I think, our government to apologise for what happened with previous governments, which is someone to just say, \u2018we\u2019re sorry\u2019,\" she said. \n\"\u2018We\u2019re sorry that you all were put through that. Sorry for the lies, sorry for disrespect and for the lack of dignity.\u2019 \u201d\nMrs Jacobs says she owes great thanks to the staff at Landican cemetery who have responded to her every request to access the public records and find more babies, which she continues to do.\nHer story is just one of many remarkable stories of lasting grief and loss, and of long awaited closure. \nShe believes the word she awaits could have the power to heal.\nIf you or someone you know has been affected by issues with pregnancy, these organisations may be able to help.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram?

    "A stretch of the River Nidd at Knaresborough is among 27 new locations to be designated bathing water status.\nThe move comes after a campaign by the Nidd Action Group to improve water quality in the area and will see summer pollution testing carried out.\nWild swimmers and other river users have welcomed the decision, saying it would lead to a better understanding of how clean the water is.\nThe new additions mean there are now 451 designated sites across England.\nBathing water status does not guarantee the water is clean, but will result in regular testing from 15 May to the end of September, with the result published on the Environment Agency's Swimfo website.\nDavid Clayden, a fly fisherman and member of the Nidd Action Group, said: \"It feels good, but it's just the beginning.\n\"This is a designation, not an action, so we're going to start understanding better quite how bad it is.\"\nKnown as the Knaresborough Lido, the stretch of river is popular with wild swimmers.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio York about how the bathing site status would benefit her, Cathy said: \"It means that I can stop guessing about whether it's clean or not.\n\"We went by smell and appearance before, but now we will know.\"\nFellow swimmer Emma said she had been visiting the site for more than three years but had never put her head or face under the water.\n\"It's an absolutely beautiful spot and it's a great way to start the day, but there's always that risk you could get poorly,\" she said.\n\"I'd like it to be a safer place for all of us.\"\nIt is hoped that regular testing could help put pressure on relevant organisations to improve the water quality where necessary. \nClaire Barrow, Area Environment Manager for North Yorkshire at the Environment Agency, said: \"Our staff will be out between May and September carrying out significant sampling. \n\"All of the samples are then taken to our labs and analysed, and then the information becomes available on our Swimfo website for bathers to stay updated.\"\nShe said 96% of the sites met minimum water requirements, after the results had been classified. \nIn the cases where they did not, she said the Environment Agency carried out further investigation to find the cause of problem and, in some cases, impose penalties.\nShe pointed to a recent \u00a31m payment by Yorkshire Water after it illegally pumped sewage into a stream in Harrogate, \u00a3500,000 of which she said would go to projects to improve water quality in the area.\nMP for Harrogate and Knaresborough Andrew Jones said it had been a \"long and wide process\" for the lido to be a designated bathing site. \nHe added that testing would be \"at the heart of what happens now\" and he was confident that the Environment Agency would continue to back their campaign.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "Jessie Stockdale died in October 2023 - her family attending a funeral and receiving a box of ashes back.\nIn March, they were horrified to learn her body had been found with 34 others at Legacy Independent Funeral Directors, in Hull, which is now the focus of a major police investigation over concern for care of the dead.\nOn Monday, the 89-year-old was finally laid to rest, with her family asking BBC News to cover the service at Hull Minster as they continue their fight for regulation of the funeral industry.\nSeveral months on from her death, Mrs Stockdale's family had hoped by now to be healing, comforted by happy memories.\nInstead, they found themselves repeating her funeral, with the scab of grief lifted the moment police told them they had found the great-grandmother's body in Legacy's funeral parlour in Hessle Road - an area she called home.\nStanding next to her coffin, adorned with a red wreath and a framed photograph of Mrs Stockdale, the Reverend Canon Dr Dominic Black told the 50-strong congregation: \"This is one of the most bizarre funerals I have ever had to do.\n\"It's the only time, in all my years, where people have already had a funeral and yet here we are.\"\nHe added: \"But this time we are properly laying Jessie to rest.\"  \nMourners filed into the building to joyous images showing Mrs Stockdale doing the things she loved most: laughing with family, knitting, and tending to her beloved animals and garden.\nDr Black said the day was about remembering this \"dear woman\".\nFollowing the hymn All Things Bright and Beautiful, Dr Black gave a summary of Mrs Stockdale's long life.\nHailing from a large family, Mrs Stockdale grew up in Hessle Road - the home of Hull's once mighty fishing industry. She was an evacuee during World War Two. \nMrs Stockdale met her future husband, Maurice, on a \"blind date\", said Dr Black, with the couple going on to have seven children, all born at home. \nTo make ends meet, Mrs Stockdale worked \"until her fingers were blue\" in Hull's numerous fish houses. She also worked as a cleaner at Smith and Nephew and, at weekends, at the Debenhams department store.\nBut the years of toil were not at the expense of fun, with the family telling how Mrs Stockdale's favourite holiday destination was Disneyland Paris, where she took her family several times.\n\"She was funny and she knew it,\" said Dr Black, to chuckles from her family.\nThe vicar told how Tristan Essex, 24, Mrs Stockdale's grandson, had lovingly cared for her in her final seven years.  \nSpeaking to the BBC after going to say his \"last goodbyes\" to his grandmother on Friday, Mr Essex told of the trauma inflicted on his family.\n\"Nobody ever expects to have to arrange a second funeral,\" he said.\n\"What has happened at Legacy is nothing short of traumatic. We have all been left having sleepless nights, nightmares... I think that is going to be a hard thing to overcome.\n\"All Nana's memories have been tainted.\"\nBut Mr Essex - one of a number of people calling for regulation of the funeral industry - said the family hoped the funeral would give them some comfort.  \nClosing the service before a private cremation, Dr Black cited a passage from Song of Songs, reminding Mrs Stockdale's family that \"love is stronger than death\".\nHe added: \"She will always be part of your family. That love carries on for generations.\"\nA 46-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman arrested on suspicion of prevention of a lawful and decent burial, fraud by false representation and fraud by abuse of position remain on bail as police inquiries continue. \nVisit BBC Sounds for audio updates on this story\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

    "A mosque has held a domestic abuse and sexual violence awareness event in a bid to fight stigma around the crimes.\nMore than 200 people attended Peterborough\u2019s Domestic Abuse and Sexual Violence conference at the city's Husaini Islamic Centre on Monday.\nRizwan Rahemtulla, vice-president of the mosque and safeguarding lead, called it a \u201csignificant\u201d attempt to address these issues.\n\u201cThere is stigma within some communities who fear shame or being judged when talking about domestic and sexual violence,\" Mr Rahemtulla said.\nThe event was organised on behalf of the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Domestic Abuse and Sexual Violence (DASV) Partnership.\nThe organisation said, according to official police figures, there were 32,000 victims of domestic abuse in Cambridgeshire in 2022-23, including 7,000 in Peterborough.\nThe crime survey said that 66% of victims were women, adding that referrals to the Independent Domestic Violence Advisor (IDVA) services increased by over 25% in 2022-23.\nAn IDVA case worker, who works with victims of Asian and African heritage, said: \u201cLanguage barriers not just stop the person from taking the first step, but they also create the gap for the perpetrator to control the situation.\n\u201cApart from this, there are cultural barriers and concerns of isolation, community discrimination and shame if victims speak out or seek help. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of mistrust with the police which is a huge barrier which needs addressing.\u201d\nVickie Crompton, from the DASV partnership, said: \u201cTrust is a huge issue - but people can report abuse to agencies or other services and not just the police and it\u2019s key we get this information out to the people struggling.\"\nDet Supt Sherrie Nash, from Cambridgeshire Police, said: \u201cBuilding trust with all communities is very important for us. We feel hugely privileged to have links with people like at this mosque. \n\"This is a start of breaking down those barriers and showing that we are cohesive and inclusive of all communities.\"\nMr Rahemtulla said he was \"proud of the event\" and added: \"I had mixed feedback from the community on hosting this - many thought it was a positive step forward. It did raise some eyebrows though. \n\"But it was a long time coming and I had a lot of support from the mosque committee.\"\nFollow Peterborough news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

    "A Labour councillor in Huddersfield has resigned from the party after questioning its \"moral direction\" under the leadership of Sir Keir Starmer.\nMusarrat Khan, who represents Dalton, is the fifth Labour member on Kirklees Council to quit the party in 2024. \nShe said she was \"troubled\" by a lack of an apology for Sir Keir's stance on Gaza and welcoming former Tory Natalie Elphicke to the party was \"alarming\". \nHowever, Labour said Ms Khan was suspended from the party on Friday. \nA statement from the party said: \"Mus Khan has been administratively suspended from membership of the Labour Party, pending investigation. \n\"We cannot comment on individual cases on the record because our disciplinary proceedings are independent and confidential.\"\nMs Khan was on a shortlist of four people to replace outgoing Huddersfield MP Barry Sheerman, who has represented the town since 1979.\nConfirming her resignation on X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday, the councillor said she was leaving with a \"with a heavy heart\" and would now serve as an independent. \nShe shared her resignation letter to Sir Keir, which said: \"I am troubled by your lack of apology for your stance on the situation in Gaza, which contradicts the moral and ethical standards expected of a potential Prime Minister. \n\"Additionally, your silence on pressing issues such as the NHS and public services is concerning.\" \nShe added that the decision to welcome Ms Elphicke was alarming \"given her history and views\". \n\"This raises questions about the party's moral direction,\" she wrote. \nLabour lost overall control of Kirklees Council at the recent local elections, with no party able to command a majority. \nWith Ms Khan quitting the party, Labour has 30 seats out of 69 but continues to run the council as a minority administration.\nThis latest defection piles more pressure on the Labour group in Kirklees. \nThe authority still faces tough financial decisions as it tries to balance the books like other councils across the country. \nWith no local elections next year in the borough, it should be a moment where the ruling group has space to make tough decisions without an imminent ballot. \nHowever, as Labour has no overall majority, it will be even more challenging to vote through the measures required. \nCouncillors will have to find a way to overcome their differences to work cross party - and that will require strong leadership. \nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "Ambulance staff in south-east England are receiving new conflict resolution training as figures reveal a rise in the number of recorded attacks.\nOverall, South East Coast Ambulance Service (Secamb) recorded 1,420 incidents of abuse in 2023 - 14% higher than the year before.  \nOne Secamb worker, who has been assaulted at work, said \"abuse just shouldn't be seen as part of the job\".\nThe government said violence towards staff was absolutely unacceptable. \nThe figures recorded by Secamb include both physical and verbal abuse and account for all staff, including those in the control room. \nMatt, 25, an associate ambulance practitioner, was assaulted by a drunk patient in Sussex in May 2023. \nWhen he moved the patient to the ambulance, Matt said he became \"very insulting and aggressive\".\n\"He tried to punch me and then he kicked me,\" he said. \nFigures obtained by BBC South East found that there were 249 physical assaults against frontline Secamb staff in 2023, compared to 186 in 2018.\nMatt added: \"What if that patient had a weapon, or what if he managed to cause more significant injuries? \n\"We are just human beings underneath a green uniform.\" \nThe 49-year-old man who attacked Matt was jailed for eight months for assaulting an emergency worker.\nThe maximum jail sentence for assaulting an emergency worker recently doubled to two years. \nLast year, Secamb announced that bodycams would be available to all ambulance staff. \nMatt said: \"We shouldn't have to wear a camera. Abuse just shouldn't be seen as part of the job.\"\nDave Monk, Secamb's security manager, said although \"the overwhelming majority\" of the public treat staff with dignity and respect, the service was seeing an increase in both verbal and physical assaults.\n\"We do acknowledge that sometimes people are having a medical episode and they might actually not know what they are doing, but we are also seeing deliberate acts.\"\nSexual assaults on staff were also taking place, Mr Monk added. \nHe said expansion of body worn technology is a big step forward in protecting staff and made workers feel more confident. \nConflict resolution training is also being implemented to help staff de-escalate situations.\nVicki, an emergency medical advisor who triages emergency calls, said there had been a rise in demand on the service in recent years and patients who were frustrated with the system and in distress could become abusive.\n\"We have had people make threats to kill,\" she said. \nShe said the abuse affected workers' mental health and could be very upsetting for people. \n\"We are not robots,\" she added. \nJess, who is also an emergency medical advisor, said she had suffered name-calling, abuse and threats.\nShe said: \"We haven't got the resources all the time to be there 'right now'. I think there is a little bit of the public not understanding that.\"\nDuring the 2022/23 financial year, an average of 35 ambulance employees in England were subjected to violence, aggression, verbal abuse or sexual assaults every day, the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives said. \nAdam Hopper, National Ambulance Violence Prevention and Reduction Operational lead said: \"These incidents can have a significant and lasting impact on our people, sometimes even leading them to leave the ambulance service.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We are working closely with NHS England as they take action to prevent and reduce violence against staff, including through body-worn camera trials and a national violence prevention hub to ensure NHS staff can work in a safe environment.\"\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "Students hoping to start university in September are being urged to apply for their loans by Friday, to guarantee they have the money by the start of term. \nIt is possible to apply later, but the Student Loans Company says that could mean delays. \nThe details depend on where in the UK you live, but student loans are typically made up of:\nMost people are entitled to the tuition fee element, which is equal to the annual cost of your course up to \u00a39,250 per year.\nThe maintenance loan is intended to cover accommodation, food, books and equipment.\nMaintenance loans are means-tested, so the amount you get depends on your family's household income. You might get extra money if you are disabled or have children.\nIf you are under 25 and have no contact with your parents, you might be able to apply as an \"estranged student\". This means your parents' financial situation is not taken into consideration.\nResearch by the Higher Education Policy Institute suggests maintenance loans in England actually cover only about half the cost of living, and less for students in London.\nThe Student Loans Company says graduates in England leave university with average debts of \u00a344,940.\nThe amount of maintenance help available varies across the UK. \nThis year, students in England will be able to borrow up to \u00a310,227 a year for a maintenance loan if living in the UK, outside London and away from their parents. This increases to \u00a313,348 in London.\nIn Scotland, the maximum annual maintenance loan is \u00a39,400 for under-25s. For students living away from home in the UK outside of London, it is \u00a312,150 in Wales and \u00a36,776 in Northern Ireland. \nYou can apply for student finance if you want to start university this year.\nYou do not need a confirmed place at university to apply and, if your plans change, you can cancel or change your application before the start of your course.\nThe Student Loans Company urges prospective students to apply by 17 May to \"guarantee their student finance will be in place for the start of the academic year\".\nHowever, you can still apply after the first day of the academic year for your course.\nThe application process is different depending on where you live:\nThe tuition fees part is paid directly to your university or education provider.\nThe maintenance loan is paid directly to your bank account in instalments.\nThese are at the start of each term in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and monthly in Scotland.\nYou are charged interest on the loan from the day you take it out, but the amount varies across the UK. \nIt is important to understand that the terms and conditions can change after you have borrowed the money - any interest-rate rises will apply to all student loans not just new applications. \nFor students starting courses this year in England, the interest rate will normally be set at the retail price index (RPI) measure of inflation. It is currently capped at 7.8%.\nFor courses in:\nThe amount graduates pay back will depend on how much they earn.\nYou do not have to start repaying your loan until you earn a certain amount of money after graduation. \nThe threshold for students starting university in England this year will be \u00a325,000.\nIn Wales it will be \u00a327,295, in Scotland \u00a331,395 and in Northern Ireland \u00a324,990.\nYou do not repay anything if you earn less than the threshold. \nThe earliest you will start repaying is the April after you leave your course. \nPayments are made automatically through the tax system. \nYou generally repay 9% of the amount you earn over the threshold. \nIn England, anyone starting university this year will pay back their loan for 40 years before it is written off, regardless of how much is owed - a decade longer than last year.\nIn Wales and Scotland it is 30 years, and in Northern Ireland it is 25 years.\nYou still have to repay your student loan if you leave your course early.\nSome people may opt to make extra repayments to clear some or all of their loan early - there is no penalty for doing so.",
    "Exam season is under way for A-level students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. \nHere is your full guide to this year's exams.\nExams for A-level students run from 13 May until the end of June. \nYour school will give you an exam timetable and the exact dates will depend on which exam board you are using (such as AQA, OCR, Pearson, CCEA, or WJEC).\nIf you are sick on the day of your exam, you should contact your school or college as soon as possible.\nYou will be asked to fill out a form and your school or college will use this to request \"special consideration\" from your exam board. \nYou could still be awarded a grade as long as you have completed at least one other exam or assessment for that qualification.\nAS and A-level results will be released on Thursday, 15 August.\nYou can normally pick up your results in person anytime from 08:00 or you may receive an email, but check with your school or college, as arrangements can vary. \nEach exam is graded on a scale from A* to E.\nGrade boundaries show the minimum number of marks you need for each grade. \nThey are decided by examiners and published on results day.\nQualification Wales, which oversees Welsh exams, has said there is still a risk that performance in some subjects has not fully recovered since the pandemic. \nSo, it will use statistics to help set the grade boundaries, to prevent marks dropping below 2019 levels. \nIn England and Northern Ireland, the way boundaries are decided has returned to normal. \nIf you are unhappy with your results, you should talk to your school or college.\nIt will contact the exam board on your behalf and ask for your marks to be reviewed. \nIf you still think you have been unfairly graded after a review, you can ask your school or college to appeal.\nThe exam board will consider whether a correction is needed. \nIf you are still not satisfied, you can request a review from the exams regulator, Ofqual.\nThe charity YoungMinds points out that exam results are not the only measure of success - and if things do not turn out how you had hoped, there are lots of ways to get where you want to.\nIf you only just miss out on the grades you need to get on to a university or college course, the admissions office might accept you anyway, or offer you a place on a different course.\nIt may also be possible to resit some or all of your exams. Talk to your school or college if you want to explore this route. Resits will take place in May or June 2025.\nAnother option if you do not get the grades you need is to apply to Ucas's clearing process.\nThis matches students with university and college courses that still have spaces, across the UK.\nStudents can use it if they:\nClearing opens on 5 July and closes on 21 October.\nUniversities make an offer to join a course based on qualifications and grades or the Ucas tariff points system.\nEach A-level grade is worth a certain number of Ucas points. For example, an A* is worth 56 points and a D is worth 24 points.\nMany students decide not to go to university and start an apprenticeship or go straight into work. \nOthers take a gap year so they have more time to decide what to do next. \nScotland has a different qualification system. Students take Highers, which are similar to A-levels. \nExams have already started and will finish at the end of May. \nResults day in Scotland is Tuesday, 6 August.",
    "Many people receiving universal credit (UC) will now have to work longer hours, as part of government plans to encourage people into employment.\nHowever, the Turn2Us charity warned of a \"drastic impact\" on people with long-term health conditions, caring responsibilities or irregular incomes.\nUniversal credit is a single benefit payment for working-age people. \nIt was introduced to replace a range of different benefits for unemployed and low-paid people. \nThere were 6.4 million people on UC in January in England, Scotland and Wales, according to official government statistics. Nearly 40% of claimants have jobs.\nThe government is expected to spend \u00a390bn on UC in 2024-25.\nThat compares with \u00a3153bn on state pensions and other benefits for pensioners, \u00a340bn on disability benefits and \u00a314bn on child benefit.\nFor UC claimants required to work, the minimum number of hours was increased from 15 to 18, on Monday 13 May.\nThe rule change means 180,000 people will have to work more or risk losing their benefits, the Department for Work and Pensions says.\nThe 18-hour minimum applies to people earning the National Living Wage (\u00a311.44 for those aged 21 or over).\nSomeone earning more per hour can work fewer hours, as long as their total earnings meet a level called the Administrative Earnings Threshold (AET).\nThe AET now stands at \u00a3892, which is what you would earn in a month if you worked for 18 hours a week at the minimum wage.\nIf a couple is earning less than \u00a31,437 between them, they will be expected to try to increase their earnings.\nClaimants already risk having their benefits reduced if they don't take steps to earn more and meet regularly with a work coach.\nCertain groups will remain exempt from sanctions - including people who can't work because of long-term sickness, or a disability.\nTurn2Us has claimed government plans to speed up the roll-out of UC - and bring down spending on welfare - could affect vulnerable people disproportionately. \nThe government says its plans are necessary to get more people back in work and boost the economy, as levels of long-term sickness have increased.\nIt claims that changes it is phasing in for the welfare system as a whole could save \u00a34bn a year. \nLabour, however, says the Conservatives' failure to tackle problems facing the NHS, such as long waiting lists, should be prioritised instead.\nThe amount you get depends on whether you are single, or claiming as a couple, and your age. There is one standard allowance per household:\nYou may be entitled to extra money if, for example, you have children. \nExtra money may also be available for rent payments, which works in different ways across the UK. \nYou may also be able to claim a reduction in council tax while on UC, or assistance to pay your mortgage, although you would need to meet strict criteria. \nUnder the UC taper, payments are reduced as claimants earn more. The current taper \"rate\" is 55%. \nThis means that for every additional \u00a31 earned over the work allowance, UC payments are reduced by 55p.\nIt is complicated to work out exactly how much UC you might receive. \nSome people have found they are entitled to less money under UC than they would have been under the previous benefit arrangements. \nThose with \u00a316,000 or more in savings are not eligible.\nIt usually takes about five weeks from the date of claiming to receiving a first payment, although an advance loan may be possible.\nAn application for UC may put a stop to any tax credits you receive, even if it proves to be unsuccessful.\nThe main benefit for anyone losing their job after a period in work is new-style jobseeker's allowance (JSA).\nThis is worth \u00a371.70 a week if you are under 25, or \u00a390.50 a week if you are 25 or over.\nYou can get this for up to six months and it will be paid into your bank, building society, or credit union account every two weeks. \nUnlike UC, your partner's or spouse's income will not affect your claim, although you may get less if you have part-time earnings or a pension.\nYou may be able to claim new-style JSA as well as universal credit.\nPlaces offering support include:",
    "ITV has agreed to add a British Sign Language version of an election debate programme to its on-demand platform, after pressure from a deaf campaigner.\nThe debate between Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, aired on Tuesday evening, included subtitles but not a live translation.\nKatherine Rowley told BBC News she \"felt very disappointed\" that she could not follow the debate live. \nIn response to a letter from Ms Rowley's lawyer, ITV said signing on live broadcasts \"involves a considerable degree of planning and additional resource\".\nThe Communications Act 2003 says at least 5% of broadcasters' content must be translated into sign language.\nThe Act says most content should include subtitles. \nBut many who use BSL as their first language struggle with English subtitles because, studies suggest, deaf people's reading ability is lower than average.\nResearch suggests this is because reading is based on spoken language, which many deaf children struggle to acquire.\nMiss Rowley's lawyer, Chris Fry, told BBC News that equality laws should be updated to close the 5% target \"loophole\" to make sure key content in the public interest is available in accessible formats.   \n\"My kids tune into Horrible Histories sometimes, and they\u2019ve got BSL on there,\" he says.\n\"If you\u2019re going to provide it on kids\u2019 broadcasts, great - but what makes broadcasts on the elections less important than that?\u201d\nHe said there are additional accessibility issues around elections, such as visually impaired people receiving leaflets through the post.\nOn 30 May, Mr Fry sent a pre-action legal letter to ITV, to pressure it into including live signing in its debate on 4 June.\nITV's response, sent on 31 May, said it recognised Miss Rowley would be \"disappointed\" sign language could not be provided for the live broadcast, but that she had \"no basis to bring a claim\" of discrimination.\nA spokesperson said a BSL version of Tuesday's programme - and of next week's multi-party debate - would be available on its on-demand platform within 24 hours of broadcast. \nAnd all ITV election content would carry subtitles.\nITV also said in its letter that accessibility and inclusion were \"extremely important\" and \"we strive continuously to improve the level of accessibility across our channels and platforms\".\nMiss Rowley said on Wednesday: \"I felt very disappointed that I couldn\u2019t follow last night's debate. It's an important time of our life, voting.\"\n\"Equality shouldn\u2019t have to be an afterthought,\" she added.\nIn 2021, Miss Rowley - a member of the Labour Party - won a claim against the government after two of its televised Covid briefings did not include sign language. \nAs part of the firm, Inspire Legal, Mr Fry is calling on political parties to provide BSL translations of their broadcasts and manifestos during the election campaign.\nThe BBC said on Wednesday that it would include live British Sign Language and subtitles on its leader debates, as part of its aim \"to make this election the most accessible to date\".\nIts first election debate, with representatives from the seven biggest parties, is on Friday 7 June. ITV's next one is on Thursday 13 June.",
    "Emergency legislation to clear victims of the Horizon Post Office scandal is being introduced by the Scottish government.\nSub-postmasters wrongly convicted because of faulty Horizon IT systems will be automatically exonerated if the bill is passed.\nThe Scottish government said the process of passing the new laws would be speeded up so victims could get redress as quickly as possible. \nThe scandal involved people running post offices being accused of crimes such as theft, false accounting or embezzlement on the basis of a faulty IT system called Horizon, which operated from 1996 until 2018.\nFigures from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service show that about  60 convictions in Scotland involved involved Horizon evidence. \nThe UK government has already introduced legislation that does not include Scotland.\nThe Scottish government said \"relevant convictions\" would be automatically quashed on the day the legislation comes into force and those affected would have access to access the UK government financial redress scheme.\nThe Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC), which investigates possible miscarriages of justice, wrote to potential victims in 2020.\nSo far in Scotland, 19 people have come forward asking for their convictions to be quashed.  \nSix of those people have been cleared and two cases are currently going through the courts.\nIn January, the Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain KC, Scotland\u2019s top law officer, told MSPs that not every case involving Horizon evidence would be a miscarriage of justice and each case must be considered carefully and with regard to the law.\nShe said it was important to recognise the important and established constitutional role of the Appeal Court in Scotland and that due process must be followed.\nThis proposed legislation means that eligible people who have not applied to the SCCRC would have their convictions quashed and have access to compensation without going through the courts.\nJustice Secretary Angela Constance said the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences (Scotland) Bill mirrored UK legislation to \"ensure parity for affected sub-postmasters in Scotland with those elsewhere in the UK\" and give access to the UK compensation scheme.\n\u201cInnocent sub-postmasters had their lives ruined by being wrongly convicted of offences of dishonesty on the evidence of the faulty Post Office Horizon system,\" she said. \n\u201cThe scale of the scandal and the length of time that the victims have waited for justice means we are taking an unprecedented step of introducing legislation to right this terrible wrong and asking parliament for it to be processed as an emergency bill. \n\"The Scottish government will not do anything to jeopardise equality and parity for victims, so the final stage of the bill cannot be considered in the Scottish Parliament until after the UK legislation has been passed.\"\nShe added that MSPs could then take account of amendments made to the UK legislation. \nScottish Conservative justice spokesman Russell Findlay said the legislation was welcome and long overdue.\nHe added: \u201cSNP ministers knew from the outset that Scotland\u2019s distinct legal system and prosecution mechanism required a separate law to deliver justice to Scottish sub-postmasters.\n\u201cBut instead of getting on and delivering it, the SNP typically wasted time on a constitutional spat with the UK government, as well as creating confusion on whether they backed blanket exonerations.\n\u201cGiven that this legislation looks to be largely a copy-and-paste job, Scottish victims of this appalling scandal have needlessly been kept in the dark for longer than those in the rest of the UK.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said the Lord Advocate had said in her statement to the Scottish Parliament in January that the Crown was continuing to use the existing mechanisms to address miscarriages of justice in Scotland.\nThe spokesperson added: \u201cShe rejected the proposition that she had the authority to facilitate an approach to blanket exonerations through the court. She did not comment on convictions being set aside by legislation.\n\u201cThe Lord Advocate will make another statement to update the Scottish Parliament on progress in dealing with appeals against conviction involving Horizon evidence.\"",

It\u2019s sad that other countries are turning away from Russia, and Russian women want to come to China\u201d, before starting to promote products like Russian candies.\nThis personally enraged Olga, whose family is still in Ukraine.\nBut on a wider level, her case has drawn attention to the dangers of a technology that is developing so quickly that regulating it and protecting people has become a real challenge.\nOlga\u2019s Mandarin-speaking AI lookalikes began emerging in 2023 - soon after she started a YouTube channel which is not very regularly updated.\nAbout a month later, she started getting messages from people who claimed they saw her speak in Mandarin on Chinese social media platforms.\nIntrigued, she started looking for herself, and found AI likenesses of her on Xiaohongshu - a platform like Instagram - and Bilibili, which is a video site similar to YouTube.\n\u201cThere were a lot of them [accounts]. Some had things like Russian flags in the bio,\u201d said Olga who has found about 35 accounts using her likeness so far.\nAfter her fianc\u00e9 tweeted about these accounts, HeyGen, a firm that she claims developed the tool used to create the AI likenesses, responded.\nThey revealed more than 4,900 videos have been generated using her face. They said they had blocked her image from being used anymore.\nA company spokesperson told the BBC that their system was hacked to create what they called \u201cunauthorised content\u201d and added that they immediately updated their security and verification protocols to prevent further abuse of their platform.\nBut Angela Zhang, of the University of Hong Kong, says what happened to Olga is \u201cvery common in China\u201d.\nThe country is \u201chome to a vast underground economy specialising in counterfeiting, misappropriating personal data, and producing deepfakes\u201d, she said.\nThis is despite China being one of the first countries to attempt to regulate AI and what it can be used for. It has even modified its civil code to protect likeness rights from digital fabrication.\nStatistics disclosed by the public security department in 2023 show authorities arrested 515 individuals for \u201cAI face swap\u201d activities. Chinese courts have also handled cases in this area.\nBut then how did so many videos of Olga make it online?\nOne reason could be because they promoted the idea of friendship between China and Russia.\nBeijing and Moscow have grown significantly closer in recent years. Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Putin have said the friendship between the two countries has \u201cno limits\u201d. The two are due to meet in China this week.\nChinese state media have been repeating Russian narratives justifying its invasion of Ukraine and social media has been censoring discussion of the war.\n\u201cIt is unclear whether these accounts were coordinating under a collective purpose, but promoting a message that is in line with the government\u2019s propaganda definitely benefits them,\u201d said Emmie Hine, a law and technology researcher from the University of Bologna and KU Leuven.\n\u201cEven if these accounts aren\u2019t explicitly linked to the CCP [Chinese Communist Party], promoting an aligned message may make it less likely that their posts will get taken down.\u201d\nBut this means that ordinary people like Olga remain vulnerable and are at risk of falling foul of Chinese law, experts warn.\nKayla Blomquist, a technology and geopolitics researcher at Oxford University, warns that \u201cthere is a risk of individuals being framed with artificially generated, politically sensitive content\u201d who could be subject to \u201crapid punishments enacted without due process\u201d.\nShe adds that Beijing\u2019s focus in relation to AI and online privacy policy has been to build out consumer rights against predatory private actors, but stresses that \u201ccitizen rights in relation to the government remain extremely weak\u201d.\nMs Hine explains that the \u201cfundamental goal of China\u2019s AI regulations is to balance maintaining s",
    "The UK government must act to prevent Northern Ireland becoming a \"magnet\" for asylum seekers, says the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) interim leader.\nThese comments follow a High Court ruling over the Illegal Migration Act.\nOn Monday, a judge ruled that large parts of the act should not apply in Northern Ireland because they breach human rights laws.\nGavin Robinson said a \"unified\" UK-wide immigration policy should be enforced.\n\"I've said that if the government do not assert the sovereignty of parliament and ensure that we have a UK-wide immigration system, then there is a difficulty,\" he told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"That's where we become a magnet because we know that the public policy imperative\u2026 is to act as a deterrent\n\"If it is not deterring individuals from coming to one part of the United Kingdom, then it could have the impact of a becoming or providing a magnet.\"\nThe Illegal Migration Act, passed by parliament in July 2023, aims to stop small boats crossing the English Channel.\nThe government should now \"step forward\", Mr Robinson added, but accepted the government would maintain their position in court.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said the ruling changes nothing about the government's plan to send illegal migrants to Rwanda and will take steps to defend that position, including appeal.\nThe DUP interim leader said: \"Ultimately, we will get a final answer from the Supreme Court.\"\nThe judge at Belfast High Court also ruled that the law breaches the Windsor Framework.\nMr Robinson said his party had previously tried to raise their concerns about the incompatibility of the act in Northern Ireland to the government, but they were dismissed.\nMr Robinson also said such a policy should allow people to move freely within the UK and between the British Isles under the Common Travel Area.\n\"We need to be certain and sure that the policy applies equally across the United Kingdom. That's the problem the government have and it is entirely of their own making,\" he added.\nThe 2023 Illegal Migration Act is a key part of the UK government's plan to stop English Channel crossings by people seeking asylum without prior permission to arrive.\nIt created laws that mean the Home Secretary must detain and remove anyone who arrives by that route and the plan had been to send them to Rwanda. That was until the Supreme Court ruled last year that the country was unsafe.\nParliament has since passed a law designating Rwanda as a safe country.\nThis policy is different in Northern Ireland due to the Good Friday Agreement and the Windsor Framework.\nThe Windsor Framework deals mostly with trade issues but also includes a human rights element covered in Article 2.\nIt commits the UK not to water down the human rights provisions that flow from the Good Friday Agreement, the 1998 deal which brought an end to 30 years of conflict in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles.\nMr Robinson said the government should amend the law to disapply Article 2 in respect of immigration policy.\nHe said this would deal with the challenges of migration without diminishing the rights of \"subjects and citizens in Northern Ireland.\"\nIn the House of Commons on Tuesday Alliance MP Stephen Farry asked the government for assurances that Article 2 and the Good Friday Agreement would not be unpicked.\nSDLP MP Claire Hanna said she was glad that Northern Ireland has additional protection.\n\"Isn't it time that the government developed an actual strategy through safe routes, through actually targeting people-smuggling gangs, through investing in efficient processing,\" she added.\nEarlier, former Attorney General Dominic Grieve told Good Morning Ulster: \"It's always been known that the Illegal Migration Bill seeks to displace the workings of the Human Rights Act in Great Britain for the purposes of the deportation of illegal immigrants to Rwanda.\n\"In Northern Ireland the situation is different because as a result of the Good Friday Agreement, essentially the Human Rights Act is entrenched.\"\nA challenge to the Illegal Migration Act was brought by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and a 16-year-old asylum seeker from Iran who is residing in Northern Ireland over \"significant concerns\" about the impact of the act.\nThe judge found, external that several elements of the act do cause a \"significant\" diminution of the rights enjoyed by asylum seekers residing in Northern Ireland under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.\nMr Grieve said Monday's ruling could act as an impediment to carrying out the Rwanda scheme as asylum seekers resident in Northern Ireland cannot be sent to the African country.",

    "Weapons from a new US aid package for Ukraine have begun arriving on the front line.\nAfter a year of political stalemate in the US, President Joe Biden approved military support worth almost $61bn (\u00a349bn) in April. \nAhead of a visit to Kyiv by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, a senior official said Ukraine had started to receive weapons to meet its \"most pressing needs, particularly with an eye towards Russia's activities right now\".\nThe official said air defence interceptors, artillery and ATACMS long-range precision-guided missiles were arriving at the front line.\nOf the $61bn worth of aid being provided, at least $8bn (\u00a36.5bn) will be used to re-supply Ukraine with missiles and ammunition. \nIn May, the US Department of Defense said this would include extra munitions for Patriot air defence systems, more Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (Himars).\nThe supply of US weapons to Ukraine dried up in early 2024 because a bill to grant more aid was delayed in Congress. \nAfter the Senate finally passed the legislation in April, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the commitment \"reinforces America's role as a beacon of democracy and leader of the free world\".\nSeparately, the UK is sending an extra \u00a3500m on top of the \u00a32.5bn in military aid it had already pledged to give Ukraine in 2024. \nIn February 2024, the EU agreed a further \u20ac50bn (\u00a342bn; $54bn) aid package for Ukraine, after Hungary stopped blocking the deal.\nThe EU failed to meet its target of sending a million shells to Ukraine by the beginning of March. \nHowever, the Czech Republic agreed a $1.5bn deal for a group of 18 Nato and EU countries to buy 800,000 rounds - both 155mm and 122mm calibre - from outside the EU.\nBetween February 2022 and February 2024, the US delivered or committed weapons and equipment worth $46.2bn to Ukraine, according to the Kiel Institute, a German research organisation. \nGermany gave Ukraine weapons and equipment worth $10.7bn, the UK $5.7bn, Denmark $5.2bn, and the Netherlands $4.1bn. \nBefore the latest aid package was approved, the US had warned that Ukraine's military was running short on munitions and morale was low. \nPresident Zelensky identified a shortage of air defence missiles, saying Ukraine needs \"seven more Patriots or similar air defence systems\" to protect its cities.\nThese would allow Ukraine to \"counter Russia's glide bombs, which [Moscow] is using to pound defensive positions and civilian targets like power stations,\" says Dr Marina Miron, of King's College London. \nUkrainian armed forces have also been limited to firing 2,000 shells a day, according to the UK-based think tank, the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi).\nIn contrast, Russian forces have been firing up to 10,000 shells a day, Rusi said. It said Russia gets almost three million shells a year from its own factories and from North Korea.\nUkraine has lost large areas of territory in the east of the country to Russian forces since October 2023, largely because of a lack of artillery.\nIt blamed shortages for the loss of the town of Avdiivka in February. \nThe resumption of US ammunition supplies means Ukraine could start using more artillery shells from its stocks, says Justin Crump, of risk intelligence company Sibylline.\n\"Ukrainian forces have been rationing shell use because they haven't been able to tell when new supplies are coming,\" he says. \nAnti-tank weapons\nWestern countries responded to Russia's invasion in February 2022 by giving Ukraine's armed forces defensive weapons, to counter Russia's armoured brigades.\nThe US and UK supplied thousands of Javelin and Nlaw anti-tank missiles. \nThese were considered crucial in stopping the advance of Russian forces on Kyiv.\nAir defence systems\nTo counter Russian air superiority, and its attacks on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, Western nations have sent Ukraine several types of air defence system.\nThese range from the UK's short-range anti-aircraft weapon, Starstreak, to the Patriot missile system.\nPatriots are expensive to operate - one missile costs about $3m.\nThe US and Norway have also provided the Nasams (National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System) for air defence, and Germany has offered the Iris-T. \nArtillery and missiles\nAfter Russia's retreat from Kyiv, the war became focused on the east of the country. Artillery and missiles were heavily used by both sides.  \nAustralia, Canada, the US and others sent M777 howitzers and ammunition to Ukraine.\nThe US and UK also provided missile systems including Himars, and the M270 MLRS.\nUkraine has also received long-range missiles such as Scalp from France, Storm Shadow from the UK and ATACMS from the US.\nThe US has also supplied Ukraine with the longest-range version of ATACMS, which can travel 190 miles (300km). Before April 2024, it had only provided a shorter range version.\nIn July 2023, the US said it had supplied cluster bombs to Ukraine, to help dislodge Russian troops from defensive positi",
    "The first official painted portrait of King Charles III since his coronation has been unveiled at Buckingham Palace. \nThe vast oil on canvas shows a larger-than-life King Charles in the uniform of the Welsh Guards. \nThe vivid red work, measuring about 8ft 6in by 6ft 6in, is by Jonathan Yeo, who has also painted Tony Blair, Sir David Attenborough and Malala Yousafzai.\nQueen Camilla is said to have looked at the painting and told Yeo: \"Yes, you've got him.\"\nIn the new portrait, the King is depicted, sword in hand, with a butterfly landing on his shoulder.\nUnveilings are always a little nerve-wracking, both for the sitter and the artist, but particularly when one of them is a King.\nYeo jokes: \"If this was seen as treasonous, I could literally pay for it with my head, which would be an appropriate way for a portrait painter to die - to have their head removed!\"\nIn reality, Yeo isn't going to lose his head of course - no executions for a badly received portrait of a monarch, in modern times anyway.\nFortunately, he has also already had a nod of approval from a key royal figure.\nThe Queen dropped in during the final sitting and said the artist had captured the King well. Yeo says the best judge of a portrait is someone who knows your sitter really well because they have instant recognition of whether it feels familiar.  \nThe King also got a glimpse of it, says Yeo, in its \"half-done state\u2026 He was initially mildly surprised by the strong colour but otherwise he seemed to be smiling approvingly\".\nIt is a vibrant painting.\nThe King was made Regimental Colonel in the Welsh Guards in 1975. In the picture, the red of the uniform fades into the red background, bringing the King's face into even more prominence.\nYeo says he wanted the painting to be distinctive and a break with the past. He was aiming for something personal. \n\"My interest is really in figuring out who someone is and trying to get that on a canvas.\"\nYeo decided to use some of the traditions of royal portraiture - the military outfit, the sword - but aimed to achieve something more modern, particularly with the deep colour and the butterfly.\nHe says he's referencing the tradition of official royal portraits but suggesting that's something \"from the past and what's interesting about them is something a bit different from that\". \n\"In history of art, the butterfly symbolises metamorphosis and rebirth,\" he explains, fitting for a portrait being painted of a monarch who has recently ascended to the throne.\nThe butterfly is also a reference to the King's long held interest in the environment, causes \"he has championed most of his life and certainly long before they became a mainstream conversation\". \nYeo says it was Charles' idea after they talked about the opportunity they had to tell a story with the portrait.\n\"I said, when schoolchildren are looking at this in 200 years and they're looking at the who's who of the monarchs, what clues can you give them?\n\"He said 'what about a butterfly landing on my shoulder?'\".\nYeo began the portrait when Charles was still Prince of Wales, with the first sitting at Highgrove in June 2021. \nThe King sat four times in all, for about an hour at a time, with the final sitting at Clarence House in November 2023. Did the artist notice any obvious change in the man after he became King?\nYeo says he's spotted \"a physical change\" in politicians he's painted in the past. \"They physically look and feel different when they're in high office or out of it.\"\nYeo adds the King \"had already been gaining presence and stature by the time I started it, and it went up a level again when he became King, as you'd expect\". \nThe sittings ended before the King's cancer was diagnosed. He had a lot going on, says Yeo, with an upcoming speech at the COP Summit, but \"didn't seem like someone who was physically exhausted\".\nHe was \"in good spirits\", the painter adds.\nKing Charles posed in his full Welsh Guards uniform and had to stand leaning on his sword for around 40 minutes each time.\n\"He stood impressively still, and didn't get distracted like some sitters do.\"\nYeo won't reveal much of what they talked about during sittings, although he says Charles III has \"a great sense of humour\" and is a \"very engaging person\".\nHis interest in art meant Charles wanted to discuss the process of creating the work and the brushes being used. They also talked about \"how he'd learned to paint and about some of the pictures on the walls\".\nBut Yeo says \"there's a sanctity to the portrait process\". Your sitters \"need to believe what goes on is between the two of you because that way I think they feel more comfortable about opening up\".\nRoyal portraits in the past have had an important role to play in signifying power and projecting an image. They were part of the tools used to ensure the survival of the monarch. Some of the most memorable include Henry VIII by Hans Holbein the Younger. The Tudor king employed Holbein as court artist, although only two portraits survive.\nBut ",
    "Twenty-six policer officers were injured in Mexico City on Monday in clashes with protesters who threw firecrackers. \nThe protesters were taking part in a demonstration demanding justice for 43 students who disappeared in 2014 from the town of Ayotzinapa in southern Guerrero state. \nThey were angry at the release from pre-trial detention last week of eight soldiers suspected of involvement in the students' disappearance.\nThe disappearance of the 43 and the botched investigation into it has long incensed not just their families but also human rights activists in Mexico and abroad.\n\nCity officials said that 26 officers had sustained injuries from the firecrackers, including to their arms, legs and buttocks and had been taken to hospital for treatment. \nThe protesters dispersed after the altercation.\nIt is not the first time demonstrators have gathered at the Z\u00f3calo - the central square in the capital - to draw attention to the lack of progress in bringing those behind the students' disappearance to justice.\nIn March, a group broke down one of the doors of the presidential palace with a lorry, reportedly venting their anger at not having been received by the president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador.\nSolving the case was one of President L\u00f3pez Obrador's campaign promises but almost six years on from his election win, there has been little progress made in the case.\nThe 43 men, all of whom attended an all-male teacher training college in Ayotzinapa, went missing on 26 September 2014 as they returned from a protest.\nDespite several investigations, only the remains of three of the 43 have been found.\nThe whereabouts of the remaining 40 are unknown and while some of their relatives still hope to find them alive, they are widely presumed to be dead.\nTwo years ago, Mexico's under secretary for human rights, Alejandro Encinas, said that local, state and federal officials had been involved in the students' disappearance and called it a \"state crime\".\nHe said that the government at the time of their disappearance had tried to cover up those links. \nHe also concluded that there was \"no indication the students are alive\". \nHowever, Mr Encinas's 2022 report has come under criticism from the families of the disappeared.\nThe families say that the presidential commission led by Mr Encinas failed to look into military intelligence documents which the relatives think contain information which could shed light on the case.\nThe military has denied such documents exist.\nThe families and rights activists have held regular protests to  keep up pressure on the government to solve the crime. \nThe release from pre-trial detention of eight soldiers suspected of involvement in the case on Thursday incensed those demanding justice for the 43, who fear the eight could flee if they are not behind bars.\nProsecutors say the eight were on patrol in the area where the students went missing on the night of their disappearance. \nThey have been charged with forced disappearance and organised crime and are required to report to court twice a month.",
    "For years, Western spy agencies have talked of a need to pivot to focus on China. This week, the head of the UK's GCHQ intelligence agency described it as an \"epoch-defining challenge\".\nIt follows a series of arrests across the West of people accused of spying and hacking for China. And on Monday, China's ambassador was summoned by the UK Foreign Office, after three people were accused of assisting Hong Kong's intelligence services.\nThese are a sign of a normally hidden contest for power and influence between the West and China bursting out into the open.\nThe West - the US and its allies - are determined to push back. But senior officials worry the West has not taken the challenge from China seriously enough and has fallen behind in intelligence terms, leaving the West more vulnerable to Beijing's spying, and both sides at risk of a potentially catastrophic miscalculation.\nWhat concerns Western officials is Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s determination that Beijing will shape a new international order. \"Ultimately it aspires to displace the United States as the foremost power,\" the chief of MI6, Sir Richard Moore, told me in a rare interview in his office for a new BBC series on China and the West.\nBut despite years of issuing warnings, Western intelligence services have struggled until recently to concentrate their focus on Chinese activity.\nNigel Inkster, who was number two at MI6 when he retired in 2006, says China's emergence as a major global power \"took place at a time when there were a lot of other pre-occupations\".\nAs Beijing rose on the world stage during the 2000s, the thinking of Western policymakers and security officials - and the focus of the intelligence services - was dominated by the so-called war on terror and military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nShadow war: China and the West\nThe rise of China is the defining challenge of our times - how far to co-operate, compete or confront. Gordon Corera asks if the West has been slow to wake up.\nListen now on BBC Sounds\nMore recently, a resurgent Russia and now the Israel-Gaza war have appeared more urgent challenges, officials in the US and Europe concede.\nAt the same time, there has been pressure from government and businesses alike to focus on securing access to China's huge market, rather than confronting the security risk it poses.\nPolitical leaders frequently preferred their intelligence chiefs not to call China out by name. And businesses too preferred not to admit their secrets were being targeted.\n\"The pendulum did swing very far in the direction of the economic and commercial interests,\" says Nigel Inkster.\nChinese intelligence was already engaging in industrial espionage back in the 2000s, he says, but Western companies typically stayed quiet. \"They didn't want to report it for fear that doing so would jeopardise their position in China's markets,\" he says.\nAnother major challenge has been that China spies differently from the West. That has made its activity harder both to recognise and confront.\nA former Western spy says he once improbably told a Chinese counterpart that China did the \"wrong type\" of spying. What he meant was that Western states prefer to focus on gathering the kind of intelligence that helps them understand their adversaries. But Chinese spies have different priorities.\nProtecting the position of the Communist Party is central. \"Regime stability is their number one goal,\" Roman Rozhavsky, an FBI counterintelligence official, explains.\nThat requires delivering economic growth. And so China\u2019s spies see acquiring Western technology as a top national security requirement. Western spies say their Beijing counterparts share information they have gathered with Chinese state-run companies, in a way that the West\u2019s intelligence agencies do not with their own domestic firms.\n\"My agency is busier than we've ever been in our 74 years of history,\" Mike Burgess, the plain-speaking head of the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation (Asio) explained to me.\n\"I rarely call out countries because when it comes to straight espionage, we do it to them,\" Burgess told me. \"Commercial espionage is a completely different matter, and that's why China is getting special treatment on this one.\"\nHe acknowledged that the Western allies had been slow to understand this threat. \"I think it's been going on for a long time and collectively we've missed it,\" he admits.\nWe were sitting down last October in California, where he was taking part in the first ever public appearance by the security chiefs of the so-called Five Eyes \u2013 the intelligence-sharing alliance made up of the US, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.\nThe unprecedented gathering was a very deliberate attempt to turn up the volume of warnings about China because of the fear that many companies and organisations were still not listening. The location in Silicon Valley was also carefully chosen - a spotlight on China\u2019s attempts to steal technology, sometimes through cyber",

    "\"He's like a children\u2019s TV presenter - the more people see, the more they don't like.\"\nThis comment comes not from an opponent of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak but a supporter, who acknowledges things have not gone as they would have liked.\nIn a wide-ranging speech earlier this week, the prime minister attempted to draw vivid dividing lines between his government and Labour. It was a reminder that we are hurtling towards an election sooner rather than later.\nThe Conservatives had hoped they'd be closing the gap by now. So why has project Sunak failed to fire? Is it his personality, is it the battered party he took over or is it that the public has simply had enough?\nI've spent the past fortnight speaking to 20 people who have worked up close with Rishi Sunak.\nThese are not disgruntled MPs or those who wished him ill from the start. They are ministers, staffers and officials (either current or former), who believed the Sunak project had a chance of turning things around, however slim that chance.\nA few genuinely believe Mr Sunak may yet be his party's saviour and others stress that he inherited appalling political gravity. But others are not so kind.\nSign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.\nAfter the meltdown of the Liz Truss administration, he formed a government, kept the markets happy and worked out Northern Ireland, one insider points out.\nIf you think back to the wild moments of autumn 2022, that is no mean feat. \"He followed advice to treat it like a coalition government at the start, to stabilise the ship,\" a former minister tells me.\nOne Whitehall insider said they \"slept easier\" when he moved into No 10.\n\"He is a decent man who is not in it for himself. He is all duty and hard work. I never saw him try to play the upside to gather power.\"\nMany of the sources I spoke to told me he is \"the cleverest person in the room\", or the \"smartest person in the meeting\". One of his colleagues reckons he is \"frighteningly well briefed... he's unmatched\".\nRishi Sunak is an unusual politician. One example is the story of Carol and Jo.  During the early part of the pandemic, Rishi Sunak made almost hourly calls to them. They were relatively junior civil servants working on designing and building the new system for furlough.\nThis was the chancellor taking personal and painstaking care with the details of an important new policy.\nHe'd host massive Zoom calls, and ask for tiny details from the desk officers directly responsible for particular pieces of policy, rather than rely on more senior civil servants.\nI can't emphasise enough, for a top level politician, this is not normal behaviour. They normally prefer making decisions to trying to master all the details. But his style of including officials no matter their status, meant \"the Treasury loved him from day one\", according to a senior figure.\nWhen Rishi Sunak arrived in No 10, the details man, apparently shorn of the ego of so many at Westminster, made politics a little more normal again.\nHis style had made him extremely popular as the Chancellor. There was a point when he \"had net favourability in every part of the country\", one insider recalls.\nHe was more popular than the Tory Party and the hope was that he could pull the party's ratings up to his level. But it is the opposite that has happened.\nOne of Rishi Sunak\u2019s mantras is \"Politics is like the stockmarket \u2013 believe in the fundamentals, not the noise\", a hangover from his past as a hedge fund manager. He reckons the small ups and downs of Westminster don't matter compared with the long-term trends.\nAnd after three months in office, in January 2023, it was time for Mr Sunak to define the substance. He announced his now famous five pledges: he vowed to halve inflation, grow the economy, reduce national debt, cut waiting lists and stop the small boats.\nThe thinking was to show an unflashy politician who would calmly make vows and keep them. He would under-promise and over-deliver, in his typical mashup of political and management speak.\n\"The people's priorities are the Government's priorities,\" the PM said.\nThere are those who insist this wasn't merely politics by polling metrics. According to one Cabinet minister: \"It was a bit of both - what focus groups wanted and what he believed in.\"\nBut others point to this moment as where things started to go wrong.\nSome colleagues believe it was a shopping list of pledges that was never going to excite or persuade. \"The five pledges were rushed out the door in January,\" a party veteran tells me. \"He should have gone harder and bolder.\"\nOthers reckon Mr Sunak picked the right issues, but that his central message has failed because while inflation has halved, he hasn't yet been able to tick all five things off his list. \"He chose hard things, and he sticks to his guns, even if it\u2019s harder and takes longer,\" a defender says.\nAfter Boris Johnson\u2019s bluster, and Liz Truss' hu",
    "Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden has raised allegations with the Saudi government that its forces were \"told to kill\" for a futuristic city following a BBC investigation.\nNeom's The Line, the desert city, is one of the projects promoted at a UK-hosted event in Riyadh.\nMr Dowden is leading a 450-strong delegation on a trade mission to Saudi Arabia. \nThe UK said it has vital economic and national security interests there.\nSpeakers at the event include footballer Rio Ferdinand, former minister Jo Johnson and a British Airways executive.\nHuman rights groups have urged UK delegates to pressure Saudi leaders over the BBC's exclusive investigation.\nThe \"Great Futures\" launch event taking place this week claims to \"bring to life the sheer scale of opportunities for UK business in Saudi Arabia\" and kickstarts a year-long partnership promoting trade, tourism, and education between the two countries.\nThe UK's Cabinet Office posted photos of the deputy prime minister with Saudi leaders on X. \nHe was quoted as saying that \"Britain doesn't just endorse Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, we want to be a part of it\".\nAsked about the BBC's report, the prime minister's official spokesman confirmed that Mr Dowden had \"raised the issue of the treatment of villagers in the construction of the Neom project in his bilateral meetings while he has been out on this visit.\"\nHe added that the UK had vital economic and national security interests with Saudi Arabia, but that \"no aspect of our relationship prevents us from speaking frankly to them about these sorts of issues\".\nNeom is one major part of Saudi's Vision 2030 strategy which aims to diversify the kingdom's economy away from oil.\nImages of Neom's The Line, a mirrored city in the desert, are central to the Department for Business and Trade's website advertising the event. \nLast week, an ex-intelligence officer, Colonel Rabih Alenezi, told the BBC that he was ordered to evict villagers from a tribe in the Gulf state to make way for The Line, part of the Neom eco-project.\nOne of them was subsequently shot and killed for protesting against eviction. A statement issued by Saudi state security at the time alleged that he had opened fire on security forces and they had been forced to retaliate. Human rights organisations and the UN have said he was killed simply for resisting eviction.\nAt least 47 other villagers were detained after resisting evictions, many of whom were prosecuted on terror-related charges, according to the UN and the UK-based human rights group ALQST. Of those, 40 remain in detention, five of whom are on death row, ALQST says.\nThe Saudi government and Neom management refused to comment on the findings of the BBC investigation.\nAmnesty International, a human rights organisation, said: \"The reality behind such futuristic projects is the brutal repression of citizens and residents.\"\n\"Any business that knowingly contributes to human rights harms is in clear violation of international law,\" Dana Ahmed, Amnesty International's Middle East Researcher said.\nALQST said it appears that the UK is \"increasingly willing to turn a blind eye to the catalogue of Saudi abuses on the ground.\" \n\"Imagine if companies working on Neom made their involvement conditional on the release of local residents arrested for protesting forced eviction?\" said Josh Cooper, deputy director of the organisation.  \n\"Or if university chancellors withheld Saudi partnerships until detained University of Leeds PhD student Salma al-Shehab was freed? Such steps would have a positive bearing,\" he added.\nThe BBC contacted several high-profile speakers participating in the event, but many did not respond.\nOf those that did, many described the event as an important opportunity to showcase and promote British business, culture and society.",
    "Two Native American tribes in South Dakota have barred its governor, Kristi Noem, from their land as she doubles down on derogatory commentary against tribal leaders and reservation life.\nThe latest bans add to existing exclusions from four other reservations this year. Ms Noem is now banned from nearly one-fifth of state territory.\nIt comes after the Republican cut short a disastrous national media book tour.\nMs Noem was once a frontrunner to be Donald Trump's running mate this year.\nLess than three months ago, she topped a poll of candidates to run as vice-president for the November election. However, a crop of recent controversies, including a story of how she shot a pet dog, have drawn bipartisan criticism.\nThe Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate and Yankton Sioux tribes on Friday passed separate resolutions to prohibit Ms Noem from setting foot in their territory.\nThe tribes joined the Cheyenne River Sioux, Oglala Sioux, Rosebud Sioux and Standing Rock Sioux tribes in making the state's chief executive an outlaw on their lands. It means six of South Dakota's nine Native tribes are now refusing her entry.\nTribal governments have a sovereign right to exclude non-tribal members from their lands, with tribal law enforcement prepared to act if necessary.\nA secretary for the Yankton Sioux, however, clarified to local media that the tribe has not \"officially\" banned the governor by a vote of its general council, but one by its business and claims committee, the main elected body.\nAs governor, Ms Noem, 52, has often been at odds with these authorities. While tribal and federal authorities have criminal jurisdiction over reservations, she has sought to expand state power.\nShe was banished in 2019 by the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council after signing anti-riot legislation in response to Native-led protests against the Keystone XL pipeline, and then again earlier this year over rhetoric linking illegal immigration to crime on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.\nThe governor also ignored tribal objections to a 2020 fireworks display over Mount Rushmore and clashed with tribal leaders after they set up coronavirus checkpoints to control visits to their reservations.\nMost recently, she alleged Native children \"don't have any hope\" because of absentee parents and suggested without evidence that tribal leaders were \"personally benefitting\" from drug cartel operators.\n\"Governor Kristi Noem's wild and irresponsible attempt to connect tribal leaders and parents with Mexican drug cartels is a sad reflection of her fear-based politics that do nothing to bring people together to solve problems,\" Janet Alkire, chairwoman of the Standing Rock Sioux, wrote in a lengthy five-page rebuke in March.\nA spokesman for Ms Noem told the BBC that \"banishing Governor Noem does nothing to solve the problem... she calls on all our tribal leaders to banish the cartels from tribal lands\".\nIt is the latest embarrassment for the former rising star of the Republican party.\nIn her new book, No Going Back, Ms Noem recounts how she shot dead her 14-month-old dog, Cricket, for bad behaviour. She also killed a goat she said smelled and was mean.\nThe governor said the shootings were examples of her willingness to do things that were \"difficult, messy and ugly\".\nIn another passage, later removed, Ms Noem claimed she had been to the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea and \"stared down Kim Jong Un\". No public record of either action exists.\nShe also claimed she had been \"slated to meet with French president Emmanuel Macron\" during a visit to Paris but nixed their sit-down over alleged \"pro-Hamas\" comments he made in the press. \nA French government official said there was no record of a scheduled meeting or even an invitation.\nMs Noem has hit back at what she calls left-wing \"spin\", but her attempts at damage control have failed across the political spectrum. Several interviews have since been cancelled.\nLast week, Mr Trump acknowledged Ms Noem has had \"a rough couple of days\" but said he liked her \"a lot\" and noted she \"has been supportive of me from the beginning\".\nAccording to US media, however, Trump insiders say she has \"killed her chances\" of being his vice-president.",
    "Dating app Bumble has apologised for adverts that critics said shamed women who were not sexually active.\nThe marketing campaign included messages such as \"A vow of celibacy is not the answer\" and \"Thou shalt not give up on dating and become a nun\".\nBumble said the ads were supposed to bring humour to \"a community frustrated by modern dating\".\nBut critics said the adverts were tasteless and ran counter to the company's stated aim of empowering women.\n\"In a world fighting for respect and autonomy over our bodies, it's appalling to see a dating platform undermine women's choices,\" wrote Jordan Emanuel, a model and actress who has talked publicly about her decision to refrain from sex for a year.\nThe company, which made its name in the world of dating apps by putting women in charge of starting conversations, said it understood the complaints and would remove the adverts, which started appearing on billboards in the US last month.\n\"We made a mistake,\" the company said in a statement posted on social media. \n\"For years Bumble has passionately stood up for women and marginalised communities, and their right to fully exercise personal choice. We didn't live up to these values with this campaign and we apologize for the harm it caused.\"\nIt said it would offer the advertising space to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, among other organisations and donate money.\nBumble was founded in 2014 and became a public company in 2021, but it has struggled amid concerns about its ability to reach younger users.\nThe company, which also owns Badoo, has seen its shares slide sharply since its debut.\nIn February, it announced plans to lay off 30% of its workforce - about 350 people.\nThe company recently relaunched its Bumble app, an overhaul that includes a new setting allowing users to remove the requirement that women initiate contact.\nA 2022 Pew survey estimated that a third of US adults and just over half of those under 30 had used a dating app or site at some point.\nOf those who had tried out online dating, only half reported they found it a positive experience. \nBumble has about four million paying customers, including 2.7 million on Badoo.",
    "Documentary makers are trying to track down the man who played a post-apocalyptic traffic warden in 1980s TV drama Threads.\nThe warden appeared as an extra in the 1984 TV film for less than 30 seconds - but his striking image was used to publicise its release. \nThe dystopian film explored the impact of a thermonuclear blast on Sheffield.\nCraig Ian Mann, who is working on the documentary, said he wanted to know how the man felt about the role. \n\"He has become the iconic image of that film,\" he said. \n\"He was on the front cover of the Radio Times, he was on the cover of every video, DVD or Blu-ray of Threads which has been made. \n\"People even dress up as him for Halloween,\" he said. \n\"We went to Sheffield Horror Con at the weekend, and there was somebody dressed up as him. \n\"He has become an iconic character and if he is still around, I would like to ask him if he is aware of it, and how he feels about it.\"\nThe film, written by Kes author Barry Hines, was shown at a time when nuclear war seemed a very real possibility, and shocked and horrified many who saw it. \nThe story focused around a young couple living in South Yorkshire when a bomb went off, and shows a society breaking down as nuclear winter sets in.\nIn the aftermath of the blast, a scene depicts increasingly desperate people trying to seek medical help or food, many of whom are herded into some tennis courts. \nMr Mann said: \"Patrolling these courts is a traffic warden with a gun in his hand, and we would love to be able to track him down.\n\"We have interviewed about 30 people so far, and none of them know who played the traffic warden in the film. \n\"He is almost definitely a local person who volunteered to be an extra in the film,\" he said. \n\"He may even have been a traffic warden, as his shirt and tie were far too clean for someone who just dressed for an extra that day.\"\nAt 34, Mr Mann was too young to have seen the film when it first aired but watched it a few months after moving to Sheffield as a student in 2007. \n\"Many people say it has shaped their lives in various ways, it was quite deeply affecting and it has stayed with them for a long time,\" he said. \n\"I have seen it four or five times since. I think if you didn't see it in the mid 80s, seeing it now is going to have the same effect on you I would say.\"\nHe is co-writing the documentary with Robert Nevitt, 44, who is the director of Sheffield horror film festival Celluloid Screams.\nMr Mann said they were asked to make a feature about the locations of the film to accompany its release on Blu-ray.\n\"I said we can do better than that, we are here, we have access to the people who were extras, actors, or in it in some way or another,\" he said. \n\"We got the green light to put together a documentary and have been talking to as many people as we can find who were involved.\"\nSome of those the pair have tracked down so far include a volunteer fire crew, who made sure none of the fires on set got out of control, and a woman and her son, who was just two years old at the time, who was shown being snatched from his pram as the bomb detonated.  \nMr Mann said: \"The boy's mother can be seen picking him up out of his pram and running, then you can see his pram overturning in the middle of The Moor. \n\"They answered an ad in the Sheffield Star, they went for auditions and then they were given call sheets and told when and where to turn up. \n\"However some people turned up at two, three or four of the film's scenes so feature more than once in the film.\" \nLord David Blunkett has also been interviewed, as he was the leader of Sheffield City Council when the film was first shown. \n\"Normally when we are trying to find somebody, there is someone who can say 'that was my father, brother, grandad' - but this time, we're not getting anything,\" he said.  \nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

    "When Donald Trump's criminal trial began, his courtroom entourage consisted of a gaggle of lawyers and campaign aides. This week, it's started to look more like a preview of July's Republican National Convention.\nWith Michael Cohen, Mr Trump's former lawyer and pivotal witness for the prosecution, on the stand, the number of prominent Republican officeholders in attendance has expanded dramatically.\nOn Tuesday, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson - the top Republican in the US - met the former president at the courthouse in Manhattan, greeting him with a smile and a nod. Then, while the hush-money trial was still ongoing, he gave a brief statement to the press outside.\n\"I am disgusted by what is happening here,\" he said, \"what is being done to our entire system of justice.\"\nMr Trump denies 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. New York prosecutors are using a novel legal theory to argue that the alleged cover-up amounts to election interference.\nMr Johnson called the trial a \"sham\" and a \"disgrace,\" said Cohen was a proven liar, and claimed that Mr Trump was being targeted by his political opponents to keep him off the presidential campaign trail as he tries to win back the White House. He even boasted about the size of the crowd at Mr Trump's Saturday campaign rally in New Jersey.\nIt was a dramatic show of support by the man second in line to the US presidency, and it came just a week after Mr Johnson survived a challenge to his congressional leadership from within his own party - a challenge that fizzled, in part, because Mr Trump repeatedly spoke out in his favour.\nIf the mutually beneficial relationship between Mr Trump and Mr Johnson was on full display on Tuesday, it was emblematic of how intertwined Mr Trump's legal fate has become with the fate of the Republican Party during this election year. \nA parade of US senators and congressmen, top Republican officials, and campaign aides trail in behind the former president each morning as a physical show of political unity.\nMany have sat behind the former president in the courtroom or stood nodding while he has given his impromptu press statements before and after the day's trial.\nThey have given their own press conferences, as well, directly challenging the veracity of the prosecution's witnesses and questioning the political motivations of the presiding judge's family. Those are topics Mr Trump is prohibited from addressing because of a court-issued gag order for which the former president has been fined 10 times for violating. Further transgressions could land him in jail for contempt of court.\nSome Republicans, like Senators Tommy Tuberville of Alabama and Rick Scott of Florida, as well as multiple state-level officials, seem content to use their attendance to gain favour with their party's leader and share a portion of the spotlight that the trial has generated. \nOthers may have more immediate interests.\nThis week several rumoured vice-presidential contenders have joined Mr Trump in the courtroom. The VIPs have included Senator JD Vance of Ohio, Congressman Byron Donalds of Florida and former Republican presidential candidates Vivek Ramaswamy and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. \nOn Tuesday, the latter three filled the first row of benches behind Mr Trump in the courtroom, as if waiting their turn to audition for the party's presidential ticket. (They were gone by mid-morning, perhaps more interested in the cameras outside the courtroom than the testimony inside it.)\nMr Trump's criminal trial is uncharted territory, and there is no playbook for how members of a political party should handle their former president - and their current presumptive presidential nominee - sitting in the criminal dock.\nIn the early days of the trial, few Republicans showed up. But after Senator Scott attended last week, a trickle has turned into a flood, only further blurring the lines between the political and the legal in the New York courthouse.\nIf there was ever any doubt that Mr Trump's trial would turn into a political spectacle, that question has now been firmly answered - and the proceedings are far from over.\nBBC reporter Kayla Epstein contributed to this story.",
    "Georgia's parliament has voted through a divisive \"foreign agent\" law that has sparked weeks of mass street protests.\nHowever, the bill now faces a likely veto by Georgia's president, which the parliament in Tbilisi can override by holding an additional vote.\nCritics say the bill - which they call the \"Russia law\" - could be used to threaten civil liberties. \nAfter the vote, protesters tried to enter the parliament while crowds also shut down a major intersection\nUnder the bill - which passed its third and final reading with 84 votes against 30 on Tuesday - NGOs and independent media that receive more than 20% of their funding from foreign donors would have to register as organisations \"bearing the interests of a foreign power\".\nThey would also be monitored by the Justice Ministry and could be forced to share sensitive information - or face hefty fines of up to 25,000 GEL ($9,400; \u00a37,500).\nProtesters are concerned that the legislation would be used by the government to suppress its opponents. Parallels have also been drawn with an authoritarian bill which came into force in Russia in 2012, and which the Kremlin has since used to clamp down on dissidents.\nOn Monday, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze warned that if authorities backed down at the bill's third reading, Georgia would lose sovereignty and \"easily share the fate of Ukraine\", without detailing what he meant.\nProtesters heckled the police - clad in full riot gear - guarding the side entrances to the building. Arrests were made after some tried to break through the iron barriers near the building. The atmosphere was tense inside the parliament too, with physical and verbal altercations taking place between pro-government and opposition MPs.\nAs she walked into the parliament building, President Salome Zourabichvili - an opponent of Mr Kobakhidze - told the BBC she would veto the law. \nHowever, Georgian Dream has sufficient numbers in parliament to overrule her, and there are few doubts the legislation will pass. \nOpposition parties say the new law could harm Georgia's attempt to join the European Union (EU), which has given it candidate status. The EU has warned the bill could jeopardise further progress within the bloc.\nIn a post on X, president of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola wrote: \"Tbilisi, we hear you! We see you!\", adding that Georgians protesting \"want a European future\". \nThe White House warned it would \"reassess\" its ties with Georgia following the development, with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre calling on Georgia's president to veto the law.\nThe UK's Minister for Europe, Nusrat Ghani, said the scenes in Georgia \"are shocking\". \nNatia Seskuria, who previously worked for Georgia's National Security Council, told the BBC she believed the protests against the law would continue.\nThe people of Georgia will \"rally against this law as long as it takes\", she said, adding that the new law represented an \"existential threat\" to the country's survival.\nThe bill comes just five months before a parliamentary election in the country, which some protestors say offers a chance to vote out Georgian Dream which has held power since 2012.\n\"We are waiting for when we will have a choice to choose a new government\", a 27-year old protestor told AFP but declined to give his last name over fears for his safety.\nMassive rallies against the bill have gripped the Caucasus country for nearly a month. Photos and footage posted online in recent days appeared to show violent altercations between protesters and police.",

    "A couple who dined and dashed at five restaurants could have been stopped earlier, according to a \"heartbroken\" restaurant owner.\nWhen Emily Langford read about Bernard and Ann McDonagh pleading guilty to stealing more than \u00a31,000 of food and drink, it made her blood boil.\nHer own family-run business in Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan, lost more than \u00a3150 when a group of diners left without paying the bill, weeks before the fraudster couple targeted Bella Ciao in Swansea.\nSouth Wales Police said it had linked the thefts and was investigating after Ann McDonagh was identified on CCTV footage outside Emily's restaurant, while BBC Wales has approached the McDonaghs for a response.\nOn a quiet Tuesday evening in March, Emily and her parents were pleased to accommodate a table for five at their family-run pizzeria The Yard.\nThe diners, who also had a baby with them, tucked into prawn and salmon starters, followed by lasagnes and pizzas, washed down with bottles of soft drinks.\n\"We checked everything was OK, they said everything was lovely,\" said Emily.\nAfter about an hour, Emily said the men and children got up from the table, thanked them and headed towards the exit while the woman asked if she could pay at the bar.\n\"She was buttering me and my mum up, saying that we looked like sisters, very pretty, blah, blah, blah.\"\nThe woman also asked them why it was so quiet and Emily said she told her \"we were all really struggling\".\nThe woman tried to pay the \u00a3151 bill with her card.

    "Vladimir Putin has appointed one of his closest allies, Nikolai Patrushev, as an official aide, in the latest reshuffle of his inner circle.\nThe 72-year-old was replaced as head of Russia's Security Council by sacked defence minister Sergei Shoigu on Monday.\nHis friendship with the Russian president dates back to the 1970s, when the pair worked in the KGB.\nIt is not clear whether Mr Patrushev's new role constitutes a demotion.\nFor a long time considered one of the most powerful men in Russia, and a protagonist in Mr Putin's campaign against the West, he will likely still hold a significant role.\nIndeed, in modern Russia, you do not have to have a particular job title to have the president's ear. \nBut Mr Putin remains the person who has the final say. It was his decision to start the war in Ukraine and all the big calls are taken by him.\nMr Patrushev is one of three Putin loyalists who have served with him ever since the 1970s in St Petersburg, when Russia's second city was still known as Leningrad.\nNot only did he work with him in the KGB during the communist era, he replaced him as head of its successor organisation, the Federal Security Service (FSB), from 1999 to 2008. He then served as secretary of the Russian Security Council for 14 years.\nThis latest movement at the top of Russian politics also saw Mr Patrushev's son, Dmitry - seen by some as a possible successor to Mr Putin - promoted to deputy prime minister.\nAlexei Dyumin, Mr Putin's former bodyguard and governor of the Tula region, was also made an aide to the president. \nMr Dyumin will oversee the defence industry, while Mr Patrushev will have a remit for shipbuilding, Mr Putin's spokesman was quoted by state news agency TASS as saying.\nThe former is Putin's former bodyguard, now the governor of Tula region, and for a time there were rumours he might replace Mr Shoigu in defence. \nIt has been alleged he was directly involved in leading the \"little green men\" that went into Ukraine in 2014 and the subsequent annexation of Crimea.\nWith additional reporting from Vitaliy Shevchenko ",
    "A sailing yacht has sunk in Moroccan waters in the Strait of Gibraltar after being rammed by an unknown number of orcas, Spain's maritime rescue services said.\nTwo people onboard the vessel, Alboran Cognac, were rescued by a passing oil tanker, after the incident at 0900 local time (0800 BST) on Sunday.\nIt is the latest in a series of orca rammings of vessels around the Strait of Gibraltar over the past four years.\nScientists are unsure about the exact causes of the behaviour, but believe the highly intelligent mammals could be displaying \"copycat\" or \"playful\" behaviour.\nSpain's maritime rescue service said the two passengers reported feeling sudden blows to the hull and rudder, causing water to seep into the vessel.\nThe couple alerted emergency services and were rescued by a nearby oil tanker which then took them to Gibraltar.\nThe yacht was left adrift and eventually sank.\nOrca rammings in the Strait of Gibraltar - one of the busiest waterways in the world, with approximately 300 ships crossing daily - and off the Atlantic coast of Portugal and north-western Spain, have become increasingly common over the past four years.\nExperts believe them to involve a subpopulation of about 15 orcas given the designation \"Gladis\".\nThe research group GTOA, which tracks the population of the Iberian orca sub-species, has documented nearly 700 interactions involving the species, since the attacks were first reported in May 2020.\nExperts believe attacks first began after one or two orcas, which are also known as killer whales, started interacting with and damaging small sailing vessels that month. \nOne of the main theories that has circulated social media is that the orcas are seeking revenge for White Gladis - a killer whale supposedly hit by a boat.\nThat caught on when Alfredo L\u00f3pez Fernandez, from research group GTOA, was quoted as saying a \"traumatised orca\" had launched the attacks.\nBut, according to animal behaviour experts, this might not be true.\n\"The idea of revenge is a great story, but there's no evidence for it,\" neuroscientist Lori Marino, president of the Whale Sanctuary Project previously told the BBC.\n\"There's never been a case of an orca harming a human being in the wild.\n\"If they really wanted to do damage and harm the people on the boat they could easily do that.\"\nInstead, Lori told the BBC, it's more likely the apparent attacks \"started out as play behaviour\", and it's a case of copycat killer whales rather than aggression.\n\"We're talking about very intelligent beings, and we know that they are social learners,\" she says.\nScientists think the endangered mammals instead appear to be \"playing\" with the boats out of curiosity and copycat behaviour, rather than aggression.",
    "A severe internet outage that has hit several African countries - the third disruption in four months - is a stark reminder of how vulnerable the service is on the continent.\nQuestions are being asked about how the reliability of what has become an essential tool in nearly every aspect of life can be improved.\nA cut to two of the undersea cables, which carry the data around the continent, early on Sunday morning, led to the recent disruption.\nIn March, damage to four cables off the West African coast caused similar problems.\nAnd in February, the vital links were damaged in the Red Sea after the anchor of a stricken ship dragged through three cables.\nInvestigations are under way into this weekend\u2019s case.\nBut it was also likely to have been caused by \u201can anchor drag\u201d from a ship, Prenesh Padayachee, chief digital and operations officer at Seacom, which owns one of the two cables affected, told the BBC.\nThe second cable, known as Eassy, was affected at the same time and at the same place.\nThe incident happened off the South African coast, just north of the port city of Durban, according to the Communications Authority of Kenya (CAK).\nThe capacity of the infrastructure connecting Africa to the rest of the world has improved in recent years and telecoms companies are switching to other cables to maintain the service.\nIn Kenya, for example, the CAK said that local internet traffic was currently using The East Africa Marine System (Teams) cable that was not affected.\nWhile Kenya has alternatives, other countries, such as Tanzania where connectivity levels hit 30% of what they were expected to be, do not.\nThe data should be able to find other routes, but when there is a limited number of pathways the service gets jammed and slows down.\nCases of cable damage are increasing but that is because the number of connections has also gone up.\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t realise that the internet is held up by these cables that are like garden hosepipes except it\u2019s one that stretches 10,000km, and that means that they are quite fragile,\u201d Dr Jess Auerbach Jahajeeah, a researcher into digital connectivity at the University of Cape Town, told the BBC\u2019s Focus on Africa programme.\nAnchor dragging from ships close to shore is one of the most common causes of damage, but underwater rockfalls, as was believed to be the case in West Africa in March, and seismic activity can also affect the cables.\nAs \u201cmany of these subsea cables are often quite close to each other, then one activity on the ocean floor or one ship can damage multiple cables at the same time\u201d, industry expert Ben Roberts said.\nRepairing the damage, which requires specialised equipment and expertise, can take days or weeks, depending on the weather, sea conditions and the extent of the problem.\nIt took more than a month, for example, for the four severed West African internet cables to be repaired and returned to service.\n\u201cWe are working on a temporary capacity solution to ensure connectivity is reinstated to the affected regions,\u201d said Mr Padayachee from Seacom.\nHe added that they were \u201cactively collaborating with various parties to expedite the repair process\u201d.\nCable repair ship the L\u00e9on Th\u00e9venin, that had been docked in Cape Town, is being sent to the site of the damage and should be there in three days, said Chris Wood, who runs a company that has invested in Eassy.\nDespite an increase in connections, Africa's reliance on a limited number of undersea cables for the internet makes the continent more susceptible to disruptions and exacerbates their impact.\nEurope and North America, on the other hand, have a dense network of high-capacity overland and undersea cables that diversify connectivity routes and improve resilience.\nWhile discussions have been ongoing to address Africa's internet infrastructure challenges, progress has been slow because of logistical and financial constraints.\nDr Jahajeeah said one problem was that the support systems to repair the growing number of cables around the continent had not kept up with the growth.\nWhile other ships can help out, the L\u00e9on Th\u00e9venin is the only repair ship dedicated to servicing Africa.\n\u201cThe [ship] used to do two or three repairs a year [but] last year it did nine\u2026 and there is a real need for African governments and global governments to get together and say we need to ensure that there is no digital divide,\u201d Dr Jahajeeah said.\nSome people have proposed alternatives such as satellite internet links to bolster digital resilience.\nElon Musk's Starlink project, for example, aims to provide high-speed internet to people who live in remote areas via a network of satellites. But is very expensive and currently not available everywhere.\nThe answer really lies in greater investment on the ground to support the vital communications infrastructure.\n\u201cIt needs more networks, more connectivity, more data centres and more internet exchanges to make sure that we have a diverse connectivity,\u201d said Mr Roberts.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for mor",

    "A man who killed a mother and her two daughters by setting fire to a flat has had his sentence reduced.\nFatoumatta Hydara, 28, died along with Fatimah and Naeemah Drammeh, aged three and one, when their home in Clifton, Nottingham, was set ablaze in 2022.\nNeighbour Jamie Barrow was convicted of three counts of murder for deliberately starting the fire and sentenced to life with a minimum term of 44 years.\nThe Court of Appeal reduced it to 38 years on Tuesday.\nLord Justice Singh, Mr Justice Jay and Judge Mayo said the original sentence was \"manifestly excessive in the circumstances of this case\", but also expressed \"sincere sympathy\" for the family of the deceased.\n\"Nothing in this judgement should be taken in any way to detract from the gravity of the offences committed by this appellant,\" they said.\nThe court heard Barrow had drunk \"seven or eight\" cans of lager before getting fuel from his motorbike and setting fire to his neighbours' flat in Fairisle Close.\nWhile he said he believed the property was empty, his trial was told a pram in the hallway showed the family was at home, with prosecutors claiming he did nothing when he heard their screams.\nBarrow was seen on CCTV walking away from the burning flat with his dog while smoking a cigarette, before returning to the scene and asking emergency services about the severity of the blaze.\nWhen defending himself in court, he said he was \"wallowing in self-pity\" before starting the fire, citing his emotionally unstable personality disorder, and said he suffered \"an immense amount of guilt\" for causing the deaths.\nAfter he was sentenced, the family of the deceased said Barrow's actions were \"utterly heartless and cruel\", and had \"caused a multigenerational trauma that we will never understand\".\nAboubacarr Drammeh - who had been working in the US at the time of the fire and was planning to bring his wife and daughters with him before their deaths - had called Barrow \"a coward who knew exactly what he was doing and exactly when to do it\".\nIn a written judgement, the Court of Appeal said the sentencing judge found Barrow had shown no remorse, \"knew the deceased were all at home asleep\", and watched the fire develop for five minutes before leaving without seeking help.\n\"It was an enormous length of time in the circumstances; in that time the smell of fire spread to nearby houses and smoke billowed from the property,\" the judgement said.\nNoting the defendant's longstanding mental health problems, the judges said Barrow \"had difficulty managing his anger\", and \"had an interest in and considerable experience of fires\", but found the trial decided his disorders \"did not impair his ability to understand the nature and consequences of his actions\".\nHowever, Barrow's defence said the 44-year minimum sentence was \"manifestly excessive\" compared to other murder cases involving arson, adding not fully taking into account his mental health as a factor \"was unreasonable and at fundamental odds with the evidence\".\nWhile finding the sentencing judge \"was entitled to go well above the starting point\" for sentencing, the Court of Appeal found there needed to be \"consistency as between different cases\", and reduced the minimum term accordingly.\n\"We stress that the minimum term is not the term that [Barrow] will in fact serve in prison,\" the judgement said.\n\"He will only be released if the Parole Board is satisfied that he is no longer a danger to society and, even if he is released, he will then be on licence for the rest of his life and may be recalled to prison if he breaches the conditions of any such licence.\"\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "The first machine gun, patented 306 years ago, was the brainchild of a lawyer, inventor and writer from London, James Puckle.\nHe was a keen fisherman and intended to use his weapon at sea - and as a side effect he believed the gun would \"convince the Turks of the benefits of Christian civilisation\".\nHowever, despite being the only British-born person to have designed a machine gun, Puckle is more likely to be known for his published work, a dialogue between father and son on the evils of intemperance, and as an obscure footnote in a 2014 videogame.\nPuckle designed his gun to fire both round and square bullets - the round ones he planned to shoot at Christians and the square, which he believed would cause greater injury, were reserved for marauding Turks.\nPuckle's animosity toward Turks stemmed from fear of the Ottoman Empire. \nBy the turn of the 18th Century, the Ottomans controlled much of southeast Europe, western Asia and north Africa, and were engaged in a series of wars with European powers.  \nThe Turks, with vessels too fast to be effectively stopped by broadside cannon, could board and raid ships with relative ease.\nSo Puckle invented a single-barrelled flintlock weapon fitted with a multi-shot revolving cylinder. It was a basic step toward the automatic weapon.\nIt was mounted on a tripod and was portable. While a musket could be loaded and fired three times a minute, the Puckle gun fired nine shots a minute.\nThe gun had nine chambers which revolved on a spindle, and by a lever under the barrel each chamber could be forced home into the breech. \nPuckle, widely considered to be a man of high and obvious morality, also had a motto engraved on the barrel of the gun reading: \nDEFENDING KING GEORGE YOUR COUNTRY AND LAWES\nIS DEFENDING YOURSELVES AND PROTESTANT CAUSE.\nPleased with his gun, Puckle took it to Woolwich for the government to assess - and possibly add to its armoury.\nIn 1717 it underwent trials but was rejected for government use, one reason being that the flintlock mechanism was too unreliable.\nThe unimpressed Board of Ordnance found it inferior in fire rate to earlier repeating weapons, some of which fired up to six times faster. \nThe board described it as \"clumsy and unreliable\".\nUndeterred, Puckle patented his weapon and three years later set up a company to market his machine. \nHe held several demonstrations - but his company did not fare well, despite an enthusiastic write-up in the London Journal in March 1722.\n\"Wednesday sennight (week) last was a performance of Mr Puckle's Machine - and it is reported for certain that one man discharged 63 times in seven minutes, though all the while it was raining. It throws one large or 16 musket balls at every discharge with great force.\n\"Even if Puckle had several cylinders ready for replacements, the mere priming of each touch-hole during continuous rain and discharge with this rapidity is little short of marvellous. \n\"It is remarkable that this invention was not carried further, for only two examples were made, one a crude experimental gun of iron, and the other the finished article in brass.\"\nWhen shares were put on the market by Puckle, a review rather cruelly said of the product: \"It only wounded those who have shares therein.\"\nCould there have been a glimmer of hope for Puckle and his weapon? The Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry bought two guns for an expedition in 1722.\nHe planned to capture St Lucia and St Vincent and appointed a Captain Uring deputy-governor, and sent him out with seven ships containing settlers and their families.\nThe French were having none of it though and landed a body of troops from Martinique to oppose him. Capt Uring was compelled to agree to leave St Lucia within seven days. \nA similar attempt to obtain a footing in St Vincent's was opposed by the inhabitants, and also ended in failure.\nThe Puckle guns were never used.\nThere was an unusual renaissance for the Puckle gun - in the 2014 video game Assassin's Creed: Rogue, four Puckle guns were part of the weaponry on the protagonist's ship.\nThey were, however, modified from the original design. They were less clumsy and unreliable.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram. Send your story ideas to hello.bbclondon@bbc.co.uk",
    "Eurovision Song contest organisers have defended disqualifying Dutch contestant Joost Klein from the competition.\nKlein was removed hours before Saturday's final after an allegation of intimidation was made to Swedish police by a female member of the production crew.\nDutch organisers The Netherlands Songfestival said on Saturday that they \"were shocked by the decision\" and called it \"disproportionate\".\nBut the Eurovision Broadcasting Union (EBU) said in a statement on Tuesday: \"The version of events released in some public comments and on social media does not correspond with the statements shared with us and the Swedish Police by staff and witnesses.\"\nThe statement continued: \"Joost\u2019s behaviour was in clear breach of contest rules which are designed to ensure there is a safe working environment for all staff and to protect the production. \n\"We are not pre-judging the legal process but, given the circumstances of what occurred and the fact that the police case will shortly be handed to the prosecutor, it would not have been appropriate for Joost to participate in the grand final.\"\nIt added that the decision to exclude him was backed by the contest\u2019s governing body and unanimously supported by the EBU executive board, \"following a thorough internal investigation\".\n\"We have a zero-tolerance policy towards inappropriate behaviour at our events and will always take necessary action to address threats to staff \u2013 no matter who they come from,\" the statement concluded.\nIn a statement posted on X on Sunday, Dutch broadcaster Avrotros said it was \"very disappointed and upset for the millions of fans who were excited\" about seeing the Netherlands entry.\nMany fans had also taken to social media to voice their dismay.\nThe latest statement from the EBU follows a turbulent Eurovision season, which culminated with Switzerland's Nemo picking up the coveted winners' trophy in Sweden on Saturday.\nOn Monday, the EBU issued another statement, responding to complaints of bad behaviour during the competition's run.\nThe organisers said they \"regret\" that some delegations \"didn't respect the spirit of the rules\" in Sweden.\nItaly's Angelina Mango and Ireland's Bambie Thug were among the contestants who complained of a \"tense\" and \"horrible\" atmosphere backstage.\nThe EBU said it would review events in Sweden's Malmo, adding that individual cases would be discussed at a later date.\nPortugal's national broadcaster RTP also complained to the EBU after there was a delay in posting its performance to YouTube after the final.\nThe EBU responded that the delay had been due to their contestant, Iolanda, who had painted designs inspired by the keffiyeh - traditional Palestinian scarves used to show support for the country - on her nails.\n",
    "UK wage growth remained strong even as the UK unemployment rate rose to its highest for almost a year.\nThe jobless rate increased to 4.3% between January and March, the highest since May to July last year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.\nThe number of vacancies also slowed meaning more unemployed people are competing for the same jobs.\nBut pay rises, excluding bonuses, remained at 6%. It had been expected to slow to 5.9% between January and March.\nTaking inflation - which measures the pace of price rises - into account, wages rose by 2.4%. Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said that \"real pay growth remains at it highest level in well over two years\".\nBut she also said there were others \"tentative signs\" that the British jobs markets is \"cooling\".\nJobs on offer in the UK dropped by 26,000 to 898,000 vacancies between February and April. The total remains higher than pre-pandemic levels but Ms McKeown said: \"With unemployment also increasing, the number of unemployed people per vacancy has continued to rise, approaching levels seen before the onset of Covid-19.\"\nIn the first three months of this year, the number of unemployed people per vacancy rose to 1.6. That compares to 1.4 unemployed people for every vacancy in the comparable period between October and December 2023. \nThe ONS said: \"Although this ratio remains low by historical standards, it does demonstrate a slight easing in the labour market, with vacancies falling alongside rising unemployment.\"\nMeanwhile, those claiming benefits in April rose to 1.5 million, up 29,300 compared to the same month last year.\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt said wage rises would \"help with the cost of living pressures on families\". \nHe added: \"While we are dealing with some challenges in our labour supply, including pandemic impacts, as our reforms on childcare, pensions tax reform and welfare come online I am confident we will start to increase the number of people in work.\"\nBut Labour's acting shadow work and pensions secretary, Alison McGovern, said \"these damning new figures prove that things are just getting worse\".\nShe said: \"It's no wonder there are now a record number of people locked out of work due to long-term sickness, given NHS waiting lists are spiralling and the Tories have pushed our NHS to its knees.\"\nThe rate of people considered \"economically inactive\" - defined as those aged between 16 to 64 years old not in work or looking for a job - edged a little lower to 22.1% in the first three months of the year. \nThe ONS said the increase in economic inactivity in the latest quarter was largely driven by people not be working \"because they were temporarily sick, long-term sick or retired\".\nIt has warned, however, that its figures should be treated with a degree of caution because they are based on a smaller sample of household questionnaires than it used to rely on before Covid.\nBrigitte Wurfel-Mathurin from Gloucester, gave up her job as a supervisor at a day nursery after her husband was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.\nShe initially tried to keep working at the job she loved but said: \"There was no way I could leave him alone all day, but I'd done the maths and I couldn't afford to pay for his care on my modest salary.\" \nMs Wurfel-Mathurin said the amount she receives in carers allowance left her feeling \"completely undervalued\".\n\"I was sad to give up my job because this is what I loved to do, I was very experienced and had years of training,\" she said. \"But I'm also happy to spend the time while I still can with my husband.\"\nInterest rates\nWhile overall pay growth, excluding bonuses, was unchanged between January and March, it slowed a little to 5.9% for private employers. \nThe wage figures will be closely watched by the Bank of England to decide if and when interest rates can be cut. \nThe next rate-setting meeting is in June and there are a number of key economic releases before then which the Bank will use to make its decision. This includes inflation as well as wage figures for April, when an increase in the National Living Wage came into force.\n\"While the further easing in regular private sector pay in March suggests that wage pressures faded a bit faster than the Bank of England expected, broader measures of wage growth are probably still a bit too strong for the Bank's liking,\" said Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics.\n\"At the margin, this may make the Bank a bit more uneasy about first cutting interest rates in June.\"\nAt its most recent meeting, Bank governor Andrew Bailey said he was \"optimistic that things are moving in the right direction\", though he added that a fall in borrowing costs was \"not a fait accompli\".  \nRates have been 5.25% since last August, the highest level in 16 years.\nAre you affected by the issues raised in this story?

    "The whereabouts of a Chinese citizen journalist jailed for covering the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic is still unknown a day after she was expected to have been released, having served her four year sentence.\nSupporters say they are unclear if Zhang Zhan had actually been freed - although rights groups had said authorities were likely to keep tight-lipped on her status.\nThe 40-year-old former lawyer is one of several activists who had run into trouble with Chinese authorities for their Covid-19 reporting. Some have been detained while others have gone missing.\nShe was found guilty of \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble\", a frequent charge against activists in China.\nMedia watchdogs and human rights groups had said that Ms Zhang was wrongfully prosecuted. They had called for her release because of her deteriorating health.\nThere is \"huge concern\" about the safety of Ms Zhang after she is released, Reporters Without Borders advocacy officer Aleksandra Bielakowska said.\n\"In China, journalists detained for their work often remain under detention or surveillance even upon completion of their prison terms,\" she said.\n\"I honestly think we will have no updates soon. They will probably try to detain her in secret location, or keep her out of the eye sight for some time.\"\nOne of Ms Zhang's lawyers told BBC Chinese that her \"personal freedom will still be restricted\", adding that she will now live with her parents in Shanghai.\nFrom her base in Shanghai, Ms Zhang travelled to Wuhan in February 2020 to document what she saw on the streets and in hospitals. \nHer livestreams and essays were widely viewed on social media, and she continued to produce them despite threats from authorities. \nOne of her livestreamed clips showed how she kept her camera rolling while an official warned her to \"stop filming or [he would] get mad\".\n\"Maybe I have a rebellious soul... I'm just documenting the truth. Why can't I show the truth?\" she said in an interview with an independent filmmaker, a clip of which was obtained by the BBC. \n\"I won't stop what I'm doing, because this country can't go backwards.\"\nThis was thought to be her last interview before she was detained.\nMs Zhang had posted more than 100 videos on her YouTube Channel, WeChat and Twitter, before being reported missing on 14 May 2020. \nThe next day, authorities announced that she was detained by police in Shanghai. She was charged in November that year and was sentenced the following month.\nMs Zhang went on a hunger strike in the first few months of detention, and her lawyer had said then that she was being force-fed through a tube.\nShe remained on partial strike until July 2023, when her weight had reportedly plummeted to just 37kg - half of what it was before her detention.\nShe was also suffering from severe malnutrition, gastrointestinal disease, and low white blood cell count, RSF said.\n\"Journalist Zhang Zhan, who courageously risked her life by informing the public on the outbreak of Covid-19 in Wuhan, is at risk of dying if she does not receive extensive medical treatment,\" the organisation said in a statement in September last year.\nThe significance of Ms Zhang's case will rest on what happens after she is released, said Jerome Cohen, an expert in Chinese law.\n\"Most released human rights advocates are kept quiet through informal means of suppression. Some try to leave the country and are successful in continuing to report on human rights violations in China but they are exceptions,\" said Prof Cohen.\nA lawyer for Ms Zhang said her family had been \"frequently approached\" by the police during her detention, and they were instructed not to discuss the case with others.\n\"Citizen journalists were the only source of uncensored, first-hand information about the Covid-19 outbreak in China. \n\"Because they work independently of state-controlled media, citizen journalists face constant harassment for exposing information the government would rather keep quiet,\" Amnesty International said in a statement.\nWhen the pandemic first struck in early 2020, the Chinese internet - despite being heavily censored - was inundated with messages describing government cover-ups and failures in the healthcare system. \nBut the state's censorship machine doubled down to suppress the unprecedented online anger. \nSeveral channels went quiet, posts were swiftly erased and some activists like Ms Zhang received explicit warnings from the authorities.\nAmong the most well-known internationally was the case of whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang, who had tried to warn his colleagues about a \"Sars-like virus\". \nDr Li died in February 2020 after contracting Covid-19. It was later revealed that he had been under investigation for \"disturbing social order\" by \"making false comments\". His death sparked an outpouring of support on social media, but the posts were periodically scrubbed.\nThe Communist Party filled state media with positive stories about its Covid-19 response.

    "Timber smuggling, estimated to be worth $23m (\u00a318m) a year, from Mozambique\u2019s ancient forests to China is helping to fund a brutal Islamist insurgency as well as a large criminal network in the north of the southern African country.\nThis illicit trade in rosewood is linked to the financing of Mozambique\u2019s Islamic-State linked militants, in the northernmost province of Cabo Delgado, according to data seen by the BBC from the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), an NGO that campaigns against alleged environmental crime.\nRosewood is a catch-all trade term for a wide range of tropical hardwoods that are highly prized for luxury furniture in China.\nMozambique\u2019s rosewood is protected under an international treaty, meaning only very limited trade that does not threaten the species is allowed.\nHowever, a four-year undercover investigation by the EIA in both countries has revealed that poor management of officially sanctioned forest concessions, illegal logging and corruption among port officials is allowing the trade to expand unchecked in insurgent-controlled areas.\nThe revelation comes at the same time as a significant resurgence in fighting in the north of Mozambique. On Friday, at least 100 insurgents staged their boldest attack in three years, on the town of Macomia, which was eventually stopped by the army.\nThe location of the attack confirms that the insurgency is expanding its area of operations due to the increased presence of soldiers in the worst-affected areas. It \u201chas also gained enough funds to recruit in neighbouring Nampula province further south\u201d, according to Mozambique analyst Joe Hanlon.\nA Mozambique government report published earlier this year and seen by the BBC - the National Risk Assessment on Terrorism Finance Report - says the al-Shabab insurgents have taken advantage of the illicit timber trade to \u201cfuel and finance the reproduction of violence\u201d.\nThe report says the insurgents\u2019 involvement in the \u201csmuggling of fauna and flora products\u201d, including wood, and the \u201cexploitation of forest and wildlife resources\u201d is contributing to a \u201cvery high level of fundraising\u201d for the insurgency group. It estimated its revenue from these activities amounted to $1.9m a month.\nGiven the challenge in accessing the Cabo Delgado region it is hard to quantify the insurgents\u2019 level of day-to-day involvement in the timber trade but there have been reports of firms paying a 10% protection fee to the jihadist groups to carry out illegal logging in forest areas.\nForests with valuable trees - not just rosewood - are divided up in to chunks, or concessions. Anyone who wants to log these areas must pay a fee to the authorities. These are typically licensed to a Mozambican national - the middleman - and rented out to Chinese logging firms.\nTrading sources who did not want to be named estimate that 30% of the timber logged in Cabo Delgado is at high risk of coming from insurgency-occupied forests.\nThere are thought to be three main forested areas in Cabo Delgado where logging and timber sales take place: Nairoto; Muidumbe and Mueda, plus one more in Napai, in neighbouring Nampula province.\nWhile the Chinese authorities have made it illegal to log rosewood in their own country, huge quantities continue to be imported.\nRosewood is given a customs code for hongmu (meaning red wood in Chinese) on arrival in the country, which allows researchers to trace it.\nMozambique was China's top African supplier of hongmu last year, providing over 20,000 tonnes worth $11.7m, according to Trade Data Monitor, a commercial company that tracks global trade.\nIt has overtaken other countries like Senegal, Nigeria and Madagascar as their rosewood species have been stripped or depleted, or laws banning exports have been more strictly enforced.\nAs part of its undercover investigation, the EIA tracked a huge rosewood shipment out of Mozambique.\nBetween October 2023 and March 2024, investigators traced around 300 containers of a type of rosewood known as pau preto from the port of Beira to China.\nPau preto rosewood, which is found in the north of Mozambique and in Tanzania, is classed as a threatened species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list.\nThese 300 containers were transporting 10,000 tonnes of the rosewood. Trader estimates value each container at around $60,000, putting the value of the total shipment at around $18m.\nEIA undercover footage seen by the BBC shows some of this specific shipment was also in raw log form - rather than planks that had been processed through sawmills. This breaks Mozambique's own 2017 law on exporting any unprocessed timber.\nThe containers also held processed planks.\nIndustry sources say that typically when trees are cut down by loggers in Cabo Delgado\u2019s forests - either at concessions operated largely by Chinese firms, or illegally beyond these boundaries - the timber is taken to be processed at sawmills around Montepuez, a large town in Cabo Delgado.\nThis timber from multip",
    "Canadian author Alice Munro, a 2013 Nobel Prize winner for literature, has died at the age of 92. \nMunro wrote short stories for more than 60 years, often focusing on life in rural Canada. \nShe died at her home in Port Hope, Ontario on Monday night, her family and her publisher have confirmed.\nMunro was often compared to Russian writer Anton Chekhov for the insight and compassion found in her stories. \n\"Alice Munro is a national treasure - a writer of enormous depth, empathy, and humanity whose work is read, admired, and cherished by readers throughout Canada and around the world,\" Kristin Cochrane, the CEO of Penguin Random House Canada, said in a statement. \nHer first major break-through came in 1968, when her short story collection, Dance of The Happy Shades, about life in the suburbs of western Ontario, won Canada's highest literary honour, the Governor General's Award. It was the first of three Governor General's Awards she would win in her lifetime.\nMunro has published thirteen collections of stories as well as one novel, Lives of Girls and Women, and two volumes of Selected Stories.\nIn 1977, the New Yorker magazine published one of Munro's stories, Royal Beatings, based on punishments she received from her father when she was young. She went on to have a long relationship with the publication. \nMunro, the daughter of a fox farmer and a schoolteacher, was born in 1931 in Wingham, Ontario. Many of her stories are set in the area and chronicle the region's people, culture and the way of life. \nIn her youth, she was named class valedictorian at her high school and received a scholarship to the University of Western Ontario in London. Munro had the the highest standing in English of any student who applied to the university. \nWhile pursuing higher education, Munro said she spent about half her time on academics and the other half writing.  \nShe has published more than a dozen collections of short stories. In the 1950s and 1960s, her stories were broadcast on the CBC and published in several Canadian periodicals. \nSome of her stories compared life before and after the social revolution of the 1960s. \n\"Having been born in 1931, I was a little old, but not too old, and women like me after a couple of years were wearing miniskirts and prancing around,\" she said.\nOne well-known story, The Bear Came Over the Mountain, was made into the 2006 film Away from Her, starring Julie Christie and Gordon Pinsent.\nIn 2009, Munro won the Man Booker Prize International Prize for lifetime achievement.\nThe judges said in a statement at the time: \"To read Alice Munro is to learn something every time that you never thought of before.\" \nThey added that Munro \"brings as much depth, wisdom and precision to every story as most novelists bring to a lifetime of novels\".\nShe later won the Nobel Prize in 2013. Previous winners include literary giants such as Rudyard Kipling, Toni Morrison and Ernest Hemingway. \nThe Nobel committee called Munro a \"master of contemporary short story\".\nMunro said in an interview with the Guardian in 2013 that she had been \"writing personal stories all my life\".\n\"Maybe I write stories that people get very involved in, maybe it is the complexity and the lives presented in them,\" she told the Guardian in 2013. \"I hope they are a good read. I hope they move people.\"\nHer last collection of stories, Dear Life, was published in 2012. It included a collection of partly-autobiographical stories. \nShe told the National Post newspaper that Dear Life was special because she'd likely not write anymore. \n\"Not that I didn't love writing, but I think you do get to a stage where you sort of think about your life in a different way,\" she said.

    "A Paris court has acquitted director Roman Polanski of defaming a British actor who accused him of raping her when she was a teenager. \nIn 2019, he told Paris Match magazine that Charlotte Lewis had lied about being sexually assaulted by him four decades ago.\nMs Lewis, 56, brought the case against the 90-year-old filmmaker.\nShe told the court in March that she had become the victim of a \"smear campaign\" that \"nearly destroyed\" her.\nMs Lewis told the BBC she will appeal the decision.\nThe court's verdict relates to the charge of defamation and not to Ms Lewis's accusation of rape against Mr Polanski.\nThe judges found that his response was a \"value judgement about the fickle character of the plaintiff\".\nThey pointed to a \"significant gap between the admiration and gratitude towards the director, which she publicly expressed until 2010, and the denunciation of the violent nature of their relationship at the moment she decided to join in the condemnation against him\".\nNone of his words contested by the actor were of a \"nature to impugn the honour and respect of the plaintiff\", the judges said.\nMr Polanski fled the United States in 1978 after admitting having sex with a 13-year-old girl.\nSeveral other women have since come forward with claims that Mr Polanski abused them. He denies all claims against him.\nIn 2010, Ms Lewis accused the director of assaulting her in \"the worst possible way\" when she was 16 in 1983 in Paris, after she had travelled there for a casting. She later appeared in his 1986 film Pirates.\nBut in an interview with the Paris Match magazine, the France-born filmmaker claimed it was a \"heinous lie\". He did not attend the trial.\nParis Match reported that during the interview he allegedly read from a 1999 article in the now-defunct British tabloid newspaper News of the World, which quoted Ms Lewis as saying: \"I was fascinated by him, and I wanted to be his lover.\"\nMs Lewis has said the quotes attributed to her in that interview were not accurate.\nShe filed a complaint for defamation, and the film director was automatically charged under French law.\nMr Polanski, known for films including Chinatown, The Pianist, and Rosemary's Baby, has faced controversy for decades since fleeing the United States.\nHe has French and Polish citizenship, and has evaded various extradition attempts by US authorities.",
    "Almost 450,000 Palestinians have fled from Rafah over the past week, the UN says, as Israeli tanks reportedly push deeper into the southern Gaza city.\n\"People face constant exhaustion, hunger and fear,\" warned the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa.\nIsrael's military says it is continuing \"operations against terror targets\" in the east of the city, where more than a million people had been sheltering.\nNew Israeli operations in northern Gaza have displaced another 100,000 people. \nIsraeli troops have gone back into the areas of Zeitoun and Jabalia, where the military says Hamas has regrouped only five months after it claimed to have dismantled the group's local battalions.\nThe military ordered civilians to evacuate eastern Rafah and Jabalia for their own safety before starting the assaults, but the total of those displaced in recent days is equivalent to almost a quarter of Gaza's 2.3 million population.\nIsrael launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 35,170 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 82 in the past 24 hours, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nOn Tuesday morning, Unrwa posted several photos showing empty streets in Rafah which were packed with tents and makeshift shelters before the start of the Israeli operation on 6 May.\nFamilies had fled in search of safety, it said, but added: \"Nowhere is safe. An immediate ceasefire is the only hope.\"\nUnrwa spokeswoman Louise Wateridge, who is in Rafah, wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that families still in the city had \"moved as far west as possible\" and had set up tents on beaches along the Mediterranean coast. Further inland was \"now a ghost town\", she added.\nHadeel Radwan, a displaced mother of a newborn baby who is sheltering in the western Tal al-Sultan area, said she was terrified by the constant shelling and was enduring shortages of drinking water and other supplies.\nShe told AFP news agency that fellow residents had been fleeing, but \"I had a C-section and moving quickly, under threat, would be difficult for me.\"\nOther Palestinians told Reuters news agency that Israeli tanks were advancing deeper into residential areas in south-eastern Rafah and had crossed the main north-south road to the nearby Rafah crossing with Egypt, which Israeli troops took control of on Tuesday.\n\"The tanks advanced this morning west of Salah al-Din road, into the Brazil and al-Jneineh neighbourhoods,\" one resident said. \"They are in the streets inside the built-up area and there are clashes,\" they added.\nAl-Jneineh was one of the eastern neighbourhoods covered by the initial Israeli evacuation order, while Brazil was included in the expanded evacuation zone declared on Saturday. \nResidents have been told to head towards an \"expanded humanitarian area\", which stretches north from the coastal strip of al-Mawasi to the central town of Deir al-Balah. But the UN has said the area lacks basic infrastructure.\nIn a statement issued on Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces said troops had \"eliminated several armed terrorist cells in close-quarters encounters on the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing\" and also \"eliminated a number of terrorists and located weapons\" in eastern areas of Rafah.\nHamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other countries - said its fighters had killed and wounded several Israeli troops after it targeted an Israeli troop carrier with an anti-tank missile in the al-Salam neighbourhood, south of Brazil, and blew up a booby-trapped building on George Street, which runs through al-Jneineh.\nThe IDF said a soldier was seriously wounded in combat in southern Gaza.\nAfter seven months of war in Gaza, Israel has insisted victory is impossible without taking Rafah and eliminating the last remaining Hamas battalions.\nBut the UN and Western powers have warned that an all-out assault could lead to mass civilian casualties and a humanitarian catastrophe.\nAs well as the mass displacement of Palestinians in the city, the UN has warned that it is running out of supplies of fuel, food and other essential goods because the Rafah crossing is closed and the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing with Israel is inaccessible due to the hostilities in the area.\nThe UN said an Indian staff member was killed on Monday in a strike as he travelled in a marked vehicle to the European Gaza hospital in Khan Younis, just to the north-east of Rafah, without blaming any party.\nThe IDF said an initial inquiry indicated the vehicle was struck in an active combat zone and that it had not been made aware of its route. But the UN said Israeli authorities had been informed of its planned movements.\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Monday that the US still believed \"it would be a mistake to launch a major military operation into the heart ",

    "A major overhaul of farming subsidies in Wales is to be delayed by another year until 2026, following widespread protests.\nRural Affairs Secretary Huw Irranca-Davies said the decision showed the Welsh government was \"listening\" to farmers' concerns.\nA farmers' union welcomed the delay, but one nature group says it \"prolongs the uncertainty\".\nThe Welsh government said a new timeframe would give them the opportunity to \"work through a number of important aspects\".\nFarmers will continue to receive their current main subsidy - paid based on how much land they farm - in 2025.\nPlans for a different approach to agricultural funding have been in development since Brexit, with the goal of rewarding more environmentally-friendly ways of farming.\nA third and - supposedly final - consultation on the Sustainable Farming Scheme (SFS) earlier this year led to protests across Wales and 12,000 responses.\nFarmers called a 10% tree cover rule for farms \"unworkable\", claiming it could cost the industry 5,000 jobs. \nMore than 3,000 farmers and their supporters staged the largest ever Senedd protest in February calling for the scheme to be scrapped, along with changes to TB control measures and regulations to reduce nitrates from seeping into rivers.\nSpeaking at a press conference held on a farm near Bridgend, Mr Irranca-Davies said the government had \"always said the scheme would not be introduced until it is ready and I stand by that\".\nThe SFS was meant to start coming in from April 2025, with reforms to farm subsidies having already been pushed back several times.\nMr Irranca-Davies said his commitment to \"meaningful engagement\" with the farming sector and others on \"the changes needed will necessitate a change in the implementation timetable\".\nNeath hill farmer Liam Price, who organised a small protest in Cardiff on Tuesday, said he is still worried about what will happen in a year's time.\n\u201c[Huw Irranca-Davies] still hasn\u2019t said what changes he\u2019s making,\" he said. \"It may be a year down the line, but we\u2019ve still got to fight.\"\nAberdare hill farmer Chloe Hyde agreed, adding the TB policy in Wales is also causing problems.\n\u201cI\u2019m not against [SFS],\" she said. \"There are a few things in there that will be beneficial for everyone.\n\u201cAs long as they work with us and we can plant trees on ground that isn\u2019t productive, we\u2019ll be more than happy, but I know that isn\u2019t the same for everyone.\"\nWildlife Trusts Wales called the delay \"bad news for farmers, nature and climate\".\n\u201c[It] prolongs the uncertainty at a time when farmers need to be rewarded for switching to sustainable farming methods,\" said trust director Rachel Sharp.\n\"Delaying measures to help farms adapt to our changing climate now only increases costs tomorrow,\" she said. \n\"It\u2019s clear that the current food system isn\u2019t working for farmers, nature, climate and even consumers.\"\nThe Nature Friendly Farming Network called the delay \"disappointing\".\n\"The Welsh government must maintain its ambition to support and reward nature-friendly farming,\" said the network manager Rhys Evans.\nConservatives said it was \"positive\" the minister has listened to concerns from farmers. \n\"What we need to see is real change to SFS in its current form,\" said Tory rural affairs spokesperson James Evans.\nPlaid Cymru called the delay \"an opportunity to take a step back and make the necessary changes\". \nNFU Cymru applauded the rural affairs secretary for taking a \"sensible and pragmatic approach\".\nThe Sustainable Farming Scheme (SFS) is the Welsh government\u2019s big plan for funding the farming industry after Brexit, which puts a lot more emphasis on the environment.\nUnder the proposals, farmers would be paid for actions resulting in environmental, animal welfare and social outcomes - over and above minimum legal requirements.\nIn order to gain access to the scheme, farmers would have to commit to having trees on 10% of their land, and earmark 10% as wildlife habitat.\nThe scheme has sparked widespread protests in recent months.\nArguing that this is not practical while keeping a farm business going, many farmers are concerned that the requirements of the scheme will overwhelm them with paperwork.\nOn the other hand, the Welsh government is under pressure from environmentalists to ensure that the plan is ambitious.\nAs 80% of Wales' landscape is under the care of farmers, the argument is that they have a key role in tackling climate change.",
    "India has urged the US not to take a \"narrow view\" of its port agreement with Iran, a day after Washington warned that countries doing business deals with Tehran risked sanctions.\nOn Monday, India signed a 10-year deal with Iran to develop the strategically important Chabahar port.\nThe US said any country considering business deals with Iran \"needs to be aware of the potential risks\".\nBut Delhi has backed the move and said the agreement would benefit the region.\n\"I think it's a question of communicating, convincing and getting people to understand that this is actually for everyone's benefit. I don't think people should take a narrow view of it,\" Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told reporters on Tuesday. He was responding to a question about Washington's remarks on the deal.\nMr Jaishankar added that in the past, the US too had been \"appreciative of the fact that Chabahar has a larger relevance\" and that a long-term agreement with Iran was necessary to improve the port's operations. \n\"And the port operation, we believe, will benefit the entire region,\" he said.\nIndia first entered an agreement to develop the Chabahar port, which is close to Iran's border with Pakistan, in 2016. It took over operations at the end of 2018. \nThe port opened a transit route for Indian goods and products to Afghanistan and Central Asia, avoiding the land route through Pakistan - neighbours India and Pakistan share a tense relationship.\nSo far, 2.5m tonnes of wheat and 2,000 tonnes of pulses have been shipped from India to Afghanistan through Chabahar port, officials say.\nUnder the new deal, India is set to develop the port further by investing about $370 million in the project.\nThe country's shipping minister called it a \"historic moment in India-Iran ties\".\nBut US State Department Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel said on Tuesday in response to a question that Washington would continue to impose sanctions on Iran.\n\"Any entity, anyone considering business deals with Iran - they need to be aware of the potential risks that they are opening themselves up to and the potential risk of sanctions,\" Mr Patel added.\nA crucial ally of India, Washington has strained ties with Tehran. The country has imposed more than 600 sanctions against Iran-related entities over the past three years. ",
    "A woman accused of plotting to destroy electrical installations around Baltimore has pleaded guilty to conspiracy and firearms charges.\nSarah Clendaniel of Maryland was arrested last year along with Brandon Russell, founder of the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen.\nProsecutors say they plotted to blow up electricity substations, hoping to sow chaos and start a race war. \nClendaniel pleaded guilty in federal court on Tuesday.\nThe pair were first in contact while both were serving prison sentences and began discussing the plan after they were released. \nClendaniel, 36, described their plot as \"legendary\" and said the attack \"would completely destroy the whole city\".\nHowever, they also discussed their plans with an FBI informant, leading to their arrests.\nRussell, 28, founded Atomwaffen Division, which has been linked to several murders, bombings and plots in the United States and other countries.\nAlthough experts say it is relatively small, the group has become known for its extreme violence. Members subscribe to a neo-Nazi version of \"accelerationist\" philosophy - the idea that political goals can be achieved via social collapse.\nNeo-Nazi accelerationists believe that chaos will lead to racial war and eventually a fascist whites-only state will emerge. Investigators say they found a document belonging to Clendaniel that was apparently meant to be released publicly in the event of an attack, and which referenced mass murderers and Adolf Hitler.\nAtomwaffen or its offshoots have been banned in the UK, Canada and Australia.\nIn 2018, Russell was sentenced to prison after being convicted of explosives charges. Police found bomb-making equipment and guns while investigating the killing of two Atomwaffen members during an internal dispute. \nHe was released in 2021. Around the same time, Clendaniel was serving a prison sentence for armed robbery.  \nIn federal court on Tuesday, Clendaniel pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to damage an energy facility, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years, and illegal possession of a firearm, punishable by up to 15 years.\nIn a plea agreement prosecutors said they would recommend that she serve a maximum of 18 years, which must be approved by a judge.\nClendaniel's guilty plea opens up the possibility that she could testify against Russell, who is scheduled to go on trial in July.

That was the case yesterday morning,\" Mr Gomez said told a news briefing. \nFootage posted on social media and verified by the BBC shows a marked UN vehicle with multiple bullet holes outside the European Hospital.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had received a report from the UNDSS that said two of its workers were injured in the Rafah area - in southern Gaza - on Monday. \nThe IDF added that the incident was under review.\nIndia's mission to the UN in New York said its \"deepest condolences are with the family\" of Col Kale, who Indian media reports was a former member of the Indian army.\nUN secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he was \"deeply saddened\" to learn of the worker's death and sent his condolences to their family, his spokesman Farhan Haq said in a statement.\n\"The secretary-general condemns all attacks on UN personnel and calls for a full investigation,\" Mr Haq added.\nIn a separate statement, Mr Guterres said more than 190 UN staff had been killed in Gaza since the war began.\nWhile Col Kale is the first international casualty for the UN, six international aid workers and a Palestinian colleague from the international food charity World Central Kitchen were killed in an Israeli strike at the start of April.\nTheir deaths sparked an international outcry and the IDF sacked two senior officers over the incident which it described as a \"grave accident\".\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza with the stated aim of destroying Hamas - which controls Gaza - in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 35,090 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",
    "Obesity jabs could cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes in people even if they fail to lose much weight, according to an analysis of a study funded by a drug manufacturer.\nResearchers looked at semaglutide - a prescription drug offered by the NHS - that supresses appetite and is sold under the brand names Wegovy and Ozempic.\nThey said the weekly shots could also benefit the cardiovascular health of millions of adults.\nThe latest results are not in a journal yet but have been showcased at a conference.\nProf John Deanfield, who led the work, said semaglutide could have a positive impact on blood sugar, blood pressure or inflammation, as well as direct effects on the heart muscle and vessels.\nThe study, run by University College London (UCL) with 17,604 over-44s from 41 countries, had already shown heart benefits.\nNow, some data from the same Select trial, funded by Novo Nordisk, suggests there are benefits irrespective of a person's starting weight and how much they lose.\nSpeaking ahead of presenting the study at the European Congress on Obesity (ECO) in Italy, Prof Deanfield said the findings had \"important clinical implications\".\nHe said it was an important discovery - likening it to when cholesterol-fighting tablets called statins were introduced in the 1990s.\n\"We finally figured out that there was a drug class that would change the biology of this disease to benefit a lot of people. That was a major breakthrough and it's transformed cardiology practice.\u00a0 \n\"We now have this class of drugs which could equally transform many chronic diseases of ageing,\" he claimed.\nWegovy has the same ingredient as Ozempic - a diabetes medicine said to be Hollywood's \"skinny jab\" of choice.\nHowever, experts have previously warned it is not a quick fix or a replacement for eating well and exercising, and should only be offered under medical supervision.\nCommon side effects include nausea or an upset stomach, bloating and gas.\nAnd people may put weight back on once they stop the treatment, trials suggest.\nSemaglutide mimics the hormone GLP-1, which makes people feel fuller and less hungry.\nIt must be prescribed by a doctor - to  overweight or obese patients, who then inject themselves once a week, using pre-filled pens.\nThe analysis examined the amount of time before patients suffered major cardiovascular events - such as heart attack or stroke - or whether they developed heart failure.\nAfter 20 weeks on the drug, 62% of patients had lost more than 5% of their bodyweight compared with 10% in a placebo group.\nHowever, the risk reduction of heart attacks, stroke or heart failure was similar in patients who lost more than 5% of their bodyweight and in those who lost less than 5%, or gained weight.\nProf Deanfield said: \"Around half of the patients that I see in my cardiovascular practice have levels of weight equivalent to those in the Select trial and are likely to derive benefit.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Prof Deanfield said the drug has a \u201cpotentially important place\u201d in the treatment for obesity.\n\u201cThere are many people living overweight or with obesity, who have struggled to improve their weight, and these drugs, for that reason alone, produce an important clinical opportunity,\" he said. \n\u201cBut these are drugs that will also improve their background medical problems. That really is quite exciting.\"\nHowever, Prof Rameen Shakur, an expert in cardiovascular medicine at the University of Brighton, who was not involved in the research, said caution was needed. \n\"We are unclear on the mechanism and biological process by which semaglutide might reduce cardiac mortality per se.  \n\"I don\u2019t think it is commercially realistic to put whole populations on a medical therapy until you know how the biological system works.   \n\"Interestingly, there remains a risk of pancreatitis and some rare thyroid cancers which is often not stated and this should also be monitored during the course of patient use.\"",
    "All schools should have phone lockers so students are not distracted by social media apps, an MP has said.\nConservative MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge Miriam Cates urged the government to consider banning under 16s from social media and smartphones.\nShe told a Westminster Hall debate on Tuesday \"our kids are not OK\" with rising mental health issues.\nConstant notifications were \"causing extreme disruption in schools\", she added.\nMs Cates asked for the debate after she suggested banning children from accessing social media and smartphones.\n\"The number of suicides, self-harm, terrible mental health, all those things have increased in particular since 2014 when smartphones and social media became almost ubiquitous amongst children,\" she told BBC Radio Sheffield.\nData from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health found that since 2013 suicide rates had risen among males aged 10 to 14, and among females across all ages.\nHowever, over the past 15 years, the UK rate of suicide among 15 to 24-year-olds had gradually fallen, the data suggested.\n\"The average child has 237 notifications a day,\" Ms Cates said. \"That's destroying their concentration, so it's no surprise that this is causing extreme disruption in schools.\"\n\"What I'm pushing for, and a number of MPs are pushing for, is government to provide the funds to schools to purchase either phone lockers or phone pouches, which is how the successful schools have managed to do it.\"\nSome schools which had banned mobile phones had better GCSE results, Ms Cates added, referencing research from think tank The Policy Exchange.\n\"I think the trade off is enormous,\" she added.\nThe proposed ban for young people comes after the government's recent Online Safety Bill, which became law in October, that seeks to force tech firms to take more responsibility for the content on their platforms.\nThe new law puts the onus on firms to protect children from some legal but harmful material, with the regulator, Ofcom, being given extra enforcement powers.\nIt introduces new rules such as requiring pornography sites to stop children viewing content by checking ages.\nYou can find more help and support about themes raised in this report via the BBC Action Line.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

    "Between fights, friendships and fame, the life of a Real Housewife can be hectic.\nAnd with The Real Housewives of New York City currently filming season 15, viewers can expect to get a peek into the lives of the Big Apple's rich and famous.\nCurrent star Jessel Taank spoke to BBC Asian Network about her experiences of being the first South Asian cast member on the reality TV show.\n\"I did feel an immense amount of pressure. It's kind of like all eyes on you,\" she says.\n\"I just want to focus on being myself and representing what being Indian means to me.\"\nJessel says it didn't help that she felt misunderstood by her cast mates.\nHer grandparents were born in India, later emigrating to Kenya and then going to London - something she says \"was really confusing\" for others on the show.\n\"A lot of the cast mates didn't understand that,\" she says.\n\"They were confused as to why I was from Africa or assume that because I'm Indian, I grew up wealthy.\"\nJessel says recording the show can be stressful, thanks to the pressure to create drama for viewers.\n\"We are on a TV show and I think watching women be super-nice to each other isn't really entertaining, right? So you do have to turn the heat up.\n\"On my show we all have very strong personalities and there can be a massive clash, so there can be tension.\n\"But obviously we have to elevate and heighten that emotion for television,\" she says.\nWith Bravo's Real Housewives franchise being known for cliques and cat fights, Jessel says social media can be a scary place for the cast.\n\"People forget the show is just a snapshot of our lives,\" she says.\n\"For example, on the show I spoke about not coming from a wealthy background. And someone created a fake website that stated I went to one of the most elite girls' schools in London - which was an absolute lie.\"\nJessel points out that she's worked as a fashion publicist and brand consultant and now runs her own business - something which sets her apart from some previous cast members.\n\"I think the women that have been featured in some of the other Real Housewife shows do come from generational wealth or married into it, so they can be out of touch with reality.\n\"But for my show, one of the biggest things that producers wanted was women who are self-made with an exciting career path and an interesting background,\" she says.\nDespite feeling a sense of pressure as the only South Asian cast member, Jessel thinks it's an important step in the entertainment industry.\n\"I think the viewers really like the dynamic I have with my husband. Some people assume Indians are very reserved, but we're really open about our relationship.\"\nJessel says she and her family have received comments about some of the issues she's spoken about in the show.\n\"How I speak on reproduction and pregnancy struggles and those types of taboo topics that are not really shared publicly and within our community.\n\"I think a lot of Indian women are particularly afraid to talk about taboo topics openly.\n\"So the fact that I was doing it and doing it quite openly was hopefully refreshing and helped a lot of people,\" she says.\nListen to Ankur Desai's show on BBC Asian Network live from 15:00-18:00 Monday to Thursday - or listen back here.",
    "Farmers need to grow more fruit and vegetables to ensure the UK is not overly reliant on foreign imports, the government has warned.\nA new national food security index found that just 17% of fruit and 55% of vegetables consumed in the UK are grown here.\nNew funding for growers was announced at a Downing Street food supply summit.\nCritics say the \u00a380m scheme does not go far enough to support farmers hit by extreme weather and rising costs.\nTom Bradshaw, president of the National Farmers' Union (NFU), told the BBC that he did not think the measures announced would see the UK's food security improve in the short term as farmers deal with the impact of the wettest 18 months since 1836.\n\"We are not going to be in a better position in 12 months time because we know the very real challenges that are going on right across the country,\" he said.\nThe NFU has warned that many of its members fear they will go bankrupt before they receive the benefits of any extra funding.\nIt pointed to its recent survey of farmers' confidence that found 65% of those that replied said their profits were down or their business might go under.\nMr Bradshaw said the government needed to take \"critical steps\" to put farming back onto a much firmer footing.\n\"I think that what is missing is that today is more about the strategic long-term - it is not about putting the building blocks in place that rebuild that confidence immediately,\" he added.\nThe most recent statistics for the horticulture industry show that in 2022 the UK produced around 2.4m tonnes of vegetables and 652,000 tonnes of fruit, with a value of \u00a31.8bn and \u00a31bn respectively.\nBut it also imported \u00a32.7bn worth of vegetables and \u00a33.9bn worth of fruit.\nThe government released its new annual food security index, that covers all farming and food production sectors, on Tuesday. \nIt said that the index showed that generally the UK farming sector is at \"its most productive since records began\" and that domestic production of all food in the UK is at around 60% of consumption.\nBut it said that the UK fruit and vegetable sector is \"significantly lagging behind\" meat, dairy and grains. \nIt is now looking to \"turbocharge\" the UK's horticulture sector, including doubling public funding to \u00a380m - with \u00a310m given to orchard growers - in England.\nHelen Browning, chief executive of the Soil Association, gave a cautious welcome to the news.\nShe told the BBC: \"Many of us have been calling for more funding, more support for horticulture, for a very long time and so finally we are getting somewhere with this.\n\"Whether the money is going to be enough I don't know but we have to recognise that only 33% of adults and 12% of children eat their \"five a day\" so it's in the nation's interest that we support growing and consuming more British fruit and veg wherever we possible can.\"\nAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at retailers' association the British Retail Consortium, welcomed the support and said stores would increase the amount of UK produce they sold as more became available.\nMeanwhile, farmers of all types, across all parts of the UK, are still struggling with the impacts of the wet weather.\nIndustry body the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board has estimated that 15% less land will be planted with wheat this year, and an estimated 558,000 hectares of arable land will remain fallow, up from 311,000 hectares last year.\nLiz Webster, of the campaign group Save British Farming, told the BBC: \"It's an absolute disaster for the country going forward. \n\"There's going to be a massive straw shortage for next winter and there's going to be problems ahead with potato shortages and vegetable shortages.\"\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he would \"always back British farmers\" and that the new funding would see more food produced in the UK.\nBut Steve Reed, Labour's shadow environment secretary, said it was \"14 years of Tory failure\" that had left farmers \"at breaking point\".",
    "A driver has been arrested over a crash that killed eight people and left dozens injured on Tuesday morning, according to Florida Highway Patrol.\nBryan Maclean Howard, 41, faces eight counts of manslaughter while driving under the influence. \nPolice say he \"sideswiped\" a bus containing dozens of farmworkers with his 2001 Ford Ranger pickup truck. \nForty people have been taken to medical facilities, said the statement from investigators. \nFlorida officials said the bus was carrying around 53 farm workers on their way to Cannon Farms, which grows watermelons.\nThe accident happened in Dunnellon, roughly 45 miles (72km) south of Gainesville, at around 06:35 EST (11:35 BST).  \nThe crash involved a bus and a 2001 Ford Ranger vehicle, which \"collided in a sideswiped manner\", the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles said in a statement.\nThe bus veered through a fence and overturned, according to the statement. State troopers arrested Mr Howard. \nThe site of the accident, State Road 40 West, was temporarily closed.\nAerial footage showed the bus lying on its side, its front section nearly entirely removed and the metal frame crumpled. \nA spokesman for the Marion County Sheriff's office told reporters during a news briefing on Tuesday there had been \"30 plus ambulances on the scene\" helping victims.\nTraffic was particularly difficult at this time of year because of the increase in \"migrant workers that are in our county on buses just like this\", he added.\nMexican Foreign Minister Alicia B\u00e1rcena wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that some of the victims were Mexican nationals, though she did not give any further details. \nOfficials from the Mexican consulate in Orlando have been sent to assist them.\nMarion County Sheriff Billy Woods said the workers were \"hard-working individuals\" who were in the country legally. \"There's absolutely nothing wrong with them being here,\" he said.\nCannon Farms said on Facebook that it was closed on Tuesday \"out of respect to the losses and injuries\" in the crash.

She used to be a good little jumper until she stopped. That was when I thought I was too big for her and I stopped eating.\u201d\nSpeaking about her experience of hospital, Annie said: \u201cWhen I first got there I was on a tube and then I realised I am not going to get out.\n\"So, I had to eat so I could go home and be with my pony. That was the only reason why I was eating because of her.\u201d\nAnnie\u2019s mum Donna was told that because her daughter was so poorly there was nowhere local where she could be treated on the NHS, so they had to search across the country for a bed.\nShe said travelling more than two hours to see Annie once a week was hard.\n\"It affected our whole family. Our whole family dynamics changed,\" Donna said.\nNow discharged and on the road to recovery, Annie said being in hospital a long way from home was a lonely experience.\nShe said: \u201cEveryone else\u2019s parents came every night, but I only got to see mine once a week and that was quite hard because I was just sat there on my own\u201d.\nThe journey was \u201cjust too far\u201d for her mother to visit more often, Annie said.\nDonna has set up an eating disorder support group called Kick Rexi Out to help others who feel desperate and alone.\n\u201cThis time last year Annie wasn\u2019t good,\u201d Donna said. \u201cBut it just proves that getting the right help and the specialist treatment can bring your child back.\u201d\nThe government had pledged to end inappropriate out of area placements by the end of March 2021. But that has not happened.\nThe latest NHS data shows there has been a 15% rise in the number of days children in England are spending miles away from home in mental health hospitals in the past year.\nYorkshire and the North East along with London have seen the biggest increases from the year ended in April 2023.\nVariations in NHS data about inappropriate out of area placements may in part be because of changes in service provision or data quality limitations.\nThe Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP) is campaigning to end inappropriate out of area placements.\nDr Ashish Kumar, chair of the RCP's Eating Disorders Facility, said forcing children to travel hundreds of miles for treatment put their health at risk and was costly to the NHS.\n\u201cEating disorder services are stretched thin due to staff shortages and chronic underfunding,\u201d he added.\nThe eating disorder charity Beat has called on the government and NHS England to better fund and staff the service.\nTom Quinn, the charity's director of external affairs, said they must \u201ctake urgent action to improve recruitment and retention of staff to make sure eating disorder funding reaches the front line\".\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it was \u201cdetermined to support children with their mental health\u201d and was \u201cinvesting an additional \u00a32.3bn a year into NHS mental health services\u201d.\nThey added the government was increasing capacity at children and young people\u2019s community eating disorder services across the country.\nA spokesperson for NHS England North East and Yorkshire region said that they acknowledged more funding was still needed, and that they were \"focusing on stre",
    "Taylor Swift's Eras Tour will boost UK spending by almost \u00a31bn this year, with more than a million fans gearing up to see the pop sensation perform live, new data suggests.\nSpanning six continents, the tour will hit the UK for 15 dates in June and August, with fans expected to spend an average of \u00a3848 on tickets, travel, accommodation and outfits, according to Barclays.\nThe bank's report is the latest example of so-called \"Swiftonomics\" - highlighting the singer's economic influence.\nWhen tickets for the Eras Tour went on sale last year, it crashed websites and led to sold-out hotels in host cities around the world.\nHer concerts in the US city of Seattle generated seismic activity equivalent to a 2.3 magnitude earthquake.\nThe Shake It Off and Cruel Summer singer entered the Forbes rich list for the first time last month.\n\nMelissa Ruby went to the Seattle show of the Eras tour in 2023 with her daughter and said it was the \"most expensive concert ticket I have ever purchased\", with the ticket, outfits and merchandise costing $4,000. \n\"Never in my life have I seen my daughter happier\", she said, adding that she was doing it all over again for Taylor Swift's Vancouver shows in December - costing her double the Seattle show.\nThe report from Barclays combines hundreds of millions of customer transactions with consumer research on spending trends around the popstar.\nIt said the average amount spent on an Eras Tour ticket was \u00a3206, with 14% of fans spending more than \u00a3400 on perks, including VIP packages and exclusive merchandise.\nTravel costs will average \u00a3111 as many fans will be travelling to a different city for the event. Eras Tour performances will take place in Edinburgh, Liverpool, Cardiff and London.\nFans will also fork out an average of \u00a3121 on accommodation.\nEating out, new outfits and Taylor-Swift-themed afterparties are also set to contribute to an overall boost of \u00a3997m to the UK economy.\n\nHowever, as anticipation has been high for the event - Swift last toured the UK six years ago - many fans missed out on UK tickets.\nInstead, some may have gone to other European cities such as Paris to see her \"possibly due to ticket availability, cheaper travel and accommodation costs, or simply so that they can combine the concert with a holiday or city break\", Barclays said.\nDr Peter Brooks, chief behavioural scientist at Barclays, said: \u201cWhen it comes to cultural icons like Taylor Swift \u2013 like we saw with Elvis and Beatlemania in the 50s and 60s \u2013 supporters have such a strong connection to the artist and to the rest of the fandom that the desire to spend becomes even more powerful.\n\u201cFor non-fans, \u00a3848 may seem like an enormous amount to splash out on a concert, but for Eras Tour ticket-holders, every pound they spend is an investment in the memories they\u2019ll create.\u201d\n",
    "Clues hidden deep in the trunks of ancient trees have revealed that last summer was the northern hemisphere's hottest in 2,000 years.\nLast year had already been confirmed as the world's warmest on record by a large margin, at least since 1850, due to climate change.\nBut tree rings, which record temperature information far further back than even Victorian scientific records, now show just how unprecedented last year's scorching temperatures were.\nResearchers say that temperatures last June, July and August were nearly 4C warmer than the coldest summer two millennia ago.\nClimate scientists have repeatedly shown that global temperatures have been rising rapidly in recent decades. According to the UN's climate body, the last time the world was consistently this warm may have been more than 100,000 years ago.\nThese conclusions come from records like ice cores and deep sea sediments, which can give a good indication of the Earth's geological past, but cannot pinpoint individual years or even decades far back in time.\nFor this, tree rings are particularly valuable. They not only show the tree's age, but also record detailed information about the state of the climate each year as they grow. \n\"That is the beauty of tree ring records,\" Ulf B\u00fcntgen, professor of environmental systems analysis at the University of Cambridge and co-author of the study, told BBC News.\nScientists looked at living specimens as well as fossils, from the European Alps to the Russian Altai mountains. They focussed on trees living at altitude, where the impact of summer growth would be most clearly felt.\nIn such places rings are usually wider in warmer years, when there is more growth, and thinner in colder years. \nUsing the nine longest temperature-sensitive tree ring chronologies, researchers had built a picture of summer temperatures dating back two millennia for the northern part of the world, outside of the tropics.\nBy using such a large dataset - containing many thousands of trees in different parts of the hemisphere - the researchers can be more confident that their record represents how temperatures have changed, rather than more local disturbances like disease.\nThe authors combined the long-term tree ring record with modern temperature data. \nThey found that the summer of 2023 was 2.07C warmer than the \"pre-industrial\" period of 1850-1900.\nCompared with the coldest summer in the record, year 536, last summer was 3.93C warmer.\nLike many colder years, 536 was impacted by a large volcanic eruption which put more sulphur into the atmosphere, helping to cool the planet.\nVolcanic activity has also been linked to cooler periods such as the Little Antique Little Ice Age in the 6th Century and the Little Ice Age, which spanned roughly from 1350 to 1850.\nThe warmest summer in the tree ring reconstruction before industrial times was year 246, but the researchers say that even this does not come close to the recent warmth. \nEven taking account of the large uncertainties, the authors say summer 2023 surpassed this range of natural climate variability by 0.5C at the very least.\nResearchers say the tree ring information is a huge addition to what we know about our changing climate over history.\nEven in the 1850-1900 period, there were only 58 weather stations recording temperatures around the world, with 45 of them in Europe.\nThe consequence is temperatures during this period may actually have been overestimated, because of the way in which these measurements were taken.\nThe new study suggests this means that the world may have actually warmed around a quarter of a degree more than typically reported.\nWhile the researchers say that human activities are responsible for the vast majority of the 2023 summer warmth above pre-industrial levels, they also note that temperatures have been amplified by El Ni\u00f1o.\nThis naturally occurring climate pattern sees warm waters come to the surface of the Pacific and help push up air temperatures globally.\nEl Ni\u00f1o was first noted by South American fishermen in the 17th Century but tree ring data helps to show that it dates back much further in time.\nThe most recent El Ni\u00f1o episode helped make 2023 the warmest year on record, but because it has continued into the early part of 2024, it may also make 2024 a record warm 12 months.\nThe authors say the key conclusion from their work is the need for rapid reductions in emissions of planet-warming gases. \n\u201cThe longer we wait, the more expensive it will be and the more difficult it will be to mitigate or even stop that process and reverse it,\u201d said lead author, Prof Jan Esper from Johannes Gutenberg University, in Germany.\n\u201cThat is just so obvious,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe should do as much as possible, as soon as possible.\nThe new study has been published in the journal, Nature.",
    "A prominent far-right German politician has been found guilty of knowingly using a Nazi slogan in a speech.\nBj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, who leads the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in the state of Thuringia, was on trial for saying the words \"Everything for Germany!\" at a May 2021 rally. \nThe slogan is associated with the SA stormtroopers, who played a key role in the Nazis' rise to power.\nH\u00f6cke - a former history teacher - had denied knowing the phrase's roots.\nThe court in the eastern city of Halle convicted the 52-year-old of using symbols of a Nazi organisation and fined him \u20ac13,000 ($14,000; \u00a311,200). DW News reports that the money will go to a grassroots anti-extremism programme. \nHowever, H\u00f6cke escaped the maximum sentence of three years in prison and being barred from public office. He can appeal the verdict.\nDuring the trial, which started last month, H\u00f6cke had argued that he was \"completely innocent\". \nBut court spokesperson Adina Kessler-Jensch said judges were convinced that H\u00f6cke was aware of the ban. \nPresiding judge Jan Stengel told H\u00f6cke he was \"an articulate, intelligent man who knows what he is saying\", according to the German news agency DPA.\nAt the campaign event in the state of Saxony-Anhalt in May 2021, Mr H\u00f6cke ended a speech by saying: \"Everything for our homeland, everything for Saxony-Anhalt, everything for Germany!\"\nProsecutors say he knew the phrase was banned for being associated with the Nazi Sturmabteilung (SA). But he said it was a \"common saying\" which should not be criminalised.\nAt another rally in December 2023, he said: \"Everything for\u2026\", to which the audience responded: \"Germany!\"\nProsecutors had initially sought to try him for both incidents but the court in Halle decided to try him only for the 2021 rally.\nIn 2017 H\u00f6cke called the Holocaust memorial in Berlin a \"memorial of shame\". \nH\u00f6cke has led the AfD's regional branch in Thuringia since the party was founded in 2013.

    "Two French prison officers have been killed in an ambush on a prison van near Rouen in Normandy.\nPrisoner Mohamed Amra - known as \"The Fly\" - was being taken from court to a prison when a car rammed the prison van at a toll booth.\nGunmen then opened fire at prison officers, with two officers killed and two critically injured.\nSeveral hundred police officers and gendarmes have been deployed to carry out a manhunt.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron wrote on X that \"everything is being done to find the perpetrators\".\nProsecutors identified the inmate who was freed as Mohamed Amra, born in 1994.\nAmra was convicted of burglary on 10 May and had been indicted by prosecutors in Marseille for a kidnapping that led to a death.\nThe 30-year-old inmate is said to have ties to a gang in the southern city of Marseille, which has been plagued by drug-related gang violence. \nAt the time of the ambush which led to his escape he was being transported back to jail in the town of \u00c9vreux after attending a morning court hearing in Rouen. \nThe ambush took place around 11:00 (09:00 GMT) near a toll booth on the A154 motorway.\nThe officers were shot with \"heavy weapons\" by the prisoner's accomplices, according to French Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti.\nThe attackers escaped in a car which police believe they have now recovered, abandoned near the toll gate where the attack happened.\nRoadblocks have been set up across north-west France, with police following up on every tip-off.\nSpeaking to the media following a crisis unit meeting, Mr Dupond-Moretti confirmed that two officers had died.\n\"One leaves behind a wife and two children who were meant to celebrate their 21st birthday in two days. The other leaves a wife who is five months pregnant,\" he said.\n\"Everything - and I mean everything - will be put in place to find the perpetrators of this vile crime,\" Mr Dupond-Moretti said, adding that the perpetrators were \"people for whom life has no value\".\nThey would be found and punished \"in a way that is proportionate to the crime\", he said.",
    "A woman who fell ill after a severe allergic reaction said a lifeboat crew had to help her breathe because the hospital a few hundred yards away was closed.\nEilidh Beaton fell ill having been at a festival in Portree, Skye, on Saturday. \nShe said some of those who went to her aid \"banged\" on the locked door of the town's hospital to try and get assistance.\nThat night a 49-year-old woman died after taking unwell at the same festival, prompting Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes to call for an investigation into emergency medical provision in north Skye.\nMs Beaton said RNLI volunteers gave her oxygen from their boat, which was anchored in the nearby bay, until an ambulance arrived 45 minutes later. \nAt weekends, Portree Community Hospital is available for urgent care non-emergency care by appointment from 08:30 to 19:30. \nNHS Highland said emergency care was available by contacting 999, and the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) responded to Saturday's two incidents.\nThe health board said there were staff in the hospital caring for inpatients, and they had provided an oxygen mask to a member of the public as soon as they became aware of the request for one.\nIt said the hospital was locked for safety and security during out-of-hours and said overnight staff were not in a position to provide urgent care.\nA spokeswoman said NHS Highland would be liaising with SAS as part of its investigations of what happened at the weekend, and \"take forward any learning for both organisations.\"\nSix years ago, a review recommended there should be access to urgent care 24 hours a day, all week.

An ambulance was also called.\nMs Beaton said a passing coastguard vehicle was flagged down.\nThe coastguard volunteers contacted Portree lifeboat crew, who arrived with some medical equipment. One of the RNLI team was an advanced nursing practitioner (ANP).\nMs Beaton said: \"They needed equipment they didn't have, so one of the coastguard volunteers ran up to the hospital to get it.\n\"He was banging on the door and no-one was coming.\"\nOxygen was then retrieved from the RNLI crews' lifeboat, but the volunteers did not have the mask needed.\nMs Beaton said her partner then tried to get help at hospital, but again without success.\nShe claimed a mask eventually arrived from the hospital after a phone call was made by the ambulance crew sent to her aid.\nMs Beaton, who is among north Skye residents who have been campaigning for an upgrade in medical services, said the quick reactions of coastguard and RNLI volunteers saved her life.\nShe said: \"If none of them had been there, there's not much chance I would be here to be honest.\"\nMs Beaton said her situation showed there was a need for improved access to out-of-hours urgent care.\nShe said the community had been shocked by the death of the 49-year-old woman, who had been attending Skye Live.\nOn Monday, Ms Forbes said she was \"hugely concerned\" by reports that emergency access to Portree Community Hospital was limited on Saturday.\nShe said she had asked NHS Highland to investigate medical provision in north Skye, and had raised the weekend's incident with SAS and Health Secretary Neil Gray.\nNHS Highland said emergency services responded to Saturday's incidents.\nA spokeswoman said: \"The Scottish Ambulance Service responded to both incidents, with support from an off-duty ANP on site and a doctor from the Broadford Hospital accident and emergency department attended. \n\"For one of the incidents, an oxygen mask was secured from Portree hospital to support with the ongoing treatment. \n\"Due to patient confidentiality, it would be inappropriate for us to make further comment.\"\nThe Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) said all 999 calls were triaged to ensure it prioritised patients with life-threatening conditions.",
    "There is no widespread evidence a post-study visa for international students is  being \"abused\", a report says.\nThe Migration Advisory Committee said the visa attracted students to the UK and should remain. \nIf it were scrapped, universities would lose income from international students' fees and have to cut courses, the MAC said.\nThe government, which requested the review, said it was considering the findings and would respond \"in due course\".\nIt introduced tougher rules for international students this year which it said aimed to help \"slash migration\".\nUniversities are increasingly dependent on international students, who pay higher fees than those from the UK. \nThey are concerned further restrictions could put off applicants and leave universities without that funding.\nApplicants to the visa are not required to have a job or earn a particular salary to qualify for the visa, introduced in 2021 as part of a plan to recruit the \u201cbrightest and best\u201d students from around the world.\nLast year, 114,000 graduate-route visas were granted for international students and a further 30,000 for their dependants, the report said.\nProf Brian Bell, who chairs the MAC, told the BBC the visa attracted international students who wanted to earn back some of the money they have spent on fees or get work experience.\nHe said universities were underfunded and less income from international student fees would mean course closures for both international and domestic students.\nScience, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) subjects would \u201ctake most of the hit\u201d, he said, especially at \u201clower-ranked universities outside of London and the South East\u201d.\nProf Bell said the government\u2019s International Education Strategy, which included a target of 600,000 international students per year studying in the UK, \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to have had wide buy-in\u201d across government.\nHe said new rules limiting the number of dependants who can come to the UK seemed to be having a \u201cvery big effect\u201d on international student numbers.\nAsked whether there may be little incentive for the government to change the graduate route if numbers were already falling, Prof Bell said: \u201cThe hard work has already been done in some sense.\u201d\nHe did not know whether the government wanted to change the visa - but if so, it would have to \u201cwork out what to do about the funding of higher education\u201d.\nThe government has not said it is considering scrapping the visa but Home Secretary James Cleverly asked the MAC to review whether it was being \"abused\". \nThe MAC said there was no widespread evidence of this.\nMr Cleverly also asked the MAC to look at the types of job those on the graduate route go into, saying initial data suggested most of those who switched from the graduate visa to a skilled-worker visa went into care work, which was \u201cclearly not what the government intended\u201d.\nBut the MAC said that data was incorrect and about 20% went into care work. \nAbout half the first lot of students to receive graduate visas had moved on to skilled-work visas, \u201cprimarily into skilled roles\u201d.\n\nUniversities UK, which represents more than 140 institutions, welcomed the report and called on the government to confirm the visa would stay.\nIts chief executive, Vivienne Stern, said \"we understand the political pressure to reduce migration\" but recent restrictions had already had a \"significant effect\".\nInternational students can no longer bring family members with them unless they are on research courses or have government-funded scholarships which the report said would reduce the number coming to study in the UK this year.\n\"Going further would be a serious mistake,\" Ms Stern said.\nUniversity of Greenwich vice chancellor Prof Jane Harrington, who chairs the University Alliance, said the MAC was \"right to highlight the damage [the restrictions], and the freeze on home-student tuition fees, is doing to UK higher education\".\nThe report also said there was concern agents recruiting international students may be \u201cmis-selling UK higher education\u201d .\nOne interviewee told the MAC she had been \"led to believe\" she would be studying in a large city, only to find her university was in a remote location.\nThe MAC recommended recruitment agents should be registered and universities required to publish how much they spend on them.\nBut this was a \u201cseparate issue\u201d from the graduate route.\nDr Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group, said international students were \"critical to the financial sustainability\" of top universities and he supported \"targeted measures\" to address \"the behaviour of some agents\".\n\nThe prime minister thinks there is \u201cfurther to go\u201d to bring down legal migration numbers, according to Rishi Sunak's spokesman.\n\u201cBritish students should be the priority for our education system and universities -

    "More and more UK hospitals are leaving patients in corridors due to a lack of bed space. NHS bosses say so-called corridor care is freeing up ambulances and saving lives, but BBC Newsnight has spoken to patients who say the growing practice is humiliating and degrading.\nGregory Knowles counted 13 other patients alongside him on a corridor at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital (NNUH) in March. Complications after an operation put him back in hospital and on to a ward but at 04:00 one morning he was moved.\nThe 68-year-old was wheeled in his bed to reception. \"I was waking up with people around me. It was horrendous,\" he told the BBC. \n\"I had no screens and no facilities for water or for really getting changed. My possessions were on the bottom of the bed. My daughter and partner were as horrified as I was,\" he said.\nHis partner Alicia Goulty described how staff had been too rushed to attend to him.\n\"One day when we got there his catheter had leaked in the bed when he was on the corridor. He was wet with no covers or any screens and I had to take him to the bathroom to get him cleaned\".  \nMs Goulty said her partner's medication had been missed.\n\"We had to ask for water for him. We had to ask sometimes for his meals because he got forgotten.\" \nIt would be three days until there was room to move Mr Knowles from the corridor and back to a ward.\nAnother patient admitted to NNUH in March described being \"distraught\" when she was put in a corridor opposite a nursing station alongside three others.  \nA nurse at the hospital, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \"It's horrible for your patient to say to them, 'This is where I'm going to leave you'. You come into work to be a carer. You want to do it in the best way possible and sometimes you're coming into a situation where you can't do that.\"\nSince 2022, hospitals like NNUH have increasingly adopted a new way of working called the Continuous Flow Model, in which patients are sent from A&E to wards and other areas even if they are full.\nThey have done this to address soaring ambulance waits outside A&E as paramedics try to offload patients.\nIn the UK, the model started at the North Bristol NHS Trust and was then implemented at the 10 hospitals with the most delays, according to NHS board papers.\nThese documents indicate at least 36 hospitals have now adopted the system or a version of it. Some implementations involve \"drip-feeding\" patients from A&E. \nBut it often means hospitals will have to put patients on beds in corridors, albeit in a planned and risk-assessed manner. \nTrusts have adopted it reluctantly, they say, but it now allows ambulances to get to the sickest patients quicker.\nLesley Dwyer, NNUH chief executive, said demand for beds was forcing tough choices. \"We are committed to reducing ambulance delays outside our hospital, which we know is saving lives by improving 999 response times by freeing up ambulances quicker to get to patients in our community.\"\nBack in February, the interim chief executive of NNUH, Nick Hulme, said they had cut ambulance handover delays - but that it had come at a cost. \nHe said the risk had been moved from outside hospital into corridors but that it was \"better for the community\".\nProf Steve Hams says the Continuous Flow Model has \"without question\" saved lives. \nThe chief nursing officer at North Bristol NHS Trust points to a dramatic improvement in ambulance performance. \nThe trust pioneered the model during the summer 2022 heatwave amid a spike in admissions. It still struggles to discharge mostly elderly patients deemed fit to leave. \nProf Hams described how ambulance response times to heart attack and stroke patients had more than halved. Average hours lost to ambulance waits outside of A&E had plummeted from 139 hours a day to just six, he said. \nNewsnight was taken to a complex care ward at Bristol's Southmead Hospital. \nIn the corridor was a bed on stand-by but the trust ensures nobody spends the night there with just one such patient per ward. Screens are available to protect patient privacy. \nProf Hams adds what while the model works at his trust, it may not be right for others.\n\"Caring for people at the end of a corridor is something none of us aspire to do and it is certainly something we would not wish to do here. But on the balance of risk, the safety risk of both our patients and citizens in the community, it's the right thing for us to have done,\" he said.\nHowever, the Royal College of Nursing has criticised the model for just moving risk, rather than solving it. And the Royal College of Emergency Medicine warned the model was not a \"silver bullet\".\nDr Louella Vaughan, a medical researcher, said she had concerns about safety.\n\"If you look at the literature there is absolutely evidence that overcrowding on a ward increases mortality,\" she said, adding trusts were \"rushing\" to implement the model because it appeared to work.\n\"I know of places where an email was sent on a Thursday to say it was being put in",

She died the day after her operation.\nShannon's family say she was trying to lose weight so she could start a family with her partner.\nThe owner of a private clinic in Scotland has confirmed that Shannon enquired about a gastric band the week before she died, but was turned down because her weight was too low to meet the medical criteria.\nShe indicated that she was going to attend a sales day run by a Turkish hospital in Edinburgh that week.\nShannon was accepted for a gastric sleeve - a more invasive and permanent procedure \u2013 at a hospital in Turkey nine days later\nGill Baird, who runs Cosmedicare, said: \u201cI spoke to Shannon on the Wednesday and the following Friday she was on an operating table [in Turkey].\"\nShannon's family have backed calls from their local MP, John McNally, who says well-known hotel chains like Hilton, Holiday Inn, Maldron and Clayton are \u201clending credibility\u201d to Turkish companies, despite a rising number of fatalities.\nIn the past five years, 28 British people have died in Turkey after travelling there for elective medical procedures.\nTurkish companies host marketing events at UK hotels. Customers seeking surgeries such as weight-loss operations, cosmetic surgery and dental treatments can meet with surgeons and sales representatives.\nThe trips are often described as \"surgery holidays\".\nIn sales tactics which have been criticised by a leading bariatric surgeon, people can receive discounts for booking multiple operations or booking on the day.\nFalkirk MP John McNally described the sales days as \u201cpredatory\u201d and said they \u201cexploit the vulnerable\u201d.\nIn their first public statement since Shannon\u2019s death, her family and partner said: \u201cShannon was a wonderful individual who lit up the lives of all who knew her in her short life. \n\"She was so loved by her family. She was bright, witty, elegant and caring and all she wanted to do was to start a family of her own.\n\u201cWe wish to express our unreserved support for the campaign which seeks to end the practice of hotels and other commercial premises hosting promotional events for cut-price surgery abroad.\n\u201cWe would plead for the immediate cessation of the promotion of such events for commercial gain and to spare families the hurt, distress and emotional trauma we have suffered since Shannon\u2019s avoidable early death.\"\nThe family added: \u201cShannon\u2019s mother, a medical professional, was only allowed to see her unconscious daughter for a matter of minutes before she was locked out of the intensive care unit with no information on how matters were developing.\n\u201cShannon died needlessly as the result of a botched procedure in Turkey in April 2023. She was but one of the victims. Please don\u2019t let her life be in vain.\u201d\nSurgery in countries like Turkey costs a fraction of the price of private surgery in the UK and can be booked within weeks \u2013 in contrast to weight-loss surgery on the NHS, which has waiting lists of up to four years in some areas.\nA recent BBC investigation found that a Turkish surgeon at a hotel sales days in Glasgow accepted patients for surgery who did not meet the UK or international criteria for surgery.\nA surgeon for Ekol Hospitals was filmed in a Hilton hotel advising an undercover journalist to \u201ceat, eat, eat\u201d ahead of the operation. \nShe had claimed to have a weight that would put her in the overweight category, but which was still too low to meet medical guidelines for bariatric surgery.\nIn reality, the journalist\u2019s weight was in the healthy range.

    "The decision to build a new power station faces a legal challenge over its potential greenhouse gas emissions. \nEnvironmental consultant Dr Andrew Boswell has applied for a judicial review against the government's decision to approve a \"net zero\" gas power station in Teesside. \nHe said his calculations revealed the plant, which would use carbon capture technology, would produce far more greenhouse gas emissions than initially estimated. \nThe Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said it would be \"robustly defending\" the legal challenge, while the developers said they did not comment on legal proceedings. \nThe secretary of state for the DESNZ granted a development consent order (DCO), which is required for nationally significant infrastructure projects, to the plant in February.\nDevelopers Net Zero Teesside Power (NZT Power), a joint operation between BP and energy firm Equinor, claimed that at least 90% of the plant's generated emissions would be captured and funnelled into a storage site beneath the North Sea. \nBut Dr Boswell said his calculations revealed that the developers failed to consider emissions linked to the supply and and transport of gas, such as the release of methane. \n\u201cMethane is a powerful and deadly greenhouse gas, which, along with carbon dioxide, is driving global heating,\u201d said Dr Boswell.\nWhen these emissions were taken into account, the plant was not compatible with the UK's net zero commitments, he said. \nOver its lifetime, the plant would be responsible for more than 20 million tonnes of carbon emissions, Dr Boswell found. \nThis was compared with the 5.9 million tonnes calculated in the government's initial assessment, he said. \n\"Fitting the power plant with a carbon capture unit and calling it 'net zero', does not constitute a free pass for ignoring the significant impact of its overall emissions,\" said Dr Boswell. \nNZT Power previously said the project would help the government \"to meet its net zero targets by capturing significant CO2 emissions, while maintaining energy security through the supply of dispatchable low-carbon electricity to back-up renewables\".\nA DESNZ spokesperson said: \u201cCarbon capture and storage has been described as a necessity not an option for reaching net zero by the climate change committee.\n\u201cOur unprecedented commitment of up to \u00a320bn in carbon capture and storage will also drive economic growth and support up to 50,000 jobs in 2030 in our industrial heartlands.\"\nFollow BBC Tees on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Seafarers have told the BBC port officials routinely demand cash, cigarettes, food and drink as bribes before allowing ships through. \nSo-called \"gratuities\" are against international anti-corruption laws. But the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network said it received 5,183 reports in 2023.\nThe International Association of Ports and Harbours is working to tackle it.\nEx-captain Stephen Gudgeon said he was once held at gunpoint after refusing to hand over cigarettes at a port in Asia.\n\"They took me ashore at gunpoint and I was locked up. I was photographed and fingerprinted, and I was interviewed by two officials in an empty room with just a chair, which I was locked into,\" he told the BBC.\n\"And it was when they said to me, 'Would you like us to inform your family of your detention?' that I really got quite worried.\"\nMr Gudgeon said eventually he was released with a $1,500 (\u00a31,200) fine to pay for paperwork irregularities, which he believed were spurious and in retaliation for not handing over the cigarettes. The BBC has been unable to reach the ports authority in question to ask about the allegations.   \nThe MACN told the BBC it had received 61,000 reports in more than 1,000 ports across 150 countries since it opened an anonymous helpline in 2011.\nCecilia Muller Torbrand, the head of the MACN, said experiences as intimidating as Mr Gudgeon's were uncommon but that the shipping industry was \"quite exposed to corruption risks\", and that the number of incidents reported would be \"the tip of the iceberg\". \nShe said this was due to \"the combination of frequent government interaction, shipping across multiple jurisdictions and the time element of sailing in and out of ports\". \nMr Gudgeon added that some crew are too afraid to report incidents because they are on contracts and fear they will be blacklisted and unable to get another job. \nThe former captain, who sailed for more than 40 years before retiring in 2022 and who is on the council of the Nautilus International union and volunteers for the International Seafarers Welfare and Assistance Network, said crews met with bribery demands faced a difficult decision. \n\"If the company found out you'd done it, you could be in real trouble. They could discipline you for forgiving gratuities when they quite clearly state that you shouldn't be doing it. But if you want the ship to be able to enter and leave port smoothly, then often these things happen.\"    \nHe said he had witnessed officials whose demands for gratuities had been refused helping themselves to the ship's food provisions.    \nFilipino officer John Soria told the BBC that when the container ship he was sailing on came into port in Eastern Europe in 2018, inspectors came on board and tried to take a large 5kg block of cheese that was to last the crew of 17 half a month. \n\"He asked me, 'Is it possible to take this home?' I couldn't say no because he was already putting the cheese in the bag.\"   \nMr Soria said he called over the cook who negotiated to cut the cheese in half. \"Half is for the vessel, half for him - so we settled with that.\"   \nProf Helen Sampson, director of the Seafarers International Research Centre at Cardiff University, said: \"Sometimes when [crews have] had their provisions raided, they will sail and there won't be enough food left on board for everybody before the next port where they have a chance to resupply.\" \nGuy Platten is the secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping, which is made up of national ship-owning associations, collectively representing 80% of the world's merchant fleet. \nHe said he was aware that bribery demands were \"very distressing for seafarers\". \n\"What we would encourage them to do is contact their company if they're getting these demands, and then the company can take it from there and can explain that there is not going to be any payment,\" he said. \n\"We try and make sure that we act as one and progress is being made, but obviously it still happens.\"\nThe MACN told the BBC it was working with governments in nine countries to tackle corrupt officials, but conceded there was still much to do.\nMs Muller Torbrand said the only way it could be stopped was if a majority of companies took a zero-tolerance approach.  \n\"[Captains] should not [say], 'You need to do whatever it takes to get the vessel out.' No, we challenge these practices as an industry.\"  \nShe said the MACN was working to help companies understand the risks, have better articulated policies and better internal escalation channels. \nThe International Association of Ports and Harbours said it was working in partnership with the MACN.  \nIn a statement, it said: \"Ports and their communities are endeavouring to work with their key stakeholders.\n\"Tangible progress has been made in places such as the Gulf of Suez, the Indian subcontinent and in African countries such as Nigeria, as well as in South America such as Argentina.\n\"This work alone is not enough as corruption in and around ports concerns many s",

Why is that important?'\"\nHe also managed to catch the GAA Ulster Final between Donegal and Armagh on Sunday. \n\"I think sport has a really big role to play in our lives,\" he said.\n\"The way people get involved with GAA \u2013 I love it, the passion it\u2019s played with.\"\nMallett has enjoyed cycling in Northern Ireland and hopes to return to continue exploring its \"great cycleways\" - although he concedes that \"it's also got some shockers\".\n\"It leads to wanting to explore more,\" he said. \"But the time has come to head home. \n\"My team Oxford United are at Wembley Stadium on Saturday so I\u2019ve got to go home for that. But I would like to come back and explore more. I don\u2019t know when that will be, I just know it will happen.\n\"Thank you to the good people of the North - you really have made this journey so enjoyable.\"",
    "The dimension of Russia\u2019s invasion is dramatically changing in its favour.\nFor almost 18 months, the front lines have been in a state of relative stalemate, with occasional, modest Russian gains.\nBut in the space of a week, overstretched Ukrainian troops are struggling to contain the most significant ground offensive since 2022 in the north-eastern Kharkiv region.\n\"Help is on the way,\" is the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken\u2019s message on a surprise visit to Kyiv. He comes during a perilous period for Ukraine.\nDiplomatic visits by the country\u2019s biggest military backer are not to be dismissed. The handshakes, working lunches and walkabouts typically bear fruit.\nThe approval of a $61bn military aid package in Washington is the biggest, juiciest one yet. But a month on, a fraction of it has arrived.\nUS officials stress some of the air defence systems, artillery and missiles are already in the eager hands of Ukrainian soldiers. Mr Blinken claimed, \"they will make the difference on the battlefield\".\nPerhaps those words would have carried more weight five days ago, when Ukrainian forces were just about hanging on across the 1,000km front line.\nNow, they\u2019re moving what few reserve troops they can to the Kharkiv region, where an estimated 30,000 Russian soldiers are continuing to advance from across the border.\nThey\u2019ve taken at least 50 square miles (130 sq km) of once-liberated territory, in yet another cruel twist for this embattled province.\nRussia threw the kitchen sink at it in 2022, and it appears to be gearing up to do the same again.\n\"Moscow\u2019s tactics remain unchanged\", Andriy Zadubinnyi, a Ukrainian military spokesman, tells the BBC.\n\"They cover Ukrainian soldiers with artillery fire and air strikes. Then, they split into small groups and begin to attack.\"\nRussia\u2019s goal of conquering Ukraine hasn\u2019t changed, but the latter\u2019s ability to fight back has.\nIn September 2022 a Ukrainian minister who could barely contain his delight was telling me: \"We have so many prisoners of war now!\"\nHis forces had outsmarted and outmanoeuvred their Russian occupiers by liberating more than 2,000 sq km (770 square miles) in the Kharkiv region.\nCities like Kupiansk and Izium were back under Ukraine\u2019s control once more.\nAfter a summer of grinding losses for Kyiv, it was a change in momentum no one had predicted.\nThe country had the wind in its sails, and grounds to believe it could win this war.\nA year and a half later, that optimism which filled Kyiv\u2019s corridors of power has gone. Events in Kharkiv are threatening to derail any hopes of liberation.\nThose same eastern cities are at risk of falling once more, and thousands are fleeing their homes under constant bombardment.\nThere\u2019s no doubt the delay of American military aid has played a role in Ukraine\u2019s struggles to contain Russia\u2019s growing dominance.\nBut so too have mobilisation issues and, in the case of the Kharkiv region, questionable defences and fortifications.\nEvacuations are also planned for 115 settlements in the Sumy region further north. Local commanders are anticipating a Russian offensive there too.\nIt\u2019s why Kyiv\u2019s goal, for now, is simply to stabilise the front line. Although, what\u2019s happening on this new front line means it\u2019s likely to get worse before it gets better.",
    "There will be a new top dog on Tuesday night when the Best in Show trophy is awarded at the 2024 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.  \nOver 2,500 dogs from all 50 US states competed this year to take the prestigious title.  \nTuesday's judging follows the selection of seven semi-finalists from different breed groups.  \nThe ultimate winner will be announced on Tuesday night in Flushing, New York, outside Manhattan.  \nThe Westminster Kennel Club is America's oldest organisation dedicated to showing dogs. The show is the second-longest continuously held sporting event in the US after the Kentucky Derby. \nThis year marks the 148th annual show. It has been broadcast on television since 1948, and this year airs on FOX, FS1 and FS2, and can be streamed at FOXSports.com or the FOX Sports app.  \nThe breeds with the largest number of entries this year are chihuahuas, Labrador retrievers, golden retrievers, vizslas, dachshunds, French bulldogs, Australian shepherds and Rhodesian ridgebacks.  \nDogs entered the competition from all across the United States, with the most entries coming from Florida, New York, California, Pennsylvania and Texas.  \nIn the preliminary rounds, dogs compete against others of the same breed before moving on to the next round where they are judged in seven groups. \nIn the final round, which ends with the crowning of Best in Show, the winner from each of the seven groups goes head-to-head in the ring.  \nJudges determine winners using a written description of the ideal breed, according to the Westminster Kennel Club. Winners are selected based on how well a dog fits the standard as well as how they perform that day.  \nTwo dogs who were semi-finalists last year are competing again in the 2024 contest. Trouble, an American Staffordshire terrier, won first place in the terrier group and Monty, a giant schnauzer, won in the Working Group last year. \nThere are no cash prizes, but the winner does receive bragging rights and a trophy. For certain categories, like in agility and obedience, winners can direct a $5,000 Westminster donation to a training club of their choosing or to the American Kennel Club Humane Fund.\nHere are this year's winners so far, vying for Best in Show Tuesday night. The remaining groups - Sporting, Working and Terrier - will be judged during the day on Tuesday:  ",
    "\"For Indians, spices are like paints in a paint box\", says Indian actor-turned-food writer Madhur Jaffrey. \"We get different shades from the same spice by doing something to the spice.\" \nIn other words, you can roast the spices or grind them into powders. The diversity of their flavours is mind-boggling. Indian spices enhance pickles and season meat. They flavour savouries and street food. Zesty spices energise local fruit drinks and add a tangy twist to fruits and salads.\nUnsurprisingly, India has emerged as a global spice powerhouse. It exports more than 200 spices and value-added products to some 180 countries, worth $4bn (\u00a33.1bn), according to the Spices Board of India. The domestic market alone is worth a staggering $10bn, making it the world's largest consumer of spices.\nBut now, concerns are emerging regarding the safety of these renowned spices. Last month, Singapore and Hong Kong halted sales of some spices produced by Indian companies MDH and Everest over suspected elevated levels of ethylene oxide, a cancer-causing pesticide. \nThat's not all. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is also investigating products from the two popular brands for potentially containing the pesticide, an FDA spokesperson told Reuters. An analysis done by the news agency of the US regulatory data found that since 2021, an average of 14.5% of US shipments of MDH spices were rejected due to presence of bacteria. Both brands insist that their products are safe.\nThe European Union (EU) has raised concerns of its own, discovering the same cancer-causing substance in samples of chilli peppers and peppercorns from India. Reports say that the Maldives, Bangladesh and Australian food regulators have also launched investigations. \n(Source: Spices Board, Global Trade Research Initiative)\nClearly, it is a disturbing development. For one, both the brands are popular and trusted ones. Delhi-based MDH, an iconic 105-year-old family-run firm, offers a range of more than 60 blended and ground spices. The 57-year-old Everest Food Products, launched by a spice trader, claims to be India's \"largest manufacturer of pure and blended spices\", exporting to over 80 countries. Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan, Bollywood superstars, have served as Everest's brand ambassadors.\nTo be sure, this is not the first time Indian spices have been found to be contaminated. In 2014, Ipsita Mazumdar, a biochemistry expert, tested popular spice brands in Kolkata which made chilli, cumin, curry powder, and garam masala. She found lead in the food colouring used to give the spices vibrant orange or red hues. And more recently in April, food and drugs control authorities in Gujarat seized more than 60,000kg of adulterated spices - chilli powder, turmeric and coriander power and pickle masala. \nSo are Indian spices safe? The federal government has instructed all state governments to conduct quality tests. The Spices Board - which has five quality evaluation labs - has issued guidelines to exporters to check for use of ethylene oxide. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is also testing samples. \nIndia's health ministry claims the country has one of the world's strictest Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) standards, with pesticides' MRLs varying by food commodity and determined through rigorous risk assessments. But something is clearly amiss: in 2022, the FDA highlighted inadequate sanitary facilities, accommodation, and equipment cleanliness standards at a premier Indian spice plant.\n\"India has been a spice exporter for centuries. But this image has been declining in the last few years, with the government's inadequate attention. We do not yet know at which stage the contamination is happening. Ethylene oxide is not used by farmers. It is most probably a post-harvest, post-processing residue,\" says Narasimha Reddy Donthi, an independent researcher and environmental justice activist.\n\"It is not only the negative attention. Repeated cases of excessive residues can have a long-term effect. In the past, mango exports to the US suffered for years due to pesticide residues,\" Mr Reddy adds.\nDelhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) believes the recent quality concerns could threaten half of India's spice exports due to \"cascading regulatory actions in many countries\".\nIf China questions the quality of Indian spices, over half of India's global exports could be affected, joining five other countries, the GTRI said in a recent report. \"The situation could worsen if the EU, which regularly rejects Indian spice consignments over quality issues, follows suits.\" \nFor spice enthusiasts in the West, the origin of the spices in their food remains unclear.\n\"I don't think most people are aware of where their spices come from. I certainly don't, and I use spices a lot! I live a few blocks from Chicago's main Indian shopping district, Devon Avenue, which is where I buy my spice. l assume they come from India but have never looked into this",
    "A victim of a paedophile told a court their abuser had \"deprived them of their childhood and ultimately the person they should have become\".\nRaymond Hawthorne, 60, was jailed for 27 years, with an extended eight-year licence, at Liverpool Crown Court.\nA jury had earlier found him guilty of 14 child sex offences, including two counts of rape, 10 of indecent assault and two of indecency with a child.\nThe abuse took place in Wirral in the 1980s and 1990s.\nThe court heard Hawthorne won the trust of the young boys by buying them gifts before sexually assaulting them. \nDuring the sentencing hearing, one of his victims said in a statement: \"For as long as I can remember I have lived a life of fear. \n\"The fear of Ray, of being in trouble if anyone knew what was going on. \n\"I had feelings of embarrassment, guilt, remorse. I was so young, and I questioned if any of it was my fault or not.\"\nThe man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said he believed the trauma of his childhood contributed to the breakdown of a 10-year relationship. \nHe said: \"She did everything to help me, she loved me a lot, and because I couldn\u2019t function as a normal person, I let her and my daughter down. \n\"The relationship broke down because I couldn\u2019t show empathy and I didn\u2019t have the ability to relate my feelings which I put down to the trauma of my childhood. \n\"I deeply regret what I put them through and wish I had dealt with things differently.\"\nHawthorne must serve at least two thirds of his custodial sentence behind bars before being assessed by a Parole Board. \nDet Con Lauren Blackmore, from Merseyside Police's Rape and Serious Sexual Offences team, described Hawthorne as \"utterly depraved\". \n\"As you can imagine for victims of such an appalling crime, the impact on them is significant and long-lasting\", she said. \n\"I hope this sentence provides some comfort in knowing they did the right thing by reporting his heinous crime to us.\u201d\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "The RNLI's first \"Legacy Lifeboat\" has been left languishing in a marina eight months after its delivery because berth facilities for it are not up to scratch, a former coxswain has said.\nThe \"George and Frances Phelon\" - a Shannon-class vessel at Great Yarmouth and Gorleston Lifeboat station, was named after a couple who bequeathed \u00a33m to the charity.\nIt was delivered to the Norfolk station in September 2023, but the RNLI said the delay to entering service was caused by the need to upgrade mooring facilities in the area.\nFormer coxswain Paddy Lee, who served with the local lifeboat for 39 years, said the crew had been \"given the carrot and it's been taken away from them\".\nThe Phelons, who lived in Bradford, West Yorkshire, left \u00a33m to the lifeboat charity but had not stipulated where their legacy should be spent.\nThe vessel was dedicated to them in a naming ceremony in Poole, Dorset in April 2022.\nIt was stored at RNLI headquarters for 18 months before its delivery to the East coast last September.\nSimon Lush, a nephew of the Phelons, told the BBC his late uncle would have been disappointed the lifeboat was not available to save lives at sea.\n\"It is being left, mothballed I believe, until they can get the facilities sorted so they can bring the boat into operation,\" he said.\n\"You have to beg the question why it went up there. You really do wonder if the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing.\n\"They had two years to get the facilities in order and that's what I want to get to the bottom of, as to why it has taken so long to get those facilities made good for that boat to become operational from Great Yarmouth.\"\nMr Lee said the Norfolk crew had been left \"upset and demotivated\" by the situation.\n\"It's unbelievable. I know how dedicated that bunch of guys and girls are, I feel so sorry for the way they've been treated by the Institution,\" he said.\n\"They've been given the carrot and it's been taken away from them.\"\nHe added: \"What's it doing? It's a lifeboat sat there not doing lifesaving work. \u00a32.5m. It's disgusting; absolutely disgraceful.\n\"How would you feel putting \u00a32.5m down for a lifeboat to be in service at a station that is never going to be for the foreseeable future.\n\"They didn't listen many years ago to the crew and the former lifeboat operations manager, that the berth is too dangerous.\"\nMr Lee claimed the lifeboat was held in Dorset for 18 months after its naming ceremony because of safety issues with mooring. \n\"When you get a south or south-easterly and the tide and the wind comes round the pier heads and creates the waves, then the boat is like it's at sea - and rocking around,\" he said.\n\"The only means of boarding the lifeboat is by a fixed drawbridge. \n\"As you can imagine a drawbridge coming down slowly onto a boat that's bucking around like a bronco, there's where your danger is, because it's unsafe.\"\nMr Lush said he had been told there were technical issues with the boat.\nThe BBC learned that the all-weather lifeboat mooring at Great Yarmouth has now been condemned and a minibus is used to transport crew to a temporary mooring further up river.\nThe RNLI said in a statement that it had carried out work at Gorleston Lifeboat station and would continue to endeavour to get the lifeboat operational.\nIn a BBC interview in March, outgoing chief executive Mark Dowie said: \"We're working with Peel Ports and some other local agencies to make sure the lifeboat can be housed safely and used effectively.\n\"That work has not been finalised as yet... when it is, the boat will go on service.\n\"It's quite a complex puzzle but we are working very closely with Peel Ports and other local agencies to make that happen.\"\nFollow Norfolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Down an unassuming street in south London the man who could be prime minister within months met leaders of some of the country\u2019s biggest trade unions.\nAt Labour\u2019s new headquarters in Southwark they were thrashing out what the party would say it would do about conditions at work and the rights of workers if it won the general election.\nIt gets right to the heart of one of the most important dynamics an incoming Labour government would juggle: its relationship with business and its relationship with, well, labour \u2013 i.e workers.\nFor a party born out of the unions, seeking office in a world where union influence is shrunken, there is a dilemma and it involves trade-offs.\nA desire to be true to its heritage but a desire too to win and to win over recent Tory voters among whom there may be few union members and even suspicion of their influence.\nSo, will Labour ban zero-hours contracts? What about companies firing and then rehiring? What about the right to switch off, and not be hassled by a boss when you\u2019re not at work?\nBack in 2021, which in political terms feels like just after the last Ice Age, Labour published what it called A New Deal For Working People. It was - it still is - described as a Green Paper, which is Westminster speak for a consultation document, the start of a conversation.\n\nIt promised to ban zero-hours contracts. It promised \u201call workers, regardless of sector, wage, or contract type, will be afforded the same basic rights and protections. \n\"This included - and still does - rights to sick pay, holiday pay, parental leave, protection against unfair dismissal and many others.\u201d\nIt promised \u201cfrom day one, a Labour government will strengthen workers' rights and make Britain work for working for people\u201d.\nFast-forward to last summer, when there had been some back-pedalling.\nOn timing, on practicalities, on specifics.\nSome union figures fear yet more back-pedalling still. They thought the party was going wobbly.\nThey thought businesses had managed to lobby them into watering the whole thing down and, a bit like Labour's about turn in February on green investment, things could end up getting ditched.\nA leak to the Financial Times spread the jitters further.\nThis is the backdrop to the leaders of the 11 trade unions affiliated to the Labour Party turning up at party headquarters to meet Sir Keir Starmer.\nThe occasion was a gathering of the Trade Union and Labour Party Liaison Organisation or TULO \u2013 which does exactly what it says in its title.\nBut the subject matter was high stakes. General secretaries rearranged their diaries to make sure they were there.\nThey were on the premises for around five hours, meeting Sir Keir and other senior party figures for around an hour.\nAfterwards, an intriguing joint statement from Labour and TULO which said: \"Labour and the affiliated unions had a constructive discussion today. \n\"Together we have reiterated Labour's full commitment to the New Deal for Working People, as agreed in July. We will continue to work together at pace on how a Labour government would implement it in legislation.\"\nUnion leaders think this amounts to a retreat from any further tinkering to the plans last altered last summer.\nBut it appears telling they are meeting again in three weeks' time and unions are yet to see \"words on a page\" as one figure put it to me.\nAnd neither have we, the wider public.\nI understand the meeting was told Labour would introduce an Employment Rights Bill within about three months of winning the election and this would make it illegal for companies to fire their workers only to rehire them on worse pay and conditions.\nThere would be an exemption if the employer was about to go under.\nSo there is a get-out clause and it won\u2019t happen instantaneously (which was never likely, but the language of the past suggested it would).\nThe outright ban on zero-hours contracts has gone. Instead the party wants to ban what it calls \u201cexploitative\u201d zero-hours contracts.\nThe idea is some people like zero-hours contracts but those who don\u2019t must be offered a contract equivalent to the average hours worked per week over a 12-week period.\nAnd creating a \u201csingle status of worker\u201d as initially suggested three years ago, which would mean all workers could be afforded the same basic rights, is actually quite complicated and will need in-depth discussions and consultation that, the party thinks, can only begin once it is in government.\nSo that is not likely to happen quickly.\nAdd to that the conventional expectation, again not fleshed out in the original proposal, that big ideas leading to changes in the law almost always begin with a consultation period of around three months, not least to minimise the likelihood of later legal challenges.\nBut all of this adds to a sense of delay, which spooked some union leaders.\nAnd so the conversation continues.\nNot just a conversation with trade union leaders but employers too \u2013 as the wider public watches, listens and forms judgements, as judgement day fo",
    "\"Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A-minor.\"\nWith every second Kendrick Lamar holds on to the last letter of \"minor\" in Not Like Us, the inflammatory song about his fellow rapper Drake, his raspy vocals reverberate through hip-hop and popular culture.\nIt's an explosive allegation, made without evidence, that calls into question Drake's conduct with young women - an allegation now heard around the world. Drake, one of the world's biggest artists, vehemently denies it.\n\u202fSince its release on 4 May, Not Like Us has been dissected on social media,\u202fplayed at NBA basketball games and boomed from DJ booths\u202fat parties from London to Los Angeles; New York to Atlanta, piercing the public consciousness.\u202f\nAnd it is only one of nine songs that make up a mind-boggling, escalating conflict between two modern rap titans, involving unevidenced accusations of domestic violence, secret children and paedophilia - all denied.\nThis is a cold war that has simmered over the last decade finally boiling to the surface.\u202f\n\"I think we've all expected this to happen at some point,\" says Minou Itseli, also known as Mimi The Music Blogger, a journalist and content creator. \"They've been sending indirect shots to each other in their music a lot more than we first thought. But no one could have seen the beef go this far.\"\nBoth men have been praised and criticised during the feud, and fans of both have proclaimed their favourite the winner.\nBut who - if either - has come out of this looking good? \nYou'd be forgiven for blinking and missing some of the detail, given how fast this confrontation has moved.  \nIt began with Lamar's verse on Like That, by rappers Future and Metro Boomin. Drake responded with Push Ups, belittling Lamar's achievements and status as a rap legend.\u202fThat track currently sits on more than 70 million streams on Spotify. \nDoubling down, Drake's controversial Taylor Made Freestyle utilised AI-generated voices of two of Lamar's heroes - Snoop Dogg and the late, great, Tupac Shakur - to goad him into a reply.\nDrake also claimed Lamar wasn't replying to his taunts for fear of interrupting the release of Taylor Swift's new album. Drake raps: \"Taylor Swift is your new top\" - meaning Lamar's boss - \"and if you boutta drop, she gotta approve.\" \nThe message was clear. Drake doesn't respect Lamar, who is considered one of the greatest rappers of his generation, and was ready to take him down a peg.\nJoseph \"JP\" Patterson, editor-in-chief of Complex UK and founder of TRENCH magazine tells the BBC: \"I might be the only person on this planet with this viewpoint, but Taylor Made Freestyle was pretty dope. I get the rap purist's dismay around him using AI verses but even down to the beat, I was feeling it.\"\nAnd then, fans waited with bated breath anticipating the next move.\u202fThose on social media felt Lamar wasn't up for the fight, given he had yet to respond.\nHis rebuttal was Euphoria, a track questioning Drake's parenting skills, rumours that he'd had plastic surgery and his use of AI.\nLines as straightforward as: \"I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress\" resonated with fans because of Lamar's heated delivery, highlighting everything - and he means everything - he dislikes about Drake.\nIt was so impactful that Euphoria was used in an official TikTok video for US President Joe Biden's election campaign against Donald Trump.  \nItseli believes this track perfectly sums up Lamar's stance: \"It's a summary of everything he wanted to say to Drake,\" she shares. \"If anyone wants a short recap of Kendrick's side, you'll find everything in Euphoria.\"\nLamar's 6:16 In LA followed, where he muses: \"Have you ever thought that OVO [Drake's record label] was working for me? / Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it.\" He threatens to shine a forensic light on Drake's character to bring his reputation into disrepute, with help from inside Drake's own label.\nItseli says that Lamar was playing perfectly to his audience throughout the back-and-forth. \"Kendrick knew what to bring to the table and went for the kill. He studied Drake's behaviour and catered his songs to every audience. He gave us wordplay, a club hit, conceptual songs. Drake couldn't really compete.\" \nAnd with this one-two punch from Lamar, fans feared the walls were closing in on Drake. But the Canadian rapper went nuclear in response.  \nFamily Matters attacks Lamar's family unit, claiming his son is the biological child of Lamar's creative partner, Dave Free, and that he has been physically abusive to his wife, Whitney Alford.\nDrake sings: \"When you put your hands on your girl, Is it self-defence 'cause she's bigger than you?\" referencing the height difference between Lamar and his wife.\nLamar has denied these claims,\u202fbut the beef had now entered a new realm - one uncomfortable for many observers.\nIn a culture that prides itself on the boundless nature of lyrical battle, where anything can be said about your opponent, some of t",
    "Beach Boys star Mike Love has said he hopes his cousin Brian Wilson will still be able to make music with the band after he was placed under a conservatorship.\nA judge last week granted the conservatorship \u2013 to oversee Wilson\u2019s personal and medical affairs \u2013 due to ill health.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Love said Wilson, 81, had good long-term memory and still had his \u201cmusical abilities\u201d but needed help with \u201cmedical supervision and care\u201d.\nLove was speaking ahead of a new Disney documentary about the band which begins on 24 May.\nCourt documents obtained by several US media outlets earlier this year said Wilson was suffering from a \"neurocognitive disorder\" similar to dementia. \nLove told Today's Nicola Stanbridge: \u201cWe got together at Paradise Cove (in Los Angeles) at the end of the documentary.\n\"He was remembering things I\u2019d forgotten about our high school days. His long-term memory is right there. \n\"His musical abilities, as long as he\u2019s alive he\u2019ll have those, but he does need medical supervision and care. His wife did take care of that.\u201d \nThe move to apply for a conservatorship came after Wilson's wife of 28 years, Melinda, died in January.\nThe family said their decision had been taken after \"careful consideration and consultation\" with Wilson, his doctors, his seven children and his housekeeper. \nOn Thursday, a judge appointed two long-time Wilson representatives, publicist Jean Sievers and manager LeeAnn Hard, as his conservators.\nLove told Radio 4: \u201cHe (Wilson) knows that he needs the help but we\u2019re still able to get together and we\u2018re going to see each other soon.\n\"It\u2019s not so negative as it sounds. As long as he\u2019s cared for properly. He\u2019s seeing his children\u2026 he\u2019s being well taken care of.\u201d\nBruce Johnston, another Beach Boys member, said he felt the documentary was like \"a new beginning\".\nHe added: \"I think once Brian and Mike sit round the piano and just the magic, you can\u2019t stop it\u201d.\nLove said they hadn\u2019t had a chance to collaborate yet but \u201cit\u2019s a brand new day now and I\u2019m hoping we can do something together - all of us - and it\u2019ll be great\u201d.\nWilson is the co-founder and chief songwriter for the Beach Boys who emerged as part of the surf-rock boom in 1961 and built their reputation on sophisticated melodies and complex vocal harmonies.\nAfter hits like Surfin' USA, I Get Around and California Girls, the emergence of The Beatles prompted Wilson to steer the band in a more experimental, psychedelic direction.\nHis magnum opus was 1966's Pet Sounds - widely considered one of the all-time greatest rock albums.\nBut his escalating drug use, combined with the pressure to keep creating ever more elaborate songs, led to a nervous breakdown and he began to withdraw from touring and public life.\nWilson was placed under a conservatorship once before, in the early 1990s, because his family fought to separate him from controversial psychologist Eugene Landy who they said exerted \"undue influence\" over his life, music and finances.\nThe case was triggered by the re-drafting of Wilson's will in 1989 in which Landy was named as chief beneficiary, standing to inherit up to 70% of his estate.\nBy 1992, the Superior Court of Santa Monica had ruled that Landy must remove himself from Wilson's life.\nThe court also appointed an independent conservator with \"specific and limited powers over the artist's affairs\".\nMelinda was supposedly one of the chief instigators of that court case.\nAfter her death last month Wilson said on his website: \"We are lost. Melinda was more than my wife - she was my saviour.\"\nThe couple married in 1995 and adopted their children Dakota Rose, Daria Rose, Delanie Rose, Dylan and Dash together.\nWilson also has two daughters, Carnie and Wendy, from his first marriage.",
    "Residents of an area of Cardiff rocked by riots last year have said it needs more investment to help young people and challenge misconceptions.\nDisorder in Ely in May 2023 followed speculation that Kyrees Sullivan, 16, and Harvey Evans, 15, were chased by police before they died in a crash.\nThe aftermath of the riots, which saw 15 officers hurt and 35 arrests, was described as an \"absolute warzone\".\nAn action plan was presented on Tuesday after consulting 1,200 people in Ely.\nIt said \u00a32m was being invested to improve youth services and tackle anti-social behaviour, as well as more investment in mental health support for teenagers and plans to improve green spaces.  \nDespite the grant only lasting a year, Cardiff council leader Huw Thomas insisted it would make a difference, adding that he hoped \"we will find ways of making the activities sustainable, in building on the wealth and the strength of the community itself\".\nSchool pupils who were involved in the conversations said the area was the same as any other, but young people need more spaces to socialise.\nFormer First Minister Mark Drakeford, whose Cardiff West constituency includes Ely, said it was a \"community plan\" developed by those who view residents as \"an asset\". \n\"Ely is not a problem to be solved,\" said Mr Drakeford, who spent several decades working in Ely before his career in politics. \n\"These are people who have huge strengths, enormous sense of community identity, and the plan is about drawing on those strengths and allowing them to flourish in conditions where people can take some responsibility for their own future,\" he told Radio Wales Breakfast. \nHe said it would not be able to tackle the \"underlying challenges\" on its own. \n\"The need is for this to be a long-term plan, not a plan that believes that it can put right everything that needs to be addressed in a short period of time,\" he said. \nLouise, 17, a student at Cardiff West Community High School who has lived in Ely since she was nine, said she did not really understand negative perceptions of the area until she got older.\n\"I don't think it is that bad to be honest,\" she said.\nShe said there were \"a lot of preconceptions of Ely being an awful place, but I don't think it is as bad as people say it to be.\n\"In reality every place will have bad things or bad things happen in that area.\n\"A couple years prior there were a lot of people drinking on the streets, but I don't see that as much these days.\"\nShe said she knows there are facilities such as youth clubs available, but they \"are not advertised enough\" or do not look \"physically appealing\" which can put people off.\n\"I think the community is welcoming. They are nice people,\" she added.\nLouise described the riots as \"quite scary\" as her and her friends were not sure what was happening.\n\"It was the night before my maths exam so it was really overwhelming,\" she said.\nFellow pupil Amelia, 16, said any negative opinions she has of the area often came from other people.\nWhen she tells people she is from Ely they often think it is \"quite a rough area\".\nBut she does not recognise that description having lived in the area all her life, and pointed to the \"community spirit\" on Facebook groups and how people \"come together and defend each other\".\n\"Because we are such a small community everyone is so close knit with one another,\" she said.\nHer input into the work that will help make up the action plan for Ely was that more investment is needed for youth clubs and spaces for young people.\nGeorgia Afferion, 26, said Ely needed more community spaces that are more closed off so they \"can't easily be ruined\".\n\"There's not many places in Ely that people can access that are so green and so natural,\" she said.\n\"There is a lot of green space that is not used and not well kept, so I definitely think there are things that can be developed.\"\nShe said the resources and centres that are available need to be better advertised and be held at a low cost or be free so more people can enjoy them.\nWhen Kyrees and Harvey died in a crash on 22 May 2023, word quickly circulated that their deaths were a result of the boys being chased by police.\nThis sparked a riot in the suburb but the circumstances behind the accident remained unclear.\nPolice insisted the teenagers were not chased, but CCTV footage analysed by BBC Verify appeared to show police following them minutes before the crash.\nThe force later confirmed they had been following the two boys before their deaths.\nThere have been 35 arrests in connection with the disorder but no charges, and inquiries are still ongoing, said the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).\nGross misconduct notices were served on the driver and passenger in the police van.\nAlmost one year on the events of May 2023 are still raw for the community of Ely.\nThe plan has been developed in the community over the last nine months, aimed at addressing the concerns and improving the lives of residents in the area.\nIt was created by the local ",
    "A social worker who helped expose the Rotherham grooming scandal has welcomed plans to ban convicted sex offenders from changing their names to avoid detection. \nJayne Senior spoke out after Safeguarding Minister Laura Farris confirmed the amendment would be included in the upcoming Criminal Justice Bill.\nShe described the measure as a \"great first step\" but said more needed to be done to support victims, saying current legislation does not go \"far enough\". \nThe Home Office said it was \"paramount\" victims were \"fully protected\".\nLast year the BBC found that more than 700 registered offenders had slipped off the police radar, mainly because of an identity change. \nAmong those to have exploited the loophole was Ian Huntley, whose previous offences went undetected at the Soham school he worked at before he killed Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in 2002.     \nMs Senior, who is the chief executive of the Swinton Lock children's charity in Mexborough, said the government should have ended the practice \"years ago\". \nSpeaking to BBC Radio Sheffield, she said: \"It's a brilliant idea, but I also think, 'Why has it taken so long for us to get here?' \n\"I don't think it goes far enough, but it's great that we've got to this stage and got where we are.\"\nMs Senior, who was awarded an MBE in 2016 for her work in Rotherham, said victims needed better communication from the Probation Service. \nSpecifically, she raised the ordeal of victims who have bumped into their abuser in the supermarket, having had no idea they were living nearby after their release from prison. \n\"There's a lot of areas that need to be looked at,\" she added. \"This is a great start but there needs to be a complete overhaul of how we treat offenders when they're released. \n\"Let's keep going and look at other areas that aren't watertight.\n\"Let's look at how victims services work with victims and what information they share.\"\nRotherham MP Sarah Champion described banning sex offenders from changing their names as an \"absolute no brainer\". \nShe told the BBC: \"I was incredulous that something as simple as changing [your] name by deed poll meant you could disappear. \n\"I can't tell you this is a panacea and it will never happen again, but I hope it sends out a chilling message to those paedophiles and abusers that are looking to use the current loophole because it's not going to be there anymore.\" \nIn a statement, the Home Office said: \"We have made sure that dangerous sex offenders cannot evade sanctions and criminal checks by changing their name and pose a further risk to the public.\n\"It is paramount victims of serious sexual and violent offences are fully protected. \n\"They are eligible to be supported by a victims liaison officer, who can help them request specific licence conditions for offenders, including exclusion zones after they are released.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.

    "Jurgen Klopp's place as a Liverpool legend has long been cemented.\nIn nine years as manager, he has led the football club to eight trophies, including the Champions League and their first league title in 30 years.\nBeyond the silverware though, the charismatic German has become more than just a football manager to many in his adopted city, a feeling summed up by the 2022 move to give him the freedom of Liverpool.\nAs the 56-year-old prepares to hang up his trademark baseball cap for the last time on Sunday, some of those whose lives he has touched have paid tribute to him.\nFor Hillsborough campaigner Margaret Aspinall, Klopp's understanding of what she and the others affected by the 1989 disaster had been through was what endeared him to the city.\n\"He really gets the people of Merseyside,\" she said.\n\"The first time I met [him], I was quite surprised how much knowledge he had of Hillsborough.\"\nShe said the affected families \"have been through so much\", but the joy Klopp's accomplishments with the Reds had brought had given some respite.\n\"We've won a lot of things with Jurgen,\" she said.\n\"He's took all our pain away for those 90 minutes.\"\nShe added that he also had a unique way of making people feel at ease.\n\"If you only meet him for five seconds, you feel as if you've known him for years,\" she said.\n\"I feel he is a Scouser.\"\nKlopp's inspiring nature has had an effect on more than just the football field.\nAt Homebaked co-operative bakery, which stands in the shadow of Liverpool's Anfield stadium, a particularly popular pie bears his name.\nHead chef Dan Shiels said the Klopp pie, filled with steak, ale, potato and \"German almost-pickled ingredients\" in a nod to the Stuttgart-born manager's heritage , was one of their bestsellers.\nHe said staff at the bakery were \"devastated\" Klopp was stepping down as manager, but his legacy would live on beyond his reign.\n\"Even though Jurgen is leaving at the end of this season, we are going to keep on running the Klopp pie,\" he said.\nCouncillor Richard Kemp was the man who nominated Klopp for his civic honour. \nHe said he put the German forward \"because of the effect he has had on our city\", especially in the way the club's success under him boosted tourism and the work he did during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\"He used the football club as a way of uniting people and bringing people out of the despondency they were in,\" he said\n\"He spoke many times about that publicly, but he did a lot of work privately as well.\"\nNeil Pullar, from Formby, lives near the Liverpool manager and serves on the management committee of fans group The Spirit of Shankly.\nDespite being a lifelong Red, he said it was not the footballing achievements that earned Klopp a special place in his heart.\nHe said he would never forget the messages Klopp sent him after he had a cardiac arrest in 2022. \nWhile he was recuperating, he was sent a Liverpool shirt signed by Klopp, his wife Ulla and the team. \nHe said the completely unprompted act of kindness showed Klopp's \"place within the local community\", which meant \"a great deal\" to him.\nColette Halliday said her partner Stephen Murphy received a similar gesture from Klopp just weeks before he died of pulmonary fibrosis.\nShe said that \"out of the blue came this absolutely beautiful letter\", which she added was written in Klopp's \"unique Scouse-German\".\n\"We just all burst into tears when we read it,\" she said.\n\"I was so pleased Stephen got to see it because he died about three weeks later.\n\"The kindness that [Jurgen] showed in writing that letter when he didn't have to is the measure of the man.\"\nShe said the letter ended with a message about how the \"managers, players, owners, directors, staff and supporters\" of Liverpool were \"all supporting\" Mr Murphy \"and the best thing about this I know is what a difference it can make\".\n\"We're all with you,\" Klopp wrote.\n\"You'll never walk alone.\"\nIt will be that exact phrase that many of the city's residents will hope he carries with him himself beyond his final game.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "OpenAI has unveiled the latest version of the tech which underpins its AI chatbot ChatGPT.\nIt\u2019s called GPT-4o, and it will be rolled out to all users of ChatGPT, including non-subscribers.\nIt is faster than earlier models and has been programmed to sound chatty and sometimes even flirtatious in its responses to prompts.\nThe new version can read and discuss images, translate languages, and identify emotions from visual expressions. There is also memory so it can recall previous prompts.\nIt can be interrupted and it has an easier conversational rhythm - there was no delay between asking it a question and receiving an answer.\nDuring a live demo using the voice version of GPT-4o, it provided helpful suggestions for how to go about solving a simple equation written on a piece of paper - rather than simply solving it.  It analysed some computer code, translating between Italian and English and interpreted the emotions in a selfie of a smiling man.\nUsing a warm American female voice, it greeted its prompters by asking them how they were doing. When paid a compliment, it responded: \u201cStop it, you\u2019re making me blush!\u201d.\nIt wasn\u2019t perfect \u2013 at one point it mistook the smiling man for a wooden surface, and it started to solve an equation that it hadn\u2019t yet been shown. This unintentionally demonstrated that there\u2019s still some way to go before the glitches and hallucinations which make chatbots unreliable and potentially unsafe, can be ironed out.\nBut what it does show us is the direction of travel for OpenAI, which I think intends  GPT-4o to become the next generation of AI digital assistant, a kind of turbo-charged Siri or Hey, Google which remembers what it\u2019s been told in the past and can interact beyond voice or text.\nIf there was an elephant in the room, alongside the enthusiastic off-camera audience whooping and applauding, it was the environmental price tag of this technology.\nWe know that AI is more power-hungry than traditional computing tasks, and that the more sophisticated it becomes, the more computing power it requires. There was no mention of sustainability during the evening.\nWe have seen chatbots like Elon Musk\u2019s Grok and Pi, from DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, prioritise the \u201cpersonality\u201d of their products, but the way in which GPT-4o seamlessly handled the combination of text, audio and images with an instant response appears to put OpenAI ahead of the competition.\nOf course, at the moment we only have the firm\u2019s word for it \u2013 it was their demo, carefully curated and managed by them. It will be interesting to see how GPT-4o copes at scale with the millions of people who already use ChatGPT as it rolls out.\nOpenAI's chief technology officer Mira Murati described GPT-4o as \u201cmagical\u201d but added that the firm would \u201cremove that mysticism\u201d with the product\u2019s roll-out.\nAn interesting and emotive choice of words: while this tech is rapidly becoming more sophisticated and increasingly convincing as a companion \u2013 it is not sentient or magic, it is complex programming and machine learning.\nThere have been rumours about a partnership between OpenAI and Apple and while this has not yet been confirmed, it was telling during the presentation that Apple products were used throughout. \nAnother shot across the bows was the timing of this event, 24 hours before its rival Google is due to show off its latest AI developments at its annual conference, Google IO.",
    "A Thai activist accused of insulting the country's monarchy has died in detention following a months-long hunger strike.\nNetiporn \"Bung\" Sanesangkhom died after her heart \"stopped suddenly\" on Tuesday morning, officials said.\nThe 28-year-old, part of a youth movement calling for royal reforms, had been detained since 26 January, facing seven separate charges - including two of insulting the monarchy.\nShe began her hunger strike the next day, only accepting water once again in late February, and food from April.\nMs Sanesangkhom was demanding reform of Thailand's justice system, including changes to the notorious lese majeste law, which criminalises critical comment about the royal family.\nShe had initially been held on a contempt of court charge, with her detention extended after bail in a separate lese-majeste case was revoked.\nMs Sanesangkhom was accused in two cases of lese-majeste case, one relating asking the public\u2019s views on the disruption caused by royal motorcades. \nIf found guilty, Ms Sanesangkhom - a judge's daughter who previously worked as a tutor - was facing up to 15 years in prison for each charge.\nThailand has some of the strictest lese-majeste laws in the world. According to legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, around 260 charges have been filed under the lese-majeste law since 2020. \nEarlier this year, a man was jailed for 50 years under the law - the longest ever sentence handed down.\nThis was not the first time Ms Sanesangkhom had gone on hunger strike. Back in 2022 she and a fellow activist from Thaluwang - which translates as \"shattering the palace\" - were released from prison after refusing to eat for 64 days.\nIt is not clear exactly how long she refused food on this occasion. Thai Lawyers for Human Rights said she started accepting food again in April.\nShe had been sent to a prison hospital due to declining health.\nAccording to prison officials, the hunger strike had left her weak and suffering from anaemia, but a statement from the Department of Corrections said she refused vitamins and electrolytes offered. \nHer heart stopped early on Tuesday morning, the statement said, with doctors attempting to revive her for several hours before she was sent to a nearby hospital where she was declared dead.\nThai MP Rukchanok Srinork from the reformist Move Forward Party - who is on bail while appealing against a six year sentence for convictions including lese-majeste - pointed out several other detained activists were also on hunger strike \"demanding their rights\".\n\"How many times will the courts allow deaths like these to happen until they're satisfied?\" she asked on X (formerly Twitter), after paying tribute to Ms Sanesangkhom.",

    "A company which performed a Brazilian butt lift (BBL) in a hotel function room which left a woman in hospital has been banned from carrying out the procedures in Glasgow.\nThe woman required emergency treatment after she received a BBL in March.\nGlasgow City Council said environmental health officers had served prohibition notices on two companies and an associated individual practitioner, preventing them from carrying out \"high risk\" BBLs and breast augmentation procedures anywhere within the city's boundaries.\nOther local authorities in Scotland and around the UK have also received complaints about similar procedures, including the City of Edinburgh Council.\nAt the end of April, the City of Edinburgh Council warned people who were about to have a non-surgical BBL in the city to contact staff due to concerns over the procedure.\nProhibition notices prevent those involved from carrying out any BBL or breast augmentation procedures within any premises or locations within the council area, until evidence can be provided that these procedures will be carried out safely.\nIf those involved fail to comply with these notices, a report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal for consideration of a prosecution - where the offender could face imprisonment, a significant fine, or both.\nCouncillor Ruairi Kelly, Glasgow's convener for neighbourhood services, said: \"Action has been taken by the council's environmental health team in a bid to prevent procedures being carried out in unsuitable and non-sterile locations. \n\"Three prohibition notices have been served on two companies and an associated individual practitioner.\"\nThe companies and individuals concerned have a 21-day period within which they could appeal.\nBrazilian butt lifts or BBLs are used to make buttocks bigger, more rounded or lifted.\nThose carrying out the procedure insert silicone-filled implants and/or inject fat transferred from other parts of the body.\nThe surgery, as with many cosmetic procedures, can be expensive, but liquid or non-surgical BBLs are a cheaper option.\nIn that version, hyaluronic acid, which is used in dermal fillers, is injected to manipulate the size and/or shape of the area.\nBut if not performed in a proper way, it can lead to serious health complications.\nThe NHS says BBLs have the highest death rate of all cosmetic procedures.\nExperts warn that injected fat transferred in the procedure can cause a blockage in a blood vessel in the lungs known as a pulmonary embolism.\nIn 2019, a woman from Norfolk died at a private hospital in Istanbul while undergoing the procedure.\nThe British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) issued new guidelines to members, external in 2022 following a four-year moratorium on BBLs due to the high death rate.\nIt now recommends surgeons only carry out a procedure called superficial gluteal lipofilling (SGL). While it uses fat collected from the body, this is only injected below the skin, whereas BBLs insert fat deep into the muscles.\nIt also recommends that surgeons should only carry out SGLs while simultaneously using ultrasound scans so they can see where the cannulas are going.",
    "A \"small minority\" are ruining the Dublin Portal experience for others, some people in the Irish capital have said. \nChanges will be made to the way the visual art installation linking Dublin to New York is operated due to some individuals having previously engaged in \"inappropriate behaviour\" near the portal, Dublin City Council said on Monday.\nThe 24/7 livestream is on a big, circular screen erected just off the junction where North Earl Street runs onto the city's main thoroughfare, O'Connell Street.\nIt allows people in Dublin in the Republic of Ireland to see what is going on in New York in the United States in real-time.\nA similar screen and webcam in the Big Apple also means people there can see what is happening in Dublin, around the clock.\nThe portals opened last week in both cities, with many people enjoying the ability to interact with passers-by on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. \nHowever on Monday, Irish and US media reported inappropriate behaviour over the weekend at the Dublin portal. \nVideos circulating online included clips of a man \"mooning\" and others apparently pretending to take drugs.\nA caller to RT\u00c9 told of a woman suspected of being under the influence of alcohol being led away by garda\u00ed (Irish police) after dancing provocatively against the portal screen.\nIn a statement on Monday, the council said the \"overwhelming majority of interactions are positive\" but said \"a very small minority of people\" had been engaged in the \"inappropriate behaviour\" and that this has been \"amplified through social media\".\n\"While we cannot control all of these actions, we are implementing some technical solutions to address this,\" it added. \n\"We will continue to monitor the situation over the coming days with our partners in New York to ensure that portals continue to deliver a positive experience for both cities and the world.\"\nThe council has not specified what technical changes will be made.\nElio Bonelli is from Tipperary and has been coming down to the Dublin Portal to take photographs of people interacting with the art installation.\nMr Bonelli said it was \"frustrating but not surprising\" that a small minority of people are ruining what should be a fun way for people to connect.\n\"I think people did kind of expect it,\" he said.\n\"Like with most things, there's always a few people, a small minority who end up ruining it.\"\n\nHe said it was \"amazing that through something like this, people can connect to other people on the other side of the world\".\n\"I just like to capture excitement in the imagery that I do and this is a great way to do that,\" he said.\nRobbie Reidy is from Dublin and has been enjoying playing rock-paper-scissors with people in New York through the portal.\nMr Reidy said hearing reports of people engaging in inappropriate behaviour at the portal is very disappointing.\n\"We are trying to represent Dublin,\" he told BBC News NI.\n\"The stuff that isn't too great is all over social media and gains more popularity, but 99% of the time it's friendly interactions.\"\nTwo American tourists visiting form Los Angeles said the portals are all about bringing communities together, but people need to be mindful of their actions. \nEmma Shields said she saw the portal on TikTok and wanted to come down and see it for herself. \nJazmyne Aquino said she is aware of some of the interactions being \"pretty scandalous\" and said everyone needs to \"remember to be careful\" and be able to have fun and connect. \nIn a statement to RT\u00c9, the company behind the installation, Portals Organization, said it did \"not intend to suggest people to interact with portals in any particular way\". \n\"Our goal is to open a window between far away places and cultures that allows people to interact freely with one another,\" it added. \n\"We encourage people to be respectful and from our position as observers, we see that the absolute majority of experiences is on the bright side.\"",

McNaughton, 29, pled guilty to a murder charge last year.\nMr Black, 65, is currently on trial for murder - which he denies along with 17 other charges - and has lodged a special defence of incrimination.\nMr Coshan taught at the Edinburgh public school from 1972 until his retirement in 2005.\nGiving evidence on Tuesday, McNaughton told jurors how he set up a fake account on dating website Gaydar in order to chat with the former teacher.\nHe said he had previously got to know the 75-year-old on the app and claimed Mr Coshan had offered him \u201cmoney for sexual favours\u201d.\nOn one visit to Mr Coshan\u2019s home, McNaughton \u201cmemorised\u201d his online banking details which had been written down on a notepad next to his computer.\nMcNaughton had lived with Mr Black at a flat in Leith, but knew him by the name of Joe Hillary.\nHe said in the years leading up to the murder, they had taken thousands from Mr Coshan\u2019s accounts without obtaining his permission.\nMcNaughton claimed he transferred some of the funds into his own bank account and that Mr Black made calls to Mr Coshan\u2019s bank to access his money.\nHe told the court he went on holiday to Blackpool with Mr Black after \u00a38,000 had been taken. On another occasion, he said they took \u00a35,000 to buy a car.\nMcNaughton said that Mr Coshan discovered that he had taken the money and he had spoken to him about it.\nHe added: \u201cHe said that I would have to do sexual favours on him for a year in order to clear my money.\n\u201cHe said he was not going to give me money but he still kept giving me money.\u201d\nMcNaughton told the court he was \u201cfed up\u201d with performing sexual favours, and that he and Mr Black had then planned to kill Mr Coshan.\nHe said they set up a new account on Gaydar and used a picture of a \u201crandom person\" from the internet.\nThe court heard messages were sent to Mr Coshan and he agreed to come to the property that McNaughton and Mr Black shared on Seafield Road.\nMcNaughton said: \u201cBoth of us decided what was going to happen when he came through the front door - he was going to be suffocated with a plastic bag by myself and Mr Black.\u201d\nHe told the court that he knew Mr Coshan had \u00a3102,000 and that they were planning to use the money for themselves.\nProsecutors claim that on 11 or 12 August 2022, Mr Black and McNaughton assaulted and injured Mr Coshan at the property, leaving him bleeding.\nIt is claimed that Mr Black struggled with Mr Coshan and then murdered him.\nHe is then alleged to have concealed the body for a number of days before putting it in a stolen suitcase and driving it to a layby on the A696 between Otterburn and Belsay in Northumberland, where he attempted to dig a grave.\nThe remains were left at a wall, while Mr Black is alleged to have attempted to dispose of clothing and other items belonging to the victim.\nMr Black's lawyers have lodged a special defence stating their client did not commit any of the alleged crimes.\nThe special defence states that if the crimes had been committed, the person responsible for them was another man called Paul McNaughton, whose location was described as \u201ccare of HMP Edinburgh\u201d.\nIt is also alleged that Mr Black later pretended to police that he did not know the victim, and purchased various cleaning products following the death.\nMr Black is also standing trial on fraud and theft charges.\nProsecutors claim that in September 2021, Mr Black and another person used \u201cmeans unknown\u201d to the Crown, to obtain the login details of Mr Coshan and access his bank accounts.\nThe trial, before judge Lord Scott, continues.",
    "A court in Austria has ruled that the country\u2019s most notorious criminal, Josef Fritzl, can be moved to a normal prison.\nFritzl, who has since changed his name, kept his daughter captive for 24 years in a dungeon he built beneath his home, and fathered seven children with her.\nHe has been held in an institution for mentally disturbed prisoners since 2009, after his conviction for rape, enslavement, incest and murder by neglect of his newborn son.\nThe statement from the court in Krems an der Donau said Fritzl, 89, no longer posed a danger that required him to be kept in a prison psychiatric unit.\nIt said that due to his \"progressive dementia\" and physical frailty, he was \"no longer likely to commit a criminal offence with serious consequences\".\nIn theory, the transfer to normal prison could pave the way for his eventual release. His lawyer, Astrid Wagner, has said she would apply for this, a year after his transfer.\nHowever the court statement said a release or a conditional release from prison would not be possible, for \"special preventative reasons\".\nGiven Fritzl\u2019s \"unprecedented criminal energy\", the statement said such a step was not to be expected.\nThe ruling can be appealed.\nThe Fritzl case, which emerged in 2008 in the town of Amstetten west of Vienna, has been described as one of the worst in Austria's criminal history.\nFritzl lived a double life. A qualified electrician, he imprisoned his daughter Elisabeth in his cellar in 1984. He raped her repeatedly and had seven children with her.\nThree of the children lived in the cellar with Elisabeth, trapped in windowless, soundproofed rooms behind a reinforced concrete door, where they never saw the light of day.\nFritzl raised three others in the house above with his wife Rosemarie,  who was unaware of the crimes.\nA seventh child died at birth. Fritzl was said to have burned the body in an incinerator and scattered the ashes in the garden of his house.\nThe case came to light when the eldest of the children, Kerstin, became seriously ill and had to be taken out of the cellar to hospital.\nFritzl initially denied the murder and slavery counts but reversed his plea after watching videotaped testimony from his daughter in court.\nElisabeth Fritzl and her children have taken on new identities.",

    "Princess Diana's former chauffeur has settled a High Court slander case with the BBC over claims he leaked information about her before her famous Panorama interview.\nStephen Davies was the Princess of Wales\u2019 chauffeur at the time of her TV interview with Martin Bashir in November 1995 - but was sacked without explanation in March 1996.\nMr Davies took legal action against the BBC after a probe revealed a document from a meeting in September 1995 which stated that Diana and her brother Earl Spencer were told by Mr Bashir that Mr Davies \"feeds Today newspaper... change your chauffeur\".\nThe BBC said it accepted that the allegation \"was and is wholly false\".\nCarter-Ruck, the solicitors for Mr Davies, told a hearing on Tuesday that the corporation had accepted that the \"serious and unfounded\" allegation had been \"fabricated\".\nIt said the BBC had agreed to pay a \"sum of compensation\" and his legal costs.\nMr Davies said in a statement via the legal firm that he was relieved to have been able to clear his name and his professional reputation as a chauffeur.\nHe said he had been shocked to hear that false allegations which \"were very likely to be the cause of my sudden termination\" had been made about him almost 30 years ago.\nCarter-Ruck said the lawyer representing Mr Davies, Persephone Bridgman Baker, told the hearing before Mrs Justice Steyn that the implication Mr Davies had leaked confidential information was a \"serious blot on his character\".\nHe had been \"devastated\" when his role with the princess was terminated, she said. \n\"He had maintained a close professional relationship with the princess throughout the many years he had worked for her and he was given no reason for the termination.\"\nHe had been \"tormented\" by speculation about what possible reason there could be for the ending of his employment, and was \"acutely embarrassed\" about his dismissal, she said.\nIt was a matter of \"profound regret\" to Mr Davies that, \"as he now knows, the princess believed that he had betrayed her, and he was unable to correct the position before her tragic death\".\nMs Bridgman Baker added that the allegations against Mr Davies, who still works as a chauffeur, had since been repeated in the Netflix series The Crown.\nCarter-Ruck added that Samuel Rowe, appearing for the BBC at the hearing, said the corporation wished to publicly apologise to Mr Davies for the publication of the allegation and the distress it had caused.\n\"The BBC accepts that the allegation made about the claimant was and is wholly false and should never have been made, and that it constitutes an attack on the claimant's reputation both personally and professionally.\"\nThe corporation accepted the claim was likely to have caused Diana to doubt Mr Davies's \"loyalty and professionalism\" - and \"may well have contributed to the claimant's redundancy six months later\".\n\"The BBC is sorry for the distress and harm suffered by the claimant. It is pleased that the parties have been able to resolve these issues.\"\nThe BBC Panorama sit-down interview with Diana and Mr Bashir was broadcast on 20 November 1995 - when she was separated from the then Prince Charles, but not yet divorced - and featured her saying: \"Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded\".\nA subsequent independent inquiry by Lord Dyson, a former senior judge, in 2021 found that the BBC had covered up Mr Bashir's \"deceitful behaviour\", and that the journalist was in \"serious breach\" of the BBC's producer guidelines when he faked bank statements and showed them to the earl to gain access to Diana.\nDiana's sons, Princes William and Harry, condemned the broadcaster for its treatment of their mother and the corporation has since promised not to air the interview again.",

    "Parents have heckled senior councillors at a meeting over delays to assessments for children with special educational needs.\nAbout a dozen parents were at the Essex County Council meeting on Tuesday.\nOnly about 1% of children in the county receive an assessment for an educational health care plan (EHCP) within the legal time limit of 20 weeks.\nThe council's Conservative cabinet member for education, Tony Ball, said we have \"let down\" the young people of Essex.\nThe full council meeting at County Hall in Chelmsford was told that 19 questions had been submitted by families about special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).\nBut just one was allowed to be asked during the meeting's public question section, which lasts 30 minutes. \nMother-of-two Hannah Harding, from Uttlesford, said: \"We have been denied that opportunity to ask questions and are very disappointed.\"\nLiberal Democrat opposition councillor Marie Goldman suggested that not allowing extra questions was \"giving the impression\" of wanting to avoid the issue.\nFellow Lib Dem councillor Jude Deakin said: \u201cThis council is denying the right of parents to ask sensible and important questions\"\nOutside the meeting, parents told of the sacrifices they had made to look after their children while awaiting an EHCP assessment.\nMrs Harding, 39, has a six and ten-year-old with additional needs, including autism, and said she could be waiting up to a year for an assessment to be carried out on her youngest.\nThe qualified teacher said: \"Unfortunately I have not been able to work for the vast majority of two years.\n\"I loved my job, but I've had to stop and focus on my children.\"\nAnd on the current system for assessments she added: \"It is a minefield and it is utterly soul destroying every single day to constantly be emailing and chasing.\"\n\nAnother mother Elizabeth Castle, 42, from Chelmsford, said her teenage son was in a SEND secondary school, but that other children were getting \"shoe-horned\" into mainstream.\n\"My son is traumatised because of certain schools that have suspended him for reasons that pertain to his autistic nature,\" she explained.\nHaving an EHCP puts public funding in place to support a child or young person with additional needs.\nMr Ball faced jeers in the council chamber as he said 2,237 of EHCPs still needed to be assessed, and of those, 26  families had been waiting more than a year.\n\u201cI make no secret that within Essex our performance is unacceptable\u00a0and has let down the\u00a0children and young people of Essex,\" he said.\n\u201cI have before and do again apologise to the families that are affected.\"\nThe county council is due to spend \u00a31m on paying for extra assessment specialists in a bid to reduce its backlog.\nRalph Holloway, the head of SEND strategy at the council, previously confirmed the rate of 1% was the lowest of any local authority in England. \n\nA council spokesperson explained there was \"limited\" time for questions at meetings.\n\"It would also be unfair on others who wish to raise different issues if all of the questions focused on one subject,\" they added.\nThe Department for Education (DfE) published its SEND and alternative provision improvement plan last year, promising to end a \"postcode lottery\" system in England.\nThirty-three special free schools would be built and an extra \u00a34.8m would be provided to expand \"specialist taskforces\".\nThe Local Government Association has said councils across England are facing \"significant financial challenges\" and need long-term certainty over funding from Westminster.\nFollow Essex news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Campaigners have called for a ban of so-called floating bus stops in London.\nThe design, which has a cycle lane between the stop and the pavement, is intended to allow bus passengers to get on and off safely while cyclists can keep moving.\nTransport for London (TfL), which has funded 160 of the stops, says the likelihood of being injured by a cyclist at a bypass is \"very low\".\nThe Department for Transport says schemes should be accessible to all.\nThe National Federation of the Blind UK's (NFB) has produced a petition which as been signed by more than 270 organisations and will be handed in to Downing Street later.\nIt comes after a video posted by the NFB that shows what it describes as \"the chaotic and downright dangerous situation\" at a bus stop bypass outside St Thomas' Hospital near Waterloo.\nIt showed a pedestrian walking into a cycle lane and falling to the ground after a cyclist knocks him off balance.\n\"These designs are not safe and they need to be urgently halted,\" it posted.\nAge UK London, the London Sports Club for the Blind and Disability Rights UK are among the signatories of the petition.\nLast month, the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan told the BBC the \"floating\" stops were installed during his second term because \"a disproportionate number of cyclists\" had been \"injured and killed as a consequence of buses\".\nSarah Gayton, street access campaign coordinator for the NFB, stressed that the organisation was not calling for the wholesale removal of cycle lanes.\n\"We're calling for a redesign of cycle lanes around bus stops so the bus can pull up directly to the pavement so blind and visually impaired people can board the bus directly without having to cross - or step into - a cycle lane,\" she said.\n\"Blind people have fewer choices. Cyclists can see and stop. We want the floating bus stops and the shared use bus borders to be removed.\"\nCaroline Russell, a Green Party member of the London Assembly, backed the \"floating\" bus stops due to what she said was \"overwhelming\" evidence that the design had reduced the number of people killed or seriously injured.\nSpeaking in the assembly, Ms Russell on Monday, she said: \"We also have to acknowledge that there are people riding bikes who are inconsiderate. \n\"There are also people driving cars who are incredibly inconsiderate and it's the inconsiderate people in cars who overwhelmingly kill and injure.\"\nMs Russsell said that measures like tactile (raised) paving, clear zebra crossings and different coloured tarmac at floating bus stops could make them safer, as well as announcements on buses reminding people when a bus stop bypass is approaching.\nShe added: \"It's all about avoiding getting into battle lines, looking at the evidence and making sure you're listening to people and particularly the most vulnerable in that transport hierarchy, which [includes] a blind person walking.\"\nChristina Calderato, TfL's director of transport strategy and policy, said: \"Keeping everyone travelling in the capital safe is our top priority and we're determined to make the network as inclusive as possible, which is why we have carried out an extensive review of safety at bus stop bypasses. \n\"Our analysis suggests that bus stop bypasses have not led to a reduction in bus stop use by older or disabled customers.\n\"Any moratorium on bus stop bypasses would put at risk the programme of work we are undertaking to improve cycle safety in London and encourage more people to cycle.\"\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"TfL are responsible for these schemes in London but we expect them to engage with disability groups and follow our guidance which clearly sets out that all infrastructure designs should be accessible for everyone.\"\nAdditional reporting by Robert Firth, Local Democracy Reporting Service\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

That's a tradition here in Rutland that all peers of the realm and members of the Royal Household will present a horseshoe as a forfeit on their first visit to the county. \nThe tradition comes from an idea that if you gave up a horseshoe, you couldn't gallop away without settling your bills first. Obviously, there's no concern about that today.\nThe horseshoes are hung in the French way, downwards, in line with the superstition that the devil can't make its nest in the bottom of it.\nOutside the castle here, hundreds of local children so excited, waving their flags.

    "The mothers of former Miss USA and Miss Teen USA have spoken out about why their daughters stepped down from their titles.\nOne mother told a US morning news show that \"the job of their dreams turned out to be a nightmare\".\nBoth pageant queens resigned just one day apart from each other last week.\nMiss USA and Miss Teen USA said last week that they support the two titleholders' decision to step down and would announce a successor.\nMiss Universe, which runs the sister pageants, has not addressed the allegations of abuse and bullying. The BBC has contacted the organisation for comment.\nThe two mothers told ABC's Good Morning America on Tuesday that they were speaking out on behalf of their daughters as they are bound by non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). \nBarbara Srivastava, mother of Miss Teen USA UmaSofia Srivastava, was interviewed alongside Jackeline Voigt, the mother of former Miss USA Noelia Voigt. \nMs Srivastava told the programme that their families \"could not continue this charade\".\nThey alleged their daughters had been \"ill-treated, abused, bullied and cornered\", and asked for an apology from Miss Universe Organization.\nNoelia Voigt was the first of the two to resign on 6 May, citing mental health struggles.\n\"Never compromise your physical and mental wellbeing,\" the 24-year-old wrote in a post on Instagram. \"Our health is our wealth.\"\nSome fans speculated on the meaning behind her note, which they said seemed to spell out \"I am silenced\" in the first 11 sentences.\nHer mother declined to answer whether the cryptic message was intentional, but said she felt her daughter had been silenced by the organisation. \n\"And she would be for the rest of her life if this NDA is not [lifted],\" she added.\nNoelia Voigt's resignation came three days after Miss USA's social media director, Claudia Michelle, announced her own resignation from the brand, citing alleged \"workplace toxicity and bullying\" and saying that titleholders \"should be heard and not silenced\". \nJust one day after Noelia Voigt's exit, UmaSofia Srivastava resigned from her title as Miss Teen USA. The 17-year-old also made the announcement on Instagram, writing that her \"personal values no longer fully align\" with the pageant organisation. \nUmaSofia Srivastava's mother said in the interview that her daughter was mistreated by the Miss Universe Organization and that her personal social media was surveilled. \nShe said her daughter's resignation was prompted by Noelia Voigt's exit. \nBoth mothers called for an end to participation in all Miss USA-affiliated pageants, saying they do not want others to experience the same mistreatment their daughters allegedly faced. \nThe Miss Teen USA runner-up, Stephanie Skinner, 19, told the New York Post on Monday that she doesn't want the crown either. \n\"I ultimately came to the decision to decline it,\" she said, adding that she was \"standing in solidarity and standing up for female empowerment\".\n\"My integrity and my character will always come before crowns.\"",
    "Donald Trump's legal team sought on Tuesday to dismantle the credibility of the star witness in the ex-president's criminal trial, Michael Cohen.\nMr Trump showed no reaction as his lawyer, during cross-examination, cast Cohen as a man with a personal vendetta against his former boss.\nThroughout the legal showdown weeks in the making, Cohen remained calm.\nHe also said he hoped Mr Trump would be found guilty of fraud in the hush-money case.\nCohen was on the stand for a second day of blockbuster testimony. He was called by prosecutors to testify about making a $130,000 (\u00a3104,300) hush-money payment to adult-film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election, to prevent her from telling a story about an alleged sexual encounter with Mr Trump. \nDonald Trump now faces 34 counts of business fraud for allegedly disguising reimbursements for the payment to Cohen as legal expenses. The former president pleaded not guilty to the charges and denies having sex with Ms Daniels.\nAt one point, his lawyer Todd Blanche asked bluntly if Cohen wanted to see Mr Trump convicted in the case.\nAfter being pressed, Cohen responded: \"Sure.\"\nOver the course of two hours, Mr Blanche tried to undermine Cohen, who was imprisoned after pleading guilty to tax evasion, fraud and campaign finance violations. He brought up his guilty plea for lying to congress, and sought to portray Cohen as being motivated by hate and fame. He also sought to show that Cohen seeks to profit from the legal woes of a man he blasts daily in public.\nThe lawyer dredged up Cohen's prolific social media posts, podcasts, and media appearances attacking Donald Trump, often in unprintable language.\nBBC News reporters are in the Manhattan courtroom covering the historic first criminal trial of a former US president. You'll find their updates and analysis on the BBC news website and app, and across TV, radio and podcasts.\nAt the start of the cross-examination, Mr Blanche asked about a comment Cohen made about him on social media.\nIs it true, Mr Blanche asked, that Cohen had called him a \"crying little [expletive]\". \nCohen quickly replied: \"Sounds like something I would say.\"\nJustice Juan Merchan swiftly struck the answer from the official record, but the exchange set the tone for the afternoon.\nMr Blanche later displayed some of Cohen's podcast merchandise, including a t-shirt that showed Mr Trump in an orange jumpsuit, handcuffed.\nBut by the close of Tuesday's session, the lawyer had not cross-examined Cohen on the most damaging testimony he had given prosecutors: that he had kept Mr Trump informed at every stage of the payment to Ms Daniels, and that the former president had approved the allegedly fraudulent reimbursement plan.\nDespite previous witnesses testifying to Cohen's belligerent nature, Cohen remained composed under cross-examination.  \nJeffrey Levine, an attorney who represents Cohen, said in a statement that \"my understanding is Mr Cohen came across credibly.\"\nHis testimony will continue when court is back in session on Thursday. \nProsecutors took a risk calling Cohen, given his online posts and criminal record. But as the man who actually carried out the hush-money payment to Ms Daniels, his testimony was crucial for the New York district attorney's case. \nProsecutors also hope he will help prove another part of their case - that allegedly covering up the payment was election interference.\nIn a pivotal moment, prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked Cohen why he made the payment.\n\"To ensure that the story would not come out, would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States,\" he told the court.\nMs Hoffinger asked on whose behalf he committed that crime.\n\"On behalf of Mr Trump,\" Cohen replied.\nAlthough Cohen said he didn't regret working for Donald Trump or his organisation, he said he had \"violated my moral compass\" in order to do Mr Trump's bidding.\nThe FBI raided Cohen's apartment in April 2018. He spoke to then-President Trump, who told him \"stay tough, you're going to be OK.\"\n\"I felt reassured because I had the president of the United States protecting me,\" Cohen testified.\nBut it was the last direct conversation between the two men. Cohen - who once said he would \"take a bullet\" for Mr Trump - testified that, after speaking to his family about being targeted by a federal investigation, he decided not to continue lying on behalf of his most famous client.\nAfter court wrapped up on Tuesday, Mr Trump told reporters that his team had \"a very good day\" and criticised a gag order limiting what he can say publicly about the judge's family and others involved in the case.\nA number of Mr Trump's Republican allies and possible running mates for November's election have attended the trial this week.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, currently the top Republican in the US government and in line to succeed the president after the vice-president, was present on Tuesday and spoke to reporters outside.\nFormer presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, Nort",
    "The boss of Manchester's troubled new Co-op Live arena has described how an incident in which part of a ventilation system fell from the ceiling could have been \"catastrophic\" if it had happened 15 minutes later.\nHowever, Tim Leiweke said the fittings had since been \"triple checked\" and he was confident it was \"the safest building in the world\" ahead of its latest planned opening on Tuesday.\nManchester band Elbow will play the first official show at the venue, after three attempts at opening were called off.\nLast month, shows by comedian Peter Kay and rock group The Black Keys were postponed because the building wasn't ready.\n\n\nThen at the start of May, an appearance by US rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie was cancelled at the last minute after the near miss with the ventilation duct following his soundcheck.\n\"If that was 15 minutes later, something catastrophic could have happened,\" Mr Leiweke told BBC entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson.\nMr Leiweke, chief executive of the arena's operator Oak View Group, said one of 95 pre-manufactured filters had fallen from the ceiling to the floor of the standing area inside the auditorium shortly before doors were due to open.\nHe said there had been \"no way\" they could have known it wasn't installed correctly.\n\"They didn't put the bolts in. It wasn't visible to the eye,\" he said. \"And it fell out.\n\"So we [have since] got that double checked and triple checked. We've looked at thousands of bolts up in that ceiling now. We've looked at the life safety lines. And we were going to take our time to make sure we did this right.\"\nThe venue paused its opening for almost two weeks as a result, with shows by Take That, Olivia Rodrigo and Keane called off.\n\"There was no way we were opening the doors until we checked every screw and every bolt and every one of those 95 shafts.\"\nMr Leiweke told the BBC the total cost of Co-op Live, which is due to be the UK's biggest indoor arena with a 23,500 capacity, was now approaching \u00a3450m.\nDozens of workmen wearing high-vis jackets and hard hats were still in and around the venue on Tuesday morning.\nAlthough Mr Leiweke insisted it would open smoothly on Tuesday, he admitted some parts may not be fully finished for six more months.\nThere is usually an extensive list of items to complete after a building opens, he said.\n\"This building will evolve over a period of time. My guess is for the next six months, we'll have guys coming in here and working on that punch list.\"\nThe arena's numerous delays and problems have made it the focus of scrutiny and ridicule, as well as causing huge upheaval for fans.\nMr Leiweke said disrupting people's lives was \"what I'm most upset about and I feel worst about\".\n\nAbout 12,000 people are expected to attend Tuesday's Elbow show. \"We are going [ahead] tonight. So everything is good,\" Mr Leiweke said.\nHe insisted it was \"the greatest arena built outside of the United States\", and said he wasn't worried by the fact the arena has only held one test event.\nThat was headlined by Rick Astley on 20 April, but thousands of people had tickets cancelled at the last minute to reduce the capacity becaue it wasn't ready.\nThe incident with the ventilation system happened on 1 May. No-one was injured.\nThe Health and Safety Executive, which is responsible for enforcing health and safety laws at construction sites, has not inspected or investigated the arena, saying the incident did not come under its reporting requirements.\nManchester City Council, which enforces health and safety at entertainment venues, said it had \"received documentation that confirms that the venue has carried out the necessary investigations following the incident with their air ducting that provides reassurance that they have considered their duties under Health and Safety law\".\nThe arena has taken five years to build, following delays in construction that were partly due to Brexit, Covid and the Manchester weather, Mr Leiweke claimed. \n\"I'm the first to tell you what probably anyone else in development and in construction will tell you - it is harder today to build things in the UK,\" he said.\n\"We got through Covid, we got through Brexit, we got through the rainiest season in the last 20 years. I had to put a roof on in the middle of the rain.\n\"All of those things ultimately had an impact. To the credit of the 10,000 people that built this arena, they stuck with it.\"\nHe also cited police requests for a specific emergency communications system, and accepted the onus on safety in Manchester following a 2017 suicide bomb at the city's other arena, which killed 22 people.\n\"We're under a different standard here in Manchester because of the bombing,\" Mr Leiweke said. \"So we're very driven by safety.\n\"We had to put a second secure communications system in here for the police department. That came up at the last minute, but we figured it out.\n\"So there are things in this building that I've never had to do any place else because we are very conscientious about w",
    "Thousands of people in western Canada are facing the wrath of wildfires this week amid severe drought.\nSome six thousand people were told to evacuate Fort McMurray, Alberta, where 90,000 residents were forced to flee during the 2016 wildfires.\nMore than 3,000 others were ordered to leave Fort Nelson, British Columbia, where a fire is burning 2.5km (1.5 miles) from the town.\nEvacuation alerts were also issued in the provinces of Alberta and Manitoba.\nSmoke from the fires has triggered air quality alerts in Canada and the US.\nHere's what to know about the fires.\nThere were several fires burning across Canada as of Tuesday, with a few dangerously close to towns and cities. \nOne is near Fort Nelson, a town in the north-eastern corner of British Columbia, about 1,600km from Vancouver. \nSome 3,400 people live in Fort Nelson and the Fort Nelson Indian Reserve. Most of them have since been evacuated due to the Parker Lake wildfire that is burning nearby. \nOn Tuesday, hundreds of people were also forced to evacuate near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta due to a fire burning 13km from the city. A 2016 wildfire in Fort McMurray destroyed 2,400 homes.\nResidents in the city itself and other surrounding neighbourhoods are on an emergency evacuation alert, meaning they could be asked to leave at any moment if the fire grows. \nIn Manitoba, 550 people were evacuated in the north-west of the province due to a wildfire that started on Thursday near the community of Cranberry Portage.\nThe wildfire had grown to 31,600 hectares (316 sq km) as of Tuesday afternoon - nearly the size of Manitoba's largest city, Winnipeg.\nIt spread at an unprecedented speed over the weekend, officials said, and could take weeks to be put out. \n\"I've been working in wildfires for 40 years. I've never seen a fire move like this fire moved,\" Earl Simmons, Manitoba's wildfire director, told reporters on Monday.\nThe Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre estimates there are 135 active fires across the country and 39 of those are out of control. \nThe Parker Lake fire near Fort Nelson began after high winds knocked over a tree and it crashed on to a power line and caught fire, Rob Fraser, Mayor of the Northern Rockies Municipality, told CBC News last week. \nBritish Columbia officials listed the fire as potentially human-caused, without elaborating. \nThe blaze in Cranberry Portage is believed to have started after a lightning strike, CBC News reported. \nIt's unclear exactly how the fires in Alberta started. \nThere are two common sources of wildfires in Canada: lightning and human beings, Gordon McBean, a geography and environment professor at Western University, told the BBC. \nPaul Kovacs, executive director of the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction at Western University, noted that if a large storm is moving across Canada, the storm can cause lightning in one place that starts a fire and then in another place that starts a separate fire.\nBut Canada's vast land and warming temperatures because of climate change are also playing a part, Prof McBean said. \nWarming temperatures in particularly dry regions of Canada, like the north-west provinces, can make those areas \"more vulnerable and likely to have fires occur\", he said. \nFor years, Canadian wildfire season started in July or August, but in the past 20 years the wildfire season has been starting earlier and earlier in the year, Mr Kovacs told the BBC. \nThis year's wildfire season comes as the country reels from its worst fire season on record in 2023, when roughly 18.5m hectares of land had burned - an area about the size of North Dakota. On average, just 2.5m hectares typically burn in Canada each year. \nMr Kovacs noted that while the wildfires have started early again this year, as is becoming normal, last year at this time there were more fires than there are right now. \n\"Last year was extraordinarily early start,\" he said. \nBut Mr Kovacs predicted this year would not be as bad as last year.\nFederal government officials warned earlier this year of the possibility of another \"catastrophic\" wildfire season due to warmer-than-usual weather. \nBut wildfire season depends heavily on weather conditions as summer progresses.",
    "The endangered puffin - one of Britain\u2019s most iconic seabirds - is at the centre of a row over the UK\u2019s post Brexit freedoms.\nThe UK recently banned fishing in the North Sea for the bird's favourite food, the sandeel. But the European Union is demanding the ban be lifted, claiming it breaches the UK\u2019s post-Brexit breakup deal.\nThe UK and the EU have until Thursday to find a compromise or risk escalation, something that could eventually lead to sanctions against Britain.\nAt stake, say conservationists, is Britain's right to choose which wildlife it protects in its own waters.\nThis is the first time the EU has triggered the dispute mechanism of the UK's breakup deal, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement.\nWildlife campaigners across Europe have reacted with fury at the EU\u2019s demand, with 38 conservation groups pledging their support for the UK ban, including the RSPB, ClientEarth, Oceana UK, Birdlife International, and the Marine Conservation Society.\nThe ban is also being championed by supporters of Brexit who say it would have been near impossible when the UK was part of the EU because of its laborious bureaucracy and the opposition of other EU members.\nDavid Davis, a former UK Brexit minister, told the BBC: \u201cUK government policy is in both the national and the global interest and Brexit gives us the right to make these decisions by itself.\u201d\nSandeels are small, silvery fish from several species which breed in huge numbers in the North Sea.\nThey are a favourite food of other threatened seabird and marine species, including seals, whales and dolphins.\nFishing boats from Denmark are most affected by the ban as they catch around 250,000 tonnes of sandeels in UK waters every year \u2013 several billion individual fish. \n\n\nThey are processed for fish oil and animal feed, particularly for pigs and farmed salmon.\nThe RSPB has been campaigning to ban the sandeel fishery for more than 25 years, warning sandeels are already under pressure.\nThey are sensitive to temperature changes and, as the seas around the UK continue to warm, there is evidence they have been migrating north.\n\"We're absolutely disgusted to see the EU challenging this sand eel closure,\" said Kirsten Carter, RSPB head of marine policy. \"Our seabirds are struggling. We've seen a 62% decline across species, a quarter of our puffins lost, our seabirds need these fish to feed their young and survive.\"\nFor its part, the EU says the UK ban does not do enough to balance the needs of marine ecosystems against the well-being of fishing communities.\nIt says the closure of the UK\u2019s sandeel fishery deprives EU vessels of important \u201cfishing opportunities\u201d and impinges the UK\u2019s \u201cbasic commitments\u201d under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement.\nA spokesman for the European fishing industry told the BBC the sandeel fishery is well managed already, with quotas in place and a system of closed areas to protect fish when they breed.\n\"Danish fishermen have been fishing for sandeel sustainably in the North Sea for decades,\" said Espen Sverdrup-Jensen, president of the EU Association of Fish Producers.\n\"We were challenging the UK ban because there is no scientific basis for this ban. There is no relationship between breeding success of seabirds and the current fishing management regime in the North Sea,\" he said.\nIf the UK and the EU don't come to an agreement by Thursday, the dispute will go to an arbitration panel which will rule on the issue.\nIf that panel were to find against the UK and the government fails to comply, Brussels could retaliate with tariffs or other measures.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every Tuesday.

    "Labour has accused the government of a \"cover-up\" over its scheme allowing some inmates to be freed early to ease overcrowding in jails. \nShadow justice secretary Shabana Mahmood said there were cases where violent criminals had been released without a proper assessment of the risk they posed. \nIt comes as a report found a \"high risk\" inmate who posed a danger to children had his release date brought forward, despite having a history of domestic abuse.\nThe government insisted no one convicted of a sexual, terrorist or serious violent offence would be eligible for early release. \nThe original scheme, introduced last October, allowed \"low-level offenders\" to be freed from prisons in England and Wales up to 18 days early under strict supervision. \nThis was increased to up to 60 days in March and will be further extended to up to 70 days from 23 May. \nThe prison population has ballooned in recent decades as a result of tougher sentences and court backlogs.\nChief inspector of prisons Charlie Taylor has raised \"serious concerns\" about the policy. \nA report on HMP Lewes published by the watchdog on Tuesday highlighted examples of high-risk inmates selected for early release. \nOne individual who had been freed early was recalled to custody before the watchdog's inspection of the prison had ended. \nAccording to the findings, he had a \"significant\" drug problem and a record of self-harm as well as experiencing suicidal thoughts, but was freed despite \"appeals for the decision to be reversed and staff having serious concerns for his and the public's safety\".\nHe was homeless on release, the report said. \nThe inspection was carried out in February, shortly after the scheme was brought in. \nMs Mahmood said: \"The public will rightly be worried to hear of cases where violent prisoners are being released without a proper assessment of the risk they pose to the public, and specifically children.\n\u201cIt\u2019s being left to prison inspectors to tell the public the truth because this government is refusing to level with them on the scale of the prisons and probation crisis.\"\nRaising the issue in the Commons, Labour's shadow justice minister Kevin Brennan said victims \"should have the right to know who this government is letting out of jail early\".\nIn response, Justice Minister Laura Farris said: \"Under our scheme, no sexual offender, no terrorist offender, nobody who has been convicted of serious violent crime or been convicted for four years or more will be eligible for release.\"\nHowever, domestic abuse commissioner Nicole Jacobs said perpetrators of domestic abuse frequently received short prisons sentences and were likely to be among those released early. \nShe called for such criminals to be exempt from the scheme, adding: \"Victims are being left to pay the price for prison overcrowding.\"\nA Ministry of Justice spokesman said: \"While we will always ensure there is enough capacity to keep dangerous offenders behind bars, this scheme allows us to ease short-term pressures on prisons by moving some lower-level offenders at the end of their custodial term on to licence.\n\"These offenders will continue to be supervised under strict conditions such as tagging and curfews, and the prison service can block the earlier release of any individual who poses a heightened risk.\"",
    "Police and probation services have admitted failings and \"lost opportunities\" over the disappearance and murder of a teenager, a pre-inquest review has heard.\nLeah Croucher, 19, disappeared while walking to work on February 15 2019 and her remains were discovered in a house in Milton Keynes, less than half a mile from her home, in October 2022.\nPrime suspect Neil Maxwell was a wanted and previously-convicted sex offender who killed himself while on the run from police in April 2019, two months after Ms Croucher vanished.\nSenior coroner at Milton Keynes Coroner's Court, Tom Osborne, said the inquest would look at admitted failings by the police and probation services that had not yet been specified publicly.\nInternal reviews had been carried out and the court heard that a redacted report on the Thames Valley Police investigation included about 250 documents.\nMr Osborne said if the failings had not been sufficiently amended, then a report to prevent future deaths would be ordered, in which he could tell organisations, government departments and individuals what action needed to be taken.\nMr Osborne said such a report could help fulfil the Croucher family's wish that \"we do not want another family going through what we've been through\".\nHe added: \"If I am satisfied that those failings and concerns have been addressed satisfactorily by further statements from police and probation, then I no longer have that duty to make those points.\"\nMaxwell was the only person with keys to the property on Loxbeare Drive, Furzton, where Ms Croucher's body was found.\nHe was wanted for a sex attack in Newport Pagnell in November 2018, and used false names to evade arrest, as well as stopping using his phone and car.\nOfficers believe he also lost weight and grew a beard to change his appearance.\nIn January 2023, Thames Valley Police released a computer generated e-fit of Maxwell as detectives tried to confirm he had killed Ms Croucher.\nCaroline Haughey KC, representing the family, told the court she was the only lawyer who would volunteer without a fee.\nAfter the hearing, she said she was representing the family pro bono because they could not afford counsel and \"otherwise they would have no-one\".\nShe added: \"Why should their misery be compounded by failings in the process?\n\"Leah was walking to work to carry on a normal day and because of failings, that predator was on the street - he should never have been at large.\"\nShe said the family had been \"subject to vitriol and trauma\" online with social media users falsely accusing some members of being involved in Ms Croucher's death.\nThe inquest will be heard on June 19 and 20.\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The son of a man who was a victim of the Windrush scandal says the Home Office asked him to do a DNA test to prove his relationship to his father as part of his compensation application.\nDijoun Jhagroo-Bryan received the \"outrageous\" letter asking for more evidence of his relationship with his father, Anthony Bryan, who was nearly deported in 2017 after living in Britain for 50 years.\nA human rights lawyer representing hundreds of Windrush victims said the Home Office's request was \"intrusive and traumatic\".\nThe Home Office now says Mr Jhagroo-Bryan is not required to provide DNA evidence after BBC News asked for a response to this case.\nThe government apologised in 2018 after some of the Windrush generation and their children were wrongly told they were in the UK illegally.\nIts hostile immigration policy affected their right to work, find homes and have NHS treatment.\nSome were detained and faced deportation.\nAnthony Bryan, 66, lived in London after coming to the UK from Jamaica when he was eight.\nIn 2017, he was arrested, held in a detention centre twice - once for nearly three weeks - and almost deported back to Jamaica.\nHis story was made into a BBC drama in 2020.\nMr Bryan, who is on medication for a serious lung condition, accepted a compensation offer from the Home Office in 2023 after five years of what he says were constant setbacks and delays.\nChildren of Windrush descendants are also eligible to apply for compensation if they can prove they have suffered losses.\nA similar scheme is in place for families of those affected by the Post Office scandal.\nDijoun Jhagroo-Bryan, 39, has applied for compensation as he says he has been left with long-term trauma and financial losses, and his own children were affected after not being able to see their grandfather when he was detained.\n\"I've suffered watching my dad being held in prison and I've suffered going through the steps that I needed to do in order to get him to stay in the UK,\" he said.\n\nAs part of the process, Mr Jhagroo-Bryan received a letter from the Home Office asking for more proof that Mr Bryan was his father.\nThe letter, seen exclusively by BBC News, stated he could voluntarily submit further evidence to support his application - such as post-natal hospital/doctor/midwife records or nursery and primary school records which name Anthony Bryan as his father.\nDNA evidence, although voluntary, would also be considered, the letter said.\nMr Jhagroo-Bryan said the letter had caused him and his family even more upset.\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous. Me submitting a DNA test doesn't change what I've gone through.\"\nMr Bryan said he could not believe it when his son told him about the letter.\n\u201cThey\u2019re at fault and still we have to fight this and fight that, do a DNA test and get the midwife,\" he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s degrading and, once again, it feels like the Home Office is insulting your intelligence.\"\nHuman rights lawyer Jacqueline McKenzie said: \"I'm not surprised that this has now become an issue in the context of Windrush.\n\u201cThe treatment of black people generally is so bad across society and particularly by the Home Office.\u201d\nIn some immigration cases the Home Office can ask applicants to provide more evidence of their biological relationship with a family member such as a birth certificate, DNA test results or a UK court order.\nBut Ms McKenzie said this was the first time she had heard about DNA requests from Windrush victims.\nShe believes they are being held to a different standard compared with families of other political scandals, such as the Post Office.\n\"It's absolutely shocking,\u201d she told the BBC.\n\u201cI think racism is at the heart of this.\u201d\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"Claims for the Windrush Compensation Scheme are considered on their individual merits.\n\"When necessary, further information may be requested to ensure we can issue the maximum award available, at the earliest point possible and we will support individuals on how to provide further evidence.\u201d\nThey added: \u201cThe government is committed to righting the wrongs of the Windrush scandal and making sure those who are eligible and entitled to compensation under the Windrush Compensation Scheme receive the compensation they rightly deserve.\"",
    "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that Russian President Vladimir Putin must pay to rebuild what he has destroyed in Ukraine.\nSpeaking in Kyiv, Mr Blinken said Washington has the power to seize Russian assets in the US and will use them to help rebuild Ukraine. \nHe also said that Ukraine is getting \"closer to Nato\".\nEarlier, the top US diplomat told Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that military aid is \"now on its way\".\n\"What Putin destroyed, Russia should - must - pay to rebuild. It's what international law demands. And it's what the Ukrainian people deserve,\" Mr Blinken said during his speech at Kyiv Polytechnic University.\n\"Our Congress has given us the power to seize Russian assets in the US, and we intend to use it,\" he said.\nHe added that the G7 group - the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and the US - can unlock billions of dollars, \"and send a powerful message to Putin that time is not on his side\".\nSince the full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago, Russian state assets in the EU estimated to be worth almost \u20ac211bn (\u00a3181bn) have been frozen.\nMr Blinken landed in the Ukrainian capital on Tuesday after a nine-hour journey via sleeper train from the Polish border.\nHis visit comes as the country struggles to hold back a major Russian incursion near its second biggest city of Kharkiv.\nMr Blinken's arrival also marks three weeks since the US Congress finally agreed a new $61bn (\u00a349bn) aid package for Ukraine.\n\"We are bringing Ukraine closer to and then into Nato,\" Mr Blinken said in his speech.\n\"We will make sure Ukraine's bridge to Nato is strong.\"\nMr Blinken sought to reassure Ukrainians with a direct-to-camera message: \"You are not alone. We are with you today and we will stay by your side\".\nHe noted that his visit came at a \"critical moment\" - amid a fresh Russian offensive which he said had been aided by North Korea, Iran and China.\nHe also touched upon new legislation to help mobilise troops to fight invading Russian forces. The measure is aimed at boosting numbers in the military, which is under severe pressure as Russia continues its advances in the east.\nMr Blinken described Ukraine's recent mobilisation reforms as \"a difficult decision but a necessary one\", lauding all those who have stepped up to serve their country.\nDuring Mr Blinken's meeting with President Zelensky, he paid tribute to Ukraine's \"extraordinary resilience\" and to the Ukrainian president's \"strength and leadership\". \nHe acknowledged that it was a \"challenging time\" but that the US assistance was \"on the way\", which he said would make a crucial difference on the battlefield.",
    "Reporters always carry some kind of baggage with them when they head off to cover a story - whether it's the tools of their trade, a camera or a microphone, or something less tangible, such as memories of a past encounter or story. It was on a recent deployment that the BBC's Middle East analyst Sebastian Usher suddenly noticed that the often unwanted companion that seemingly always accompanied him on trips abroad had suddenly gone missing. \nI got back from a reporting trip to Jerusalem, with all the usual highs and lows, and with the backdrop of one of the world's most utterly enthralling cities. And I realised on my return that something that habitually accompanies me on such trips had been missing. \nSomething that I have always somewhat resented, yet also jealously guarded as an essential part of who I am. \nMy stutter. \nEven after all these years it is almost always there, just giving a little wave as I prepare to do the umpteenth live interview. \nIt's mostly very well-behaved these days and surprisingly flexible, even generous. \nAt one time, it would let me know that a certain word - say, \"Syria\" - was a no-go. That was fair and mostly allowed me a way around it. It had no objections, for instance, to \"Syrian territory\" or the \"Syrian region\".  \nHaving to find fresh phrases can be an asset for a reporter. So it was perfectly liveable-with and to be honest - after a lifetime of listening to that little voice - quite companionable. \nBut high up on the windswept bureau balcony in Jerusalem, the voice was silent.  \nThere have been times like this before, and it has always returned. But who knows - this time it might be for good.  \nAnd it makes me feel a little bereft. \nWhen I look back, I can't really remember how it started but I do know that it was - to me at least - a relatively unobtrusive part of my childhood.  \nI was lucky to have a relatively sheltered, privileged upbringing where if it was noted at all, it was seen as a vaguely charming mark of distinction. A musty old Classics teacher would tell me about the great Athenian rhetorician Demosthenes standing on the beach with stones in his mouth to cure his stutter. It didn't really appeal.  \nAny time there was some distance that needed to be bridged - like speaking on a phone or asking for a bus ticket - it could be a problem. Anything too formal, too. And I found early on that it was really a stammer, not a stutter. \nWords didn't fracture and become staccato. They simply sat in the path like great unblinking toads, slyly preventing anything from getting past. But a stutter always sounded classier to me, so I've stuck with that.  \nIt's been everywhere with me - at school, university, work. It's been quite remarkably even-handed in showing up in formal or casual situations. And utterly capricious, suddenly coming up with an entirely new syllable or consonant to place out of bounds. \nPeople would ask: Is it nerves? Are you very anxious? Which would of course give me anxiety - so I never mentioned it. This meant that if suddenly, halfway through a sentence, I was struck dumb, people would react as if it were some biblical curse. \nOnce in Jordan after a 12-hour bus journey through the endless scrubland from Riyadh, I was suddenly unable to sound out a single word, a great imaginary boulder having materialised on my tongue through the night.  \nAcross the Middle East, beyond the endless strife and complication, certain things were at least clear to me - \"Lebanon\" was no problem, \"Iraq\" and \"Iran\" were easy - \"Israel\" too - \"Egypt\" a doddle - but \"Tunisia\", \"Tel Aviv\" and \"Turkey\" were temperamental, withdrawing access at a moment's notice. \nI would try to avoid listening to a fellow correspondent on the same story before going on air, in case my inner voice should triumphantly extricate the key word from their report and place it in quarantine. \nThat voice has however become ever more forgiving and forbearing down the years; now it is mostly a whisper of itself. But it's never gone away - or so I thought. \nMaybe I was just holding onto it as a precious fragment of a long-lost self - a sense that there was always something latent and untapped that lay beyond the surface. A connection - semi secret - to entire worlds of people that were gone. \nAs she sank ever deeper into Alzheimer's, my mother, who had helped make it so that I never felt it a burden or a hindrance, simply denied outright that my stutter had ever existed - a last link broken with the past. \nPerhaps it's her gentleness and elegant humour that the trace of sudden silence on my tongue still keeps alive. Or did. \nSo, the next time I am lost for words, it may simply be because there are none left to convey what is happening in Gaza, Israel and beyond.",
    "Notes from the first Stormont Executive meeting following a former Sinn F\u00e9in chairman's funeral, which were once thought to be missing, have now been published.\nSeven attempts were made by the Covid-19 inquiry team to source the minutes from 2 July 2020 following the large-scale funeral of Bobby Storey.\nThe notes were then submitted to the Covid Inquiry earlier this month..\nThe then-deputy first minister Michelle O'Neill and other Sinn F\u00e9in ministers had attended the funeral of Mr Storey.\nThey had faced criticism from other parties over their attendance at the funeral.\nSome Executive colleagues had claimed that the gathering was in breach of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions at that time.\nIn the hand-written published notes on Tuesday evening, Ms O'Neill claimed the funeral was within the regulations.\nShe added there had been \"no dilution\" of the public message \"in her mind\".\nIn the aftermath of the controversy surrounding her attendance, Ms O'Neill said she would never apologise for attending the funeral of a friend.\nBut on Tuesday she told the Covid Inquiry that she was sorry for going and for \"the hurt that's been caused\".\nThe Executive meeting took place on 2 July 2020, two days after the funeral which was attended by large crowds.\nThe notes show that Ms O'Neill told Executive colleagues that the funeral's online stream had been watched by about 250,000 people.\nShe said the cortege, including herself, numbered 30 people, with stewards lining the route to prevent people joining it.\nThey had worked with the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), she said, and masks were used, along with hygiene measures and social distancing. She added \"no offence intended.\"\nAlongside the then-DUP first minister Arlene Foster, Ms O'Neill was jointly responsible for leading the Northern Ireland Executive's response to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nMs Foster said \"huge damage\" had been done following the funeral and that she could not share a platform that day with Ms O'Neill giving out a joint public message.\nThat situation then continued for about two months.\nArlene Foster's DUP colleague, the former economy minister Diane Dodds, called the funeral \"absolutely disgraceful\" and said it was \"undermining\" the work of the Executive.\nShe added that the deputy first minister needed to \"express remorse\".\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in finance minister Conor Murphy said he attended the funeral, but was not in the cortege. \nMr Murphy said the rules around funerals had been relaxed and any breach of regulations was a technicality.\nMs O'Neill's apology to the Covid Inquiry comes almost four years after the event was held.\nMeanwhile, despite Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill publicly falling out over the Bobby Storey funeral, new WhatsApp messages released by the Covid-19 inquiry reveal that their once difficult political relationship appeared to end on good terms.\nThe day before her resignation as DUP leader, following an internal party coup, the Sinn F\u00e9in vice president sent Arlene Foster a text. \nIn her message, Ms O'Neill said: \"I'm genuinely sorry if you don't get to bow out the way you had planned. Politics is certainly not an easy path\".\nArlene Foster replied: \"Thanks Michelle. Just felt you should know.\"\nThree weeks later the former DUP leader thanked Michelle O'Neill for a card and gifts, prompting the reply: \"You are welcome. Take care.\"\nMichelle O'Neill also congratulated the former DUP leader in a text on being awarded \u00a3125,000 in damages after a defamatory tweet by TV presenter Dr Christian Jessen in May 2021, the day before she resigned.\nDr Jessen tweeted an unfounded claim that the DUP leader had been having an extra-marital affair on 23 December 2019.",
    "A man whose mother vanished 50 years ago said the mystery of a woman's body found in a cellar was the \"catalyst\" for their reunion. \nThe man, who asked to be identified only as Matthew, said his mother had left him and his two siblings in 1974 and \"dropped off the face of the Earth\".\nIt was listening to a podcast about the discovery of a partially mummified body at a house in Bolton that prompted him to contact police. \nAnd he would quickly learn that his mother - whom he feared might have been the dead woman - was actually alive and well. \nDetectives still do not know the identity of the woman, whose remains were discovered in a cellar in Bolton in 1982, wrapped in an old newspaper from 1966.\nThe case gained national attention in 1983 as the first time a ground-breaking facial recognition technique was used in a public appeal by a British police force.\nForensic artist Richard Neave created a likeness of Mary Ellen's face using scientific measurements of her skull and strips of modelling clay.\nA BBC Radio Manchester investigation, The Forgotten Dead, re-examined the case in 2022 in an effort to solve the mystery. \nMatthew, who now lives in mid Wales and was three when his mother disappeared, said he knew it had been a \"long shot\" that it might be her, but he contacted Greater Manchester Police to raise his fears after hearing the series. \nHis mother was 27, had three children and was living in Bolton when she disappeared without a trace in about 1974, he said.\nMatthew, now 53, said his mother had a \"tempestuous\" relationship with a married man, who was \"quite a violent person\", in the early 1970s.\nHe said his mother, who was herself divorced, frequently hid at her mother's house to avoid him.\nOne day she took him and his siblings to his grandmother's house telling her she needed to back to her flat \"because she had the gas man coming round\".\n\u201cAnd that was it. She's never seen again. She just completely dropped off the face of the earth,\" said Matthew. \nFor the next 50 years he was left with nagging questions about what had happened to his mother. \nHe had very little information, a vague idea of where his mother had been living in Bolton, and a rough idea of when she disappeared, and a few photographs. \nLast year, at Matthew's request, GMP took another look at his mother\u2019s disappearance.\nHe had feared she was dead and \"something had happened at the time of her disappearance\".\nBut Matthew said he was shocked to learn from the force that she was alive. \n\"It just turned everything upside down,\" he said.\nMatthew said police could not give him his mother's contact details, but were able to pass on a letter from him.\nAbout three months after he wrote the letter, Matthew got a phone call from his mother, and they spoke for the first time in 50 years.\nHe said they started to speak on a regular basis, but it was a \"real rollercoaster of emotions\" for the first few weeks.\nShortly afterwards, they held a video call and and he saw his mother for the first time in five decades. \nActually seeing her was \"another milestone\", he said.\nMonths later, the mother and son met in person for the first time.\nHe recalled saying \"Hello mum\" and sharing a big hug with her. \n\"She was in fear of her life, and in fear of her children\u2019s lives\" and had to make a decision that \"no mother should ever have to make to escape a violent partner\", he said.  \nSeries 1 and 2 of The Forgotten Dead: The Body in the Cellar, are on BBC Sounds.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X and Instagram?

    "Mohamed Amra - the prisoner who escaped from a prison van during an ambush by armed men who killed two prison officers and wounded others - is said to have ties to a gang in the southern city of Marseille, which has been plagued by drug-related gang violence.\nKnown as \"The Fly\", Amra was being taken from court to a prison in the city of Rouen near Paris on Tuesday when a car rammed the prison van at a toll booth and armed men opened fire.\nProsecutors say the 30-year-old had been convicted of burglary on 10 May and had also been indicted by prosecutors in Marseille for a kidnapping that led to a death.\nHe was being held at the Val de Reuil prison, near Rouen, and had reportedly appeared at a nearby court in relation to those new charges prior to the ambush.\nAmra was not a \"closely watched inmate\", prosecutor Laura Beccuau said, using a term for highly dangerous prisoners. \nHowever his transportation still reportedly required a \"level three escort\" which meant there were five prison officers travelling with him.\nHis lawyer, Hugues Vigier, said Amra had already made an escape attempt at the weekend by sawing the bars of his cell, but said he was shocked by the \"inexcusable\" and \"insane\" violence.\n\"This does not correspond to the impression that I had of him,\" the lawyer told BFMTV.\nMr Vigier said that his assistant had met with Amra on Tuesday morning.\n\"A short meeting, about an hour long was planned for this morning and my assistant saw Mr Amra and he was perfectly normal,\" he said.\n\"He knew about [Tuesday's] transfer so it is possible that he'd have told other people.\"\nHis accomplices appeared to be fully informed because they were waiting at the motorway tollbooth.\nAmra's mother said he had not given any indication he would try to escape.\n\"He doesn't talk to me. He's my son, he doesn't talk to me about anything at all.\"\nShe said she went to visit him in several of the prisons he's been held in, but \"he never gave anything away. I don't understand\".\nShe described breaking down in tears after hearing about the ambush.\n\"I broke down, I cried - I was so unwell - how can lives be taken away in this way?\" she told RTL.\nShe also described her son's life in the prison system, saying he was \"lugged around left right and centre, they put him in isolation instead of sentencing him once and for all\".\nHe had been held in separate prisons in Marseille, Paris and Rouen during the legal process against him for theft, which resulted in an 18-month jail sentence.\nHe had 13 previous convictions for largely minor offences, including driving without a licence, theft and refusing to stop for police, according to BFMTV.\nHowever his implication in the death of a man from Dreux near Rouen who was kidnapped in Marseille in acts linked to drug trafficking suggests involvement with more serious criminals.\nThe heavily armed attack that freed him came on the same day as the French Senate published a report warning France was being \"submerged\" by drugs crime.\nThe report notes an \"explosion of both supply and demand\" in the illegal drugs trade, warning: \"No part of the national territory and no social class is beyond the reach of drugs crime\u2026 drugs traffic is infiltrating everywhere, with a concomitant exacerbation of violence\".\nThe trade in drugs has spread across the country, making inroads in rural areas and medium-sized towns, it said.\n\"The spread of drugs crime is not just the result of foreign mafias. It is also the work of structured and dangerous French organisations who act without any limit be it financial, territorial or in the exercise of violence,\" the report said.\nYesterday Nicolas Bessone, the prosecutor for the Marseille region, told broadcaster France 2 that drug gangs had become so rich and powerful they were successfully infiltrating the court system in Marseille, corrupting civil servants.\nAround 50 people were killed in drug-related shootings in Marseille last year.",

A public footpath would run to the east of the station.\nThe proposal is being developed in partnership with the Hull & East Yorkshire Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP), National Highways and Wykeland Group, which owns  Melton West.\nThe project offered \"high value for money\" and bringing it to an \"investment ready\" stage would maximise the chances of securing funding from the government's Network North transport initiative, according to the consultation documents.\nPassengers, local people and businesses are being asked to take part in the consultation, which will run until August 12. \nThe station could open in 2027, subject to funding.\n\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter)\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

    "The Scottish government has agreed to fund the country's largest men's mental health charity amid uncertainty over its future.\nThe Scottish Men's Sheds Association (SMSA) helps set up sheds in local communities where men can take part in activities and enjoy the company of others - all designed to improve mental health and wellbeing.\nCabinet Secretary for Social Justice Shirley Anne Somerville announced the funding for this financial year but would not confirm plans for future years.\nFunding for the charity was scrapped in 2022 but the government agreed on a \u00a375,000 grant last year.\nThis week the Sunday Post reported the charity faced being wound up as no further money had been agreed.\nSMSA executive officer Jason Schroeder told the BBC they had to fight \"tooth and nail\" for the organisation's future.\nHe said: \"We are the most successful and preventative charity in Scotland, no other movement provides what we're providing.\n\"Our ideas have even been exported to Canada and America, that's how successful it's been.\"\nThe government has not yet confirmed how much the charity will receive, but Mr Schroeder said the organisation needs \u00a3360,000 per year to run successfully.\nIn recent years, he said the most recent grant of \u00a375,000 had left the SMSA running on a \"skeletal\" staff.\nSMSA chairman David Gardner runs his local shed in Ayrshire. He told BBC Scotland's Drivetime programme the association relies on financial stability for their few permanent staff.\nHe said: \"We have two full-time staff and three part-time staff and these people are contracted on a year-to-year basis, and its always a concern amongst staff when they start hearing we\u2019re not getting funding.\n\"We\u2019re a far, far larger organisation than we have been and as such, I think its fair to say we\u2019re making a far greater contribution.\"\nFollowing the funding announcement, Mr Gardner said: \"Hopefully we will not have to have this battle with the government every year.\"\nThe Scottish Men's Shed Association (SMSA) is the national support hub which helps local groups set up and run a Men's Shed in their local communities across Scotland. \nThe first started up in Westhill, Aberdeenshire in 2013 and there are now over 200 sheds across Scotland.\nLocal branches of Men's Sheds are run by volunteers \"for the men, by the men\", with the aim of fostering social inclusion and improving health and wellbeing.  \nMr Gardner says the activities in each shed can vary from location to location, day to day. \nHe said: \"The shed does what the members want it to do. If you ask 15 different men, you'll get 15 different answers. \n\"Most of them will have some form of woodwork or metalwork. Some will have cooking classes, exercise classes or model making, photography and arts and crafts - there is all sorts going on.  They deliver to meet the needs of their members.\"\nSpeaking in parliament today, Shirley Anne Somerville said: \"The Scottish government has provided \u00a3795,000 worth of funding to the Scottish Men\u2019s Shed Association since 2016, supporting the movement to grow from five sheds to 200 across Scotland. \n\"We understand that it\u2019s a very challenging time for small organisations and that the SMSA are working to secure funding from charity donors and from the private sector. \n\"Given this, I can confirm today that we will work with the organisation to identify and to provide the funding for this financial year to ensure that we support them in the months ahead to develop broad, sustainable support for this important national organisation. \n\"We hope this will help to avoid future uncertainty and assist local sheds to flourish.\"\nScottish Labour MSP Paul O'Kane who posed the question to the cabinet secretary said: \u201cInstead of receiving funding on time the Scottish Men\u2019s Sheds Association was made to wait anxiously for an answer about its own future from the Scottish government.\n\u201cI want to see the Scottish government go further than it did today by coming forward with a plan for sustainable long term funding.\n\u201cThe Men\u2019s Sheds Association and other third sector organisations can\u2019t plan for or invest in any long-term projects if they don\u2019t have that guarantee of sustainable funding.\"",
    "An \"intelligent\" low-energy lighting system will reduce maintenance costs and disruption to traders at a new market, according to Bradford Council.\nDarley Street Market will be lit up by the new street lighting when it opens in September.\nThe building will be fully lit when the market is open, but dimmed when it is being cleaned and prepared for trading.\nThe scheme was originally budgeted at \u00a323.5m, but the council since increased its  spending on the market to \u00a327m which it said was due to high inflation.\nColin Wolstenholme, markets manager at Bradford Council, said: \u201cThe testing of the lighting system at the new market is the latest in the progress of this exciting development.\n\"Alongside our traders we\u2019re looking forward to opening the market later this year.\u201d\nOperators will have the ability to control the lighting system so it can be used for key occasions throughout the year or to highlight key dates.\nThe market roof has glazing sections allowing natural light into the upper floors and atrium.\nBradford Council said a \"special glass\" had been used to allow natural light in but reduce glare from the sun, while reflecting heat to keep the building cool in the summer and warm in winter.\nLighting in areas without natural light will also be powered by surplus energy from solar panels on the roof.\nDavid Wilson, senior project manager at Kier Construction North & Scotland said: \u201cI\u2019m incredibly proud of the work our site teams have delivered on this project and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing the market and the local area flourish once it is in operation.\u201d\nThe market will replace the city centre\u2019s two existing markets, Kirkgate and Oastler, which will both shut once Darley Street Market opens.\nIt will have three floors of stalls offering food and drink, a stage, indoor screens, a large outdoor screen and umbrellas for hosting events in the market square.\nWhile some councillors have criticised the cost of the scheme, David Shepherd, director of place, said: \u201cThe money we invest will be recouped through the income generated by the market.\u201d\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.

    "In November last year, Muralikrishnan Chinnadurai was watching a livestream of a Tamil-language event in the UK when he noticed something odd.\nA woman introduced as Duwaraka, daughter of \u200b\u200bVelupillai Prabhakaran, the Tamil Tiger militant chief, was giving a speech.\nThe problem was that Duwaraka had died more than a decade earlier, in an airstrike in 2009 during the closing days of the Sri Lankan civil war.  The then-23-year-old's body was never found. \nAnd now, here she was - seemingly a middle-aged woman - exhorting Tamilians across the world to take forward the political struggle for their freedom. \nMr Chinnadurai, a fact-checker in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, watched the video closely, noticed glitches in the video and soon pinned it down to being a figure generated by artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe potential problems were immediately clear to Mr Chinnadurai: \"This is an emotive issue in the state [Tamil Nadu] and with elections around the corner, the misinformation could quickly spread.\"\nAs India goes to the polls, it is impossible to avoid the wealth of AI-generated content being created - from campaign videos, to personalised audio messages in a range of Indian languages, and even automated calls made to voters in a candidate's voice. \nContent creators like Shahid Sheikh have even had fun using AI tools to show Indian politicians in avatars we haven't seen them in before: wearing athleisure, playing music and dancing.\nBut as the tools get more sophisticated, experts worry about its implications when it comes to making fake news appear real.\n\"Rumours have always been a part of electioneering. [But] in the age of social media, it can spread like wildfire,\" says SY Qureshi, the country's former chief election commissioner. \n\"It can actually set the country on fire.\" \nIndia's political parties are not the first in the world to take advantage of recent developments in AI. Just over the border in Pakistan, it allowed jailed politician Imran Khan to address a rally.\nAnd in India itself, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also already made the best of the emerging technology to campaign effectively - addressing an audience in Hindi which, by using the government-created AI tool Bhashini, was then translated into Tamil in real time.\nBut it can also be used to manipulate words and messages.\nLast month, two viral videos showed Bollywood stars Ranveer Singh and Aamir Khan campaigning for the opposition Congress party. Both filed police complaints saying these were deepfakes, made without their consent.\nThen, on 29 April, Prime Minister Modi raised concerns about AI being used to distort speeches by senior leaders of the ruling party, including him.\nThe next day, police arrested two people, one each from the opposition Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress party, in connection with a doctored video of Home Minister Amit Shah.\nMr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has also faced similar accusations from opposition leaders in the country.\nThe problem is - despite the arrests - there is no comprehensive regulation in place, according to experts.\nWhich means \"if you're caught doing something wrong, then there might be a slap on your wrist at best\", according to Srinivas Kodali, a data and security researcher.  \nIn the absence of regulation, creators told the BBC they have to rely on personal ethics to decide the kind of work they choose to do or not do. \nThe BBC learned that, among the requests from politicians, were pornographic imagery and morphing of videos and audios of their rivals to damage their reputation.\n\"I was once asked to make an original look like a deepfake because the original video, if shared widely, would make the politician look bad,\" reveals Divyendra Singh Jadoun.\n\"So his team wanted me to create a deepfake that they could pass off as the original.\"\nMr Jadoun, founder of The Indian Deepfaker (TID), which created tools to help people use open source AI software to create campaign material for Indian politicians, insists on putting disclaimers on anything he makes so it is clear it is not real.\nBut it is still hard to control.\nMr Sheikh, who works with a marketing agency in the eastern state of West Bengal, has seen his work shared without permission or credit by politicians or political pages on social media.\n\"One politician used an image I created of Mr Modi without context and without mentioning it was created using AI,\" he says.\nAnd it is now so easy to create a deepfake that anyone can do it.\n\"What used to take us seven or eight days to create can now be done in three minutes,\" Mr Jadoun explains. \"You just need to have a computer.\"\nIndeed, the BBC got a first-hand look at just how easy it is to create a fake phone call between two people - in this case, me and former US president Donald Trump.\nDespite the risks, India had initially said it wasn't considering a law for AI. This March, however, it sprung into action after a furore over Google's Gemini chatbot response to a query ",
    "Robert Fico's ability to reinvent himself has kept him at the top of Slovakia\u2019s politics despite repeated scandals. \nNow surgeons are battling to save his life after an assassination attempt that followed a government meeting in a small town.\nHis most recent fall from grace was in 2018, when mass protests forced his resignation in the wake of the murder of investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his fianc\u00e9e.\nTurning to the then president Andrej Kiska \u2013 one of many political enemies \u2013 he vowed to return to politics.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. Don\u2019t worry,\u201d he said.\nAnd he was right.\nInitially stunned by the sudden fall \u2013 and swiftly replaced as PM by his party prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Peter Pellegrini \u2013 Fico appeared to be heading for the political wilderness. \nAfter a humiliating election defeat for their leftist Smer party, Pellegrini abandoned him, forming a new centre-left party, Hlas.\nBut the Covid crisis created fresh opportunity for Robert Fico. He began appearing at mass demonstrations against the centre-right government\u2019s restrictions to counter the pandemic. \nThose demonstrations became increasingly unruly and ugly. Fico stood at the head of them, rousing the angry crowds with megaphone in hand, even being arrested at one point.\nAs Covid faded from the headlines, he found a new cause \u2013 Ukraine. \nThe September 2023 election was won \u2013 partly \u2013 on a pledge to send \"not one more round of ammunition\" to Kyiv, promising to reverse the Slovak government\u2019s policy of arming Ukraine with artillery shells, heavy weapons and even fighter jets.\nAnd after he won those elections, forming a coalition with Peter Pellegrini - the man who had betrayed him - as well the ultra-nationalist Slovak National Party \u2013 he doubled down on that policy.\nIn February as the world marked the conflict\u2019s second anniversary, Mr Fico reiterated his opposition to the west\u2019s policy of arming Kyiv. \nThere was no military solution to the conflict, he said, and sending weapons to Ukraine would only fill more graves in the country\u2019s cemeteries.\nRussia would never relinquish Crimea, or the parts of the eastern Donbas region it has taken, and instead Kyiv should lay down its arms and sue for peace, he said. \nVladimir Putin, Mr Fico said, had been \"wrongly demonised\" by the west.\nDuring the six months he has been in office this time, he and his coalition allies have taken a sledgehammer to Slovakia\u2019s institutions. \nReform of the criminal justice system included abolition of the Special Prosecutor\u2019s Office, set up 20 years ago to investigation serious crime and corruption. \nThe office had been overseeing the Kuciak murders, and six years on, securing a conviction now seems more distant than ever.\nThe national broadcaster \u2013 RTVS \u2013 is to be shut down in June and replaced with a new body with a new director. \nMr Fico says RTVS cannot be objective as it is in permanent conflict with his government, and this \u2018unsustainable\u2019 situation can only be rectified by replacing it.\nObservers \u2013 including the opposition, the European Commission and the European Broadcasting Union \u2013 have warned the move would be a blow to media freedom in Slovakia.\nParliament had begun debating the proposal in earnest on Wednesday morning when news of the shooting broke. An opposition demonstration against the proposal was quickly cancelled.\nMedia reports that the gunman \u2013 reported to be a 71-year-old man from southern Slovakia \u2013 had been motivated by the move to shut down RTVS have not been confirmed. Meanwhile a Hungarian investigative journalist said the man had previously been associated with a pro-Russian paramilitary group.\nThe man\u2019s identity is being reported widely by the Slovak media, but his motive remains unclear.\nHowever if 59-year-old political veteran Mr Fico pulls through, he will likely draw new strength from this attempt on his life. \nAmid the calls for calm and an end to the hateful rhetoric, his closest political allies are already laying the blame squarely on the liberal opposition and the media.\nOne coalition ally \u2013 deputy prime minister Andrej Danko \u2013 said the country was heading for \"political war\".\nThe political temperature has certainly risen in Slovakia since he formed what is his fourth administration in October. \nBut this shooting propels the country into wholly uncharted territory.",
    "As a controlled explosion rocked the Dali on Monday, nearly two dozen sailors remained on board, below deck in the massive ship's hull. \nThe simultaneous blasts sent pieces of Baltimore's once iconic Francis Scott Key Bridge into the dark waters of Maryland's Patapsco River, seven weeks after its collapse left six people on the bridge dead and the Dali marooned. \nAuthorities - and the crew - hope that the demolition will mark the beginning of the end of a long process that has left the 21 men on board trapped and cut off from the world, thousands of miles from their homes. \nBut for now, it remains unclear when they will be able to return home. \nThe Dali - a 948ft (289m) container ship - was at the start of a 27-day journey from Baltimore to Sri Lanka when it struck the Francis Scott Key Bridge, sending thousands of tonnes of steel and cement into the Patapsco. It left the ship stranded under a massive expanse of shredded metal. \nA preliminary NTSB report found that two electrical blackouts disabled equipment ahead of the incident, and noted that the ship lost power twice in the 10 hours leading up to the crash. \nThe crew, made up of 20 Indians and a Sri Lankan national, has been unable to disembark because of visa restrictions, a lack of required shore passes and parallel ongoing investigations by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and FBI. \nOn Monday, the crew remained on board even as authorities used small explosive charges to deliberately \"cut\" an expanse of the bridge lying on the ship's bow. \nAhead of the controlled demolition, US Coast Guard Admiral Shannon Gilreath said that the crew would remain below deck with a fire crew at the ready. \n\"They're part of the ship. They are necessary to keep the ship staffed and operational,\" Adm Gilreath said. \"They're the best responders on board the ship themselves.\" \nWhile the ship is likely to be re-floated this week, it remains unclear when it will be able to make the 2 nautical mile (3.7km) journey to port. \nAmong those who have been in touch with the crew is Joshua Messick, executive director of the Baltimore International Seafarers' Center, a non-profit organisation that works to protect the rights of mariners.\nAccording to Mr Messick, the crew has been left largely without communication with the outside world for \"a couple of weeks\" after their mobile phones were confiscated by the FBI as part of the investigation. \n\"They can't do any online banking. They can't pay their bills at home. They don't have any of their data or anyone's contact information, so they're really isolated right now,\" Mr Messick said. \"They just can't reach out to the folks they need to, or even look at pictures of their children before they go to sleep. It's really a sad situation.\" \nThe plight of the sailors also attracted the attention of the two unions representing them, the Singapore Maritime Officers' Union and the Singapore Organisation of Seamen. \nIn a joint statement on 11 May, the unions said that \"morale has understandably dipped\", driven by \"unfounded fear of personal criminal liability\" and emotional distress. \nThe statement also called for the \"swift return\" of the crews' phones, noting that losing communication with family members is \"causing significant hardship for crew members with young children at home.\" \nDave Heindel, the president of the Seafarers International Union, said that \"however long the investigation takes, the crew's rights and welfare should not be infringed upon\". \n\"We call on the authorities to be mindful that seafarers utilise mobile devices to conduct personal business for bill payments, and, more important, transfer money to their home country to sustain families,\" he said. \"Crew members are becoming demoralised without the basic tools we all take for granted.\" \nAndrew Middleton, who runs Apostleship of Sea - a programme that ministers to ships coming through Baltimore - told the BBC he visited the sailors two weeks ago and found them in \"good spirits\" despite constant worries. \n\"Once we broke the ice and got everyone to say their name and what part of India they were from, and talk about if they were married or had children, we got the ball rolling,\" he said. \"They were willing to kind of poke fun at one another a little bit.... we did our best to get them laughing and joking, hopefully to take their mind off things for even a few minutes.\" \nFor the time being, the crew has been given SIM cards and temporary mobile phones without data included, according to Mr Messick. \nThey also received care packages from various community groups and private individuals, which in recent weeks have included batches of Indian snacks and handmade quilts.\nThe BBC has reached out to the ''unified command'' overseeing the government's response to Dali and the bridge collapse for clarity on when the sailors might be able to leave the ship and, eventually, be repatriated. \nDarrel Wilson, a spokesperson for Synergy Marine, the Dali's Singapore-based managem",
    "A mother and daughter appear in a new film about palaeontologist Mary Anning, which premieres in Dorset next month.\nDirector Sharon Sheehan began writing and researching the film in 2000 after a trip to Lyme Regis with her daughter.\nIn the biopic, she plays Anning in her adult years, while her daughter, Katy Hamilton, is the young Mary.\nSheehan, who collaborated with numerous experts on her research, says the film is \"as near as we can possibly get to the exact story of her life\".\nThe film stars Jenny Agutter as Miss Philpott, Mary Anning's mentor, and was partly shot in Lyme Regis, where Anning lived and made her historic discoveries.\nSheehan worked with palaeontologists, academics and institutions, including the Natural History Museum in London, to piece together the details of Anning's life.\n\"The film goes from her early life to her death at the age of 47 from breast cancer and all the trials and tribulations of trying to get recognition for her research,\" she said.\n\"I started writing it when my daughter was really small.
