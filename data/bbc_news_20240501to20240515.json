    "In the early afternoon of 29 November last year, several Palestinian boys descended on to their street in the occupied West Bank, where they often played together.\nMinutes later, two of them lay dead from gunshots fired by Israeli soldiers - Basil, 15, and eight-year-old Adam.\nAs part of an investigation into the conduct of Israel's security forces in the West Bank, which has been under military occupation for more than half a century, the BBC has pieced together what happened on the day the two boys were killed.\nMobile phone and CCTV footage, information about the movements of Israel's military, witness testimony and detailed investigation of the scene, including taking measurements, combine to reveal evidence suggesting serious human rights violations.\nThe evidence we found has prompted Ben Saul, UN special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, to say the death of Adam appears to be a \"war crime\".\nAnother legal expert, Dr Lawrence Hill-Cawthorne, described the use of lethal force as \u201cindiscriminate\u201d.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the circumstances of the deaths were \u201cunder review\u201d but said \u201clive fire is used only in order to remove immediate threats or for arrest purposes, following arrest protocols after exhausting other options\u201d.\nWith violence having surged in the West Bank in the months since Hamas's attack on Israel from Gaza on 7 October, the BBC has also found evidence of Palestinian homes being vandalised with graffiti, Palestinian civilians threatened with weapons and told to leave the territory for neighbouring Jordan, and the possible mutilation of the body of a Palestinian gunman.\nVideo footage from 29 November shows Basil standing next to a hardware store, its shutters firmly locked down. When Israel's military arrives, shops close quickly in Jenin, a city in the West Bank - Palestinian territory which, unlike Gaza, is not run by Hamas.\nWitnesses said gunfire had been ringing out from a nearby operation by Israel's army in the Jenin refugee camp.\nAdam, a football fanatic and massive Lionel Messi fan, stood with his older brother Baha, 14. There were about nine boys on the street in total, all captured on CCTV cameras that provided a nearly 360-degree view of what happened next.\nA few hundred metres away, a convoy of at least six armoured Israeli military vehicles turned a corner and began heading towards the boys, who clearly became uneasy. Several of the boys started to move away.\nAt this precise moment, mobile phone footage shows the front door of an armoured vehicle opened. The soldier inside had a direct view of the boys. Basil had darted into the middle of the road, while Adam was 12m further from the soldiers, running away.\nThen at least 11 gunshots rang out.\nExamining the scene, the BBC found the bullets struck a wide area. Four bullets hit a metal pole, two the shutter of the hardware store, one burrowed its way through the bumper of a parked car, and another pierced a handrail.\nMedical reports obtained by the BBC show that two shots hit Basil in the chest.\nAnother bullet struck eight-year-old Adam in the back of the head as he ran away; his older brother Baha desperately tried to drag him to cover, leaving a trail of blood as he screamed for an ambulance.\nBut it was too late. Baha said Adam and his friend Basil died in front of him.\n\u201cI was in a state of shock; I wasn\u2019t even thinking about myself. I tried to speak to him. I started saying, \u2018Adam, Adam!\u2019 But his soul was basically leaving his body because he didn't answer,\u201d Baha told the BBC tearfully.\nBefore being shot, Basil can be seen clutching something in his hand. It is not clear what it is. The IDF later shared a picture taken at the scene, which it says shows an explosive device.\nEvidence from our investigation of the scene was shared with a number of independent experts, including human rights lawyers, a war crimes investigator and a counter-terrorism expert, as well as members of the UN and other, neutral bodies. Some gave their analysis anonymously.\nThe experts agreed the incident should be investigated and some went further, saying there appeared to be violations of international law.\nBen Saul, the UN special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, said there may be questions about whether lethal force could have been used legally in Basil's case, if he was holding an explosive.\n\"For Adam, this appears to be a violation of the International Humanitarian Law prohibitions on deliberately, indiscriminately or disproportionately attacking civilians, a war crime, and a violation of the human right to life,\" Mr Saul said.\nDr Lawrence Hill-Cawthorne, co-director of the Centre for International Law at the University of Bristol, said: \"The soldiers were in armoured vehicles. Even if there was a threat, they should have driven away and planned an arrest, rather than defaulting to apparently indiscriminate, lethal force, which is a violation of international law.\u201d\nThe IDF said the suspects had been about t",
    "The US central bank again said it would keep interest rates unchanged, noting a \"lack of further progress\" toward lowering inflation.\nThe decision left the Federal Reserve's key rate hovering at the highest level in more than two decades, in the range of 5.25%-5.5%, where it has stood since last July.\nBy keeping borrowing costs high, the Fed is hoping to cool the economy and reduce the pressures pushing up prices.\nBut with inflation in the US proving more persistent than expected, the bank is facing questions about its next move.\nAnalysts who had expected the bank to start cutting rates early this year have been forced to postpone forecasts - and some have even raised the possibility of a rate rise. \nAt a press conference following the announcement, Fed chairman Jerome Powell said he thought that a rate increase was \"unlikely\", while repeating that officials wanted greater confidence that inflation was easing before moving to cut. \n\"It really will depend on the data,\" he said. \n\"It's going to take longer to reach that point of comfort. I don't know how long it will take,\" he added. \nIn the US, consumer prices rose 3.5% over the 12 months to March.\nThat is down sharply from the 9.1% rate seen in June 2022, but remains above the Fed's 2% target, ticking higher in recent months. \nIn its statement announcing its latest decision on Wednesday, the Fed drew attention to those trends, noting \"a lack of further progress\" bringing inflation back to its goal.\n\"The statement explicitly recognises the recent deterioration in inflation dynamics,\" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.\n\"Patience is the watchword now for the Fed and the risk of fewer or no rate cuts this year is growing.\" \nThe Fed has left rates untouched since last July, after boosting them aggressively from near zero in March 2022.\nHigher interest rates trickle out to the public in the form of more expensive mortgages, car and business loans and other debt.\nThe Fed's moves are being closely watched around the world where many central banks, including the Bank of England, have also had a prolonged period of sharply raised rates. \nMr Powell said policymakers in other countries may move more quickly than the US to cut rates due to worries about economic slowdown.\n\"The difference between the United States and other countries that are now considering rate cuts is they're just not having the kind of growth we're having,\" he said. \"We can be patient.\"\nSeparately, the Fed also outlined its previously-discussed plans to slow the pace at which it is shrinking its holdings of US Treasuries.\nIt built up those holdings as part of its stimulus efforts to bolster the economy when the pandemic hit in 2020, starting to reverse the moves two years later. \nMr Powell said the decision to slow that process was aimed at avoiding disruption to financial markets and not intended to influence the inflation fight.",
    "The family of a gay British-Mexican man held in Qatar for alleged drug offences has given further details of what they say was a \"honeytrap\" operation using the gay dating app, Grindr.  \nManuel Guerrero Avi\u00f1a was approached online by a man called \"Gio\" and they arranged to meet - but he was instead met by police and arrested on false drug charges, Manuel's brother Enrique told the BBC. \nManuel, who has HIV, has now completely run out of his usual medication, his family says. They want the UK government to bring him back home for treatment.\nAmnesty International has described Manuel's experience in detention as \"nothing short of horrific\" and says that his trial was \"marred by a range of due process violations.\" Its concerns are echoed by other human rights organisations the BBC has spoken to. \nQatari officials insist Manuel has been treated \"with respect and dignity\". \nAt first glance \"Gio\" - who also used the name \"Mike\" - looked like the thousands of other men on dating apps around the world.\nHis Grindr profile, seen by the BBC, was full of gym selfies showing off his six-pack. His listed interests were karaoke, football and Netflix. \nThe man also had a similar profile on Tinder, where his identity would have had to be verified by the app's facial recognition technology.\nEnrique says his brother swapped phone numbers with the man and invited him over to his apartment in Qatar's capital, Doha. \nBut when Manuel went down to the lobby of his building to meet \"Gio\", he was instead confronted by Qatari police officers, according to his brother, who says they immediately handcuffed Manuel and placed him under arrest. \nHomosexuality is illegal in Qatar but Manuel, an airline worker, had lived a \"normal life\" for the past seven years and had never been in trouble with the authorities, his family says.\nQatari officials insist the 44-year-old's arrest in February was \"for possession of illegal substances on his person and in his apartment\" and that \"no other factors were taken into account\".\nThey say he \"acknowledged\" possessing illegal substances, adding: \"A drug test later came back positive, confirming the presence of illegal substances, specifically amphetamine and methamphetamine, in Mr Avi\u00f1a's system at the time of his arrest.\"\nEnrique maintains that Manuel didn't take any drugs and says a small amount of methamphetamine was planted on him, which he was \"pressured\" into accepting was his.  \nBBC News has not been able to independently verify all of the claims made by Manuel and his family. Many of the accusations about his treatment after his arrest took place behind closed doors with few witnesses. \nHowever Manuel's family has presented a detailed timeline of events, and previous reporting, on both the treatment of LBGT people and the behaviour of police in the country, suggest others have had similar experiences.\nWhile being held in custody at the police station, Manuel allegedly witnessed others being \"whipped on their backs\" by officers - and was threatened with similar treatment if he did not sign several legal documents.\nManuel told his family that these documents were written in Arabic - a language he could not read - and that he was not given access to a translator or any legal advice. \nHis brother says that when Manuel told the prison about his HIV they moved him into solitary confinement and would sporadically withhold his medication to pressure him into sharing information about other gay men - which he refused to do.  \nEnrique has told the BBC that Manuel was interrogated for hours at a time.\nWithholding medication in prison is \"morally intolerable\" and could already have had very serious consequences for Manuel's health, the UK's National Aids Trust says. \nThe charity is calling on the UK government to intervene and bring Manuel back for proper treatment. \nQatari officials have told the BBC that Manuel was \"treated with respect and dignity throughout his detention\".\nHe was told that he is facing anything from six months to three years in prison for possession and consumption of drugs. \nBut for the time being, after having spent 42 days in a Qatari detention centre, he has been granted provisional release and is staying with friends while he waits for further court appearances.  \nManuel's passport has been taken away - the conditions of his release mean he is banned from travelling abroad. \nDana Ahmed, a Middle East researcher at Amnesty International, says his treatment in detention, and later in his first trial sessions \"raises serious fears that Manuel is being targeted for his sexual orientation and is being coerced into providing the authorities with information that they could use to pursue a crackdown on LGBTI individuals in Qatar\". \nManuel's family has told the BBC that his usual treatment, prescribed by British doctors, ran out in mid-April. He now has to take an alternative provided by the Qatari authorities.\nBefore his arrest, Manuel's HIV was being treated with antiretroviral medication",
    "A first failed asylum seeker has gone to Rwanda under a voluntary removals programme, it is understood.\nUnder the scheme, announced last month, migrants whose claims are rejected are offered up to \u00a33,000 to move to the east African country.\nIt is separate to the forced returns scheme the government announced two years ago.\nThat scheme, which has been beset by delays, is due to begin by mid-July.\nThe Sun, which first reported the story, said the unnamed man was flown out of the UK on Monday on a commercial flight.\nOfficials would not be drawn on any details, other than to say the asylum seeker had exhausted all rights to be in the UK. \nThe Rwandan government confirmed that a failed asylum seeker arrived on Tuesday on a flight from London.\nLabour said the move showed ministers were \"desperate\" to get a flight off to Rwanda before Thursday's local elections in England.\nThe scheme announced in March is understood to be a variation of an existing voluntary returns scheme for failed asylum seekers.\nThe scheme will also be opened up to other people with no right to remain in the UK, and foreign criminals.\nThe Home Office says payments under the current scheme \"can pay for\" temporary accommodation in the destination country, or education costs, or the cost of setting up a business.\nBusiness Secretary Kemi Badenoch suggested the fact someone had volunteered to go to Rwanda undermined the argument that it was not a safe country. \nIn response to criticism of the \u00a33,000 paid for relocation, she told Sky News there was no \"cost-free option\" for border control.\nAccording to official statistics, 19,253 people with no right to remain in the UK were voluntarily removed from the UK last year. \nOf these, 3,319 received a \"reintegration package\" or flights paid by the Home Office. \nJacqueline McKenzie, partner and head of immigration at Leigh Day solicitors, said she was aware from contacts that many people had recently been offered this package to go to Rwanda, including some very vulnerable individuals. \n\"I am surprised, given the amount of calls that have been made, that more people haven't gone, if it's a good idea,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \nShadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called news of the voluntary return a \"pre-election gimmick,\" adding taxpayers were \"forking out \u00a33,000 for a volunteer to board a plane\".\n\"The Tories are so desperate to get any flight off to Rwanda before the local elections that they have now just paid someone to go,\" she added.\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the individual went to Rwanda under \"an old scheme\", which \"won't stop the boats\".\n\"They've had to pay someone \u00a33,000. There's a suspicion out there that this is about an election - it's not about seriously stopping the boats,\" he said, in a reference to the local elections taking place in England on Thursday.\n\"Liberal Democrats believe this scheme is extremely expensive and won't actually work,\" he added. \nIt comes after the Home Office confirmed Rwanda had agreed to accept an initial cohort of 5,700 asylum seekers under the separate forced returns scheme.\nThe scheme - which the government argues will deter future migrants from crossing the English Channel in small boats - has been dogged by legal delays.\nHowever, it is finally set to begin in the summer, after legislation to override a Supreme Court ruling entered into force earlier this month.\nThe Home Office has said 2,143 asylum seekers can immediately be located for detention in the run-up to their flights, as they are reporting to the department.\nIt has denied losing track of the remaining 3,557, who are subject to a range of different monitoring requirements.\nDowning Street insisted on Tuesday it remained confident of their whereabouts, after the figures became public as part of a policy document.\nHowever, a government source admitted it was possible some could abscond before they were detained.",
    "What would it be like to meet one of our closest human relatives from 75,000 years ago in the flesh?\nScientists have produced a remarkable reconstruction of what a Neanderthal woman would have looked like when she was alive.\nIt is based on the flattened, shattered remains of a skull whose bones were so soft when excavated they had the consistency of \"a well-dunked biscuit\".\nResearchers first had to strengthen the fragments before reassembling them.\nExpert palaeoartists then created the 3D model.\nThe representation appears in a new BBC Studios documentary for Netflix called Secrets of the Neanderthals, which examines what we know about our long-lost evolutionary cousins, who became extinct about 40,000 years ago.\nThe sculpture puts a face to these people.\n\"I think she can help us connect with who they were,\" said Dr Emma Pomeroy, a palaeoanthropologist on the project from the University of Cambridge.\n\"It's extremely exciting and a massive privilege actually to be able to work with the remains of any individual but especially one as special as her,\" she told BBC News.\nThe skull on which the model is based was found in Shanidar Cave in Iraqi Kurdistan.

    "Wednesday marks a significant moment for the UK government's Legacy Act - with an end to historical inquests and the transferring of Troubles-era cases to a new body.\nThe controversial act has been opposed by victims' groups and all the main political parties in Northern Ireland - while the UK government maintains the law is human rights compliant and draws a line under the past.\nThe act was passed by Parliament in September despite opposition from Labour, all Northern Ireland parties, several victims' groups and the Irish government. \nIt created a new legacy body known as the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) to take over all Troubles-era cases from May 1, including those on the desk of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). \nThe act shuts down all historical inquests from 1 May and has already prevented new civil cases from being lodged in court. \nThe act's most controversial element, the offer of conditional immunity to suspects, has been disapplied following legal action by bereaved families. \nThe court ruled this part of the act was incompatible with human rights' legislation and the Windsor Framework. \nThe UK government has lodged an appeal which is due to be heard in June.\nThe ICRIR is headed by Sir Declan Morgan, a former lord chief justice of Northern Ireland. \nFrom 1 May, and for a period of five years, it will accept requests for investigations into UK-wide incidents in which people were killed or seriously injured between 1 January 1966 and 10 April 1998. \nThese can be lodged by bereaved families or victims themselves. Cases can also be referred to it by the Northern Ireland attorney general and the Northern Ireland secretary, among others. \nIn consultation with those who come forward, the ICRIR, which has police powers, will decide on the type of investigation to be carried out. \nIn theory there still can be, perhaps more so now that the immunity clause has been struck from the act. \nThis removed the possibility of suspects applying for immunity from the ICRIR in return for information to be provided to victims' families. \nHowever, based on recent precedent, the number of prosecutions is unlikely to be significant, given a good many suspects and witnesses have died since the events of 30 to 50 years ago. \nThe Public Prosecution Service considered 53 legacy cases presented to it following Police Service of Northern Ireland investigations between 2012 and the start of April 2024 and it brought charges in about half of them. \nOnly a small minority led to convictions. The expectation of bereaved families and victims is not high. \nProsecutions which began before 1 May , such as Soldier F in relation to Bloody Sunday, will continue to a conclusion.\nThe most dramatic impact of the act is the halting of all Troubles-related inquests. \nThis applies to inquests which have not opened, or which have not reached the findings stage. \nBefore the act was conceived, there was a five-year programme of Troubles-era inquests, but this was disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. \nMany cases also faced delays over the provision of evidence by the Ministry of Defence, and others, and then applications by the Northern Ireland secretary to have intelligence information withheld on the grounds of national security. \nMany of the inquests which have fallen involve multiple killings, including the shooting dead of eight IRA men by the Army at Loughgall in County Armagh in 1987. \nUnder the act, inquests which have not been dealt with can transfer to the ICRIR. \nThey will become what's known as Enhanced Inquisitorial Proceedings (EIP), with findings produced by Sir Declan Morgan. \nMany families, who question whether EIPs will be a like-for-like replacement, hope that should Labour win the next election, inquests will be reinstated under its pledge to repeal the act.\nIt has no idea what its workload will be - there were more than 3,500 Troubles-era killings (about 1,000 remain unsolved) and up to 40,000 people were injured. \nOn 1 May, the ICRIR will open phone lines and begin receiving emails from people who want it to look at their cases. Face-to-face meetings will then be arranged. \nThe ICRIR has offices in Belfast and London and may recruit up to 300 staff in coming months.\nIt could end up being operational until 2030 or beyond and cost in the region of \u00a3250m, but this is entirely dependent on numbers coming forward and the type of investigation agreed in each case. \nThe ICRIR has said case numbers are impossible to predict at this stage.",

    "A schoolboy who was killed in a sword attack in London on Tuesday has been named as Daniel Anjorin.\nThe 14-year-old died in hospital after being stabbed in Hainault, where four other people - including two police officers - were seriously injured.\nA 36-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder and is in police custody.\nDaniel's school, Bancroft's, said he was a \"true scholar\" who had a \"positive nature and gentle character\".\nIt described him as a \"core member\" of the community, and continued: \"Losing such a young pupil is something we will always struggle to come to terms with.\"\nThe teenager attended the school where Grace O'Malley-Kumar - who was killed in a random stabbing attack in Nottingham in June 2023 - was previously a pupil.\nIn a letter to parents seen by BBC News, the school's head said it \"seems scarcely believable\" that children and teachers were \"facing fresh sorrow\".\nThe suspect hit a 33-year-old when he crashed his van into a property in Laing Close, at about 07:00 BST on Tuesday, and then attacked the man who suffered a neck wound, the Met said. \nAnother man, 35, was cut on his arm when he was attacked inside a nearby house.\nTheir conditions are not considered to be life-threatening, police said.\nThe suspect then went on to attack Daniel. He died from stab wounds shortly after being taken to hospital. \nThe Met said police arrived within 12 minutes of the first call and officers had used a kind of pepper spray and a Taser on the suspect, which did not stop him.\nTwo officers were then attacked, suffering serious injuries, and will need long-term treatment to recover, the force added.\nThe suspect fled before eventually being surrounded by other officers in Thurlow Gardens where he was overpowered with a Taser.\nHe was arrested and taken to hospital due to injuries from the crash. He is now in police custody.\nDet Ch Insp Larry Smith described it as a \"complex investigation due to the number of crime scenes, forensic evidence, hours of CCTV footage and witnesses we need to speak to\".\n\"I know that many people will want answers and we are working to provide them as soon as we can,\" he added.\n\"I would also echo previous calls for patience as my officers carry out a painstaking investigation to deliver justice for Daniel, his family, those injured and the wider community.\"\nIn a letter to parents, the school's head teacher, Simon Marshall, wrote: \"Naturally this event will have a profound effect on the whole school, but this will be especially true of his peers.\n\"All we can do for now is to look after one another and respect the privacy of Daniel's family - it is a time of profound grief and as a community we will endure best if we come together in kindness and compassion.\"\nA flag was seen flying at half-mast at the school on Wednesday.\nJubilee Church, which Daniel was a member of, expressed their \"immense sadness\" at the \"sudden and tragic death\".\nSeparately, the school where his mother works, Holy Family Catholic School, has issued a statement naming her as Mrs Anjorin. \nIt said: \"It is with great sadness that I share with you the news of the death of the child of one of our staff members.\n\"Please keep Mrs Anjorin, her husband and their other children in your prayers.\"\nJanti Charalambous, whose son attended Snaresbrook Prep School with Daniel, dropped off a bag of supplies to the Anjorin family on Wednesday afternoon.\nThe family friend told reporters: \"Daniel was an amazing young man.\n\"He was good at his studies. He was good at his sports. Very much loved by many, many people and came from a wonderful family.\n\"The family are in shock. Obviously they are very heartbroken. He was such a young boy taken away from his family.\n\"It's sad that it's happened in a family, a community, like this. It's heart-breaking.\n\"At least they got their time to spend with Daniel, 14 years. Their faith is sustaining them and we are all supporting them in any shape or form that they need.\n\"He was a joyful boy - he brought his family lots of joy and his life has just been taken away. Just walking out on his way to school. He was much-loved, his family are much-loved.\n\"I was talking to my son and he was so heartbroken, he can remember Daniel driving his little car and playing in the street.\n\"He said he can't imagine it happening to his own brother.\"\nSpeaking to LBC, Met Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said: \"The first thing you have to say is for the parents involved, who've lost their 14-year-old, and that is just horrific, and it's everyone's worst nightmare.\n\"I'm sure we're all thinking about them.\"\nThe Met said urgent checks on their system had so far found no traces of the suspect having previous involvement with the police but it was \"investigating further for certainty\".\nIt confirmed he had not been arrested by officers on Monday.\n\"An arrest did take place at Copperwell on Monday, 29 April which relates to a different person and a separate incident,\" a spokesperson said.\nGrace O'Malley-Kumar die",
    "The US central bank again said it would keep interest rates unchanged, noting a \"lack of further progress\" toward lowering inflation.\nThe decision left the Federal Reserve's key rate hovering at the highest level in more than two decades, in the range of 5.25%-5.5%, where it has stood since last July.\nBy keeping borrowing costs high, the Fed is hoping to cool the economy and reduce the pressures pushing up prices.\nBut with inflation in the US proving more persistent than expected, the bank is facing questions about its next move.\nAnalysts who had expected the bank to start cutting rates early this year have been forced to postpone forecasts - and some have even raised the possibility of a rate rise. \nAt a press conference following the announcement, Fed chairman Jerome Powell said he thought that a rate increase was \"unlikely\", while repeating that officials wanted greater confidence that inflation was easing before moving to cut. \n\"It really will depend on the data,\" he said. \n\"It's going to take longer to reach that point of comfort. I don't know how long it will take,\" he added. \nIn the US, consumer prices rose 3.5% over the 12 months to March.\nThat is down sharply from the 9.1% rate seen in June 2022, but remains above the Fed's 2% target, ticking higher in recent months. \nIn its statement announcing its latest decision on Wednesday, the Fed drew attention to those trends, noting \"a lack of further progress\" bringing inflation back to its goal.\n\"The statement explicitly recognises the recent deterioration in inflation dynamics,\" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.\n\"Patience is the watchword now for the Fed and the risk of fewer or no rate cuts this year is growing.\" \nThe Fed has left rates untouched since last July, after boosting them aggressively from near zero in March 2022.\nHigher interest rates trickle out to the public in the form of more expensive mortgages, car and business loans and other debt.\nThe Fed's moves are being closely watched around the world where many central banks, including the Bank of England, have also had a prolonged period of sharply raised rates. \nMr Powell said policymakers in other countries may move more quickly than the US to cut rates due to worries about economic slowdown.\n\"The difference between the United States and other countries that are now considering rate cuts is they're just not having the kind of growth we're having,\" he said. \"We can be patient.\"\nSeparately, the Fed also outlined its previously-discussed plans to slow the pace at which it is shrinking its holdings of US Treasuries.\nIt built up those holdings as part of its stimulus efforts to bolster the economy when the pandemic hit in 2020, starting to reverse the moves two years later. \nMr Powell said the decision to slow that process was aimed at avoiding disruption to financial markets and not intended to influence the inflation fight.",
    "Europeans in 27 countries vote in June in elections that will have a wide impact across the European Union and beyond.\nAbout 400 million voters are eligible to vote from Finland in the north to Cyprus in the south, Ireland in the west to Bulgaria in the east.\nAt stake is the make-up of the next European Parliament, the direct link between Europeans and the EU's institutions.\nHow Europeans vote will shape the direction of the EU over the next five years, on climate change and migration, greater integration or increased nationalism.\nRight-wing and far-right parties have made significant gains across Europe, and this shift to the right is likely to be reflected in the next European Parliament. \nThe Parliament, based in Brussels and Strasbourg, passes laws that affect the lives of EU citizens and has the job of endorsing the annual budget, which this year reached \u20ac189bn (\u00a3160bn).\nThe result of the elections also has a bearing on who will be president of the European Commission.\nVoting starts on Thursday 6 June in the Netherlands, followed by Ireland and Malta on the following day and Latvia and Slovakia on Saturday. Many EU member states vote on Sunday 9 June.\nMost voting takes place on one day although Czechs have Friday and Saturday to cast their ballots, and Italians vote on Saturday and Sunday. Belgians are not just voting in European elections on Sunday, but in national and regional elections too.\nIn most EU countries you have to be 18 to vote, but if you're 16 you can vote in Germany, Austria, Belgium and Malta, while in Greece the minimum age is 17. In a handful of countries including Luxembourg and Bulgaria, voting is compulsory.\nResults are decided by proportional representation, so every vote counts, although some countries have a minimum electoral threshold of up to 5%. Average turnout in 2019 was 50.7%.\nBy the end of 9 June, it will be clear which parties have won the Parliament's 720 seats, 15 more than in 2019. The UK took part in the last European elections before leaving the EU, and some of its seats have since been redistributed or kept in reserve if the EU expands.\nThe number of MEPs each country has is proportionate to its population. Germany, the EU's most populous country, has 96. Malta, Luxembourg and Cyprus have the minimum number of six each.\nAs the only EU institution directly elected by voters across 27 countries, it connects European citizens to the two other big institutions: the EU's executive branch - the European Commission - and the Council, which is made up of ministers from EU governments.\nThe European Parliament shapes the direction of EU laws and policies by amending and passing laws and deciding on international agreements and enlargements. It must endorse the EU's annual budget, and it can ask the Commission to propose legislation. \nMEPs oversee the work of the Commission and Council. They share responsibility with the Council for adopting laws put forward by the Commission.\nMost MEPs sit in political groups ranging from left to right, rather than by nationality, so they often have juggle allegiances to party or country. \nTraditionally the two biggest are the centre-right European People's Party (EPP) and the centre-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), but others groups have become increasingly significant.\nThe liberal Renew Europe group and the Greens/European Free Alliance were the next biggest in the last parliament, but two groups on the right have set their sights on big gains.\nThey are the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and the Identity and Democracy (ID) group. \nTwo smaller groups play a key role too. One is the smaller left-wing GUE/NGL grouping, the other is the MEPs not aligned to any group - from Hungary's nationalist Fidesz members to the handful of separatists from Spain's Catalonia region.\nAlthough the main purpose of the June election is to decide the make-up of parliament, voters often use the occasion to send a message to their national governments. \nFrom Italy to France, Austria to Belgium, Germany to the Netherlands and beyond, parties on the far right are eyeing significant gains.\nPolls suggest the two groups on the right, ECR and ID, could overtake the centre left and become the second largest force in Parliament.\nUntil now the centre right has tended to work together with the centre left but the EPP may come under pressure to seek new allies if the centre left performs badly.\nA move to the right could put the brakes on plans for new climate and sustainability laws and influence social or economic legislation. The EU's strong backing for financial and military aid for Ukraine could also be affected.\nOne of the first tasks of the new MEPs will be to elect the president of the European Commission. The current president, Ursula von der Leyen, is seeking re-election.\nThe EU's 27 heads of state or government, known as the European Council, will factor in theelection results and then nominate a candidate, whose name is the",
    "Kenyans living in areas at risk of flooding or landslides will be asked to evacuate on Wednesday, the country's president has said.\nWilliam Ruto was speaking in Mai Mahiu, north of Nairobi, where an overflowing reservoir has wiped out a swathe of houses and swept dozens of people to their death.\nThis is \"not a time for guesswork\" he said, noting the forecast for more heavy rain. \n\"The likelihood of flooding and people losing [their] lives is real\", he added.\nAlthough no definitive number was given, an evacuation order of this scale is likely to target many thousands of people. \nThe government has told people it will help resettle them in approved areas and warned those who refuse to leave could be removed by force.\nHowever, ministers have not yet released any detail on the evacuation plans, and it is unclear how many might have to move, and in what form they will be notified.\nA government spokesman told local media there were 52 centres, including social halls, set aside to host the affected people, and more could be added if needed.\nThe weather agency has said heavy rains will continue until Monday in many regions of the country.\nThe rainy season has been extra punishing this year, and weeks of flooding have killed at least 170 people.\nBut the disaster at Mai Mahiu has been the most catastrophic so far.\nThe reality is still sinking in for those who had hoped their missing loved ones had survived.\n\"My brother was in his 70s when he died after being washed away,\" 62-year-old Nancy Wanjiku told the BBC. \nShe spoke to us sitting on the wreckage of what was once her parents' home.\n\"My mum and dad are safe but we have lost everything,\" she added.\nElsewhere, we saw a woman on the side of the road bent over double crying, losing herself in the news that the body of her child had been found.\nRescue workers continued the search for more of the dead. \nWe followed them down along the blasted banks of the Ngeya River - mostly members of the National Youth Services in bright yellow vests carrying shovels, rakes and sticks to poke through the branches of uprooted trees.\nSome stopped at an enormous heap of broken branches that covered a crushed house. A family of six had lived there and the workers suspected they might be buried under the mound.\nThey called in a bulldozer to clear out the debris, but it did not find evidence of a watery death.\nNot far from here we met Stephen Kamau, 31, helping a neighbour to sift through what is left of their home.\n\"I'm trying to salvage things that were carried away by water and look for missing people as well,\" he explained.\n\"I woke up in a different world. Everything had been swept by water.... We are in fear. My heart is heavy.\"\nFurther downstream, a rescue team found the body of a woman tucked away in logs at the top of a bridge. Onlookers recognised her as someone who had worked at a local 24-hour car wash.\nAnother woman, who did not identify herself, trekked to the site to see if her three missing sisters had washed up there. \nHer brother had searched for them in a nearby hospital, but came back empty-handed, she said. \nShe had stayed awake all night, worried that another tide of water would crash down on her while she was sleeping.\nThe terror of that flash-flood on Sunday night - triggered when water built up in a gully because a tunnel was blocked - is still vivid.\nDavid Karanja has just returned from the morgue to view the body of his 9-year-old son Paul.\nHe stands with his eyes downcast and his arm in a sling, next to corrugated-iron roof panels lurching over the shell of his still-standing home, while he and his 17-year-old daughter Veronica told their story.\nLike others that lived in the river valley, they were awakened by the roar of water at 03:00 local time (00:00 GMT) on Monday.\nThey rushed to switch off the power to avoid electric shock, but when David opened the door, Veronica was swept away. She says she clung to a tree branch until the water subsided.\nWhen she made it back to the house, she couldn't find her father right away - until she heard people calling her name.\n\"He was hit by a stone,\" she told the BBC. \"When he was trying to rescue my brother, a stone from the upper side of the wall hit his hand, and he let [Paul] go, and that's why [Paul] drowned.\"\nThe family lived off their livestock - all gone now. Their 900 hens perished. And of 21 pigs, only five are left. \"We have totally nothing right now,\" Veronica said.\nThey are appealing for help, and President Ruto promised government support when he stopped at a local school sheltering survivors.\nThose gathered were told they would get help rebuilding their houses, but not next to the river if experts deemed it possible they could once again be in the pathway of such destruction.\nMr Ruto said the authorities had mapped all fragile places in the country prone to floods and landslides, and that the army had been mobilised to help the evacuations.\nHe did not say where they would go, nor exactly from where the resourc",
    "Nigeria has raised salaries for civil servants by between 25% and 35% amid to help them cope with the rising cost of living.\nThe lowest-paid government employee will now earn $324 (\u00a3258) a year, Reuters news agency reports.\nPolice and military officers are among state workers who are set to benefit from the pay rises, which will be backdated to January.\nThe announcement came on the eve of Wednesday's Workers' Day holiday.\nHowever, the rate of inflation is currently more than 30% - the highest figure in nearly three decades.\nThe cost of food has risen even more - by 35%, according to the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics, so the pay rises mean that salaries for civil servants stay roughly the same in real terms - what it can buy in the shops and markets.\nPensions for those workers who benefit were also increased by between 20% and 28%, the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC) said. \nThe hikes come after the government recently raised the salaries of academic staff members and healthcare workers. \nHowever, the monthly minimum wage, set by the government and which all employers are supposed to observe, has not changed since 2019, when it was put at 30,000 naira - this is now worth just $19 (\u00a315) after a sharp fall in the value of the naira over recent months.\nThe government also recently increased electricity tariffs for consumers who use the most power as it seeks to wean the economy off subsidies that have weighed heavily on public finances.\nThe trade union umbrella group, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), welcomed the latest pay increase but urged the government to ensure that it was reflective of the harsh economic situation in the country.\n\"These categories of workers are already in the privileged sector but we expect it to be extended also to other categories of civil servants who are in lower cadre and are vulnerable,\" NLC spokesman Comrade Benson Upah told local media. \nNegotiations are ongoing between the government and the main labour unions about an increase in the minimum wage.\nFood prices as well as the prices of goods and services have doubled in many parts of the country since the removal of a fuel subsidy last year.\nPetrol shortages have worsened in Nigeria's major cities, with long queues observed since last week, as Africa's biggest oil producer struggled with a fuel scarcity.\nAuthorities blamed the shortage on supply disruptions due to logistical challenges. \nMost of Nigeria's oil is exported, while the fuel which is used locally is mostly imported due to a lack of refining capacity.",

    "US secretary of state Antony Blinken has told Israel and Hamas that \"the time is now\" for a deal to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza and free the remaining hostages held there.\nMr Blinken said a deal was on the table and Hamas should agree to it.\nMediators are awaiting a response from Hamas to the latest proposal. \nIt reportedly involves a 40-day ceasefire and the release of more than 30 Israeli hostages in exchange for many more Palestinian prisoners.\n\"We are determined to get a ceasefire that brings the hostages home and to get it now, and the only reason that that wouldn't be achieved is because of Hamas,\" Mr Blinken said as he met Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv.\n\"There is a proposal on the table, and as we've said, no delays, no excuses. The time is now.\"\nA senior Hamas official has denied the group is to blame for delays on reaching a new deal.\nFamilies of the hostages were demonstrating outside and Mr Blinken greeted them, saying setting their loved ones free was \"at the heart of everything we're trying to do\".\nAbout 130 hostages from among 253 kidnapped by Hamas during its unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October remain unaccounted for. At least 34 of them are presumed dead. The rest have been released or rescued.\nThe top US diplomat later visited the Israeli port of Ashdod, about 30km (20 miles) north of Gaza, where he insisted that Israel had made meaningful concessions to reach a hostage and ceasefire deal.\nMr Blinken said Israel had made progress on getting more aid into Gaza but this needed to be accelerated given the immense scale of need.\nAshdod was recently opened to aid shipments destined for Gaza, where the UN has warned of severe food shortages and looming famine.\nOn Wednesday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said 30 trucks of humanitarian supplies from Jordan had for the first time entered northern Gaza via the Erez crossing.\nMr Blinken also repeated the US position that Israel should not launch a military incursion into the overcrowded southern city of Rafah without a clear plan to protect more than a million Palestinians who have been sheltering from the war there in dire humanitarian conditions. \n\"On Rafah itself - our position is clear, it has not changed, it won't change. We cannot, will not support a major military operation in Rafah absent an effective plan making sure that civilians are not harmed. We have not seen such a plan,\" he said.\nRafah is the only major city in Gaza that IDF ground forces have not taken control of during half a year of war. However the city has been repeatedly hit by deadly Israeli air strikes.\nOn Tuesday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - who also met Mr Blinken on Wednesday - said Israel would launch an invasion of Rafah regardless of truce talks with Hamas.\n\"We will enter Rafah and we will eliminate the Hamas battalions there with or without a deal, in order to achieve the total victory,\" he said.\nMembers of Mr Netanyahu's governing coalition are divided on the issue. Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Israeli TV a Rafah operation would be suspended if there was a deal. But far-right ministers have said if that happens they will bring down the government.\nThe UN, Western allies of Israel and humanitarian agencies have all warned that an assault on Rafah risks a humanitarian disaster.\nWest Bank-based Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said it would be the \"biggest catastrophe in the Palestinian people's history\" because, he said, it would trigger large-scale displacement of Palestinians out of Gaza entirely.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 253 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 34,500 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",
    "Arizona's Senate has voted to repeal a 1864 law banning abortion, the last major push in the Democrat-led effort to erase the law from state books. \nTwo Republicans joined Senate Democrats to support the repeal bill, which narrowly passed the House last week. \nGovernor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, hailed the result and is due to formalise the removal of the law.\nThe pre-statehood law bars abortion from the moment of conception, with no exceptions for rape or incest. \nIt was revived last month after Arizona's top court ruled the ban could be enforced following the US Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v Wade in June 2022, a landmark ruling which rescinded the nationwide right to abortion. \nThe decision unleashed an uproar across the country, where voters broadly support abortion access and galvanised efforts to put an abortion question on the ballot in November, which would expand rights in the state. \nAnd for Republicans staring down autumn elections, the ban posed a major political dilemma, with legislators caught between the party's conservative base and more moderate swing voters who decried the Civil War-era bill as draconian.\nSome leading Republicans including former President Donald Trump and former Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, distanced themselves from the law, suggesting it was out of step with the state's voters. \nThe repeal bill was passed 16-14 on Wednesday after two Republicans, Shawnna Bolick and TJ Shope broke ranks with their party, voting yes on the one-line repeal bill. \nBoth were criticised by their colleagues, who described their votes as a betrayal of \"pro-life\" values. \n\"The epitome of delusion is saying I am pro-life yet voting to repeal an abortion ban,\" said Senator Anthony Kern, who called the 1864 law \"the best abortion ban in the nation\". \nVoting to repeal is \"voting for death\", he said. Mr Kern was one of the fake electors indicted last week for his role in an alleged scheme to overturn the 2020 election in favour of Donald Trump. \nExplaining her vote, Ms Bolick recounted her experience receiving an abortion during an unviable pregnancy - an option, she said, that may have been unavailable under the 1864 law, which includes exceptions for the life of the mother.  \nThe abortion \"was very tough\", she said. \"Would Arizona's pre-Roe law have allowed me to have this medical procedure, even though at the time my life wasn't in danger?\" \nNational anti-abortion activists, too, condemned the two politicians, criticising what they described as political cynicism. \n\"This blueprint of irresponsibility and cowardice will be emulated across the nation by other opportunistic Republicans who gladly wear the pro-life cape for donor dollars but stab the movement in the back when it's time to act,\" said Chanel Prunier, vice-president of political affairs for anti-abortion group Students for Life Action. \nIf the repeal is signed by Governor Hobbs, abortions in Arizona will be governed by 2022 law, which prohibits abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy with exceptions only in cases of medical emergency. There are no exceptions for rape or incest. \nHowever, that could change in November when Arizonans are expected to vote on a ballot question that would protect abortion access until 24 weeks of pregnancy. \nSimilar ballot initiatives in Republican-controlled states since Roe was overturned have all delivered wins for the pro-choice movement.

    "Fans have reacted with shock and confusion as Manchester's troubled new Co-op Live arena called off its opening concert at the last minute.\nThousands were queueing to see rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie at the \u00a3365m venue when his show was cancelled.\nOne fan told the BBC it was \"very unprofessional\", while another criticised the \"bad organisation\".\nThe arena has had a series of problems, and later said Olivia Rodrigo's shows this weekend would also not go ahead.\nSome fans outside the venue were handed a sheet of paper saying A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie's gig had been cancelled for \"technical reasons\".\nYasin, 20, told BBC Newsbeat he paid \u00a325 for parking and arrived at the venue to be handed one of the pieces of paper.\nHe said: \"I'm thinking, is this real? Why isn't it online? It was very unprofessional, I couldn't believe it almost, like is this the way we're finding out that it's been cancelled?\"\nYasin said he had been looking forward to attending the show and had been listening to the rapper's music \"on repeat\" for two weeks.\n\"It makes me question future events, if they're going to be planned properly or if it's going to be organised enough\", he added.\nThe venue later put the cancellation down to a part of the heating and ventilation system coming loose during the soundcheck before Wednesday's show. \nFan Katie Barnsley, who travelled up from Kent for the gig, found out it had been cancelled just as she was about to get a tram from Manchester city centre to the arena in the Etihad Campus.\nThe 28-year-old insurance broker had travelled up from near Dover with her partner and his sister, and estimated they had spent around \u00a3600 on tickets, accommodation and petrol.\nShe said: \"We were going on the tram and were asking the attendant how we got to the campus and he said, 'Don't bother, it's been cancelled'. \n\"Then I went on Twitter and saw the tweet from the arena.\" \nMs Barnsley said she had been apprehensive about travelling to Manchester because of the cancellation of earlier gigs at the venue but had been reassured by recent tweets from Co-op Live saying other shows would be going ahead.\nComedian Peter Kay had been due to open the venue last week but his shows have now been postponed twice, while a concert by US rock band The Black Keys has also already been scrapped.\nSome fans found out about Wednesday's cancellation on social media. The venue posted at 18:40 that the show would no longer go ahead - which was 10 minutes after doors had been due to open.\nOthers heard when the news spread by word of mouth outside.\n\"We found out from other members of the public telling us, to save us from queuing up - not that there were any actual management telling us,\" said Radhika, 17, from Manchester.\n\"I just think personally it's bad management, bad organisation.\"\nZack, also 17, had come from Blackpool for the show. \"I'm on crutches and we queued up for about two hours, wasting our time,\" he said. \n\"They came out with these sheets of paper saying 'we're sorry about this', but we'd found out already from people shouting, people running around shouting that it's cancelled before they [the staff] even came out themselves.\"\nTeoni Kirkham, 21, said: \"We literally hopped out of our Uber and just saw everybody turning around and walking the opposite way. We found out literally when we got here.\n\"It's just messy, really. It seems like there's no organisation. With Ticketmaster on my phone, I thought, surely if it's been cancelled I would have got notification. They've not done a good job I don't think.\"\n\"We knew that the other ones had been cancelled last week,\" added Lucas Sheriff, who had travelled from Sheffield. \"So we were a bit unsure whether this was going to get cancelled.\" The eventual announcement was \"very last minute\", he said.\n\"If we'd found out at least in the afternoon, we would have been a bit less disappointed.\"\nJamie Cornwall, 21, had come from Lincoln, and also found out on the way to the venue. \"I got sent away by the security and told to go back home,\" he said.\n\"Technical issues? You'd think they would have solved that. I know a few events have already been cancelled. So it's not great. You see all these sad faces everywhere.\"\nA Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, real name Julius Dubose, wrote on social media: \"Something happened with the venue while I was at soundcheck today that caused cancellation of the show.\n\"We are working on rescheduling in the next few days.\n\"I'm heated about the situation too, but safety first Manchester, I got you, just stay tuned for further info.\"\nA spokesman for the venue said: \"We appreciate the inconvenience this will cause for many, and are deeply sorry for all those impacted.\"",
    "Florida's six-week abortion ban has come into force, closing the door - for now - on the last major abortion access point in the US South. \nAnti-abortion campaigners have celebrated the new legislation - which replaces an existing 15-week law - as the gold standard of abortion policy and a major victory in the country's battle over abortion access. \nBut pro-choice campaigners say the ban will push an overstretched system to the brink. \nThey worry the new law in Florida, which had been the last state in the region without a near-total ban, will effectively cut off abortion access for more than 21 million women of reproductive age across nearly a dozen states.\n\"This essentially creates an abortion desert in the south-east part of our country,\" said Michelle Quesada, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of South, East and North Florida. \"This will be devastating.\" \nAnd, activists say, the near-total ban will put women's health at risk, pointing to cases involving pregnancy complications in states like Texas. \nBut the change may be undone as soon as November, when Floridians will vote on a ballot measure known as Amendment 4, which could protect abortion access until around 24 weeks of pregnancy.\nBoth the new ban and the looming vote have set up perhaps the highest-stakes abortion fight since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade two years ago and rescinded the nationwide right to abortion.\nAfter that landmark ruling in June 2022, most Republican-controlled states moved to restrict abortion outright or at six weeks gestation, a point at which many women do not yet know they are pregnant. \nFlorida was an outlier. \nAbortion there was legal until 15 weeks, making it a relative haven for women seeking the procedure in the region. \nAfter Roe v Wade was overturned, Florida became \"one of the main points of access for abortion care within the formal healthcare system in the south\", said Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a data scientist at the pro-choice research group the Guttmacher Institute.\nMore than 84,000 abortions took place in Florida last year - a 12% jump from 2020.\nMore than half of that increase is attributed to out-of-state patients, Mr Maddow-Zimmet said, an estimated 9,000 people in 2023 alone.  \nFlorida's new law restricts abortions after six weeks from the date of a woman's last menstrual period. \nPatients must also appear for two in-person appointments spaced at least 24-hours apart - a requirement that providers say will be a challenge in an already restrictive time window. \nThe new law \"makes it virtually impossible for people to be able to access care in time\", said Daniela Martins, a spokeswoman for the Women's Emergency Network (WEM), an abortion fund in south Florida.\nThe law includes limited exceptions for victims of rape, incest, or human trafficking up until 15 weeks of pregnancy, with patients required to show documentation such as medical records or a police report. It also includes exceptions for fatal foetal abnormalities and for the life of the mother.\nAbortion providers and campaigners say that many patients will fall through the cracks - that they will either be unable to travel hundreds of miles to an appointment or unable find one in already overcrowded clinics in Virginia, North Carolina and Illinois, which are now some of the nearest states where abortion is broadly available. \n\"There's nowhere that can absorb all of the patients that we see [in Florida], it's just not possible,\" said Amber Gavin, vice-president of advocacy at A Woman's Choice, an independent abortion clinic with a location in Jacksonville.\nThe new law has been welcomed by anti-abortion activists and leading state Republicans, who had lamented Florida becoming a hub for out-of-state patients.\n\"We don't want to be an abortion tourism destination,\" Republican Governor Ron DeSantis said last year. His office did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. \nMr DeSantis signed the six-week ban into law last April, but it was held up by legal challenges until last month, when a state supreme court ruling cleared the way for its enforcement. \nMatt Staver, founder and chairman of the Florida-based anti-abortion group Liberty Counsel told the BBC that the state could now be \"a sanctuary for life\".\n\"This is a great day for protecting unborn children,\" he said. \nMr Staver emphasised that the six-week law also includes $30m (\u00a324m) allocated each year to support pregnant women and new mothers, money that will go towards baby formula, car seats, adoption and parenting classes.\n\"Florida is putting its money where its mouth is and protecting mothers and their children,\" he said.  \nAccording to March of Dimes, a non-partisan maternal health non-profit, pregnant women in Florida \"have a very high vulnerability\" to poor outcomes, with nearly a quarter of all expectant mothers receiving \"inadequate\" prenatal care.  \nBut a second ruling from the Florida Supreme Court means the ban might be temporary. \nOn the same day as the court green-lit t",

    "Disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein will face a new trial in the autumn after his state rape conviction was overturned, a judge ruled on Wednesday.\nManhattan prosecutors told the packed court: \"We believe in this case and will be retrying this case.\"\nAn appeals court ruled last week that Weinstein did not receive a fair trial in 2020.\nBut he remains jailed because of a separate rape conviction in California.\nWeinstein was sentenced to 16 years in prison in that case.\nAt the court in New York on Wednesday, prosecutors said they would be ready to retry the case by September.\nAt the start of proceedings, Weinstein was brought in in a wheelchair, wearing a navy-blue suit and a light blue tie.\nHe appeared to be in good spirits, and smiled and waved to his team.\nAssistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg told the judge that one of Weinstein's victims was also in court. \nShe said the \"sexual assault survivor\" was there \"to show she's not backing down and is here to make sure justice is served once again. He may have power and privilege, but she has the truth.\"\nThe judge overseeing the case ruled that Weinstein's retrial will happen sometime after the Labour Day holiday on 2 September.\nLast week, the New York state appeals court ruled that the judge overseeing the former Hollywood mogul's case had erred when he allowed the testimony of women who made allegations about Weinstein for which he was never charged. \nThe judge had \"erroneously admitted testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts against persons other than the complainants of the underlying crimes\", the appeals court ruled by a vote of 4 to 3.\nThe decision also said the trial judge compounded the error by letting Weinstein be cross-examined in a way that portrayed him in a \"highly prejudicial\" light.\n\"The remedy for these egregious errors is a new trial,\" the court found.\nWeinstein has always maintained his innocence and his defence team said at the time of the New York trial that sex between the movie executive and accusers was consensual.\nArthur Aidala, the movie mogul's lawyer, hailed the decision as a \"victory for every criminal defendant in the state of New York\".\nWeinstein was taken to hospital a few days ago for what his lawyer described as \"immediate medical attention\" and \"a myriad of tests\".\nHe could be sent to the city's Rikers Island prison, or possibly to California to serve time there. \nJuda Engelmawer, a spokesman for Weinstein, told BBC News that his health condition has worsened in prison, but he is elated to have had his conviction vacated. \n\"He was relieved that the court saw it the way we did - that the trial wasn't fair,\" he said outside court.\n\"But he acknowledges his long road ahead of him.\"\nMr Engelmawer added that Weinstein hopes to remain in New York pending re-trial, in order to be nearer to his family and doctors. \nIn court, his lawyer argued that despite his health issues, Weinstein is \"sharp as a tack, smart as he ever was\".\nMr Aidala said that his client had read hundreds of books, so he had no concerns about his mental ability to participate in his legal defence.\nAt his New York trial in 2020, Weinstein was convicted of sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006 and raping Jessica Mann, a former aspiring actress, in 2013. He was sentenced to 23 years.\nMs Haleyi has said she has reservations about returning to court again to attempt to re-convict Weinstein. \n\"It was retraumatising and gruelling and exhausting and all the things,\" she said at a news conference on Friday.\n\"I definitely don't want to actually go through that again. But for the sake of keeping going and doing the right thing and because it is what happened, I would consider it.\"\nMs Haleyi did not attend Wednesday's hearing in New York, but her attorney Gloria Allred appeared in court. \nSpeaking to press after the hearing, Ms. Allred said her client was still thinking about testifying again, but \"it's not an easy decision for her.\" Prosecutors in California say Weinstein's conviction for raping a woman in 2013 will stand up to any appeals challenge.\nWeinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct, assault and rape by over 100 women. \nThe decision by his accusers to come forward, and his subsequent conviction in New York and 23-year prison term galvanised the #MeToo movement against sex abuse by powerful men.\nWeinstein co-founded Miramax film studio, whose hits included Shakespeare in Love, which won best picture at the Academy Awards, and Pulp Fiction.\nMr Aidala told reporters that Weinstein was \"used to champagne and caviar\" and now is paying for crisps and M&M's at the prison commissary.\nHis films received more than 300 Oscar nominations and 81 statuettes.",
    "Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia announced on Wednesday that she will force a vote to remove Mike Johnson as speaker of the House.\nThe conservative firebrand filed the motion last month but held off on formally introducing it, which would require a vote on Mr Johnson's fate within two legislative days.\nAt the time, she described her action as a warning to the Republican leader. \nNow she has followed through on that threat.\nSpeaker Johnson put out a statement that her motion \"is wrong for the Republican conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country\".\nMr Johnson's support for a $61bn military aid package to Ukraine, approved by the House on 20 April, is partially responsible for Ms Greene forcing the vote.\n\"Mike Johnson is not capable of that job,\" Ms Greene said on Wednesday. \"He has proven it over and over again.\"\nOn Tuesday, Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives pledged to support Mr Johnson if his leadership was threatened - a show of gratitude for the speaker's co-operation on Ukraine aid, which was a priority for Democrats and President Joe Biden.\nMs Greene called the Democratic pledge \"a warm hug and a big wet sloppy kiss\" for the speaker.\nRepublican leaders, including former president Donald Trump, had reportedly pressured the Georgia congresswoman to back down from attempting to remove Mr Johnson, concerned that a Republican power struggle would harm the party's prospects in November's general election.\nLast October, Democrats voted with a handful of Republicans to remove Speaker Kevin McCarthy, setting off three weeks of Republican discord as several top candidates failed to win the near-unanimous party support needed to secure the gavel.\nMr Johnson ultimately prevailed -  in part because he was relatively unknown and had few connections to party leadership. But some Republicans, including Ms Greene, soured on him after he worked with Democrats to pass government funding legislation earlier this year.\n\"I voted for Mike Johnson because his voting record before he became speaker was conservative,\" Ms Greene said on Wednesday. \"Once he became speaker, he has become a man that none of us recognise.\"\nTwo other Republicans in the House have said they will back Ms Greene's effort, which would be enough in the narrowly divided chamber to remove the speaker with Democratic help. Instead, the Democrats have said they will vote with pro-Johnson Republicans to \"table\" the motion, effectively killing.\nMs Greene said she will introduce her motion to remove Mr Johnson next week.

    "Gordon Brown has called for police to investigate whether the publisher of the Sun and News of the World covered up phone hacking evidence.\nThe former prime minister told the BBC that civil court documents show News UK deleted emails to stop police seeing them.\nHe also believes his phone may have been hacked while in No 10 and could now take legal action.\nNews UK said Mr Brown's allegations were \"unfounded and wrong\". \nIn 2015, prosecutors said there was no evidence of corporate wrongdoing.\nHowever, Mr Brown said that decision was based on an \"incomplete picture\" of the case against News UK, previously known as News Group Newspapers.\nHe said: \"What we have is new evidence. What we now know was not available at the time, perhaps not even available to the police.\n\"What is coming out is the extent of the interference in people's civil liberties, the extent to which the organisation tried to cover up.\" \nHe said he was speaking out on behalf of \"ordinary families\" targeted by newspapers \"at the moment of greatest difficulty for them - grief, tragedy, accidents, murders\".\nVictims of phone hacking include the murdered teenager Milly Dowler and families bereaved by the 7 July 2005 terror attacks in London.\nMr Brown continued: \"The intrusion into their private lives at the time of grief was so extensive, whether it be by phone hacking, or by using private investigators or by investigating their family life and the relatives of people around them.\"\nThe police investigation into the company was brought to a halt in 2015 after the convictions of senior journalists including Andy Coulson, a former editor of the News of the World.\nThe company had accepted journalists at the tabloid were involved in wrong-doing and closed it down in 2011.\nIt has paid damages to hundreds of News of the World phone hacking victims, and has also settled cases brought by those targeted by the Sun, without admitting any liability.\nMore than 40 people are currently suing News UK for hacking their phones or unlawfully obtaining their private information.\nThe complex case is likely to go to trial next year but evidence is already being disclosed to the claimants' lawyers.\nA key question in the trial is likely to be why the company deleted more than 30 million emails in 2010 and 2011, when it knew it faced a police investigation over phone hacking.\nNine million emails, detailing important periods during the phone hacking saga, were \"irretrievably lost\", according to court documents.\nThe reasons for the email deletion policy are at the centre of claims the firm was involved in a corporate cover-up which went beyond the wrong-doing of individual reporters and private investigators.\nNews UK has always insisted it was clearing out old computer servers, but claimants say it was deleting evidence at the time the police investigation was expanding. \nThey have accused the company in court filings of inventing a false \"security threat\" to provide another reason why emails needed to be deleted.\nCourt documents filed by the claimants suggest senior figures at the News UK believed an insider sympathetic to the Labour Party had leaked emails belonging to chief executive Rebekah Brooks.\nThey believed these had been passed to a third party, who had then met and discussed them with Gordon Brown.\nThe court documents suggest the company decided to delete Mrs Brooks's emails to prevent further leaks.\nOn Wednesday, Mr Brown discussed this claim for the first time, describing it as an \"an attempt to blame someone else... when, of course, they themselves were guilty of destroying evidence\".\nHe denied ever being passed information relating to Mrs Brooks, adding: \"The police should never have accepted their explanation.\"\nMr Brown has never taken legal action against News UK but revealed he is now considering it.\nHe said it was possible that his phone was hacked between 2005 and 2007 when he was chancellor, and for the three years he was prime minister, before losing the 2010 election.\nMr Brown said he had a personal mobile phone at the time, and believes his voicemail messages may have been accessed.\nHe continued: \"If a prime minister was having his phone hacked by News Group, then that is a very serious matter.\n\"And we need to get all the evidence about what happened, what didn't happen, what was happening at their headquarters.\n\"I think that is all still to come out. And that's why although time has passed, we must not allow this to happen again because of a failure to investigate what happened in the past.\"\nIn response, News UK said Mr Brown's allegations related to events from over a decade ago which are the subject of current legal proceedings in the civil courts. \nA spokesperson added: \"There is absolutely no evidence to support the assertion that Mr Brown's voicemails were intercepted and this is denied.\" \nThe company has also denied in court documents it deleted millions of emails because they were \"potentially incriminating\", pointing out that many had been back",
    "US author Paul Auster, who wrote the New York Trilogy mystery novels, has died at the age of 77.\nAuster wrote more than 30 books across his career and gained cult status in the 1980s and 90s.\nHis novels were often existentialist stories about outsiders, and were particularly successful in Europe.\nThe writer died on Tuesday at his home in Brooklyn due to complications from lung cancer, his friend and fellow author Jacki Lyden confirmed.\nIn March 2023, Auster's wife, author Siri Hustvedt, announced he had been diagnosed with cancer.\nThe son of Jewish Polish immigrants, Auster grew up in Newark, New Jersey, later moving to New York to attend Columbia University.\nAfter graduating, he spent four years in France, where he honed his craft as a writer.\nThe sudden death of his father prompted Auster to write 1982's The Invention of Solitude, a haunting reflection on father-son relationships, which became a recurring theme.\nBut his breakthrough came with The New York Trilogy, a philosophical twist on the detective genre centred on a shady quartet of private investigators named Blue, Brown, Black and White.\nHis subsequent novels included Timbuktu and existential capers Moon Palace, The Music of Chance and Leviathan.\nAuster was praised for his sharp dialogue, and his books have been translated into more than 40 languages. \nIn addition, Auster wrote the screenplay for 1995's Smoke, a film about a Brooklyn tobacco shop, starring Harvey Keitel, which won the writer an Independent Spirit Award.\nHe also co-directed the follow-up, Blue in the Face, which starred Keitel again.\nIn 2017, Auster published 866-page novel 4321, which charted US society through the life of an everyman, Archie Ferguson.\nThe author was said to have considered it his masterwork, although it received mixed reviews from critics.\nLast year, Auster published Bloodbath Nation along with his photographer son-in-law Spencer Ostrander, which focused on gun violence in America.\nAuster's text was accompanied by Ostrander's black-and-white pictures from the sites of 30 mass shootings.\nIn recent years, Auster's own life was struck by tragedy, with his 10-month-old granddaughter Ruby dying after ingesting heroin and his son Daniel, the child's father, dying of an overdose 10 months later.\nPrior to his death, Daniel had been found guilty of negligent homicide. Auster never publicly discussed their deaths.",
    "The number of BBC World Service journalists working in exile is estimated to have nearly doubled, to 310, since 2020.\nThe figures, released for the first time ahead of World Press Freedom Day, reflect press crackdowns in Russia, Afghanistan, and Ethiopia.\nJournalists from other countries, including Iran, have lived abroad for more than a decade. \nMany face jail sentences, death threats and harassment, both on and offline. \n\"The only way they can carry on reporting is to be forced out of their homes,\" says the director of the BBC World Service, Liliane Landor. \"The increase we're seeing in the numbers of journalists in exile is extremely concerning for press freedom.\"\nWhen the Taliban took control in Afghanistan in August 2021, the BBC pulled most of its team out of the country. Female staff were no longer allowed to work, while their male colleagues also faced threats.\nIn 2022, after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia introduced a new censorship law, meaning anyone criticising the war could be prosecuted. \"I'm calling a war, a war, and for that I could be easily jailed,\" says Nina Nazarova, a correspondent for BBC Russian, which has moved its Moscow team to Latvia. \nIn April this year, Nina's colleague, BBC Russian correspondent Ilya Barabanov, was labelled a \"foreign agent\", accused of \"spreading false information\" and opposing the war. He and the BBC reject this and are disputing it in court. \nJournalists in Myanmar and Ethiopia have also seen increased pressure, which has left them unable to report freely.\nJodie Ginsberg, from the Committee to Protect Journalists, says the number of exiled journalists it offers financial and legal support to has increased by 225% in the past three years.\n\"We've got near record number of journalists in jail, the killing of journalists has reached a high not seen since 2015,\" she adds. \nRegimes - such as Russia, Iran and Saud Arabia - are becoming increasingly desperate to control the narrative inside and outside their countries, she says.\n\"I watch my back,\" says BBC Persian correspondent Jiyar Gol. When he enters a room now, he says he looks for an escape route. \"I have a lot of security cameras in my house. I was warned it would be smart to change my daughter's school.\"\nJiyar hasn't been to Iran since 2007. When his mother died he couldn't go to her funeral. He has managed to cross the border to visit her grave.\nBut since his wife died of cancer four years ago, he has become more cautious. \"If something happened to me, what will happen to my daughter? That's something that's really in the back of my mind all the time,\" he says.\n\"The Iranian regime has grown bolder,\" he adds. \"They are under strict sanctions, they don't care about what the international community thinks about them because they are isolated.\"\nIn March, a presenter for the independent broadcaster Iran International was stabbed in the leg outside his London home, and recently British counter-terrorism police warned of an increased threat to BBC Persian staff living in the UK. \nTen BBC Persian staff recently learned they had been sentenced to a year in prison in their absence. They found out after hackers leaked information from the Iranian judiciary.\nPreviously, the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has accused BBC Persian staff of inciting violence, hate speech and human rights abuses.\nOne World Service journalist in Africa, who spoke anonymously for fear of aggravating leaders in his home country, says his biggest fear is becoming stateless if his government refuses to renew his passport.\nFor Shazia Haya, from BBC Pashto, life in exile is laced with guilt. She was evacuated to the UK alone in 2022 when the Taliban took control in Afghanistan, leaving her parents and brother in Kabul. \n\"The night I left home, at around 02:00, I don't know why but I couldn't hug my younger brother.

    "Over 300 pro-Palestinian protesters at New York City university campuses were arrested Tuesday night after hundreds of police officers raided a building the students had taken over. \nDramatic footage showed police climbing a ladder to enter Hamilton Hall, which had been occupied at Columbia University, and later removing people handcuffed with zip ties. \nThe university had earlier told any students involved to leave or face expulsion.\nOfficials have said the building was cleared and no injuries were reported.\nThe New York Police Department (NYPD) said on Wednesday that nearly 300 people in total were arrested - including 119 at Columbia University and 173 from the nearby City College of New York - on charges of trespassing, criminal mischief and burglary.\nThe NYPD is still working to decipher who was affiliated with the university out of those who were arrested. \nAt Wednesday's news conference, New York Mayor Eric Adams said students had a \"right to protest\". \nBut he added: \"There's nothing peaceful about barricading buildings, destroying property or dismantling security cameras.\"\nThe demonstrators want the university to divest from Israel over its continuing deadly military operation in the Gaza Strip.\nThe Columbia protest is one of dozens across the country, including at campuses in Texas, California, Georgia, North Carolina, Utah, Virginia, New Mexico, California, New Jersey, Connecticut and Louisiana, where police have arrested more than 1,000 protesters.\nThe Columbia arrests came just before violence erupted over the war in Gaza at another campus hundreds of miles away on the West Coast. \nLengthy clashes broke out early Wednesday morning between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrators at the University of California in Los Angeles, after school administrators moved to shut down an encampment it called \"unlawful\". \nCounter-demonstrators clad in black arrived at the campus around midnight local time, before trying to tear down barricades around the encampment, the LA Times reported. Video footage showed flares and fireworks being set off, while other clips showed scuffles between the groups. \nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the scenes \"abhorrent and inexcusable\" and said police officers had arrived at the campus. \nIn New York, meanwhile, school officials authorised police officers to enter Hamilton Hall at Columbia University after student demonstrators inside defied a deadline to disperse. One student told the BBC that around 80-100 police stormed the building. \nColumbia said that after the hall was \"occupied, vandalised and blockaded, we were left with no choice\". In a letter to the New York Police Department (NYPD), President Minouche Shafik wrote that she requested police aid \"with the utmost regret\". \nOfficers said they used flashbang grenades to \"disorient protesters\" as the raid commenced, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. \nSome students could be heard shouting \"Shame on you!\" at the officers as they entered the building around 21:30 EST. \nNYPD Commissioner Edward Caban said those in the building tried to lock the police out, but officials were still able to gain access. \nSome students alleged that police clad in riot gear manhandled demonstrators as they stormed the building, with one telling the BBC that three people had been pushed down the stairs by NYPD officers. The interview was cut short moments later after an officer interrupted and slammed shut a window through which the conversation had been happening. \nNYPD assistant commissioner of public information, Carlos Nieves, defended the officers. He said that students had \"barricaded\" the doors to Hamilton Hall with \"conference tables, chairs or soda machines\". He alleged they had also blocked windows with newspaper so officers \"couldn't see\". \nHuge cheers of support by anti-war crowds were heard as the arrested students were marched off with their hands in zip ties. People also chanted: \"Let them go!\"\nThe activists have been occupying a tent camp at the Ivy League school in upper Manhattan for nearly two weeks.\nAll was relatively quiet on Columbia's campus on Wednesday as non-essential visitors are not allowed to enter. Some Columbia students could be seen packing up their possessions with the help of their parents. \nThe school has gone fully remote, and it will retain NYPD officers on campus until 17 May. \nNational politicians have called on colleges to do more, highlighting reports of antisemitism at some of the demonstrations.\nPresident Joe Biden earlier said demonstrations should be peaceful, but \"forcibly taking over buildings is not peaceful - it is wrong\".\nHis Democratic colleague, New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, condemned the police response at Columbia and urged Mayor Eric Adams to find a \"de-escalatory path\". \n\"This is the opposite of leadership and endangers public safety,\" she wrote. \"A nightmare in the making.

    "The union for senior civil servants is launching an unprecedented legal challenge to ministers' Rwanda plan. \nThe FDA said it was intervening because it feared the scheme to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda could force officials to break the law.  \nUnder a new law, ministers can ignore the European Court of Human Rights and direct officials to organise flights. \nThe union wants the High Court to rule on whether that element would put civil servants in a difficult legal position. \nThe FDA fears civil servants could be stuck between judges and ministers and that a direction to breach international law, would put them in conflict with the Civil Service Code. \nThe government said advice from Darren Tierney, its head of propriety and ethics, says the code would not be breached. \nIn a letter published on the government's website, Mr Tierney wrote: \"In implementing the decision, civil servants would be operating in accordance with the Civil Service Code, including the obligation not to frustrate the implementation of policies once decisions are taken.\n\"They would be operating in compliance with the law, which is the law enacted by Parliament under which the minister's specifically recognised and confirmed discretion would be exercised.\" \nThe Rwanda plan is the key part of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's pledge to stop migrants from crossing the English Channel in dangerous dinghies. \nThe Safety of Rwanda legislation overrules last November's Supreme Court decision which said that the country was not a safe place to send genuine refugees because they could be returned from there to their home countries and subjected to torture and abuse.\nIt also limits what kind of legal challenges they can present to the courts and, crucially, says ministers could choose to ignore a temporary order from the European Court of Human Rights to halt flights while a case is still being considered. \nIn practice, that would see ministers ordering key civil service leaders to prepare and send off flights, even if judges have said the case has not been settled. \nThe First Division Association (FDA), which represents those Whitehall leaders, said that measure means members fear they could be ordered to break both international law and the Civil Service Code, their legally-underpinned rule book.\nDave Penman, the FDA's general secretary, said its members were not taking a political view on whether the Rwanda plan was right or wrong - but they needed certainty about whether the measure places them in a conflict between ministers and the law.\n\"This [measure] is not an accident or down to poor drafting,\" he said.\n\"It's a political choice from the government, made not for the good of the country but to avoid upsetting either of the warring factions within its own party.\"\n\"It's also irresponsible. Civil servants know that they have to support the government of the day and implement policy, regardless of their political beliefs, but they also know they have a legal obligation to adhere to the Civil Service Code. \n\"Faced with a government that is prepared to act in this cowardly, reckless way, it is left to the FDA to defend our members and the integrity of the civil service.\"\nThe FDA will now ask the High Court to prioritise its case - but there is no guarantee that judges will do so. \nBut if the case goes to a full hearing - even though no departure dates have yet been set - it could temporarily paralyse the policy. \nIn a worst case scenario, judges could rule that the government has created an unlawful conflict that then prevents top civil servants from implementing the plan. \nEarlier on Wednesday, the Home Office confirmed \"a series of nationwide operations\" was under way to detain people across the country ahead of their removal to Rwanda. \nPhotographs and a video were released of immigration enforcement officers detaining several migrants at different residences, before they were led away in handcuffs and put into secure vehicles.\nEach person being considered for forcible removal to Rwanda must be given at least seven days' written notice of that intention and they have the right to launch a legal challenge.\nThe government had previously said it was aiming for flights to take off by the spring but now says this should happen in nine to 11 weeks. \nLabour has said it would scrap the Rwanda scheme if it wins the next election. \nHowever, asked several times whether the party would release those detained as part of the policy, Labour's deputy nation campaign coordinator Ellie Reeves would not say.\n\"We want to get people back to their own countries if their claims have failed which is why we would set up those return agreements and also recruit a thousand case workers,\" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. \nLabour have said they would allow those who have arrived on small boats to apply for asylum, something current arrivals are barred from doing.\nThe party added that no flights to Rwanda carrying asylum seekers would be scheduled by a Labo",
    "Felix Collins' job would not be suitable for anyone who is squeamish about insects.\nThe founder and boss of a company called Full Circle Biotechnology, he is in charge of 20 million black soldier fly larvae.\nBased at a small, indoor facility on the outskirts of Bangkok, the firm rears the insects to produce animal feed for the country's shrimp and pig farms.\nThe larvae, which live in a dark, warm and humid environment, feed on fruit and vegetable waste sourced from food and drink manufacturers, before being harvested and combined with probiotic bacteria and mushrooms.\nMr Collins says the product is a more environmentally-friendly alternative to the soybean-based animal feeds that dominate the market. The latter have been repeatedly linked to deforestation in South America.\nHe also claims that the firm's insect-based feed has a carbon footprint that is \"100 times lower than that of soymeal\".\nStudies agree that insect-based feed generally does have a lower carbon footprint, but only if the larvae have been fed natural food waste. If the insects have been given a processed food source, then one report says that soybean-based feed produces less carbon.\nMr Collins adds that the feed made by Full Circle, contains up to 70% protein, compared with soy, which has less than 50% protein - making the insect feed more filling and nutritious.\nFounded in 2019, Full Circle now employs 14 people, and supplies 49 farms across Thailand. It wants to increase this, but faces a hurdle - soybean-based feed is currently substantially cheaper.\nSoybean feed is presently around 460 euros ($490; \u00a3400) per tonne, compared with \u20ac1,400 for insect-based, according to one European comparison earlier this year.\nTo try to reduce the price of its feed, Full Circle is now turning to AI to help maximise production at a lower cost. To do this it is training an AI system to study all available past and present data on insect farming to determine and then continuously fine tune the best methods.\nThis can include everything from temperature to food quantity, the optimum space that the larvae need, quickly and accurately counting thousands of flies, and whether to introduce new strains or species.\n\"AI can help us speed up the process of trial and error, helping us overcome obstacles, and develop a thorough enough understanding of insect production, to be reasonably confident that our production is optimised,\" says Mr Collins.\n\"AI can help us process, record and understand every attempt at insect farming to date, and expand the potential for a larger and more nutritious crop every time we grow one.\"\nRead more stories on artificial intelligence\nSome 5,000 miles away in Lithuania, insect farm software provider Cogastro is also working on an AI-based system. It currently sells monitoring software that automatically collects data for users to analyse, but the AI upgrade will enable to system to learn, adapt and make changes inside an insect farm for itself.\nCogastro says it is not rushing the launch of the AI, and instead plans to launch it commercially in the next three years.\nIts founder and chief executive Mante Sidlauskaite, says she is wary of companies in the space that claim they already have AI systems readily available. \"We know from our example that it takes time to develop a layer of software, and we have been here already for five years.\n\"It has taken us time to work with as many companies as possible globally, to understand the differences and similarities of their processes, so that we would be able to standardise our data models to cover their overlapping needs. So we now have a baseline to build an AI solution.\n\"But when we see start-ups coming up just yesterday, and then announcing that they have something related to AI, they cannot have an accurate AI model before they start to train it, and to train it, you need to have some data, and to have data you need to have some customers first.\"\nShe adds that she is concerned about the overuse of AI as a buzzword, without firms explaining exactly how their AI supposedly works.\nBack at Full Circle, it is developing its AI system with a Singapore-based expert in the field called Simon Christofides.\nMr Collins says that as black soldier fly larvae have only been farmed commercially over the past decade and a half, there is still much to learn, and that the use of AI can rapidly speed up this process.\n\"Rice farmers are still trying to create the perfect crop after 13,500 years of passed down generational learning,\" he says. \"Black soldier fly larvae have been farmed for 0.1% of the time rice has been grown, and that's reflected in our current understanding.\"\nMr Collins adds that the firm's strategy will be to use AI to glean insights \"no human could ever achieve\", by using multiple sensors and crunching millions of data points.\nYet he adds that sometimes you just need to leave the flies to get on with things on their own. Such as the breeding process, whereby mature flies mate on green ribbons laid",
    "Kendrick Lamar has released a diss track attacking fellow rap star Drake, escalating their long-running feud.\nCalled Euphoria, the song is a response to weeks of taunting by Drake, who has taken pot-shots at Lamar on a series of viral diss tracks.\nOver six minutes, Lamar calls Drake a \"manipulator and habitual liar\", and criticises his parenting skills.\nHe also accuses the Canadian star of selling out, saying he only makes music to \"pacify\" fans.\nAnd he leaves listeners under no illusions about the strength of his feelings towards Drake. \n\"This ain't been 'bout critics, not about gimmicks, not about who the greatest,\" he raps. \"It's always been about love and hate, now let me say I'm the biggest hater.\"\n\"I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress.\"\nThe rappers' feud dates back to 2013, when Lamar was a relative newcomer. \nDuring a performance at the BET Awards, he boasted that his skills had \"tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pyjama clothes\". The line was interpreted as a reference to Drake, whose soul-baring blend of rap and R&B had changed the sound of hip-hop.\nThe feud simmered for a few years, boiling over again last year, when J Cole and Drake described themselves, along with Lamar, as the \"big three\" of rap, on the song First Person Shooter.\nThe seemingly innocuous comment went unremarked for months. Then, in the middle of March, Lamar delivered a fiery verse on Like That, declaring that there was no \"big three - it's just big me\".\nIn April, Drake released the first of two diss tracks, titled Push Ups, in which he mocked Lamar's height as well as his collaborations with Maroon 5 and Taylor Swift.\nLater that month, Drake dropped another song, Taylor Made Freestyle, in which he taunted Lamar, calling him a coward for failing to respond. \nThe track controversially used AI technology to imitate the voices of Snoop Dogg and the late Tupac Shakur - one of Lamar's heroes. \nAfter a complaint from Shakur's estate, Drake pulled the song off his Instagram.\nLamar's Euphoria similarly criticises the use of AI, saying it would \"make [Tu]pac turn in his grave\". \nHe also asks \"Am I battlin' ghost or AI?\" - a reference to the accusation that Drake has used ghostwriters in the past.\nLamar even addresses the time it took to record a response, with the combative lyric: \"Y'all think all of my life is rap? I got a son to raise, but I can see you know nothin' 'bout that.\"\nA former Pulitzer Prize winner for his fourth album, Damn, Lamar uses the song to display the dexterity of his voice, switching between flows and rhythmic meters throughout. \nHe even appears to be mimicking Drake's Toronto accent in the closing bars.\nHowever, fans who were hoping for a slam-dunk conclusion to the rap beef were disappointed.\nLamar conceded: \"I like Drake with with the melodies, I don't like Drake when he act tough,\" and declined to respond to Drake naming his wife on a previous song. \n\"We ain't gotta get personal, this a friendly fade, you should keep it that way,\" he rapped.\nThe rift has drawn in several other rappers over the last few months, with stars such as Kanye West, The Weeknd and Rick Ross releasing songs that reference the fall-out.\nDrake responded to Lamar's latest volley on Instagram, sharing a scene from the 1990s romcom 10 Things I Hate About You, where Julia Stiles' character recites a poem listing her grievances against Heath Ledger's \"bad boy\" character.\nIt's presumably intended as a parody of Lamar's lyrics - but Drake seems to have forgotten how the scene ends.\n\"I hate the way I don't hate you,\" says Stiles, choking back tears. \"Not even close, not even a little bit.\"",
    "FKA Twigs has revealed she has used artificial intelligence to create a deepfake of herself that will interact with fans and journalists so she can focus on her music.\nThe British singer, dancer and actress told a US Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Tuesday that celebrities and artists should have control over how their voices, looks and personalities are used by AI.\n\"In the past year, I have developed my own deepfake version of myself that is not only trained in my personality but that also can use my exact tone of voice to speak many languages,\" she said.\n\"These and similar technologies are highly valuable tools. This, however, is all under my control and I can grant or refuse consent in a way that is meaningful. \n\"What is not acceptable is when my art and my identity can simply be taken by a third party and exploited falsely for their own gain without my consent due to the absence of appropriate legislative control.\"\nShe added that her digital clone would be able to communicate in French, Korean and Japanese.\n\"It means that even with my upcoming album, I can really explain in depth what it's about creatively,\" she said.\n\"It also allows me to spend more time making art. Often being a music artist, or any artist in this day and age requires a lot of press and a lot of promo, a lot of one-liners.\n\"So it means if it's something simple that doesn't really require my heart, I can do a one-liner and give it to people to promote a piece of work and it's harmless, but ultimately I can spend more time making something that's really meaningful for my fans.\"\nIn further written evidence, she said her \"AI twigs\" would be deployed later this year \"to extend my reach and handle my online social media interactions, whilst I continue to focus on my art from the comfort and solace of my studio\".\nThe star argued that other people shouldn't be allowed to use an artist's voice and other features without their consent, saying that creators' \"careers and livelihoods are in jeopardy\" if there is not legislation to regulate the use of AI.\n\"There are songs online - collaborations with myself and other artists - that I didn't make,\" she told the committee.\n\"It makes me feel vulnerable because, first of all, as an artist, the thing that I love about what I do is that I'm very precise. I take my time with things and I'm very proud of my work.\n\"So the fact that somebody could take my voice, change lyrics, change messaging, maybe work with an artist that I didn't want to work with, or maybe work with an artist that I wanted to work with and now the surprise is ruined - it really leaves me very raw and very vulnerable.\"\nThe use of AI to impersonate the voices and images of well-known singers and rappers has been growing.\nIn early April, Jess Glynne, Mumford and Sons, Sam Smith and Zayn Malik were among the British artists who signed an international open letter calling for more protection against \"the predatory use of AI to steal artists' voices and likenesses\".\nOn Wednesday, a group of UK MPs published a report suggesting that musicians and other celebrities should be protected by a law that would ban AI-generated deepfakes in the UK.\nThe All-Party Parliamentary Group on Music said there should be legislation including \"a specific personality right to protect creators and artists from misappropriation and false endorsement\".\nSuch a law should also include other measures to protect musicians from the risk of AI becoming \"a destroyer of creators' livelihoods\", the MPs said in a report published on Wednesday.\nPoliticians must \"confront the danger that unfettered developments in AI could pose to the UK\u2019s musicians and music businesses\", said the cross-party group's chair, Labour MP Kevin Brennan.\nBut the power of AI can also be a force for good to \"help musicians to innovate and to inspire new human creativity\", he added.\n\n\"We ignore the necessity to sow policies, which will harvest the benefits of AI, and help stave off the threats it poses, at our peril,\" Mr Brennan said.\n\"Our central insight must always be that AI can be a great servant but would be a terrible master.\"\nIn response, a government spokesperson said: \"We are committed to helping artists and the creative industries work with the AI sector to harness the opportunities this technology provides, and ensure our music can continue to be enjoyed around the world.\n\u201cTrust and transparency are vital to this shared approach. We are working closely with stakeholders and will provide a further update in due course.\u201d\nThe government has already pledged that the creation of sexually explicit deepfake images will be made a criminal offence in England and Wales.",
    "Outgoing First Minister Humza Yousaf has said he \"paid the price\" for the way he ended the SNP's power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens.\nSpeaking for the first time since announcing his resignation, Mr Yousaf told BBC News ending the Bute House Agreement was the \"right decision\".\n\"But I have to acknowledge the manner in which I did it caused great upset and that's on me,\" he said. \nMr Yousaf announced on Monday that he would resign as first minister.\nHe intends to remain in office until a new SNP leader is named. \nA motion of no confidence in his government, which would have forced all SNP ministers to resign, was defeated by 70 votes 58 in the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday. \nMr Yousaf said it was clear to him that the SNP's power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens was \"coming to an end anyway\".\nGreen members had been asked to vote on whether to end a power-sharing deal with the SNP after it scrapped key climate change targets, and there was also disquiet from some within his own party about the alliance. \nHe said: \"In my mind, whether it was a matter of days or weeks, the Bute House agreement was coming to an end.\n\"That's why I say that ending the Bute House agreement was the right thing to do for the party and the country.\n\"But I accept fully the manner in which it was done clearly caused upset and therefore I've paid the price of that.\"\nThe first minister insisted he did not regret ending the deal, adding: \"I just regret the manner in which I ended it\".\nTension between the parties had increased following the announcement that NHS Scotland was pausing prescribing puberty blockers to under-18s referred by the country's only specialist clinic, following a report by Dr Hilary Cass.\nMr Yousaf said Green co-leader Patrick Harvie's response to the move - including his refusal to accept the Cass review as a valid scientific document - had \"upset a lot of people\" in the SNP but that it was \"not necessarily\" a factor in ending the Bute House Agreement. \nMr Yousaf announced his intention to step down as he faced two no-confidence votes tabled by opposition parties following the turbulent ending of the  Bute House Agreement - a deal signed by his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon three years ago that brought two Green ministers into government.\nFormer Deputy First Minister John Swinney and ex-Finance Secretary Kate Forbes have emerged as the frontrunners in the process to succeed him, although neither has yet declared they are standing. \nMr Yousaf said he would not endorse either potential candidate.\nHe called for unity within the party and urged any potential candidates not to openly criticise their rivals. \n\"We will gain nothing if we talk each other down,\" the first minister said. \"The only people who benefit from that are our opponents.\"\nMs Forbes, who narrowly lost out to Mr Yousaf in the 2023 leadership contest, was criticised during the campaign for revealing she would have voted against gay marriage legislation had she been an MSP at the time due to her religious beliefs as a member of the Free Church of Scotland.\nWhen asked if he felt Scotland could have a first minister who opposed gay marriage, Mr Yousaf said: \"You can be a person of faith and be first minister.\" \n\"What people will judge any potential candidate on are their policies,\" he said, adding: \"That is the right discussion to have - not whether somebody of faith can be first minister.\"\nBoth Mr Swinney and Ms Forbes have said they are considering SNP leadership bids but that they need to consider what they feel is right for their families, party and country. \nA source close to Mr Swinney, who led the party between 2000 and 2004, told BBC Scotland News he had no plans to make an announcement on Wednesday.\nHe has been backed by several senior party figures, including Westminster leader Stephen Flynn, deputy leader Keith Brown and cabinet ministers Neil Gray, Shirley-Anne Somerville and Mairi McAllan.\nMs Forbes has been publicly supported by ex-ministers Fergus Ewing and Ivan McKee, as well as backbench MP Joanna Cherry.\nAllies of Ms Forbes told BBC Scotland News she had made progress planning a potential leadership bid, including on policy positions and resources, in case she decided to stand. \nHer supporters said she was not expected to make an announcement on Wednesday as it had only been 48 hours since Mr Yousaf announced his resignation.\nNominations for the SNP leadership opened on Monday and will close in one week. If more than one candidate receives 100 nominations from at least 20 local party branches, a ballot will be held among members to decide on a new leader.\nMr Yousaf has said he will resign as first minister once a new leader is chosen. At that point, parliament would have 28 days to nominate new first minister to be appointed by the King. \nIf MSPs could not reach an agreement after 28 days, a snap election would be called.  \nOne of the no-confidence motions, directed at the first minister himself, was pulled by the Scottish Tories",
    "US author Paul Auster, who wrote the New York Trilogy mystery novels, has died at the age of 77.\nAuster wrote more than 30 books across his career and gained cult status in the 1980s and 90s.\nHis novels were often existentialist stories about outsiders, and were particularly successful in Europe.\nThe writer died on Tuesday at his home in Brooklyn due to complications from lung cancer, his friend and fellow author Jacki Lyden confirmed.\nIn March 2023, Auster's wife, author Siri Hustvedt, announced he had been diagnosed with cancer.\nThe son of Jewish Polish immigrants, Auster grew up in Newark, New Jersey, later moving to New York to attend Columbia University.\nAfter graduating, he spent four years in France, where he honed his craft as a writer.\nThe sudden death of his father prompted Auster to write 1982's The Invention of Solitude, a haunting reflection on father-son relationships, which became a recurring theme.\nBut his breakthrough came with The New York Trilogy, a philosophical twist on the detective genre centred on a shady quartet of private investigators named Blue, Brown, Black and White.\nHis subsequent novels included Timbuktu and existential capers Moon Palace, The Music of Chance and Leviathan.\nAuster was praised for his sharp dialogue, and his books have been translated into more than 40 languages. \nIn addition, Auster wrote the screenplay for 1995's Smoke, a film about a Brooklyn tobacco shop, starring Harvey Keitel, which won the writer an Independent Spirit Award.\nHe also co-directed the follow-up, Blue in the Face, which starred Keitel again.\nIn 2017, Auster published 866-page novel 4321, which charted US society through the life of an everyman, Archie Ferguson.\nThe author was said to have considered it his masterwork, although it received mixed reviews from critics.\nLast year, Auster published Bloodbath Nation along with his photographer son-in-law Spencer Ostrander, which focused on gun violence in America.\nAuster's text was accompanied by Ostrander's black-and-white pictures from the sites of 30 mass shootings.\nIn recent years, Auster's own life was struck by tragedy, with his 10-month-old granddaughter Ruby dying after ingesting heroin and his son Daniel, the child's father, dying of an overdose 10 months later.\nPrior to his death, Daniel had been found guilty of negligent homicide. Auster never publicly discussed their deaths.",
    "A male swan left companionless after his nesting mate was shot dead a week ago has bonded with a fellow rescuee.\nThe swan was found with a single shot to her neck on the waterside off Weston Parade, Netley Abbey, near Southampton.\nThe swan's five eggs, which will not hatch, and her mate were taken in on 23 April by charity Swan Support.\nThe charity said he was \"doing well all things considered ... enjoying the company of others and has taken a shine to one of the ladies in our care.\"\nThe charity said after collecting the shot swan from the tide pool it sought permission to take the male and the eggs into care.\n\"Despite it being his home, his safety was paramount and our fear was that he could too be targeted,\" the charity said. \nA fundraising page has been set up by a resident to raise a reward of \u00a32,000 for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for shooting the swan and to support the male swan's care at the charity.\nTo date it has raised just over \u00a31,300.\nHampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary said is was investigating and urged witnesses and anyone with information to come forward.\nThe force said in the report made it was stated the swan's death \"was caused by an air rifle\".\nThe charity, based in Datchet, Berkshire, said: \"The local community, like us, are both angry and heartbroken and want to see this properly investigated, the offender caught and justice served.\"\nIt said volunteers had attended more than 20 separate incidents since the end of last year with no arrests made. \nPosting on its Facebook page, the charity said it had written \"again to MPs and the Police Crime Commissioners in the areas we attend asking for more to be done\".\n\"At times we feel like giving up and these types of rescues go beyond what any of us as volunteers should have to see,\" it said. \n\"But we must continue for the sake of all the others and hope that one day in the very near future something changes.\"\nThe centre's staff informed David Barber the King's Swan Marker of the nesting swan's death after finding she had been shot in the neck.\nAll wild birds, including swans, are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.\nIntentionally killing or injuring a swan is a criminal offence punishable with up to six months in jail and an unlimited fine.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

    "Journalists at STV are taking strike action for a second time after the latest pay offer put forward by the broadcaster was rejected by staff.\nThe strike on Wednesday will see programmes such as the News at Six bulletin and Scotland Tonight debate show pulled off air.\nStaff at the company previously went on strike in March, with the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) saying they were seeking a \"fair\" 6% pay rise, but a second strike planned for April was cancelled as talks continued.\nThe channel said it was \"disappointed\" at the decision but alternative programming would air in place of news programmes.\nThe strike will coincide with the broadcaster\u2019s annual general meeting, where NUJ representatives, STUC representatives and individual staff will attend as shareholders.\nNick McGowan-Lowe, the NUJ's national organiser for Scotland, said that STV had shown \"willingness\" to end the dispute, but that it was \"disappointing that once again our journalists are having to head out of the newsrooms and into the shareholder AGM to find out answers\".\nHe added that they had been told by STV that a 6% pay increase - which the union says would keep pace with inflation - was \"unaffordable\".\nThe union has argued that salaries for journalists at the company have fallen behind equivalent roles at the BBC and ITV, which runs the rest of the channel three network.\nThe broadcaster's pay offer has been accepted by other staff at the company.\nHowever, the union said that the pay rise could easily be paid for via money that has been paid to chief executive Simon Pitts.  \nMr McGowan-Lowe said: \u201cA tiny fraction of chief executive Simon Pitt\u2019s bonus would be enough to resolve this dispute for all 90 of the newsroom\u2019s staff \u2013 and still leave him paid vastly more than the director general of the BBC \u2013 an organisation that is over 45 times larger than STV.\u201d\nAn STV spokeswoman said the company had offered \"enhanced\" terms.\nShe said:  \"We understand that almost half of NUJ members voted to accept the enhanced offer, which included a bonus payment for all STV staff.\n\"We remain open to further dialogue but the NUJ's claim for an above inflation pay increase of 6% - nearly twice the current level of inflation - is unrealistic and unaffordable.\" \nThe spokeswoman added that the company considered their offer \"fair and financially responsible\".\nThe first one-day strike in the dispute saw newsroom staff form picket lines in Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow, while a separate demonstration at the Scottish Parliament attracted cross-party support.\nAt the time, First Minister Humza Yousaf called on STV to return to talks with the union to reach a fair settlement.\nThe second scheduled strike day, scheduled for Wednesday 16 April, was postponed after talks between the NUJ and management. \nFollowing further talks, a package of proposals was put to NUJ members.\nUnions once had huge power in commercial broadcasting.\nUntil the 1980s, industrial action could leave screens blank and meant the broadcaster would lose advertising revenue.\nThe strike by journalists at STV is not costing the company a single penny directly.\nNetwork programmes and advertising went out normally during the first strike in March - the same is likely to happen on Wednesday.\nRules on the volume of advertising which only cover Channels 3, 4 and 5 mean that there are few commercials around the main news programme. So if the programme shown instead of the STV News at Six gets a relatively small audience it makes no difference to advertising revenue.\nBut the union believes it has other powerful weapons.\nNews is STV\u2019s main legal obligation - it may lose money but it earns the company the right to broadcast on Channel 3. It also wins the company influence and respect.\nThe union has chosen the day of the company\u2019s annual general meeting for action purposefully. It hopes to highlight its members' concerns to shareholders and put pressure on management to make a further improvement to its pay offer.",
    "Gordon Brown has called for police to investigate whether the publisher of the Sun and News of the World covered up phone hacking evidence.\nThe former prime minister told the BBC that civil court documents show News UK deleted emails to stop police seeing them.\nHe also believes his phone may have been hacked while in No 10 and could now take legal action.\nNews UK said Mr Brown's allegations were \"unfounded and wrong\". \nIn 2015, prosecutors said there was no evidence of corporate wrongdoing.\nHowever, Mr Brown said that decision was based on an \"incomplete picture\" of the case against News UK, previously known as News Group Newspapers.\nHe said: \"What we have is new evidence. What we now know was not available at the time, perhaps not even available to the police.\n\"What is coming out is the extent of the interference in people's civil liberties, the extent to which the organisation tried to cover up.\" \nHe said he was speaking out on behalf of \"ordinary families\" targeted by newspapers \"at the moment of greatest difficulty for them - grief, tragedy, accidents, murders\".\nVictims of phone hacking include the murdered teenager Milly Dowler and families bereaved by the 7 July 2005 terror attacks in London.\nMr Brown continued: \"The intrusion into their private lives at the time of grief was so extensive, whether it be by phone hacking, or by using private investigators or by investigating their family life and the relatives of people around them.\"\nThe police investigation into the company was brought to a halt in 2015 after the convictions of senior journalists including Andy Coulson, a former editor of the News of the World.\nThe company had accepted journalists at the tabloid were involved in wrong-doing and closed it down in 2011.\nIt has paid damages to hundreds of News of the World phone hacking victims, and has also settled cases brought by those targeted by the Sun, without admitting any liability.\nMore than 40 people are currently suing News UK for hacking their phones or unlawfully obtaining their private information.\nThe complex case is likely to go to trial next year but evidence is already being disclosed to the claimants' lawyers.\nA key question in the trial is likely to be why the company deleted more than 30 million emails in 2010 and 2011, when it knew it faced a police investigation over phone hacking.\nNine million emails, detailing important periods during the phone hacking saga, were \"irretrievably lost\", according to court documents.\nThe reasons for the email deletion policy are at the centre of claims the firm was involved in a corporate cover-up which went beyond the wrong-doing of individual reporters and private investigators.\nNews UK has always insisted it was clearing out old computer servers, but claimants say it was deleting evidence at the time the police investigation was expanding. \nThey have accused the company in court filings of inventing a false \"security threat\" to provide another reason why emails needed to be deleted.\nCourt documents filed by the claimants suggest senior figures at the News UK believed an insider sympathetic to the Labour Party had leaked emails belonging to chief executive Rebekah Brooks.\nThey believed these had been passed to a third party, who had then met and discussed them with Gordon Brown.\nThe court documents suggest the company decided to delete Mrs Brooks's emails to prevent further leaks.\nOn Wednesday, Mr Brown discussed this claim for the first time, describing it as an \"an attempt to blame someone else... when, of course, they themselves were guilty of destroying evidence\".\nHe denied ever being passed information relating to Mrs Brooks, adding: \"The police should never have accepted their explanation.\"\nMr Brown has never taken legal action against News UK but revealed he is now considering it.\nHe said it was possible that his phone was hacked between 2005 and 2007 when he was chancellor, and for the three years he was prime minister, before losing the 2010 election.\nMr Brown said he had a personal mobile phone at the time, and believes his voicemail messages may have been accessed.\nHe continued: \"If a prime minister was having his phone hacked by News Group, then that is a very serious matter.\n\"And we need to get all the evidence about what happened, what didn't happen, what was happening at their headquarters.\n\"I think that is all still to come out. And that's why although time has passed, we must not allow this to happen again because of a failure to investigate what happened in the past.\"\nIn response, News UK said Mr Brown's allegations related to events from over a decade ago which are the subject of current legal proceedings in the civil courts. \nA spokesperson added: \"There is absolutely no evidence to support the assertion that Mr Brown's voicemails were intercepted and this is denied.\" \nThe company has also denied in court documents it deleted millions of emails because they were \"potentially incriminating\", pointing out that many had been back",
    "A delivery rider who bit off a customer's thumb continued working for Deliveroo, even after the account she was using at the time was suspended.\nJenniffer Rocha, 35, from Aldershot, Hampshire, previously pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm after an argument over a pizza in December 2022.\nFollowing her court appearance, Deliveroo cancelled her account.\nBut BBC News filmed Rocha in April still delivering food, again apparently using a Deliveroo rider account.\nA second account that Rocha was accessing has also been suspended, Deliveroo said.\nShe is due to be sentenced on Friday.\nThe big three delivery apps - Deliveroo, Just Eat and Uber Eats - announced this week they would tighten up their systems to check the identities of what are called \"substitute\" riders.\nWarning: This story contains a graphic image and details that some readers may find upsetting\nStephen Jenkinson, 36, had ordered a pizza from the Deliveroo app on 14 December 2022.\nAfter Rocha arrived at the wrong location, Mr Jenkinson walked down the street to meet her - but forgot to pick up his phone.\nThis caused an argument, as he had needed to give Rocha a delivery code from his mobile in order to collect the food.\nMr Jenkinson said he was then attacked.\nHe said he raised his hand to Rocha's motorcycle helmet and she bit his thumb with \"force\".\nWhen she eventually let go, Mr Jenkinson lifted up his arm and \"sprayed her with blood\", as his thumb had been severed just above the knuckle. \nDeliveroo previously described the original incident as \"awful\".\nRocha pleaded guilty to one count of grievous bodily harm at Winchester Crown Court on 19 March.\nBut weeks later, BBC News tracked down Rocha in Aldershot and twice observed her riding her moped and picking up food for delivery.\nOn the second occasion, on 18 April, she was filmed going to a takeaway, collecting a bag of food, putting it into the box on her bike and riding off.\nWhen asked, the takeaway manager confirmed Rocha was delivering using a Deliveroo account.\nA Deliveroo spokesperson said the company was committed to preventing misuse of its platform.\nThey said: \"We immediately cancelled the account that was being used at the time of this terrible incident and subsequently terminated an alternative account.\n\"We have strengthened our processes and recently introduced a new registration process and identity verification technology for substitute riders.\"\nOn Tuesday, the Home Office announced Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just Eat would be tightening up their identity checks.\nMinisters had been concerned the current system allowed illegal working.\nAll riders are self employed and can lend their account to anyone they want - a so-called substitute.\nThe main account holder has in the past been responsible for checking that person is over 18, has no serious convictions and is legally allowed to work.\nBBC News revealed last year how it led to illegal workers and even children working for Deliveroo, with a black market of accounts for sale or rent online.\nThe Home Office criticised the companies for failing to tackle illegal working and organised a series of meetings with them.\nDeliveroo rolled out its new system last month, saying it was the first major platform to carry out \"direct right to work checks\".\nThe company said the new scheme included \"a registration process and identity verification technology\".\nAdditional reporting by Charlotte Andrews  \nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

    "Inside a busy primary school classroom in the South Africa seaside town of Saldanha Bay, one chair is left empty.\nThis is where six-year-old Joshlin Smith sits - or sat until she went missing in February in a case that has gripped the attention of South Africans.\nThe huge search operation that involved the navy as well as local volunteers, the big reward and the arrest of her mother have served to make this an irresistible story.\nBut the community living with its day-to-day reality remains scared.\nSaldanha Bay, about 120km (75 miles) north-west of Cape Town, has the reputation of being a tranquil, quaint town known for its fishing, watersports and magnificently colourful wildflowers that bloom in spring in the town's nature reserve. \nDespite the end of apartheid 30 years ago, the spatial planning in Saldanha, like most cities and towns in South Africa, still reflects the inequalities bequeathed by the system of separate and unequal development. \nAs one enters the town through the business district, the upmarket housing, which includes guest houses and holiday homes, is located close to the coastline.\nBut when going into the areas of Diazville and Middelpos, which comprise a mixture of low-cost and informal housing, there is a noticeable change. \nThe homes in Diazville are mostly government-subsidised basic brick and mortar structures, known as RDP (part of the Reconstruction and Development Programme) homes. In the adjacent Middelpos area there's a mixture of RDP homes and corrugated iron shacks built on an open field. \nThere is a marked sense of anxiety and suspicion in the two communities, particularly when they see an outsider or a car that is not from the area.\nThe rise in the number of parents and guardians eagerly waiting to collect their children outside the gates of the modest Diazville primary school is an indication of how much more care is being taken by residents to ensure the safety of young children in the area.\nGetting those adults to speak is not easy.\nThe reluctance is understandable given the media frenzy, and several instances of fake news disseminated on social media, such as alleged sightings and reports of a body being found.\nFaeeza Ecksteen, one of the parents who was prepared to talk, was at the school Joshlin attended to fetch her six-year-old son Aleem. \nShe says the disappearance of Joshlin, also spelled Joslin, has had a serious impact on the community, particularly the children.\n\"It's a very sad story. All parents are now worried about the wellbeing of their children and are taking extra care to ensure their safety.\"\n\"It's traumatising for the children in the area because they no longer want to play outside,\" adds community activist Carmelite Ross. \n\"My 11-year-old daughter, Keayondre, didn't want to go to school for the first few days after Joshlin's disappearance because she was scared, even though the school is just a few minutes away. She now walks to school every day with six other children.\n\"At the end of the day everyone in Saldanha, even our children, has been dragged into this matter.\"\nMs Ross, who participated in many of the searches for Joshlin in the first few days after the little girl's disappearance, chose to step back for her own wellbeing.\n\"I decided curtail my involvement in the Joshlin case because it started to take an emotional toll on me.\n\"As a mother myself, it's very painful. I've had sleepless nights because if it were my child I don't think I would still be alive due to all the worries, stress and everything that you have to deal with.\"\nTwo weeks after Joshlin's disappearance from her modest shack in the Middelpos informal settlement, police arrested her mother Racquel \"Kelly\" Smith, Smith's boyfriend Jacquen \"Boeta\" Appollis, Steveno van Rhyn and Phumza Sigaqa. That dwelling has since been locked up and stands deserted. \nThe four first appeared in the local magistrate's court on 7 March on charges of human trafficking and kidnapping. A large crowd of local people gathered around the court to call for \"justice for Joshlin\".\nThe first few days after her disappearance was accompanied by some racial tension between coloured (as people of mixed racial heritage are known in South Africa) and black members of the community following the arrest of Ms Sigaqa, a black person. She was caught up in a maelstrom of rumours and media reports incorrectly identified her as a traditional healer, or sangoma.\n\"There were days where people of this area labelled us as if we are the causes of Joshlin's disappearance. There were days when people were suspicious of sangomas, doing wrong things,\" Liwani Siyabulela, ward councillor for Middelpos, tells the BBC. \n\"We've managed to address the issues - we've made it clear it's not about being coloured or black or white, Indian or whatever. We should focus on finding the missing child. At least now the atmosphere is back to normal,\" says Ms Siyabulela, a member of the governing African National Congress (ANC). \nMs Ross acknowledges",
    "The union for senior civil servants is launching an unprecedented legal challenge to ministers' Rwanda plan. \nThe FDA said it was intervening because it feared the scheme to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda could force officials to break the law.  \nUnder a new law, ministers can ignore the European Court of Human Rights and direct officials to organise flights. \nThe union wants the High Court to rule on whether that element would put civil servants in a difficult legal position. \nThe FDA fears civil servants could be stuck between judges and ministers and that a direction to breach international law, would put them in conflict with the Civil Service Code. \nThe government said advice from Darren Tierney, its head of propriety and ethics, says the code would not be breached. \nIn a letter published on the government's website, Mr Tierney wrote: \"In implementing the decision, civil servants would be operating in accordance with the Civil Service Code, including the obligation not to frustrate the implementation of policies once decisions are taken.\n\"They would be operating in compliance with the law, which is the law enacted by Parliament under which the minister's specifically recognised and confirmed discretion would be exercised.\" \nThe Rwanda plan is the key part of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's pledge to stop migrants from crossing the English Channel in dangerous dinghies. \nThe Safety of Rwanda legislation overrules last November's Supreme Court decision which said that the country was not a safe place to send genuine refugees because they could be returned from there to their home countries and subjected to torture and abuse.\nIt also limits what kind of legal challenges they can present to the courts and, crucially, says ministers could choose to ignore a temporary order from the European Court of Human Rights to halt flights while a case is still being considered. \nIn practice, that would see ministers ordering key civil service leaders to prepare and send off flights, even if judges have said the case has not been settled. \nThe First Division Association (FDA), which represents those Whitehall leaders, said that measure means members fear they could be ordered to break both international law and the Civil Service Code, their legally-underpinned rule book.\nDave Penman, the FDA's general secretary, said its members were not taking a political view on whether the Rwanda plan was right or wrong - but they needed certainty about whether the measure places them in a conflict between ministers and the law.\n\"This [measure] is not an accident or down to poor drafting,\" he said.\n\"It's a political choice from the government, made not for the good of the country but to avoid upsetting either of the warring factions within its own party.\"\n\"It's also irresponsible. Civil servants know that they have to support the government of the day and implement policy, regardless of their political beliefs, but they also know they have a legal obligation to adhere to the Civil Service Code. \n\"Faced with a government that is prepared to act in this cowardly, reckless way, it is left to the FDA to defend our members and the integrity of the civil service.\"\nThe FDA will now ask the High Court to prioritise its case - but there is no guarantee that judges will do so. \nBut if the case goes to a full hearing - even though no departure dates have yet been set - it could temporarily paralyse the policy. \nIn a worst case scenario, judges could rule that the government has created an unlawful conflict that then prevents top civil servants from implementing the plan. \nEarlier on Wednesday, the Home Office confirmed \"a series of nationwide operations\" was under way to detain people across the country ahead of their removal to Rwanda. \nPhotographs and a video were released of immigration enforcement officers detaining several migrants at different residences, before they were led away in handcuffs and put into secure vehicles.\nEach person being considered for forcible removal to Rwanda must be given at least seven days' written notice of that intention and they have the right to launch a legal challenge.\nThe government had previously said it was aiming for flights to take off by the spring but now says this should happen in nine to 11 weeks. \nLabour has said it would scrap the Rwanda scheme if it wins the next election. \nHowever, asked several times whether the party would release those detained as part of the policy, Labour's deputy nation campaign coordinator Ellie Reeves would not say.\n\"We want to get people back to their own countries if their claims have failed which is why we would set up those return agreements and also recruit a thousand case workers,\" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. \nLabour have said they would allow those who have arrived on small boats to apply for asylum, something current arrivals are barred from doing.\nThe party added that no flights to Rwanda carrying asylum seekers would be scheduled by a Labo",
    "The number of BBC World Service journalists working in exile is estimated to have nearly doubled, to 310, since 2020.\nThe figures, released for the first time ahead of World Press Freedom Day, reflect press crackdowns in Russia, Afghanistan, and Ethiopia.\nJournalists from other countries, including Iran, have lived abroad for more than a decade. \nMany face jail sentences, death threats and harassment, both on and offline. \n\"The only way they can carry on reporting is to be forced out of their homes,\" says the director of the BBC World Service, Liliane Landor. \"The increase we're seeing in the numbers of journalists in exile is extremely concerning for press freedom.\"\nWhen the Taliban took control in Afghanistan in August 2021, the BBC pulled most of its team out of the country. Female staff were no longer allowed to work, while their male colleagues also faced threats.\nIn 2022, after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia introduced a new censorship law, meaning anyone criticising the war could be prosecuted. \"I'm calling a war, a war, and for that I could be easily jailed,\" says Nina Nazarova, a correspondent for BBC Russian, which has moved its Moscow team to Latvia. \nIn April this year, Nina's colleague, BBC Russian correspondent Ilya Barabanov, was labelled a \"foreign agent\", accused of \"spreading false information\" and opposing the war. He and the BBC reject this and are disputing it in court. \nJournalists in Myanmar and Ethiopia have also seen increased pressure, which has left them unable to report freely.\nJodie Ginsberg, from the Committee to Protect Journalists, says the number of exiled journalists it offers financial and legal support to has increased by 225% in the past three years.\n\"We've got near record number of journalists in jail, the killing of journalists has reached a high not seen since 2015,\" she adds. \nRegimes - such as Russia, Iran and Saud Arabia - are becoming increasingly desperate to control the narrative inside and outside their countries, she says.\n\"I watch my back,\" says BBC Persian correspondent Jiyar Gol. When he enters a room now, he says he looks for an escape route. \"I have a lot of security cameras in my house. I was warned it would be smart to change my daughter's school.\"\nJiyar hasn't been to Iran since 2007. When his mother died he couldn't go to her funeral. He has managed to cross the border to visit her grave.\nBut since his wife died of cancer four years ago, he has become more cautious. \"If something happened to me, what will happen to my daughter? That's something that's really in the back of my mind all the time,\" he says.\n\"The Iranian regime has grown bolder,\" he adds. \"They are under strict sanctions, they don't care about what the international community thinks about them because they are isolated.\"\nIn March, a presenter for the independent broadcaster Iran International was stabbed in the leg outside his London home, and recently British counter-terrorism police warned of an increased threat to BBC Persian staff living in the UK. \nTen BBC Persian staff recently learned they had been sentenced to a year in prison in their absence. They found out after hackers leaked information from the Iranian judiciary.\nPreviously, the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has accused BBC Persian staff of inciting violence, hate speech and human rights abuses.\nOne World Service journalist in Africa, who spoke anonymously for fear of aggravating leaders in his home country, says his biggest fear is becoming stateless if his government refuses to renew his passport.\nFor Shazia Haya, from BBC Pashto, life in exile is laced with guilt. She was evacuated to the UK alone in 2022 when the Taliban took control in Afghanistan, leaving her parents and brother in Kabul. \n\"The night I left home, at around 02:00, I don't know why but I couldn't hug my younger brother. And I'm regretting that,\" she says. \"I'm free here, but they're in a kind of prison.\"",
    "A law that has now shut down some Troubles-era inquests is a setback to reconciliation, a victim's son has said.\nThe legacy bill ends 38 inquests which had not reached their final stages by 1 May.\nIt also introduces a new legacy body to take over all Troubles cases spanning the 30-year conflict.\nThe law has been opposed by all Northern Ireland politicians at Stormont and Westminster.\nIt was also rejected by Troubles victims' groups, with some relatives holding a protest at the Northern Ireland Office headquarters in Belfast on Wednesday.\nHowever, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris welcomed the implementation of the bill.\nHe said the new Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) would deliver \"robust and effective mechanisms for addressing the legacy of the past\".\nSean Slane, whose father Gerard, 27, was shot dead by loyalists in 1988, said he had been put through \"turmoil\" year-after-year.\nHe said his family had hoped an inquest could help as they \"need closure\" on what happened.\nThe ICRIR, headed up by former Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, has the power to run replacement inquests.\nIt will also investigate any Troubles-related incidents in the UK where people were killed or seriously injured.\nBut its main task will be to provide new information to relatives and survivors.\nThe Lady Chief Justice's Office said 14 of the inquests affected by the 1 May deadline had not reached a findings stage, while 24 others had not been assigned a coroner to begin.\nSome of the inquests cover multiple killings.\nGerard Slane's murder by the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) in west Belfast involved an Army agent, Brian Nelson.\nA new inquest was ordered in 2011, but it was hit by multiple delays, including over the disclosure of security force documents.\n\"It was just delaying tactics the whole way through,\" his son said.\nSean Slane added: \"Personally, the only way there is going to be true peace and reconciliation is for the truth to come out across the board.\"\nRather than go to the ICRIR, he said he would campaign for an inquest, noting Labour had pledged to repeal the law if it won the next general election.\nSpeaking on Good Morning Ulster on Wednesday, Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn said for many bereaved families the May deadline felt like a door being slammed shut in their face.\nHe said that Labour would remove immunity from the act \"because it's already been struck down by the High Court in Belfast, though the issue is being appealed\".\nMr Benn said his party would also restore civil cases and inquests.\nSpeaking about the ICRIR, he said: \"I would not scrap it, I will see how it goes. In the end the test for this is will it work for families.\n\"In the end if families find that ICRIR works for them - and there are some reforms that we could make to boost confidence in it - then that will put us in a much, much better place than where we are at the moment.\"\nRev David Clements' father Billy was a reserve police officer who was murdered by the IRA in December 1985.\nOf the ICRIR, he said: \"I think we have to be to some degree pragmatic and say this is the only game in town at the moment. \n\"If we can find a way to engage constructively with it and give it a fair wind as best we can, my own personal view is that's the approach we should take.\"\nThe ICRIR, established by the act, will take on cases referred to it or brought by bereaved families and survivors, and has police powers to investigate and bring prosecutions, where possible.\nThe act's immunity clause has been disapplied by legal action.\nFrom Wednesday, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) will no longer investigate Troubles cases and will \"cooperate fully\" with ICRIR requests for information.\nThe ICRIR's commissioner for investigations, Peter Sheridan, said he hoped the new body would be supported over time.\nThe act has been criticised by Northern Ireland political parties and victims' groups.\nThe Irish government is also bringing an inter-state case against the UK at the European Court of Human Rights.\n\"I understand the contested nature of this,\" said Mr Sheridan.\n\"At some stage if we are all serious about wanting to help victims and survivors then everybody has to contribute into this, otherwise we are going to leave this for another generation to do.\"\nHe explained how the body would work with families: \"If it is a case with the possibility of evidence, then it will be a criminal justice investigation.\n\"If it is one we don't think is going to meet that standard, it could be a culpability, in other words, on the balance of probabilities, Sir Declan Morgan will write a report on who was to blame.\n\"And in a family focused investigation, answering questions that families have wanted for 40 or 50 years.\"\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said he welcomed the ICRIR becoming operational.\n\"In establishing the independent commission, we are doing something that has eluded successive government",
    "On the banks of the Dee Estuary, separating Wales and England, scientists are concerned about what at first glance appear to be ordinary sand dunes.\nBut, as environmental scientist Dr Alex Riley scratches carefully away at their surface, an \u201cunnatural\u201d grey powder begins to appear.\n\u201cYou can see over the years this has oxidised and looks natural,\u201d he explains.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s reading on the meter that it has the same pH as household bleach.\u201d \nThe dog walkers and bird watchers who pass by the estuary either side of Flintshire and Merseyside appear unaware they are walking on chemical waste.\nThis site is one of hundreds of landfills that scientists fear are now leaking onto beaches and into the sea.\nThousands of rubbish dumps span the UK\u2019s coastline, many containing materials that were buried long before records needed to be kept.\nAccording to Dr Riley, it is only in the past few years that scientists have started to record where they are and what might be in them.\nIn Wales alone, a recent report found there were more than 260 coastal landfill sites currently at risk of leaking into the marine environment, as a result of coastal erosion, flooding and climate change.\nWhat we do not know yet is much about the effect these coastal landfills are having on wildlife with which they have contact. \n\u201cIt's unknown,\u201d said Dr Riley, from the University of Hull.\n\u201cThere are a lot of waste types around [and] different landfill sites. Sometimes these wastes are mixed together. It's a very complex picture and it's difficult to know exactly what the issues and impacts will be from those sites.\u201d\nThese dunes, made from the grey chemical power, have stood on the estuary for more than 100 years.\nLike many early landfills, there is little record-keeping, but the powder is understood to be waste product from a Victorian factory that once stood nearby.\nFlintshire council, which monitors the site, said it had raised the idea with Natural Resources Wales of coastal defences to \u201cprevent further damage\u201d.\nDr Riley said researchers like him were now hoping to raise awareness of legacy waste and its potential impact.\n\u201cThinking about sewage discharges into waterways for example, that's something that's quite high on the public radar at the moment,\u201d explained Dr Riley.\n\u201cIt's a problem that's affecting the environment right now - and will continue to do so, specifically with climate change.\u201d\nDr Riley said household landfill could be quite obvious when it began to erode, with plastic bottles and jars from the 1950s and 1960s easily noticed by people.\nHowever, he said the majority of chemical and industrial waste would not be so clear and urged people to keep a distance and wash their hands if they were ever unsure.\nAt the more severe end, Dr Riley said compounds like arsenic and lead had \u201cthe potential to leech out of these wastes and into the environment\u201d.\nNatural Resources Wales has been working to estimate how many sites already pose a risk to the environment.\nLast year, NRW engineers found 89% of Welsh landfill sites had the potential to release chemical waste.\nEstuaries and reefs were deemed to be most at risk from landfill waste leakage. Caves, mudflats and sandbanks were also deemed higher risk areas.\nNow the scale of the problem is beginning to be uncovered, one problem is establishing who is responsible for it.\n\u201cThere are over 1,500 landfill sites in Wales, a very small number are still active, and a few are permitted. Most of those 1,500 landfill sites are not permitted at all,\u201d said Mary Lewis, who leads an NRW advisory team on the issue.\n\u201cPrior to the 1970s, no records had to be kept. So there was no permitting on landfill sites and no requirement to keep records.\u201d\nShe that by default, responsibility now fell to the current landowner, no matter how long ago the waste was dumped, but there was little in the way of legislation.\n\u201cThe stage we\u2019re at is understanding the scale of the problem - and the risk it poses,\u201d she said.\n\u201cClimate change really is a very significant factor in the threat posed. We are already seeing increasing extremes weather events, extreme rainfall events - we also know sea level is gradually rising - which means we are seeing an increase in coastal flooding.\n\u201cAll of that makes the landfill potentially more unstable.\u201d\nMs Lewis's team plan to carry out more research into these sites, if they can secure funding.\nIn Cardiff, one litter picking group said it had already started to notice signs of Victorian era dumps re-emerging.\n\u201cWe have found things like old bottles, boots and gin bottles,\u201d said Dave King, who helps coordinate hundreds of volunteers for Cardiff Rivers Group.\n\u201cWe have a couple of spots like that which we regularly clean up,\u201d he said.\nMr King said at one site his volunteers regularly unearth material failing to degrade, such as \u201cTip Top ice lolly wrappers that are pre-decimalisation\u201d. \n\u201cSo that's [buried] before 1971 and it's still in perfect condition,\u201d he said.\nDr Riley said trying to move any of the waste ",
    "Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia announced on Wednesday that she will force a vote to remove Mike Johnson as speaker of the House.\nThe conservative firebrand filed the motion last month but held off on formally introducing it, which would require a vote on Mr Johnson's fate within two legislative days.\nAt the time, she described her action as a warning to the Republican leader. \nNow she has followed through on that threat.\nSpeaker Johnson put out a statement that her motion \"is wrong for the Republican conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country\".\nMr Johnson's support for a $61bn military aid package to Ukraine, approved by the House on 20 April, is partially responsible for Ms Greene forcing the vote.\n\"Mike Johnson is not capable of that job,\" Ms Greene said on Wednesday. \"He has proven it over and over again.\"\nOn Tuesday, Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives pledged to support Mr Johnson if his leadership was threatened - a show of gratitude for the speaker's co-operation on Ukraine aid, which was a priority for Democrats and President Joe Biden.\nMs Greene called the Democratic pledge \"a warm hug and a big wet sloppy kiss\" for the speaker.\nRepublican leaders, including former president Donald Trump, had reportedly pressured the Georgia congresswoman to back down from attempting to remove Mr Johnson, concerned that a Republican power struggle would harm the party's prospects in November's general election.\nLast October, Democrats voted with a handful of Republicans to remove Speaker Kevin McCarthy, setting off three weeks of Republican discord as several top candidates failed to win the near-unanimous party support needed to secure the gavel.\nMr Johnson ultimately prevailed -  in part because he was relatively unknown and had few connections to party leadership. But some Republicans, including Ms Greene, soured on him after he worked with Democrats to pass government funding legislation earlier this year.\n\"I voted for Mike Johnson because his voting record before he became speaker was conservative,\" Ms Greene said on Wednesday. \"Once he became speaker, he has become a man that none of us recognise.\"\nTwo other Republicans in the House have said they will back Ms Greene's effort, which would be enough in the narrowly divided chamber to remove the speaker with Democratic help. Instead, the Democrats have said they will vote with pro-Johnson Republicans to \"table\" the motion, effectively killing.\nMs Greene said she will introduce her motion to remove Mr Johnson next week.

    "Changes to the Condor Ferries summer schedules have left some travellers frustrated by the disruption.\nThe schedules were changed in April, affecting passengers with prior bookings and leading some to cancel travel plans.\nThe company has apologised to customers and said the changes were meant to bring \"consistency and familiarity\" to the schedule and that more than three quarters of its passengers \"remain unaffected\".\nRegular summer visitor to Guernsey, Rachel Sennett said she had \"no confidence that we are actually going to be there in July\".\nThe Hampshire resident said: \"Why is the schedule for this summer being changed in April? It should have been changed in the winter season ready for people booking for the summer. \n\"If it changes again and it impacts on the holiday then we will cancel and if Condor are still the ferry provider next year then we won't book at all.\"\nSteve Austen, who lives in Ascot and was due to visit Guernsey with his three sons this summer for the first time, said the disruption had meant he had decided to cancel his trip.\nHe said: \"I only booked on the 3pm sailing because they published that sailing.

    "A man who was sexually assaulted by his karate master said it had been his \"lifelong dream\" to train with him.\nStuart Amos, now 31, moved to Liverpool in 2011 to learn under ninth dan black belt Andrew Sherry.\nBut Sherry sexually abused him and was this week jailed for two years at Liverpool Crown Court for his crimes against him and another, younger boy.\nMr Amos said Sherry, now 80, had manipulated him and \"abused his dream\".\nHe had relocated from Bedfordshire to Liverpool to train at Red Triangle karate club in Everton.\nMr Amos, who waived his anonymity as a victim of a sexual offence to speak out, said: \"When I met Andrew Sherry it was a lifelong dream to come to Liverpool to train with him and he abused that dream to get what he wanted, \" he said.\n\"It was a horrific time. I was groomed for a long period and manipulated into silence and sexually assaulted by someone who was in a great position of trust.\n\"He was my teacher - I believed he was my friend. \n\"In my first statement to police, one of the words I gave was that it felt 'practiced'.\"\nSherry, of Mann Island in Liverpool, was convicted in March of indecently assaulting a boy under the age of 16 in the mid-1980s, and of four counts of sexual assault on an older teenager in 2011 or 2012.\nHis trial heard the karate master, who was chief instructor for the Karate Union of Great Britain, claimed the allegations had been the result of a conspiracy by other practitioners who wanted to \"overthrow their leader\".\nSentencing judge David Swinnerton told him his actions had been \"an abuse of trust\". \nMr Amos said Sherry \"knew exactly what he was doing, he knew exactly what he was saying\".\n\"He referred a lot to behavioural psychology, which he said was an interest of his,\" he said.\n\"He bought me a book once on behavioural psychology, which had a long chapter on manipulation.\"\nHe said Sherry had \"his choice of children from all over the country\".\n\"He was the chief instructor, he was the chief examiner and he was the squad coach,\" he said.\n\"He had the pick of the litter, for want of a better word.\"\nMr Amos said the investigation had been an \"uphill battle\" and had taken its toll on him.\n\"I have been shunned by my old friends who he turned against me,\" he said.\n\"I have had to deal with a lot of personal abuse from people I thought were my friends.\"\nHe added that the case had brought him closure, although it would have been better if Sherry had been handed a longer sentence.\n\"I always said if he got to trial I would have my day in court and stand there and look him in the eye,\" he said.\n\"I was able to do that.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds\u00a0and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X and Instagram?

    "Inside a busy primary school classroom in the South Africa seaside town of Saldanha Bay, one chair is left empty.\nThis is where six-year-old Joshlin Smith sits - or sat until she went missing in February in a case that has gripped the attention of South Africans.\nThe huge search operation that involved the navy as well as local volunteers, the big reward and the arrest of her mother have served to make this an irresistible story.\nBut the community living with its day-to-day reality remains scared.\nSaldanha Bay, about 120km (75 miles) north-west of Cape Town, has the reputation of being a tranquil, quaint town known for its fishing, watersports and magnificently colourful wildflowers that bloom in spring in the town's nature reserve. \nDespite the end of apartheid 30 years ago, the spatial planning in Saldanha, like most cities and towns in South Africa, still reflects the inequalities bequeathed by the system of separate and unequal development. \nAs one enters the town through the business district, the upmarket housing, which includes guest houses and holiday homes, is located close to the coastline.\nBut when going into the areas of Diazville and Middelpos, which comprise a mixture of low-cost and informal housing, there is a noticeable change. \nThe homes in Diazville are mostly government-subsidised basic brick and mortar structures, known as RDP (part of the Reconstruction and Development Programme) homes. In the adjacent Middelpos area there's a mixture of RDP homes and corrugated iron shacks built on an open field. \nThere is a marked sense of anxiety and suspicion in the two communities, particularly when they see an outsider or a car that is not from the area.\nThe rise in the number of parents and guardians eagerly waiting to collect their children outside the gates of the modest Diazville primary school is an indication of how much more care is being taken by residents to ensure the safety of young children in the area.\nGetting those adults to speak is not easy.\nThe reluctance is understandable given the media frenzy, and several instances of fake news disseminated on social media, such as alleged sightings and reports of a body being found.\nFaeeza Ecksteen, one of the parents who was prepared to talk, was at the school Joshlin attended to fetch her six-year-old son Aleem. \nShe says the disappearance of Joshlin, also spelled Joslin, has had a serious impact on the community, particularly the children.\n\"It's a very sad story. All parents are now worried about the wellbeing of their children and are taking extra care to ensure their safety.\"\n\"It's traumatising for the children in the area because they no longer want to play outside,\" adds community activist Carmelite Ross. \n\"My 11-year-old daughter, Keayondre, didn't want to go to school for the first few days after Joshlin's disappearance because she was scared, even though the school is just a few minutes away. She now walks to school every day with six other children.\n\"At the end of the day everyone in Saldanha, even our children, has been dragged into this matter.\"\nMs Ross, who participated in many of the searches for Joshlin in the first few days after the little girl's disappearance, chose to step back for her own wellbeing.\n\"I decided curtail my involvement in the Joshlin case because it started to take an emotional toll on me.\n\"As a mother myself, it's very painful. I've had sleepless nights because if it were my child I don't think I would still be alive due to all the worries, stress and everything that you have to deal with.\"\nTwo weeks after Joshlin's disappearance from her modest shack in the Middelpos informal settlement, police arrested her mother Racquel \"Kelly\" Smith, Smith's boyfriend Jacquen \"Boeta\" Appollis, Steveno van Rhyn and Phumza Sigaqa. That dwelling has since been locked up and stands deserted. \nThe four first appeared in the local magistrate's court on 7 March on charges of human trafficking and kidnapping. A large crowd of local people gathered around the court to call for \"justice for Joshlin\".\nThe first few days after her disappearance was accompanied by some racial tension between coloured (as people of mixed racial heritage are known in South Africa) and black members of the community following the arrest of Ms Sigaqa, a black person. She was caught up in a maelstrom of rumours and media reports incorrectly identified her as a traditional healer, or sangoma.\n\"There were days where people of this area labelled us as if we are the causes of Joshlin's disappearance. There were days when people were suspicious of sangomas, doing wrong things,\" Liwani Siyabulela, ward councillor for Middelpos, tells the BBC. \n\"We've managed to address the issues - we've made it clear it's not about being coloured or black or white, Indian or whatever. We should focus on finding the missing child. At least now the atmosphere is back to normal,\" says Ms Siyabulela, a member of the governing African National Congress (ANC). \nMs Ross acknowledges",
    "Vaughan Gething should hand back \u00a3200,000 taken from a company owned by a man prosecuted for illegally dumping waste, a former Welsh government minister has told the Senedd.\nLee Waters questioned the judgement of the first minister for accepting the donation, during the Welsh Labour leadership campaign, from Dauson Environment Group.\nHe said he was \u201cdeeply uncomfortable\u201d with the situation and that it was \"shocking\" to find where the money had come from.\nA Welsh government minister, Jane Hutt, said \u201call relevant rules have been complied with\u201d.\nThe former transport minister, who was the public face of the 20mph speed limit policy until he left government in March, made the comments in one of two debates forced by the opposition on the issue.\nLabour MSs successfully voted down Tory calls for an independent investigation into the donations, as well as a Plaid Cymru motion for the Senedd to look at a cap on numbers.\nWelsh Conservative and Plaid Cymru Senedd members criticised Mr Gething for failing to take part in the discussions.\nMr Gething was absent for most of the proceedings, arriving midway through the second debate called by Plaid Cymru. \nMr Waters had supported Vaughan Gething's rival Jeremy Miles and was one of the few Labour politicians who spoke on the record about the donations during the campaign.\nMr Waters said he had been \"struggling to process my feelings\" about the issue and he would have rather avoided making the speech.\nHe said he had not changed his initial view that the donation was \"unjustifiable and wrong\".\nIt really \"shocked\" him that it came from a firm with a conviction for damaging the Gwent Levels, a site of special scientific interest, \"at a time that some of us were fighting hard to protect this area\".\nMr Gething has said that he has followed the rules over political donations.\n\"But the issue is not whether the paperwork was correct, it\u2019s whether the judgement was correct,\" said Mr Waters.\nHe said 25 years ago \"we talked of devolution as the beginning of a new politics; but the reputation of politics, and politicians, seems to be lower than ever\".\n\"The first minister told a Senedd committee last week that his approval ratings haven\u2019t been affected by the controversy. I must say that surprised me, and troubled me.\"\n\"Whether the polls bear that out or not, it really isn\u2019t the point. Surely the question isn\u2019t what any of us can get away with, it\u2019s what is right?\"\n\"I\u2019m deeply uncomfortable with the way I am now, in effect, being expected to endorse something I think is just wrong.\n\"I haven\u2019t spoken out since the donation came to light ten weeks ago. I wanted to give time for the issue to be addressed. But it hasn\u2019t been.\"\nMr Gething has faced claims that he had broken the code of conduct for ministers, which requires ministers not to accept any gift which might, or might reasonably appear to, compromise their judgement or place them under an improper obligation.\nMr Waters said that ministerial code is not a \"legal contract\" or a \"test to find a loophole\"\n\"It's a code of ethics,\" he said.\nCalling on Mr Gething to do the \"right thing,\" he added: \"It would not be a sign of weakness to say it was a mistake to take the donation and now all the facts are known to give it back.\"\nMr Waters' was supported by his party colleague Alun Davies, who called a \"test of a fit and proper person from whom donations may be accepted\".\nHe later said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \"many Labour members agree with Lee\".\nIn the Conservative debate calling for an independent probe, Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: \u201cThere is no rule breaking, but the perception of such substantial monies coming into a campaign to lead the country of Wales as first minister has caused considerable public disquiet, as well as considerable political disquiet amongst the Labour Party and other political parties.\u201d\nHe said the \u00a3200,000 could \"reasonably be seen as securing influence\". \nPlaid Cymru focused on introducing a cap on the size of donations.\nRhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru leader, said: \u201cThis episode reflects terribly, I\u2019m afraid, on the first minister himself and his judgement.\n\u201cBut we can take a stand here today to defend the integrity of our democracy as a whole.\u201d\nHefin David, Labour MS for Caerphilly who supported Mr Gething in the leadership campaign, played the issue down.\nHe was heckled when he told the Senedd the \"more you dig\" on the donations, \"the less you find\".\n\u201cAll of the evidence that we've talked about has been addressed. What are we now trying to investigate?\"\n\u201cAndrew RT Davies says in the Western Mail article that he wants to move on.\n\u201cIf he wants to move on, he can start asking questions about the things we care about: the cost of living, children in care; these are the kind of things he could start asking about at first minister's questions instead of just going on about this non-issue.\u201d\nMr Gething did not respond to either debates, and was not present for the first Conservative sessio",
    "FKA Twigs has revealed she has used artificial intelligence to create a deepfake of herself that will interact with fans and journalists so she can focus on her music.\nThe British singer, dancer and actress told a US Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Tuesday that celebrities and artists should have control over how their voices, looks and personalities are used by AI.\n\"In the past year, I have developed my own deepfake version of myself that is not only trained in my personality but that also can use my exact tone of voice to speak many languages,\" she said.\n\"These and similar technologies are highly valuable tools. This, however, is all under my control and I can grant or refuse consent in a way that is meaningful. \n\"What is not acceptable is when my art and my identity can simply be taken by a third party and exploited falsely for their own gain without my consent due to the absence of appropriate legislative control.\"\nShe added that her digital clone would be able to communicate in French, Korean and Japanese.\n\"It means that even with my upcoming album, I can really explain in depth what it's about creatively,\" she said.\n\"It also allows me to spend more time making art. Often being a music artist, or any artist in this day and age requires a lot of press and a lot of promo, a lot of one-liners.\n\"So it means if it's something simple that doesn't really require my heart, I can do a one-liner and give it to people to promote a piece of work and it's harmless, but ultimately I can spend more time making something that's really meaningful for my fans.\"\nIn further written evidence, she said her \"AI twigs\" would be deployed later this year \"to extend my reach and handle my online social media interactions, whilst I continue to focus on my art from the comfort and solace of my studio\".\nThe star argued that other people shouldn't be allowed to use an artist's voice and other features without their consent, saying that creators' \"careers and livelihoods are in jeopardy\" if there is not legislation to regulate the use of AI.\n\"There are songs online - collaborations with myself and other artists - that I didn't make,\" she told the committee.\n\"It makes me feel vulnerable because, first of all, as an artist, the thing that I love about what I do is that I'm very precise. I take my time with things and I'm very proud of my work.\n\"So the fact that somebody could take my voice, change lyrics, change messaging, maybe work with an artist that I didn't want to work with, or maybe work with an artist that I wanted to work with and now the surprise is ruined - it really leaves me very raw and very vulnerable.\"\nThe use of AI to impersonate the voices and images of well-known singers and rappers has been growing.\nIn early April, Jess Glynne, Mumford and Sons, Sam Smith and Zayn Malik were among the British artists who signed an international open letter calling for more protection against \"the predatory use of AI to steal artists' voices and likenesses\".\nOn Wednesday, a group of UK MPs published a report suggesting that musicians and other celebrities should be protected by a law that would ban AI-generated deepfakes in the UK.\nThe All-Party Parliamentary Group on Music said there should be legislation including \"a specific personality right to protect creators and artists from misappropriation and false endorsement\".\nSuch a law should also include other measures to protect musicians from the risk of AI becoming \"a destroyer of creators' livelihoods\", the MPs said in a report published on Wednesday.\nPoliticians must \"confront the danger that unfettered developments in AI could pose to the UK\u2019s musicians and music businesses\", said the cross-party group's chair, Labour MP Kevin Brennan.\nBut the power of AI can also be a force for good to \"help musicians to innovate and to inspire new human creativity\", he added.\n\n\"We ignore the necessity to sow policies, which will harvest the benefits of AI, and help stave off the threats it poses, at our peril,\" Mr Brennan said.\n\"Our central insight must always be that AI can be a great servant but would be a terrible master.\"\nIn response, a government spokesperson said: \"We are committed to helping artists and the creative industries work with the AI sector to harness the opportunities this technology provides, and ensure our music can continue to be enjoyed around the world.\n\u201cTrust and transparency are vital to this shared approach. We are working closely with stakeholders and will provide a further update in due course.\u201d\nThe government has already pledged that the creation of sexually explicit deepfake images will be made a criminal offence in England and Wales.",
    "Johnson & Johnson has outlined a new settlement that it said would resolve nearly all of the lawsuits it faces over claims that its talc products, including baby powder, caused cancer.\nThe pharmaceutical giant said it was offering $6.475bn (\u00a35.2bn) over 25 years to former customers with ovarian cancer claims.\nThose represent the vast majority of the more than 59,000 lawsuits it faces.\nIn all, it said it was now setting aside about $11bn (\u00a38.8bn) to address the talc litigation.\n\nThis is the third settlement offer Johnson & Johnson has put forward to try to address the claims from former customers, which have weighed on the company's reputation and stock price. \nIt said none of the cases against it had \"merit\" but it was now seeking votes of support for the proposal from its opponents in the hope of ending the litigation. \nLast year, it proposed to pay nearly $9bn (\u00a37.2bn) for a more comprehensive deal, which would have addressed lung cancer and mesothelioma claims, as well as litigation from state attorneys general in the US. \nThe company said it was working separately to resolve those matters and had addressed 95% of the mesothelioma claims. \nIt also announced a tentative $700m (\u00a3560m) settlement with the states in January.  \nErik Haas, the company's worldwide vice president of litigation, said he hoped that putting the latest deal directly to ovarian cancer claimants would help bring the fights to a close.\n\u201cUnlike the prior cases, it is the vote of the claimants \u2013 and not the conflicting financial incentives of the small minority of plaintiff lawyers who stand to receive excessive legal fees outside of a reorganization \u2013 that decides whether the Plan may proceed,\u201d he said.\nThe company said the $6.475bn sum was \"far better recovery than the claimants stand to recover at trial\" and that the slow nature of the legal process meant most of those effected would never have \u201ctheir day in court\u201d.\nThe deal drew mixed reactions from lawyers representing former customers.\n\"If a bankruptcy court accepts the proposal, J&J would pay pennies on the dollar for ovarian cancer and mesothelioma claims,\" lawyers Mike Papantonio and Andy Birchfield said in a statement.\nJohnson & Johnson stopped US sales of its talc-based baby powder in 2020, citing \"misinformation\" that had sapped demand for the product, applied to prevent nappy rash and for other cosmetic uses, including dry shampoo. In 2022, it announced plans to end sales globally.\nBefore that decision, the company had sold the baby powder for almost 130 years. It continues to sell a version of the product that contains cornstarch.\nJohnson & Johnson has won a majority of the talc lawsuits against it and has maintained the products did not contain asbestos and did not cause cancer.\nBut it has been stuck with some significant losses, including one decision in which 22 women were awarded a judgement of more than $2bn.\nIt previously tried to resolve the lawsuits in bankruptcy court.\nBut its efforts ran into trouble after judges have ruled that the subsidiary it created to be responsible for the claims was not in financial distress and could not use the bankruptcy system to resolve the lawsuits.\n\n",

    "Looted artefacts from the Asante kingdom are finally on display in Ghana, 150 years after British colonisers took them.\nGhanaians flocked to the Manhyia Palace Museum in Kumasi, the capital of Asante region, to welcome the 32 items home.\n\"This is a day for Asante. A day for the Black African continent. The spirit we share is back,\" said Asante King Otumfuo Osei Tutu II.\nAt this stage the items have only been loaned to Ghana for three years.\nThis loan can be extended, but only with the approval of the British culture secretary.\nThe agreement is between two British museums - the Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A) and British Museum - and the Asante king, not the Ghanaian government.\nThe Asante king, or Asantehene, is seen as a symbol of traditional authority, and is believed to be invested with the spirits of his predecessors. But his kingdom is now part of Ghana's modern democracy.\n\"Our dignity is restored,\" Henry Amankwaatia, a retired police commissioner and proud Asante, told the BBC, over the hum of jubilant drumming.\nThe V&A is lending 17 pieces while 15 are from the British Museum.\nThe return of the artefacts coincides with the silver jubilee celebration of the Asantehene.\nSome of the items, described by some as \"Ghana's crown jewels\" were looted during the Anglo-Ashanti wars of the 19th Century, including the famous Sagrenti War of 1874.  \nOther items like the gold harp (Sankuo) were given to a British diplomat in 1817.\n\"We acknowledge the very painful history surrounding the acquisition of these objects. A history tainted by the scars of imperial conflict and colonialism,\" said Dr Tristam Hunt, director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, who has travelled to Kumasi for the ceremony.\nAmong the returned artefacts are the sword of state, gold peace pipe and gold badges worn by officials charged with cleansing the soul of the king.\n\"These treasures have borne witness to triumph and trials of the great kingdom and their return to Kumasi is testament to the power of cultural exchange and reconciliation,\" said Dr Hunt.\nOne of the returned items, the sword of state, also called the \"mpompomsuo sword\" holds great significance for the Asante people. \nIt serves as a sword of office that is used in swearing the oath of office to the kingdom by paramount chiefs and the king himself.\nRoyal historian Osei-Bonsu Safo-Kantanka told the BBC that when the items were taken from the Asante it took away \"a portion of our heart, our feeling, our whole being\".\nThe return of the artefacts is as controversial as it is significant. \nUnder UK law, national museums like the V&A and British Museum are banned from permanently giving back contested items in their collections, and loan deals such as this are seen as a way to allow objects to return to their countries of origin.\nSome countries laying claim to disputed artefacts fear that loans may be used to imply they accept the UK's ownership.\nMany Ghanaians feel the ornaments should remain permanently. However, this new arrangement is a way to overcome British legal restrictions.\nAfrican countries have repeatedly called for the return of looted items with some regaining ownership over precious historical artefacts in recent years.\nIn 2022 Germany gave back over 1,000 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria. The German foreign minister said at the time it was a step in dealing with a \"dark colonial history\".\nAll pictures subject to copyright",

    "The father of a girl with autism who took her own life said Harry Potter inspired her to move from the family home in Singapore to a UK boarding school.\nCaitlyn Scott-Lee, 16, attended Wycombe Abbey school in Buckinghamshire from the age of 11, where she lived onsite.\nHer father, Jonathan Scott-Lee, said it was Caitlyn\u2019s choice to attend the boarding school.\nHe said: \u201cShe was into Harry Potter at the time, and it was Caitlyn who chose Wycombe Abbey.\"\nHe added: \"She loved learning, even in the Singapore system - which is very competitive - she was one of the top one or two in her class.\n\u201cShe would say \u2018tell me more stuff Daddy, I\u2019m like a sponge\u2019. She had an intense desire to please those in authority.\u201d\nCaitlyn died on 21 April 2023, just weeks before she was due to sit her GCSEs.  She had been diagnosed with autism the year before.\nShe had sought help from the NHS just weeks before her death and killed herself because she could not bear the thought of a detention, an inquest heard.\nHer father recalled: \u201cWe increasingly heard less and less from her, not because she didn\u2019t want to speak to us, but because she was having so much fun with the new friends she had made\u2026and she really enjoyed that boarding school life.\u201d\nIn Year 11, Caitlyn received a detention for having alcohol in her locker and missed a concert, just before the Easter holidays.\nHer father, who is himself autistic, said that she became preoccupied by the detention.\nHe told the BBC: \u201cIt was probably appropriate that she had a sanction for that but, for someone like Caitlyn, I can imagine that it might have disproportionately weighed on her mind during that long Easter period.\u201d\nIn a statement read out in court, her mother Tara said that during the Easter holidays, Caitlyn had asked to see a GP for anxiety, which her mother arranged.\nShe was given a referral to the NHS Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, booked for the 16 May. But Caitlyn took her own life just hours before the detention was due to begin.\nDuring the inquest, an excerpt from Caitlyn\u2019s personal diary was read out, where she acknowledged that she might be self-medicating with alcohol.  \n\u201cI\u2019ve been feeling suicidal\u201d she wrote.\nShe texted a friend during the school holidays and said:  \u201cI\u2019m the most anxious and depressed I\u2019ve ever been. I\u2019d rather be suspended than have a detention.\u201d\nThe inquest heard from the headmistress of Wycombe Abbey, Joanne Duncan.\nShe said: \u201cThe school has been devastated by Caitlyn\u2019s death.  She was a much-loved pupil who was celebrated for her talent in performing arts.\u201d\nThe school had not been aware that she had been suffering from anxiety during the school holidays, nor was she on the list of girls with \"serious mental health issues\".\nMs Duncan added: \u201cWe are deeply saddened that we were unaware of the difficulties she was suffering with.\u201d\nNearly one in four people with autism have attempted suicide and were seven times more likely to die by suicide than non-autistic people, charity Autism Centre of Excellence at Cambridge, said.\nIn an open letter to the government, it highlighted the increased risk.\nIts CEO, Tom Purser, said: \u201cCaitlyn\u2019s inquest has demonstrated that despite schools and the NHS doing their best, it is too frequently not enough to prevent the most tragic of outcomes.\"\nHe added: \"The government must listen, both to the people signing our letter and to the countless stories like Caitlyn\u2019s which send a loud and clear message - work with us and help save autistic peoples' lives.\u201d\nThe charity Autistica said that while only 1% of the UK population are autistic, 15% of people who attempted suicide have a diagnosis of autism.\nMr Scott-Lee told the inquest: \u201cIt\u2019s a myth that people with autism don\u2019t have much emotion - we do but it\u2019s amplified and internal. \n\"We are often misunderstood. Caitlyn loved intensely but also internally.\n\u201cCaitlyn would not have wanted to unleash such emotional devastation on her loved ones. Most people don\u2019t want to end their lives, they just want the pain to stop.\u201d\nThe inquest concluded there was \"no evidence\" that anything would have helped the school prevent the 16-year-old from taking her own life.\nHowever, her father wondered whether his daughter's \"narrative\" was \"fully heard\".\nMr Scott-Lee said: \"The big hole in this inquest is Caitlyn\u2019s diary. It is a very, very unusual inquest.\n\"The coroner is right. Caitlyn left a uniquely comprehensive five-year account of her life. However, I wonder whether her narrative was fully heard. I still wonder whether autism was appropriately considered in the context of Caitlyn\u2019s actions.\n\"To honour Caitlyn and support the broader autistic community, it is right to reflect on whether there has been appropriate diligence in this investigation. I will consider options and revert in due course.\"\nIf you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The UK will not accept the return of asylum seekers from Ireland, the prime minister has told MPs.\nThe Irish government has complained of a significant spike in the number of asylum seekers arriving in Ireland from Northern Ireland, and argued the UK has a duty to take them back. \nBut Rishi Sunak told the Commons the UK had no legal obligation to do so. \nHe also urged the Irish government to honour its pledges to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland. \nOn Tuesday, Irish Justice Minister Helen McEntee announced she was releasing 100 police officers from desktop duties to work on frontline immigration enforcement, in response to a rising number of asylum seekers who, she claimed, were coming from Northern Ireland because they feared being sent to Rwanda.\nDuring Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Sunak said Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris was \"seeking urgent clarification\" from Dublin that \"there will be no disruption or police checkpoints at or near the border\". \n\"I can confirm that the United Kingdom has no legal obligation to accept returns of illegal migrants from Ireland,\" he added. \nDowning Street has repeatedly argued that the UK is under no obligation to take asylum seekers back from Ireland, and will not do so while France continues to refuse to accept returns from the UK.\nFollowing Brexit, the 310-mile frontier between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic is the only land border between the UK and the EU. \nBut both governments have agreed that a return to security posts here could jeopardise the Good Friday Agreement, which helped to end nearly 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland. \nIn the Commons, Democratic Unionist MP Carla Lockhart dismissed Dublin's claim that 80% of asylum seekers were entering Ireland from Northern Ireland as \"unsubstantiated\", suggesting \"the reverse is true\".  \nShe also accused the Irish government of \"hypocrisy\" given its previous statements about the border.\nMr Sunak said the UK had \"made commitments to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland\" and the \"Irish government must uphold its promises too\".\n\"We can't have cherry-picking of important international agreements,\" he added. \nThe prime minister said it was \"no surprise that our robust approach to illegal migration is providing a deterrent, but the answer is not sending police to villages in Donegal\".\n\"It's to work with us in partnership to strengthen our external borders all around the Common Travel Area [an open borders area including the UK, Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands] that we share.\" \nThe UK has an operational agreement with Ireland on the Common Travel Area which Dublin says provides for returning asylum seekers, but No 10 has said this is not legally binding and that no one has been returned to the UK under its terms.\nLabour said it agreed the UK should not accept returns from Ireland \"while Britain is not able to return people who arrive here from the EU\".\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris has said his country will not \"provide a loophole\" for others' migration \"challenges\".\nBut he added that there would be no police checkpoints on the border.\nThe Safety of Rwanda Act, which became law last week, aims to deter migrants from crossing the Channel in small boats by deporting some asylum seekers to the east African country. \nThe Home Office has announced that migrants identified for deportation to Rwanda have begun being detained. \nIt said more operations would be carried out in the coming weeks.",
    "I'm in Victory Park, Moscow's giant memorial complex dedicated to the Soviet Union's defeat of Nazi Germany. A new open-air exhibition has just opened.\nBut it has nothing to do with World War Two.\nOn display is Western military hardware captured by the Russian army in Ukraine.\nThey are war trophies and Russia has decided to flaunt them.\nAmong the armour here is a British Army Husky tactical support vehicle which had been donated to Ukraine. Its windscreen is covered in bullet-holes.\nOpposite the Husky I can see Western tanks that had been transferred to the Ukrainian military. There's an American Abrams which had been damaged on the battlefield. A German Leopard tank, too. \nIn fact, there's a long line of German armour. And above it a sign: \"History is repeating itself.\"\nThe Russian authorities want the public to think that the war in Ukraine and World War Two have a common denominator: Russia as the victim, under attack from enemies abroad.\nIn reality, the two wars are very different. In 1941 Germany invaded Russia. In 2022 Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nThe war trophy exhibition is packed out.\nIn bright sunshine Russians are crowding round the military hardware, posing for photographs in front of tank gun barrels and, from the sounds of it, thoroughly enjoying the display.\n\"It's incredible. Jaw-dropping,\" says Natalya, who's here with her husband and small daughter.\n\"It's amazing to think that our guys managed to get these trophies.\"\nMore than 30 armoured vehicles have been put on display.\nBut why?\nThe Russians have not invented the wheel here. In the past Ukraine has displayed Russian military hardware that had been captured by the Ukrainian army.\nBut for the Russian authorities, this exhibition has, I believe, several key objectives.\nThe first is to reinforce the Kremlin's narrative that, in Ukraine, Nato - and the West as a whole - are waging war on Russia. The aim here is to demonise the West yet further in the minds of Russians.\nIn reality, it was Russia that invaded Ukraine: something Western leaders had urged Moscow not to do. It was President Vladimir Putin's personal decision to launch what Russia still refers to as the \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. \nWith supplies of arms and ammunition, the West came to Kyiv's defence. It does not seek to destroy Russia, despite what Russian officials may claim.\nThen there's the historical symbolism.\nRight now Victory Park is ablaze with red flags commemorating the upcoming Victory Day, the 9 May national holiday which marks Hitler's defeat. \nThe venue for this exhibition (a World War Two memorial) and the timing (ahead of Victory Day) feed that other official narrative I mentioned earlier: the one claiming a link between World War Two and the war in Ukraine.\nBut there's also a large element of gloating about this exhibition. Regarding the war in Ukraine, the Russians appear increasingly confident, despite the recent $61bn (\u00a349bn) package of US assistance to Kyiv. Moscow believes it now has the initiative on the battlefield.\nRussia's main message is written on a big sign beside the war trophies. \nIt reads: \"Our victory is inevitable.\" ",
    "Presenter Sangita Myska is to leave talk radio station LBC as part of a shake-up of the schedule, parent company Global has announced.\nIt follows speculation on social media about Myska's position, after listeners said she appeared to have been taken off air.\nGlobal thanked Myska for her \"fantastic contribution\" to the station. Myska has not yet commented.\nVanessa Feltz is among the new hosts being added to the weekend line-up.\nHowever, Feltz is not a direct replacement for Myska because she is hosting a programme in a different timeslot.\nFrom 4 May, former Talk TV presenter Feltz will front a new LBC show between 15:00 to 18:00 on Saturdays.\nMyska, who hosted a weekend phone-in show, has not been on air since 14 April, and had been replaced by another presenter, Ali Miraj, in recent weeks.\nMiraj, a former Conservative Party parliamentary candidate, will now permanently join the weekend schedule, Global confirmed.\nSome listeners had questioned whether Myska's departure was connected to an interview she conducted with an Israeli government spokesperson the day after Iran launched an unprecedented missile and drone attack on Israel.\nHer absence from the airwaves led to an outpouring of support, and almost 25,000 people signed a petition to calling for LBC to reinstate her.\nThe station has kept the YouTube clip of the interview online. Parent company Global has not made reference to it, and its announcement on Wednesday said the line-up changes were \"part of a refreshed weekend schedule\".\nLBC's senior managing editor Tom Cheal said: \"We'd like to thank Sangita for her fantastic contribution to LBC and wish her every success in the future.\"\nFeltz left Talk TV last month following the announcement that the channel was moving online.\nIn a statement, she said: \"After a long and passionate courtship, I've finally succumbed to the allure of LBC. Actually I was powerless to resist. \n\"Global's dynamism is mesmerising and it is THE high octane station from which to broadcast, in this riveting election year. I can't wait to join the Global family and get cracking. Brace yourself for May 4th - May the fourth be with you!\"\nPrior to working on Talk TV, Feltz spent more than two decades at the BBC, hosting programmes on Radio 2 and Radio London.\nEarlier this week, LBC also announced a new Sunday morning politics show for The News Agents co-host Lewis Goodall.",

    "US singer Olivia Rodrigo has expressed her disappointment after becoming the latest act to fall foul of a crisis at Manchester's troubled Co-op Live arena.\nShe was due to launch her UK tour with two sold-out gigs at the new venue this weekend, but they have been called off.\nThe decision came after the arena's opening was postponed for a third time on Wednesday when a fault scuppered a gig by rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie.\nRodrigo told fans she was \"sooooo disappointed\" not to perform her shows.\n\"I'm so bummed and I really hope to see you all soon,\" the chart-topping pop star wrote on Instagram, saying she and her team were \"doing our best\" to reschedule the concerts.\nRodrigo's fans have also had their plans wrecked, with many left out of pocket. Scott Tostevin, from Guernsey, had booked flights and a hotel for himself and two friends to see her on Friday night.\nHe told the BBC the group had spent several hundred pounds on the trip.\n\"I can either use my flights and hotel to now sit and watch a film in Manchester or lose the money and just cancel it all with no refunds,\" he said.\nThe decision to postpone major shows by one of the world's biggest artists is another big embarrassment for the Manchester arena after a series of delays.\nThe \u00a3365m venue, the UK's largest indoor arena with space for 23,500 people, was due to be opened by comedian Peter Kay last week, but his shows have been postponed twice.\nBosses decided Rodrigo's shows could not go ahead after A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie's concert was cancelled at the last minute on Wednesday.\nThousands of his fans were waiting outside the venue when they were informed about the announcement, which came 10 minutes after doors had been due to open.\nThe arena's operators blamed an incident during the soundcheck, when \"a component of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system, used to direct air, separated from the ductwork\".\nThey said no-one had been injured and that they were \"deeply sorry\", but the whole system would need to be tested for further defects.\nTicket-holders, many of whom had travelled for miles, were left disappointed, and the rapper wrote on social media: \"I'm heated about the situation too, but safety first Manchester, I got you, just stay tuned for further info.\"\nOne fan told the BBC it was \"very unprofessional\", while another criticised the \"bad organisation\".\nThe venue's operators, Oak View Group, said they appreciated \"the inconvenience\" this would cause for \"many\". The fault had been caused by a \"factory defect\" with a nozzle used to direct air, they added.\nHowever, staff were unable to verify that other such nozzles were free of similar problems.\nFan Katie Barnsley, who travelled up from Kent for the gig, found out it had been cancelled just as she was about to get a tram from Manchester city centre to the arena in the Etihad Campus.\nThe 28-year-old insurance broker had travelled up from near Dover with her partner and his sister, and estimated they had spent around \u00a3600 on tickets, accommodation and petrol.\nShe said: \"We were going on the tram and were asking the attendant how we got to the campus and he said, 'Don't bother, it's been cancelled'.\n\"Then I went on Twitter and saw the tweet from the arena.\"\nMs Barnsley said she had been apprehensive about travelling to Manchester because of the cancellation of earlier gigs at the venue but had been reassured by recent tweets from Co-op Live saying other shows would be going ahead.\nSome fans outside the venue were handed a sheet of paper saying A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie's gig had been cancelled for \"technical reasons\".\nZack, also 17, had come from Blackpool for the show. \"I'm on crutches and we queued up for about two hours, wasting our time,\" he said.\n\"They came out with these sheets of paper saying 'we're sorry about this', but we'd found out already from people shouting, people running around shouting that it's cancelled before they [the staff] even came out themselves.\"\nTeoni Kirkham, 21, said: \"We literally hopped out of our Uber and just saw everybody turning around and walking the opposite way. We found out literally when we got here.\n\"It's just messy, really. It seems like there's no organisation. With Ticketmaster on my phone, I thought, surely if it's been cancelled I would have got notification. They've not done a good job I don't think.\"\nThe next show in the schedule is Keane on Sunday, followed by a five-night residency by Take That next week.\nThe venue said it understood \"the need to reassure fans over future shows\", but did not rule out further postponements.\n\"We are working with artist management and promoters to limit the impact on the opening season schedule,\" its statement said.\n\"Where necessary, we will identify alternate dates, and will continually reassess to provide fans with sufficient notice regarding imminent shows.\n\"Should shows be cancelled or rescheduled, fans will be contacted by their point of purchase and offered a full refund where preferred.\"\nOak View Group chi",
    "New rules that tighten Chinese government restrictions on the country's internet companies have come into effect today, raising concerns about how they will be applied.\nThe expanded State Secrets Law compels firms - including social media giants Tencent, ByteDance and Weibo - to take action if users post sensitive information.\nIt requires \"network operators\" to monitor information being shared by users.

    "Two human rights groups have condemned an 11-year prison sentence handed to a Saudi fitness instructor and women's rights activist by a terrorism court.\nManahel al-Otaibi, 29, was convicted of charges related to her clothing choices and expression of her views online, Amnesty International and ALQST said. \nThese included calls for an end to the guardianship system and videos of her shopping without an abaya, they added.\nSaudi diplomats told the UN she was found guilty of \"terrorism offences\".\nA letter from the Sunni Muslim-ruled Gulf kingdom's mission in Geneva confirmed that Manahel al-Otaibi's trial had concluded with her conviction in January, but it provided no further details about the case.\nDozens of people, many of them women, have been have been imprisoned in Saudi Arabia in the past two years in connection with social media posts. \nAmnesty International and ALQST, a London-based Saudi rights organisation, said Manahel al-Otaibi was an early supporter of the social and economic reforms enacted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after he was named heir to the throne in 2017 by his father King Salman. \nTwo years later, she told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle that she felt free to wear what she liked and express her views. She also explained that her behaviour was \"based on what the crown prince has said... that I have the right to choose what I want to wear, as long as it is respectable\".\nIn November 2022, she was arrested on terrorism charges amid an intensified crackdown on online dissent.\nALQST said she was initially accused of violating the Anti-Cyber Crime Law, including \"opposing the laws relating to women, such as the male guardianship system and the hijab law\"; \"participating in several hashtags opposing these laws\"; \"having several photos and video clips in indecent clothes on [social media] accounts\", and \"going to the shops without wearing an abaya, photographing this, and publishing it on Snapchat\". \nUnder Saudi Arabia's male guardianship system, a woman's father, brother, husband or son has the authority to make critical decisions on their behalf about marriage, divorce and their children.\nHer sister Fawzia faced similar charges, but fled Saudi Arabia that year after being summoned for questioning, ALQST added.\nThree months after her arrest, Manahel al-Otaibi's case was referred to the Specialised Criminal Court (SCC). Rights groups say the terrorism tribunal has been used to prosecute peaceful dissidents and that it is notorious for violations of fair trial standards and handing out harsh sentences.\nOn 9 January, she was convicted and sentenced to 11 years in prison by the court, but the verdict was only publicly revealed in the Saudi mission's letter to the UN Human Rights Office, which was dated 25 January. \nThe letter said the court found her guilty of \"terrorism offences\" under articles 43 and 44 of the Counter-Terrorism Law. They outline sentences for \"any person who creates, launches, or uses a website or a program on a computer or on an electronic device to commit [a terrorism offence]\", and \"any person who, by any means, broadcasts or publishes news, statements, false or malicious rumours, or the like for committing a terrorist crime\".\nThe letter stressed that the court \"verified all the evidence against her, while fully respecting the international obligations of Saudi Arabia\".\n\"The government wishes to underscore the fact that the exercise and defence of rights is not a crime under Saudi law; however, justifying the actions of terrorists by describing them as exercising or defending rights is unacceptable and constitutes an attempt to legitimize terrorist crimes,\" the letter added.\nALQST's head of advocacy Lina al-Hathloul said Manahel al-Otaibi's \"confidence that she could act with freedom could have been a positive advertisement for Mohammed bin Salman's much-touted narrative of leading women's rights reforms in the country\".\n\"Instead, by arresting her and now imposing this outrageous sentence on her, the Saudi authorities have once again laid bare the arbitrary and contradictory nature of their so-called reforms, and their continuing determination to control Saudi Arabia's women,\" she said.",

    "Hundreds of asylum seekers who were living in tents in central Dublin have been moved to two accommodation sites, the Irish government has said.\nThe asylum seekers had been living in a makeshift campsite outside the International Protection Office on Mount Street for several months.\nThe Irish government said 285 single male applicants were offered accommodation on Wednesday.\nThe Irish government said the encampment had been dismantled and all asylum seekers had now been moved to Citywest and Crooksling tented accommodation in County Dublin. A total of 186 applicants were taken to Citywest and a further 99 were accommodated at Crooksling.\nA joint agency operation to \"ensure the safe movement of people seeking international protection\" to designated accommodation took place early on Wednesday morning\nThe streets in the area were also cleaned by the city's council.\nThe operation on Wednesday morning was undertaken by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Department of Justice, Garda\u00ed (Irish police), Dublin City Council, the Office of Public Works and the HSE.\nThe government previously tried to move asylum seekers to the Crooksling site over the St Patrick's Day bank holiday weekend. \nA number returned to the Mount Street site a few hours later citing the facility was not appropriate, did not have adequate facilities and was too rural with no transport links.\nThe Irish government said on Wednesday that the Crooksling site had \"10 to 12 person robust, weather-proof tents\". \nIt also has showers, toilets, indoor areas where food is provided, facilities to charge phones and personal devices, access to and from the city centre as well as 24-hour onsite security.\nIt also added those in Crooksling would receive the same support as at other locations.\nFive buses and 19 taxis were used to move the asylum seekers.\nSpeaking in the D\u00e1il (Irish parliament) on Tuesday, Taoiseach (prime minister) Simon Harris said that once asylum seekers sleeping on the street were given accommodation, the encampment would not be allowed to return.\nContractors, some wearing protective clothing, cleared the tents from the street.\nThe Irish government said on Wednesday that Dublin City Council and the Office of Public Works will \"secure the area of Mount Street where the tents were placed, with street furniture and traffic management measures in place to prevent the placement of tents\".\nIt said it did not \"envisage an encampment building up on Mount Street again\" with street furniture and traffic management measures being put in place.\n\"This underlines how important it is that the Comprehensive Accommodation Strategy is rolled out successfully so that sufficient accommodation is provided, and sleeping outside the International Protection Office isn't necessary.\"\nIt said applicants \"will be transferred from these sites when appropriate accommodation is identified within the IPAS (International Protection Accommodation Services) accommodation portfolio\". \n\"Given the need to ensure that there is sufficient capacity for families, including those with children, it is not possible to give timelines.\"\nThe Irish government said the \"offer of accommodation in IPAS centres is voluntary and some applicants are understood to have not taken up a place at their assigned centre\". \n\"IPAS will continue to engage with these applicants and efforts will be made to ensure these applicants do not continue to reside at the Mount Street location.\"\nNoel Wardick, Dublin City Co-operative's chief executive, said he hoped the new accommodation would be better than the makeshift campsite on Mount Street.\n\"The conditions were what only you could describe as absolutely appalling, completely unacceptable humanitarian conditions,\" he said.\n\"No sanitisation, no water, no hygiene, an awful smell of urine.\n\"People crammed in together, living in the heart of the capital city in a situation which is utterly unjust and unfair and a shameful episode in contemporary Ireland.\"\nMr Wardick said politicians had \"no political will\" to address the issues around asylum seekers.\n\"Nothing can explain why they were left out in the street for many weeks or months,\" he added.\n\"At the end of the day, refugees who are not provided with accommodation have to live somewhere. \n\"If the state can provide accommodation, as it is legally obliged to do, then there won't be tents appearing on the street of Dublin or any other city. \n\"However, if the state doesn\u2019t provide accommodation then they will have to live somewhere and I absolutely believe tents will appear on the streets of Dublin again.\"\nAoife Moore, BBC News NI's Dublin reporter\nWednesday was a new day in Mount Street, both in weather and view.\nOn Tuesday, hundreds of tents lined the busy city centre street, blocking the pavement, with tarpaulins rattling against the wind and rain.\nHundreds of people, who have fled from places like Afghanistan and India, told the BBC they had no running water or toilets, and",

    "The two frontrunners to succeed outgoing First Minister Humza Yousaf have held informal talks.\nJohn Swinney and Kate Forbes met on Tuesday, according to a spokesperson for Ms Forbes.\nBoth have said they are considering a bid for the leadership, though neither has confirmed they are running.\nNominations for the role close on Monday. A contest will be held if more than one candidate gets sufficient support.\nNews of the meeting emerged on Wednesday as the Scottish government survived a motion of no confidence that could have forced all SNP ministers to resign. \n\"We can confirm Kate spoke to John yesterday,\" a spokesperson for Ms Forbes, the former finance secretary, said.\n\"It was a purely informal meeting. Kate is continuing to weigh up whether to run and is grateful for the growing outpouring of support.\"\nSpeaking earlier, Ms Forbes said she \"fundamentally disagreed\" with any suggestion she would not have enough parliamentary party support to become SNP leader, having narrowly lost out to Mr Yousaf in last year's contest to replace Nicola Sturgeon. \nMs Forbes said she was \"listening just now and not ruling anything out\".\nMr Swinney, the former deputy first minister, told reporters at Holyrood: \"I will not be rushed into making decisions that affect my loved ones.\"\nHe denied there was a stand off between potential leadership candidates. \n\"It's about people taking the time to make the right decisions for those they love,\" he said. \nMr Swinney has been backed by a number of senior party figures, including Westminster leader Stephen Flynn, deputy leader Keith Brown and cabinet ministers Neil Gray, Shirley-Anne Somerville and Mairi McAllan.\nMs Forbes has been publicly supported by ex-ministers Fergus Ewing and Ivan McKee, as well as backbench MP Joanna Cherry.\nAllies of Ms Forbes told BBC Scotland News she had made progress planning a potential leadership bid, including on policy positions and resources, in case she decided to stand.\nHer supporters said she was not expected to make an announcement on Wednesday as it had only been 48 hours since Mr Yousaf announced his resignation.\nMs Sturgeon, speaking to journalists at Holyrood, said: \"I'll make up my own mind, I'm not going to tell other members how to vote.\n\"What I would say is that I hope the contest is positive, I hope it is forward-looking, and I hope it focuses on the things the SNP needs to do to continue it's very strong election-winning streak.\"\nMs Forbes, who narrowly lost out to Mr Yousaf in the 2023 leadership contest, was criticised during the campaign for revealing she would have voted against gay marriage legislation had she been an MSP at the time due to her religious beliefs as a member of the Free Church of Scotland.\nAt the time, Mr Swinney, also a Christian, questioned whether it would be \"appropriate\" for someone with such views to become SNP leader.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme, Mr Ewing urged Mr Swinney to retract those comments.\nNominations for the SNP leadership opened on Monday and close one week later. If more than one candidate receives 100 nominations from at least 20 local party branches, a ballot will be held among members to choose a new leader.\nMr Yousaf has said he will resign as first minister once a new leader is chosen. At that point, parliament will have 28 days to nominate a new first minister to be appointed by the King.\nIf MSPs cannot reach an agreement after 28 days, a snap election would be called.\nSpeaking for the first time since announcing his resignation, Mr Yousaf said he had \"paid the price\" for the way he ended the SNP's power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens.\nHe told BBC News ending the Bute House Agreement was the \"right decision\".\n\"But I have to acknowledge the manner in which I did it caused great upset and that's on me,\" he said. \nA motion of no confidence in his government, which would have forced all SNP ministers to resign, was defeated by 70 votes 58 in the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday. \nThe result was in little doubt after the Greens, whose votes would be required to give the opposition a majority, called for it to be withdrawn following the first minister's resignation announcement.\nIf it had passed, the motion would have compelled the entire government to resign, with parliament given 28 days to nominate a new first minister.

We were tackled and beaten, and my hands were handcuffed so tightly that even lifting my pinky caused extreme harm and excruciating pain\".\nThe NYPD denied that it was unnecessarily aggressive, and the administration has defended its decision to bring in police - who will remain on campus until 17 May. \nMeghnad Bose, a 31-year-old journalism graduate student at Columbia University, witnessed the NYPD raid on Tuesday night and said police acted \"rough and aggressive\" with the protesters.\nWhile 109 people at Columbia University were arrested when police stormed the school to quash the pro-Palestinian protest, police said at a Wednesday press conference that they arrested another 173 people at a similar sit-in at the City College of New York later in the evening.\nPolice Commissioner Edward Caban said officers intervened because \"public safety was a real concern... the NYPD was called in to do their job\".\nA 19-year-old physics student named Kevin - he declined to give his last name - said it was \"difficult to be proud of being a Columbia student\" after the police raid, which had left him deeply frustrated. \nHe spoke while piling bags full of clothes into his parents' car just outside the campus gates, and said he was unsure when he would return. \n\"It depends on what the university does in the coming months,\" he said. \"We'll see what they [the administration] say about it.

    "US singer Olivia Rodrigo has expressed her disappointment after becoming the latest act to fall foul of a crisis at Manchester's troubled Co-op Live arena.\nShe was due to launch her UK tour with two sold-out gigs at the new venue this weekend, but they have been called off.\nThe decision came after the arena's opening was postponed for a third time on Wednesday when a fault scuppered a gig by rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie.\nRodrigo told fans she was \"sooooo disappointed\" not to perform her shows.\n\"I'm so bummed and I really hope to see you all soon,\" the chart-topping pop star wrote on Instagram, saying she and her team were \"doing our best\" to reschedule the concerts.\nRodrigo's fans have also had their plans wrecked, with many left out of pocket. Scott Tostevin, from Guernsey, had booked flights and a hotel for himself and two friends to see her on Friday night.\nHe told the BBC the group had spent several hundred pounds on the trip.\n\"I can either use my flights and hotel to now sit and watch a film in Manchester or lose the money and just cancel it all with no refunds,\" he said.\nThe decision to postpone major shows by one of the world's biggest artists is another big embarrassment for the Manchester arena after a series of delays.\nThe \u00a3365m venue, the UK's largest indoor arena with space for 23,500 people, was due to be opened by comedian Peter Kay last week, but his shows have been postponed twice.\nBosses decided Rodrigo's shows could not go ahead after A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie's concert was cancelled at the last minute on Wednesday.\nThousands of his fans were waiting outside the venue when they were informed about the announcement, which came 10 minutes after doors had been due to open.\nThe arena's operators blamed an incident during the soundcheck, when \"a component of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system, used to direct air, separated from the ductwork\".\nThey said no-one had been injured and that they were \"deeply sorry\", but the whole system would need to be tested for further defects.\nTicket-holders, many of whom had travelled for miles, were left disappointed, and the rapper wrote on social media: \"I'm heated about the situation too, but safety first Manchester, I got you, just stay tuned for further info.\"\nOne fan told the BBC it was \"very unprofessional\", while another criticised the \"bad organisation\".\nThe venue's operators, Oak View Group, said they appreciated \"the inconvenience\" this would cause for \"many\". The fault had been caused by a \"factory defect\" with a nozzle used to direct air, they added.\nHowever, staff were unable to verify that other such nozzles were free of similar problems.\nFan Katie Barnsley, who travelled up from Kent for the gig, found out it had been cancelled just as she was about to get a tram from Manchester city centre to the arena in the Etihad Campus.\nThe 28-year-old insurance broker had travelled up from near Dover with her partner and his sister, and estimated they had spent around \u00a3600 on tickets, accommodation and petrol.\nShe said: \"We were going on the tram and were asking the attendant how we got to the campus and he said, 'Don't bother, it's been cancelled'.\n\"Then I went on Twitter and saw the tweet from the arena.\"\nMs Barnsley said she had been apprehensive about travelling to Manchester because of the cancellation of earlier gigs at the venue but had been reassured by recent tweets from Co-op Live saying other shows would be going ahead.\nSome fans outside the venue were handed a sheet of paper saying A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie's gig had been cancelled for \"technical reasons\".\nZack, also 17, had come from Blackpool for the show. \"I'm on crutches and we queued up for about two hours, wasting our time,\" he said.\n\"They came out with these sheets of paper saying 'we're sorry about this', but we'd found out already from people shouting, people running around shouting that it's cancelled before they [the staff] even came out themselves.\"\nTeoni Kirkham, 21, said: \"We literally hopped out of our Uber and just saw everybody turning around and walking the opposite way. We found out literally when we got here.\n\"It's just messy, really. It seems like there's no organisation. With Ticketmaster on my phone, I thought, surely if it's been cancelled I would have got notification. They've not done a good job I don't think.\"\nThe next show in the schedule is Keane on Sunday, followed by a five-night residency by Take That next week.\nThe venue said it understood \"the need to reassure fans over future shows\", but did not rule out further postponements.\n\"We are working with artist management and promoters to limit the impact on the opening season schedule,\" its statement said.\n\"Where necessary, we will identify alternate dates, and will continually reassess to provide fans with sufficient notice regarding imminent shows.\n\"Should shows be cancelled or rescheduled, fans will be contacted by their point of purchase and offered a full refund where preferred.\"\nOak View Group chi",
    "A group of award-winning students have created their own interactive app to help children avoid being exploited.\nThe Gang Awareness app has been put together at Northampton School for Girls and has the full backing of Northamptonshire Police.\nIt is designed to equip youngsters with the ability to make the right decisions in difficult situations.\nAbout 46,000 children across the UK are thought to be involved in gangs.\nThe students won a County Schools Challenge with their idea and developed the storylines during PHSE (personal, social, health and economic) lessons.\nElla, one of the team of seven that put the storyline feature together, said: \"We had a lot of input on how it was going to be.\n\"When you play it, you start by making a character and you can change its clothes and things like that to make it more suitable to you.\"\nThe app then follows the character through a storyline about \"kids in secondary school making a decision\" - whether it is good or bad - and the consequences of it.\nDet Insp Andy Blaize, lead on child safeguarding at Northamptonshire Police, said: \"I've seen child exploitation increase over the years. The situation's probably never been as bad as it is now.\n\"I think it's really important that children get involved in creating this app, otherwise the message is often coming from adults and it can be a bit patronising, a bit preachy.\"\nHeadteacher Cristina Taboada-Naya said the app was important because her staff could not keep an eye on the children when they were not in school.\n\"Whilst they're here, they're safe and we know how to keep them safe, we can give them constant reminders and prompts,\" she said. \n\"In the electronic age, it is outside of that time that we are less able to protect them - so we have to arm them with the knowledge and tools and resources to keep themselves safe and the app allows them to do that.\"\nFollow Northamptonshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The two frontrunners to succeed outgoing First Minister Humza Yousaf have held informal talks.\nJohn Swinney and Kate Forbes met on Tuesday, according to a spokesperson for Ms Forbes.\nBoth have said they are considering a bid for the leadership, though neither has confirmed they are running.\nNominations for the role close on Monday. A contest will be held if more than one candidate gets sufficient support.\nNews of the meeting emerged on Wednesday as the Scottish government survived a motion of no confidence that could have forced all SNP ministers to resign. \n\"We can confirm Kate spoke to John yesterday,\" a spokesperson for Ms Forbes, the former finance secretary, said.\n\"It was a purely informal meeting. Kate is continuing to weigh up whether to run and is grateful for the growing outpouring of support.\"\nSpeaking earlier, Ms Forbes said she \"fundamentally disagreed\" with any suggestion she would not have enough parliamentary party support to become SNP leader, having narrowly lost out to Mr Yousaf in last year's contest to replace Nicola Sturgeon. \nMs Forbes said she was \"listening just now and not ruling anything out\".\nMr Swinney, the former deputy first minister, told reporters at Holyrood: \"I will not be rushed into making decisions that affect my loved ones.\"\nHe denied there was a stand off between potential leadership candidates. \n\"It's about people taking the time to make the right decisions for those they love,\" he said. \nMr Swinney has been backed by a number of senior party figures, including Westminster leader Stephen Flynn, deputy leader Keith Brown and cabinet ministers Neil Gray, Shirley-Anne Somerville and Mairi McAllan.\nMs Forbes has been publicly supported by ex-ministers Fergus Ewing and Ivan McKee, as well as backbench MP Joanna Cherry.\nAllies of Ms Forbes told BBC Scotland News she had made progress planning a potential leadership bid, including on policy positions and resources, in case she decided to stand.\nHer supporters said she was not expected to make an announcement on Wednesday as it had only been 48 hours since Mr Yousaf announced his resignation.\nMs Sturgeon, speaking to journalists at Holyrood, said: \"I'll make up my own mind, I'm not going to tell other members how to vote.\n\"What I would say is that I hope the contest is positive, I hope it is forward-looking, and I hope it focuses on the things the SNP needs to do to continue it's very strong election-winning streak.\"\nMs Forbes, who narrowly lost out to Mr Yousaf in the 2023 leadership contest, was criticised during the campaign for revealing she would have voted against gay marriage legislation had she been an MSP at the time due to her religious beliefs as a member of the Free Church of Scotland.\nAt the time, Mr Swinney, also a Christian, questioned whether it would be \"appropriate\" for someone with such views to become SNP leader.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme, Mr Ewing urged Mr Swinney to retract those comments.\nNominations for the SNP leadership opened on Monday and close one week later. If more than one candidate receives 100 nominations from at least 20 local party branches, a ballot will be held among members to choose a new leader.\nMr Yousaf has said he will resign as first minister once a new leader is chosen. At that point, parliament will have 28 days to nominate a new first minister to be appointed by the King.\nIf MSPs cannot reach an agreement after 28 days, a snap election would be called.\nSpeaking for the first time since announcing his resignation, Mr Yousaf said he had \"paid the price\" for the way he ended the SNP's power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens.\nHe told BBC News ending the Bute House Agreement was the \"right decision\".\n\"But I have to acknowledge the manner in which I did it caused great upset and that's on me,\" he said. \nA motion of no confidence in his government, which would have forced all SNP ministers to resign, was defeated by 70 votes 58 in the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday. \nThe result was in little doubt after the Greens, whose votes would be required to give the opposition a majority, called for it to be withdrawn following the first minister's resignation announcement.\nIf it had passed, the motion would have compelled the entire government to resign, with parliament given 28 days to nominate a new first minister. Failing that, a snap election would have been called.",
    "Hundreds of asylum seekers who were living in tents in central Dublin have been moved to two accommodation sites, the Irish government has said.\nThe asylum seekers had been living in a makeshift campsite outside the International Protection Office on Mount Street for several months.\nThe Irish government said 285 single male applicants were offered accommodation on Wednesday.\nThe Irish government said the encampment had been dismantled and all asylum seekers had now been moved to Citywest and Crooksling tented accommodation in County Dublin. A total of 186 applicants were taken to Citywest and a further 99 were accommodated at Crooksling.\nA joint agency operation to \"ensure the safe movement of people seeking international protection\" to designated accommodation took place early on Wednesday morning\nThe streets in the area were also cleaned by the city's council.\nThe operation on Wednesday morning was undertaken by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Department of Justice, Garda\u00ed (Irish police), Dublin City Council, the Office of Public Works and the HSE.\nThe government previously tried to move asylum seekers to the Crooksling site over the St Patrick's Day bank holiday weekend. \nA number returned to the Mount Street site a few hours later citing the facility was not appropriate, did not have adequate facilities and was too rural with no transport links.\nThe Irish government said on Wednesday that the Crooksling site had \"10 to 12 person robust, weather-proof tents\". \nIt also has showers, toilets, indoor areas where food is provided, facilities to charge phones and personal devices, access to and from the city centre as well as 24-hour onsite security.\nIt also added those in Crooksling would receive the same support as at other locations.\nFive buses and 19 taxis were used to move the asylum seekers.\nSpeaking in the D\u00e1il (Irish parliament) on Tuesday, Taoiseach (prime minister) Simon Harris said that once asylum seekers sleeping on the street were given accommodation, the encampment would not be allowed to return.\nContractors, some wearing protective clothing, cleared the tents from the street.\nThe Irish government said on Wednesday that Dublin City Council and the Office of Public Works will \"secure the area of Mount Street where the tents were placed, with street furniture and traffic management measures in place to prevent the placement of tents\".\nIt said it did not \"envisage an encampment building up on Mount Street again\" with street furniture and traffic management measures being put in place.\n\"This underlines how important it is that the Comprehensive Accommodation Strategy is rolled out successfully so that sufficient accommodation is provided, and sleeping outside the International Protection Office isn't necessary.\"\nIt said applicants \"will be transferred from these sites when appropriate accommodation is identified within the IPAS (International Protection Accommodation Services) accommodation portfolio\". \n\"Given the need to ensure that there is sufficient capacity for families, including those with children, it is not possible to give timelines.\"\nThe Irish government said the \"offer of accommodation in IPAS centres is voluntary and some applicants are understood to have not taken up a place at their assigned centre\". \n\"IPAS will continue to engage with these applicants and efforts will be made to ensure these applicants do not continue to reside at the Mount Street location.\"\nNoel Wardick, Dublin City Co-operative's chief executive, said he hoped the new accommodation would be better than the makeshift campsite on Mount Street.\n\"The conditions were what only you could describe as absolutely appalling, completely unacceptable humanitarian conditions,\" he said.\n\"No sanitisation, no water, no hygiene, an awful smell of urine.\n\"People crammed in together, living in the heart of the capital city in a situation which is utterly unjust and unfair and a shameful episode in contemporary Ireland.\"\nMr Wardick said politicians had \"no political will\" to address the issues around asylum seekers.\n\"Nothing can explain why they were left out in the street for many weeks or months,\" he added.\n\"At the end of the day, refugees who are not provided with accommodation have to live somewhere. \n\"If the state can provide accommodation, as it is legally obliged to do, then there won't be tents appearing on the street of Dublin or any other city. \n\"However, if the state doesn\u2019t provide accommodation then they will have to live somewhere and I absolutely believe tents will appear on the streets of Dublin again.\"\nAoife Moore, BBC News NI's Dublin reporter\nWednesday was a new day in Mount Street, both in weather and view.\nOn Tuesday, hundreds of tents lined the busy city centre street, blocking the pavement, with tarpaulins rattling against the wind and rain.\nHundreds of people, who have fled from places like Afghanistan and India, told the BBC they had no running water or toilets, and",

    "The former boss of Camelot has been confirmed as interim chairman of the Post Office after its last leader was sacked.\nNigel Railton has been appointed by Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch after Henry Staunton departed in January.\nHe takes on the role as hundreds of sub-postmasters are still waiting for compensation over the Horizon scandal.\nMr Railton spent 24 years at former National Lottery operator Camelot UK before stepping down last year.\nHe also worked for car manufacturer Daewoo and the former British Rail.\nMr Railton has agreed to a 12-month stint as Post Office chairman, the BBC understands.\nMs Badenoch said she wanted to thank Mr Railton for \"stepping up to public service at a time of need\".\n\"I know he can help fix the issues of the past whilst transforming the company for the future,\" she added.\nThe Department for Business and Trade appointing Mr Railton signals a new beginning in its relationship with the troubled Post Office, which is owned by the government.\nThe organisation is currently the subject of a long-running inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal, where hundreds of sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted after faulty software made it appear money was missing from their accounts.\nIn a statement following his appointment, Mr Railton said: \"This is an incredibly challenging time for the Post Office as it works to address historic failures while also striving to transform its business.\"\nMr Railton left the former National Lottery operator during a shake-up around the time Allwyn Entertainment acquired Camelot UK.\nCamelot had run the lottery since the game's launch in 1994, but it faced tough competition and its licence ended in February, with a new one for 10 years being given to Allwyn instead.\nThe new Post Office chairman also chairs Argentex Group, a London-listed provider of currency management services, and is a trustee of the Social Mobility Foundation, according to his profile on the social platform LinkedIn.\nFormer chairman Henry Staunton was sacked by Ms Badenoch in January after little more than a year in the role - leading to a bitter public row between the two.\nAfter his exit, Mr Staunton claimed in an interview with the Sunday Times that he had been advised by a civil servant to stall compensation payments to allow the government to \"limp into the election\" without the impact of a large pay-out.\nThe government strongly denied the allegation and Ms Badenoch claimed Mr Staunton was under a \"formal investigation\" for \"serious matters such as bullying\".\nMr Staunton refuted this. He then disclosed in February that it was actually current chief executive Nick Read who was under investigation after a Speak Up complaint was made against him.\nThe Post Office confirmed at the time there were complaints against Mr Read and other staff, however he has since been cleared of all misconduct allegations following an investigation carried out by an external barrister.\nThe row has been criticised by former sub-postmasters, including campaigner Alan Bates, who described it as a \"sideshow\" to the inquiry.",
    "The deaths of two boys in a car carrying eight teenagers which crashed in Surrey has prompted a coroner to ask the government to consider doing more to protect young people on the roads.\nSpeed and \"drunkenness\" contributed to the deaths of driver Charlie Hopkins, 18, and Billy Robinson, 17,  following the collision in Oxenden Road, Tongham, in the early hours of 26 September 2021, an inquest concluded.\nMr Hopkins, from Frimley, who had passed his driving test just two weeks earlier, died at the scene. Mr Robinson, from Farnborough, Hampshire, was a front-seat passenger who died in hospital 10 weeks later. Six other teenage boys in the Volkswagen Polo survived.\nSam Robinson - Billy's mother - said the crash was \u201cavoidable\u201d and whenever she sees a VW Polo, \u201cI just think, what were they thinking?\u201d\nMr Robinson had posted a video on social media from inside the vehicle before it crashed.\nHis mother said she could not bring herself to view the footage, but had been told about its contents by friends.\nShe told the BBC: \u201cThe music was loud, and they were chanting - it looked like a party car.\n\u201cI have no doubt that the driver felt that there was pressure on him and he was trying to concentrate.\u201d\nCoroner Anna Crawford said it was possible the \"inexperience\u201d of the driver and the presence of so many passengers may also have played a part. \nShe is writing to the Department for Transport (DfT)  to ask it to consider further steps to \"protect young drivers\" and \"reduce fatalities\".\nThe inquest in Woking, which concluded on Tuesday, heard the teenagers had left a birthday party when their vehicle was in collision with a taxi.\nThere were eight teenage boys in the small hatchback - two in the front, five in the back and one in the boot.\nThe VW Polo hit a curb as it approached a roundabout and veered onto the wrong side of the road, hitting the taxi coming in the opposite direction.\nMr Robinson was a talented footballer who had been training to become an electrician.\nHis mother described him as her \u201cblue-eyed boy\u201d and said emptiness \u201csurrounds\u201d the family every day.\n\u201cThere's Billy\u2019s empty room. The empty chair around the kitchen table. But you also grieve everything that he's missing out on in life.\u201d\nMrs Robinson is now part of the Forget-me-not Families Uniting campaign group of bereaved parents which is petitioning the government to introduce a graduated licensing system for new drivers.\nIt would involve a minimum number of learning hours, curfews and a ban on carrying passengers for a limited period of time.\nGraduated schemes have been adopted in countries including the United States, Australia and Ireland.\n*Watch on BBC IPlayer: Drive Fast Die Young\nAccording to government figures, one in five young drivers crash within a year of passing their test, and more than 1,500 young drivers are killed or seriously injured on roads each year.\nMrs Robinson said: \u201cI know for sure that if it was law in this country my Billy would be living this life like he should be.\u201d\nThe coroner concluded the car had been speeding and it\u2019s driver was over the legal alcohol limit, and that both factors had contributed to the collision.\nThe inquest also heard the airbag system on the car had been disabled during a previous ownership and had not deployed at the time of impact.\nHad the airbags worked the driver\u2019s injuries would have been \u201cless severe and he would have survived,\u201d the coroner said.

    "Thousands of streets across Glasgow are set to have the speed limit cut from 30mph to 20mph. \nAfter assessing 5,740 streets with a 20mph or 30mph speed limit, it was proposed that 3,868 streets should be reduced.\nThe proposed changes will support the National Strategy for 20mph, which will introduce the \"safer speed limit\" in built-up areas across Scotland.\nCouncillor Angus Millar, city convener for climate and transport, said the move would \"help to create safer streets and communities for all of us\". \nThe 1,400 streets currently assigned a 20mph speed limit and 472 streets assigned at 30mph will remain the same.\nThe introduction of a citywide 20mph speed limit was approved by Glasgow City Council in 2020, with the council\u2019s road safety plan committing to introduce the limit on the majority of roads by 2030.\nMost of Scotland's urban roads are due to drop to 20mph limits by 2025, in line with Wales, which became the first in the UK to introduce a 20mph limit in September 2023.\nThe implementation of new 20mph speed limits in Glasgow is expected to be phased in by zones, with each requiring the promotion of a speed limit order. \nMr Millar said moving to 20mph was \"technically complex\", but the council was working with national partners to identify the best ways to take it forward. \n\u201cA citywide 20mph speed limit will bring Glasgow in line with many other UK cities and help to create safer streets and communities for all of us, reducing the risk of accidents and the severity of injuries sustained,\" he said.\nHe added that moving to 20mph was \"technically complex\", but the council was working with national partners to identify the best ways to take it forward. \nAlongside capital funding, the scheme is being supported by a grant from Places for Everyone and administered by Sustrans.\nKaren McGregor, Scotland Director at Sustrans said: \u201cTime and time again, the evidence has shown that lowering speed limits in our built-up areas creates neighbourhoods that are safer for everyone and that this makes the biggest positive difference for our most vulnerable people such as children, older people and those living with disability.\"",
    "A couple in their 80s who have fostered more than 150 children say they have no plans to retire.\nMargaret Isdale and her husband Robert, from Grantham, Lincolnshire, took in their first child in 1978.\nThey have been given a lifetime achievement award to mark their decades of dedication to families.\nAsked how they continue to care for newborns, Mrs Isdale laughed: \"I don't know! We just enjoy doing it, and I can't imagine not doing it now.\"\nThe couple, who have been married for 58 years and have two children of their own, are currently caring for an eight-month-old baby. \nMr Isdale, 81, said of their award: \"It's really quite humbling. It's not about us, it's about the kids we look after - they're the important ones.\"\nPaying tribute to them, Michelle Sawmynaden, from Lincolnshire Fostering Service, said she was \"in awe of them both\".\nShe added: \"Their dedication to the fostering service over 46 years has been absolutely incredible. \n\"The difference they've made to the children's lives has been fantastic. Lots of those children have either gone back to their birth families or gone on to be adopted.\"\nExplaining their decision to foster, Mr Isdale said: \"You're there to give them an interim period of safety, to allow them to experience being part of a family.\"\nThe couple can still remember the first child they cared for - a 14-year-old girl.\nShe stayed with them for just a week before being returned to her birth parents, they recalled.\nOver the years, they have looked after children with a range of needs, including a boy who underwent a kidney transplant. Mr and Mrs Isdale spent weeks in hospital by his bedside.\nThey said one child came to them with just a single set of pyjamas.    \nThe husband and wife team agreed the most rewarding part of fostering was reuniting families.\nMr Isdale said: \"People say, how can you hand them over? Well, that's part of what we do, and sometimes when you hand [a child] over the adoptive parents or birth parents keep in touch and they say how appreciative they are. That in itself is a reward.\"\nRecently, the couple were asked to be the godparents of a girl they had cared for.\nIn 1987, the Isdales adopted a girl after three years caring for her as foster parents.\n\"She just grew on us,\" said Mrs Isdale, 80.\nKim was born with Down's syndrome and a complex heart condition.\nWhen she was born doctors said she would not live beyond nine months. She died in 2005, aged 21. The family travelled all over the world with her. \nMr Isdale said: \"She taught us a lot.

    "A karate champion who sexually assaulted teenagers has been jailed for two years.\nAndrew Sherry was convicted in March of indecently assaulting a boy under the age of 16 in the mid-1980s, and of four counts of sexual assault on an older teenager in 2011 or 2012.\nThe 80-year-old, from Liverpool, retired in March 2022 when a police investigation was launched.\nSentencing Judge David Swinnerton said he had been \"lauded\" while his victims \"suffered\".\nHe said although Sherry, of Mann Island, Liverpool,  who had no previous convictions, was a positive influence on many young people, it was clear his interest in young men went beyond an interest in their \"sporting prowess\".\nThe judge added: \"It is perhaps a tragedy for you, your karate club and those who will be impacted, but particularly for your victims, that you were unable to exercise the discipline and self control which I understand is central to karate when it came to your sexuality.\"\nSherry, a ninth dan black belt, founded the Red Triangle karate club in Everton, and was a founder member of the Karate Union of Great Britain. \nHis defence team claimed the allegations were the result of a conspiracy by other practitioners who wanted to \"overthrow their leader\".\nThe court heard Sherry had assaulted one boy in the mid-1980s and asked him to perform \"special favours\".\nThe boy said Sherry wrestled with him while at his bungalow in West Derby, Liverpool, before taking him to Knowsley Safari Park where he spoke about monkeys having sex.\nJurors heard the complainant had since struggled with alcohol and gone on to commit criminal offences.\nThe judge told Sherry: \"You had an impact on him psychologically which has had lasting echoes on him throughout his life.\"\nThe second complainant, who was 18 at the time of the assaults, said Sherry massaged him on the buttocks and kissed him on the lips on more than one occasion.\nAndrew Ford KC, prosecuting, told the court the victim said Sherry made him think \"he had a real shot at becoming something special\".\nHe added: \"His life became one of confusion, betrayal, distrust and worry about how he would be touched.\"\nTwo other men, whom Sherry was not charged with assaulting, claimed he propositioned them in the 1990s.\nThe judge said: \"This is an abuse of trust, undoubtedly.\n\"You were their mentor, their teacher, their idol and you abused that position and groomed them.\"\nTania Griffiths KC, defending, told the court it was not accepted that the life of the first victim was \"ruined by alcoholism caused by any abuse\".\nShe said an impact statement from the second complainant was \"exaggerated\".\nSherry is planning to appeal against the convictions.\nMs Griffiths said: \"He has lost everything by these convictions. \n\"He's lost his good name, lost his reputation and lost his world standing.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds\u00a0and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X and Instagram?

    "The town of Ipswich is abuzz with energy after Kieran McKenna's team took a big step closer to the Premier League on Tuesday, thanks to a 2-1 win at Coventry.\nIpswich Town have one game left of the season and the team need just one point to be automatically promoted, without having to go through the play-offs.\nFans from across the town and beyond are nervously waiting ahead of Saturday's home game at Portman Road against Huddersfield Town, who are all but condemned to relegation to League One. \nBut are match tickets still available? Where can you watch the game if you don't have a ticket? And are any events planned for Saturday or beyond?\nNon-season ticket holders were able to buy tickets for Saturday's game back in April, on a priority basis depending on how many games supporters had been to previously.\nThese sold out quickly and those hunting for a ticket will be unable to get hold of any through the Ipswich Town website.\nThe BBC has heard from many fans who are desperately trying to source tickets ahead of the game.\nBBC Radio Suffolk spoke to Simon Nolloth, whose son Ed Nolloth has planned to fly back from New Zealand where he lives just for the match - but he needs a ticket.\nMr Nolloth Snr said they had been watching Tuesday's game together via WhatsApp when his son decided to book a flight to come over.\n\"He's a big Town fan,\" Mr Nolloth Snr added.\n\"We're hoping someone will take pity on us hopefully, we'll give it a good go.\"\nBBC Radio Suffolk's build up to the match starts at 11:00 BST and will be followed by full commentary.\nKick-off is at 12:30.\nSky Sports will be broadcasting live from Portman Road, with their coverage starting at 11:30.\nA number of pubs across the town will be broadcasting the game live, including The Thomas Wolsey on St Peter's Street, The Brewers Arms on Orford Street and The Curve Bar on Princes Street. \nIsaacs on the Quay has shared on social media that it will be showing the game \"across all areas of the venue with full sound\".\nHowever, a family zone will be set up for those who want to enjoy the game \"in a slightly calmer environment\", the pub has said. \nFan group Blue Action is encouraging supporters to gather ahead of the game to welcome the players' coach to Portman Road.\nPosting on Facebook, the group asked people to 'roar them on to the Premier League'.\nThe message says to meet at Sir Alf Ramsey Way at 11:00.\nBlue Action provided a raucous welcome to the players ahead of the final home game of last season's campaign, and also before the derby with Norwich in December.\nIpswich need just one point against Huddersfield in order to secure automatic promotion to the Premier League for next season. \nThey currently sit in second place, three points clear of Leeds, but with a worse goal difference. \nIf Ipswich achieve their goal it will be back-to-back promotions for McKenna's side.\nIf they lose on Saturday and Leeds win against Southampton, Town will finish the season in third place and head into the play-offs.\nHuddersfield, meanwhile, travel to Portman Road second from the bottom of the league, on 45 points.\nThey are two points behind Birmingham and three points off Plymouth, who will start the weekend above the relegation zone.\nHowever, Huddersfield's inferior goal difference (11 worse than Birmingham and 15 behind Plymouth) means the Terriers would have to beat Ipswich by several goals, and hope the two teams above them lose, to earn themselves a miraculous reprieve from relegation.\nIpswich Central has called on businesses in the town centre to \"turn Ipswich blue and white\".\nChair of the group and Town supporter, Terry Baxter, said the gesture would \"show the team we're behind them\".\n\"Let\u2019s show the team we are behind them by dressing shop windows and shop fronts blue and white, waving flags in support, put up bunting and balloons and of course urging staff to wear the club colours on Saturday,\" he said. \nMr Baxter added the potential promotion could \"be a massive boost\" for the town and its town centre businesses. \n\"Ipswich Central is fully backing the Blues and their bid for promotion to the Premier League as the icing on the cake for a fantastic season - Come on You Blues,\" he added.\nAt the moment, no news on promotion celebrations have been shared.\nLast year's promotion to the Championship saw a large celebration event in Christchurch Park.\nIt is more bad news if you are looking to get season tickets for the 2024-25 campaign.\nLast Friday the club announced that the full allocation of season tickets had been snapped up by existing holders, with 20,000 renewals.\nChief executive Mark Ashton said the support had been \"incredible\".\n\"Season ticket holders are incredibly important and for such a high number to have renewed for the new campaign is another example highlighting the loyal support the club is fortunate to have,\" he said.\nThe club has previously said it wants to keep some tickets available for supporters who cannot commit to every match.\nIt also has plans to develop",

    "The deaths of two boys in a car carrying eight teenagers which crashed in Surrey has prompted a coroner to ask the government to consider doing more to protect young people on the roads.\nSpeed and \"drunkenness\" contributed to the deaths of driver Charlie Hopkins, 18, and Billy Robinson, 17,  following the collision in Oxenden Road, Tongham, in the early hours of 26 September 2021, an inquest concluded.\nMr Hopkins, from Frimley, who had passed his driving test just two weeks earlier, died at the scene. Mr Robinson, from Farnborough, Hampshire, was a front-seat passenger who died in hospital 10 weeks later. Six other teenage boys in the Volkswagen Polo survived.\nSam Robinson - Billy's mother - said the crash was \u201cavoidable\u201d and whenever she sees a VW Polo, \u201cI just think, what were they thinking?\u201d\nMr Robinson had posted a video on social media from inside the vehicle before it crashed.\nHis mother said she could not bring herself to view the footage, but had been told about its contents by friends.\nShe told the BBC: \u201cThe music was loud, and they were chanting - it looked like a party car.\n\u201cI have no doubt that the driver felt that there was pressure on him and he was trying to concentrate.\u201d\nCoroner Anna Crawford said it was possible the \"inexperience\u201d of the driver and the presence of so many passengers may also have played a part. \nShe is writing to the Department for Transport (DfT)  to ask it to consider further steps to \"protect young drivers\" and \"reduce fatalities\".\nThe inquest in Woking, which concluded on Tuesday, heard the teenagers had left a birthday party when their vehicle was in collision with a taxi.\nThere were eight teenage boys in the small hatchback - two in the front, five in the back and one in the boot.\nThe VW Polo hit a curb as it approached a roundabout and veered onto the wrong side of the road, hitting the taxi coming in the opposite direction.\nMr Robinson was a talented footballer who had been training to become an electrician.\nHis mother described him as her \u201cblue-eyed boy\u201d and said emptiness \u201csurrounds\u201d the family every day.\n\u201cThere's Billy\u2019s empty room. The empty chair around the kitchen table. But you also grieve everything that he's missing out on in life.\u201d\nMrs Robinson is now part of the Forget-me-not Families Uniting campaign group of bereaved parents which is petitioning the government to introduce a graduated licensing system for new drivers.\nIt would involve a minimum number of learning hours, curfews and a ban on carrying passengers for a limited period of time.\nGraduated schemes have been adopted in countries including the United States, Australia and Ireland.\n*Watch on BBC IPlayer: Drive Fast Die Young\nAccording to government figures, one in five young drivers crash within a year of passing their test, and more than 1,500 young drivers are killed or seriously injured on roads each year.\nMrs Robinson said: \u201cI know for sure that if it was law in this country my Billy would be living this life like he should be.\u201d\nThe coroner concluded the car had been speeding and it\u2019s driver was over the legal alcohol limit, and that both factors had contributed to the collision.\nThe inquest also heard the airbag system on the car had been disabled during a previous ownership and had not deployed at the time of impact.\nHad the airbags worked the driver\u2019s injuries would have been \u201cless severe and he would have survived,\u201d the coroner said. However, Mr Robinson would still have died.\nThe coroner intends to send three prevention of future deaths reports, to the DfT, the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency, and vehicle servicing trade associations.\nThe DfT earlier this year said the UK has \u201csome of the safest roads in the world\u201d and it had no plans for further restrictions on younger drivers.\nIn a statement, Surrey Police said: \"This was a tragic incident resulting in the loss of the lives of two teenagers, and our thoughts are with the family and friends of Charlie and Billy on what will have been a very difficult day for them all.\n\"The collision will have also had a long-lasting effect on the other passengers who were in the car.\"\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, and on X.

    "Thousands of streets across Glasgow are set to have the speed limit cut from 30mph to 20mph. \nAfter assessing 5,740 streets with a 20mph or 30mph speed limit, it was proposed that 3,868 streets should be reduced.\nThe proposed changes will support the National Strategy for 20mph, which will introduce the \"safer speed limit\" in built-up areas across Scotland.\nCouncillor Angus Millar, city convener for climate and transport, said the move would \"help to create safer streets and communities for all of us\". \nThe 1,400 streets currently assigned a 20mph speed limit and 472 streets assigned at 30mph will remain the same.\nThe introduction of a citywide 20mph speed limit was approved by Glasgow City Council in 2020, with the council\u2019s road safety plan committing to introduce the limit on the majority of roads by 2030.\nMost of Scotland's urban roads are due to drop to 20mph limits by 2025, in line with Wales, which became the first in the UK to introduce a 20mph limit in September 2023.\nThe implementation of new 20mph speed limits in Glasgow is expected to be phased in by zones, with each requiring the promotion of a speed limit order. \nMr Millar said moving to 20mph was \"technically complex\", but the council was working with national partners to identify the best ways to take it forward. \n\u201cA citywide 20mph speed limit will bring Glasgow in line with many other UK cities and help to create safer streets and communities for all of us, reducing the risk of accidents and the severity of injuries sustained,\" he said.\nHe added that moving to 20mph was \"technically complex\", but the council was working with national partners to identify the best ways to take it forward. \nAlongside capital funding, the scheme is being supported by a grant from Places for Everyone and administered by Sustrans.\nKaren McGregor, Scotland Director at Sustrans said: \u201cTime and time again, the evidence has shown that lowering speed limits in our built-up areas creates neighbourhoods that are safer for everyone and that this makes the biggest positive difference for our most vulnerable people such as children, older people and those living with disability.\"",
    "A golden eagle that mysteriously vanished in the Borders during the autumn is now believed to have been shot.\nPolice investigating the disappearance of the missing bird, named Merrick, are confident she died due to \"human interference\".\nThe bird was satellite-tagged, having come to the area in 2022 through the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project.\nThe investigation found blood and feathers at the spot where she was last tracked on 12 October, west of Fountainhall between Heriot and Stow.\nPolice Scotland have worked with land managers, raptor workers and the public as part of an investigation.\nOfficers are confident from \"the nature and pattern of feathers and blood, and all other evidence, indicated that Merrick was shot and killed\".\nDr Cat Barlow said: \u201cPolice Scotland believe she was shot then fell to the ground, where she bled considerably through a single wound. \n\"Police Scotland believe that someone then removed her body and destroyed her satellite tag.\u201d\nUntil her disappearance, Merrick\u2019s state-of-the-art satellite tag had been transmitting normally. \nDuring the eight days before her disappearance, she was exploring the Moorfoot Hills. Then her tag suddenly stopped transmitting, indicating \u201cno malfunction\u201d, and strongly suggesting human interference.\nEagle Officer, John Wright, inspected the bird's last known roosting spot and noticed a small golden oval-shaped head feather, two small wing covert feathers and some white under-down on the moss directly below the tree. \nHe said: \"I saw a film of blood stretched across the grass stems. It subsequently turned out that a considerable amount of blood was present in and below the moss layer. \n\"I could see small downy feathers scattered in the dense spruce foliage below the roosting branches.\n\u201cMerrick had been roosting (sleeping perched) in a tree when her tag stopped transmitting.

    "Abortion was made legal across the US after a landmark legal ruling in 1973, often referred to as the Roe v Wade case.\nNow the US Supreme Court - the nation's most senior legal body - has overturned that right.\nTwenty-six conservative states are either certain or considered likely to introduce new abortion restrictions or bans.\nIn 1969, a 25-year-old single woman, Norma McCorvey using the pseudonym \"Jane Roe\", challenged the criminal abortion laws in Texas. The state forbade abortion as unconstitutional, except in cases where the mother's life was in danger.\nDefending the anti-abortion law was Henry Wade - the district attorney for Dallas County - hence Roe v Wade.\nMs McCorvey was pregnant with her third child when she filed the case, and claimed that she had been raped. But the case was rejected and she was forced to give birth.\nIn 1973 her appeal made it to the US Supreme Court, where her case was heard alongside that of a 20-year-old Georgia woman, Sandra Bensing. \nThey argued that abortion laws in Texas and Georgia went against the US Constitution because they infringed a woman's right to privacy. \nBy a vote of seven to two, the court justices ruled that governments lacked the power to prohibit abortions.\nThey judged that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy was protected by the US constitution.\nThe case created the \"trimester\" system allowing:\nRoe v Wade also established that in the final trimester, a woman can obtain an abortion despite any legal ban only if doctors certify it is necessary to save her life or health.\nThe Supreme Court has ruled in favour of Mississippi's ban on abortions after 15 weeks.\nIn doing so, it has effectively ended the constitutional right to an abortion for millions of US women.\nIndividual states are now able to ban the procedure again.\nHalf of the states in the US are expected to introduce new restrictions or bans.\nThirteen have already passed so-called trigger laws that will automatically outlaw abortion following the Supreme Court's ruling. A number of others are likely to pass new restrictions quickly.\nThere are nine judges on the Supreme Court, six of whom were appointed by Republican presidents.\nA draft opinion from one of these - Judge Samuel Alito - was leaked in May 2022. It contained the comment that the Roe v Wade judgement is \"egregiously wrong\".\nEven before the US Supreme Court's latest ruling, anti-abortion campaigners had been regaining some ground. \nIn 1980, the court upheld a law that banned the use of federal funds for abortion except when necessary to save a woman's life.\nThen in 1989, it allowed states to prohibit abortions being carried out in state clinics, or by state employees.\nThe biggest impact came from the top court's ruling in Planned Parenthood v Casey in 1992. \nIt said states could restrict abortions even in the first trimester for non-medical reasons.\nAs a result, many states already have restrictions in place, such as requirements that young pregnant women involve their parents or a judge in their abortion decision. \nOther states already have waiting periods between the time a woman first visits an abortion clinic and the actual procedure.\nAs a result, many women are having to travel further to get abortions, often across state borders, and they are having to pay more for them.

    "Businesses in a town could face fines for putting bins out at the wrong time of day.\nA blitz on \"unsightly\" bins in Northampton is being proposed by West Northamptonshire Council, because the town centre is undergoing extensive regeneration.\nThe Conservative-controlled authority said bins could \"detract from the enhancements we are striving to deliver\".\nFirms that break the rules could be fined up to \u00a31,000, the council said.\nRegeneration work is already under way on the Market Square and Abington Street and Fish Street, with further schemes due to start in the coming months.\nThe proposed policy would mean businesses would have to leave their bins out either between 06:00 and 09:00 or between 16:00 and 18:00.\nAt other times, the bins would have to be \"stored appropriately\" and \"within the business or residential premises\".\nUnder the policy, businesses face \"enforcement action\" which may include being handed a Section 47 notice regarding bins placement.\nIf a firm ignores a notice, a \u00a3100 fixed penalty fine could be imposed - or the case sent to a magistrates' court, where a maximum fine of \u00a31 ,000 could be handed down.\nDan Lister, the council's cabinet member for town centre regeneration, said: \u201cTo breathe new life into our town centres, it's essential for businesses, the community, and local authorities to collaborate.\n\u201cRevamping areas into flourishing spaces by tackling issues like indiscriminate bin placement is a key aspect of this.\"\nThe council said that, during a consultation exercise, 78% of respondents agreed the times when businesses put their bins out should be restricted, and 80% agreed that firms should be held accountable if they left bins out at any other times.\nThe council added that it was disappointed only 7% of respondents were businesses.\nThe policy will be discussed at the authority's next cabinet meeting next Tuesday.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The BBC has been told Birmingham Airport needs at least 100 more security agents as delays for passengers enter a third day. \nTravellers hoping to get away ahead of the long weekend have been stuck in queues and missed flights. \nMultiple holidaymakers said they had spent hours waiting for a lift to the airport's security area. \nThe airport said it had an active year-round recruitment campaign for security officers and recent problems were down to a technical issue. \nA source told the BBC that the number of vacant positions meant security staff felt overstretched, making it harder to recruit and retain staff.\nIt comes as the airport has been undergoing improvements for more than a year, with multi million-pound upgrades to its security hall nearing completion. \nBut it has meant delays for passengers at busy periods, and issues began again ahead of the May bank holiday. \nThe airport said it could not confirm how many people had been unable to board flights in the past 72 hours, directing questions to individual airlines. \nLisa Ruston, who was flying from Birmingham Airport to Cape Verde on Wednesday, said staff were helpful but it took her almost two hours to even get to security. \n\"Only three of the lifts are working and one is used for fast track,\" she said. \n\"They definitely need more staff around to help people, it's all very confusing.\"\nRoger Burton, who missed his flight from Birmingham to Alicante on Monday, previously said he spent about \u00a3165 on a new flight and would also have to cover taxi costs to the airport again.\n\u201cIt was absolutely disgusting the way we were treated,\u201d Mr Burton said. \nHe added passengers were \"herded like cattle\u201d through the airport and described a  \u201ccrush of people\u201d waiting for elevators. \nBirmingham Airport said on Monday that a technical problem had compounded its peak departure period. \nIn a statement, a spokesperson said: \"We realise that the building works are extensive and have impacted the terminal, and at times our customer service level, and for this we apologise.\" \nBosses directed people to the airport's website for the latest information and advice on speeding up search times. \nWhen asked about staffing, a spokesperson added: \"Birmingham Airport has an active year-round recruitment campaign for its security officers.  \n\"Both classroom and on the job training takes months to complete, hence our continual recruitment.\u201d \nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X, and Instagram, Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk",
    "Abortion was made legal across the US after a landmark legal ruling in 1973, often referred to as the Roe v Wade case.\nNow the US Supreme Court - the nation's most senior legal body - has overturned that right.\nTwenty-six conservative states are either certain or considered likely to introduce new abortion restrictions or bans.\nIn 1969, a 25-year-old single woman, Norma McCorvey using the pseudonym \"Jane Roe\", challenged the criminal abortion laws in Texas. The state forbade abortion as unconstitutional, except in cases where the mother's life was in danger.\nDefending the anti-abortion law was Henry Wade - the district attorney for Dallas County - hence Roe v Wade.\nMs McCorvey was pregnant with her third child when she filed the case, and claimed that she had been raped. But the case was rejected and she was forced to give birth.\nIn 1973 her appeal made it to the US Supreme Court, where her case was heard alongside that of a 20-year-old Georgia woman, Sandra Bensing. \nThey argued that abortion laws in Texas and Georgia went against the US Constitution because they infringed a woman's right to privacy. \nBy a vote of seven to two, the court justices ruled that governments lacked the power to prohibit abortions.\nThey judged that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy was protected by the US constitution.\nThe case created the \"trimester\" system allowing:\nRoe v Wade also established that in the final trimester, a woman can obtain an abortion despite any legal ban only if doctors certify it is necessary to save her life or health.\nThe Supreme Court has ruled in favour of Mississippi's ban on abortions after 15 weeks.\nIn doing so, it has effectively ended the constitutional right to an abortion for millions of US women.\nIndividual states are now able to ban the procedure again.\nHalf of the states in the US are expected to introduce new restrictions or bans.\nThirteen have already passed so-called trigger laws that will automatically outlaw abortion following the Supreme Court's ruling. A number of others are likely to pass new restrictions quickly.\nThere are nine judges on the Supreme Court, six of whom were appointed by Republican presidents.\nA draft opinion from one of these - Judge Samuel Alito - was leaked in May 2022. It contained the comment that the Roe v Wade judgement is \"egregiously wrong\".\nEven before the US Supreme Court's latest ruling, anti-abortion campaigners had been regaining some ground. \nIn 1980, the court upheld a law that banned the use of federal funds for abortion except when necessary to save a woman's life.\nThen in 1989, it allowed states to prohibit abortions being carried out in state clinics, or by state employees.\nThe biggest impact came from the top court's ruling in Planned Parenthood v Casey in 1992. \nIt said states could restrict abortions even in the first trimester for non-medical reasons.\nAs a result, many states already have restrictions in place, such as requirements that young pregnant women involve their parents or a judge in their abortion decision. \nOther states already have waiting periods between the time a woman first visits an abortion clinic and the actual procedure.\nAs a result, many women are having to travel further to get abortions, often across state borders, and they are having to pay more for them.

    "A decision on approving a new Aldi supermarket has been postponed after one councillor described the design as \"ugly\".\nThe German chain wants to demolish a former car showroom in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, and build a two-storey shop.\nBuckinghamshire Council's planning committee voted to defer the application after a discussion that lasted nearly two hours.\nElements of the plans which may now be revised include site deliveries, the external appearance of the building, and a right-hand turning lane into the site.\nThe Local Democracy Reporting Service said some objectors questioned the need for another supermarket, given there is a Tesco superstore in Old Amersham and a Little Waitrose and M&S Simply Food in the town centre.\nHowever, John Catton, vice-chairman of the Amersham Society, a conservation and heritage group with 350 members, argued the town needed a new budget supermarket.\nHe said the one proviso the society had was that Aldi\u2019s proposed \"blocky\" building for London Road West should be more sympathetic to the area.\nTesco has said the project would harm nearby Grade II listed buildings.\nMike Stannard, a Conservative councillor, said he supported Aldi\u2019s plans as \"good for Amersham\", but said the design of the building was \"absolutely ugly\".\nMore than 1,500 letters of support for the store had been received by the Conservative-controlled council, with only a couple dozen objections.\nBlueprints have shown there would be 101 parking spaces at the site.\nAnother Conservative councillor, Isobel Darby, added she was \"really concerned\" about the number and size of the parking spaces planned.\nShe said the large cars of Amersham and local preferences for driving rather than walking meant that the planned parking provision would not be adequate.\nHighways officer Lucy Malloy told the meeting that the Buckinghamshire county-wide parking guidance means Aldi\u2019s planned spaces were 30cm (11in) too narrow, only measuring 2.5m by 5m (8ft by 16ft).\nHowever she explained that this was considered acceptable due to parking requirements being updated around the time the planning application was made.\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Russia is causing disruption to satellite navigation systems affecting thousands of civilian flights, experts say.\nThe Baltic Sea, the Black Sea and the eastern Mediterranean - the regions where Russia's military has been most active - have seen an increase in disruption to the Global Positioning System (GPS). \nThis has left aircraft unable to receive GPS signals.\nIn March, a RAF plane carrying Defence Secretary Grant Shapps had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory.\nThe persistent disruption led Finland's flag carrier Finnair to suspend daily flights to Estonia's second largest city, Tartu, for a month, after two of its aircraft had to return to Helsinki due to GPS interference.\nTartu Airport relies solely on GPS, unlike most larger airports which have alternative navigation systems that allow aircraft to land even if the signal is lost.\nJuho Sinkkonen, Finnair's vice-president for flight operations, told the BBC their aircraft encounter this issue daily.\n\u201cPilots are reporting cases actively, and we get more than 100 reports per month,\u201d he said.\nHowever, Mr Sinkkonen said GPS interference is mainly a nuisance and carries few risks. \nThis is because while an aircraft is in flight - i.e. before approaching and landing at an airport \u2013 it can normally use other navigation systems, so losing connection to GPS does not pose an immediate threat to its safety.\nAccording to Cyrille Rosay, a senior cybersecurity expert at the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), while the problem existed before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 it is worsening.\nThe EASA now clocks \"several thousand incidents\" per year, Mr Rosay said.\nWhen asked where the blame lies, officials from the Baltic states don\u2019t hesitate.\n\"The source of interference is Russia,\u201d Estonia's Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told the BBC. \n\u201cWe have proof that it is coming from Russia, and Russia is violating all the international agreements.\"\nMr Tsahkna said the sources of interference were located near the Russian cities of St Petersburg, Kaliningrad and Pskov.\nOnline investigators agree, saying GPS jammers are likely located halfway between St Petersburg and Estonia and near the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea \u2013 where the RAF plane carrying Defence Secretary Grant Shapps was when its signal was jammed.\nMr Tsahkna said that by jamming GPS signals, Russia was \u201cviolating our territories\u201d and putting people and civilian airplanes in danger. \n\u201cThis is a violation of international agreements\u2026 And also I'm really sure that they know exactly what they're doing,\" he added.\nThe BBC has contacted Russia's Ministry of Defence for comment.\nThere have also been reports of maritime traffic in the Baltic Sea being affected by GPS interference.\nJamming is the most widespread form of such meddling, but there have also been numerous instances of \"spoofing\", when legitimate signals are replaced with fake ones, indicating a false location.\nKeir Giles, director of the Conflict Studies Research Centre, a British think tank, believes Russia is meddling with GPS for both offensive and defensive reasons.\nHe says that while on the one hand Russia is testing \"its capabilities for immobilizing Europe completely in time of crisis\", it is also trying to protect itself from possible missile and drone attacks.\n\"Ukraine has already found ways around Russia's GPS jamming, using other navigational systems to carry out drone strikes deep into Russia. But of course that doesn't mean that Russia doesn't benefit from making sure that GPS simply does not work,\" Mr Giles told the BBC.\nThe impact of GPS interference on Russia's own navigation is much less severe as it has its own sat-nav system, called GLONASS.\nAircraft may have backup systems to work around GPS jamming, but Dana Goward, president of the US-based Resilient Navigation and Timing Foundation, which protects and improves GPS communication, says that meddling with signals still poses serious risks because \"all of our systems and society has been structured around precise GPS signals\".\n\u201cWhen we take the GPS out, clearly to some degree the efficiency and the safety of the aviation system is going to go down,\u201d he added. \n\u201cPeople have to revert to old procedures that they're not quite so familiar with. There is going to be some harm, and we just hope it all stops before something bad happens.\u201d",
    "A failure of adhesive bonding was the cause of an aircraft crash, an investigation has found. \nThe Air Accidents Investigation Branch published its report on the VA-1X, G-EVTL crash at Cotswold Airport on 9 August 2023. \nThe aircraft was being flown by a remote pilot on an experimental test flight at 30ft (9m) above ground level when a propeller blade detached.\nThere were no crew or passengers on board and nobody was injured in the crash.\nRoutine checks had been made prior to take-off and the aircraft set up according to the test card.\nIt took off at 07:14 BST which was described as \"a normal vertical take-off\". \nAfter the aircraft became stable, the remote pilot shut down an electric propulsion unit (EPU 1) in accordance with the test card.\nThe pilot then began a gentle climb to 9m (30ft).\nThere were eight EPUs on board, and all of them drove propellers.\nThe test card required the aircraft to be stable at this height for 10 seconds before the flight could proceed.\nAfter this was completed, the test pilot began a \"gentle acceleration\" towards seven knots ground speed (kt GS).\nAs the speed of the aircraft passed 2-4 kt GS, a loud \"pop\" was heard as a propeller blade was released from EPU3.\nAs a result, the aircraft was unable to stay in the air and struck the ground at 07:15 BST, three seconds after the noise was heard, on the southern edge of Runway 26.\nThe impact saw the right wing fail outboard of pylon three, in addition to the nose gear collapsing and other structural damage.\nTwo propellers detached from EPU3, with a blade sheath coming to rest 9m (30ft) from the aircraft.\nThe released propeller blade had been operating as normal but the \"progressive degradation of the bond occurred during operation prior to the blade release\".\nThe conditions on the day of the flight were \"ideal\", the report said, with light winds from the south west.\nAt the time of the flight, the aircraft's manufacturer was in the process of introducing a blade design that eliminated the bonding failure mode that caused the blade release.\nFollowing its own investigation, it identified 36 improvements that could be made to products and processes.\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A man charged with murdering schoolboy Daniel Anjorin with a Samurai sword in London has appeared in court. \nMarcus Arduini Monzo, 36, was remanded into custody over the attack in Hainault on Tuesday morning.\nWestminster Magistrates' Court heard Daniel, 14, suffered fatal stab wounds and four other people were injured.\nIt is alleged he also hit a pedestrian with a van, attacked him, and broke into a family's home - where a couple were asleep with their young child.\nThe prosecutor alleged a series of \"horrific offences\" had been carried out. \nEarlier, Daniel's family said he was a wonderful child who was \"well loved\" and \"hard working\". \n\"No family should have to go through what we are experiencing,\" they said. \"Any family will understand it's an absolute tragedy.\"\nMr Monzo, from Newham, east London, has also been charged with two counts of attempted murder, two counts of causing grievous bodily harm, aggravated burglary, and possession of a bladed article.\nThe dual Spanish-Brazilian national stood in the dock in a grey tracksuit holding his left arm across his chest.\nHe spoke slowly to give his name and is due to appear at the Old Bailey on 7 May if a hearing is not available on Friday, the chief magistrate, Paul Goldspring, said.\nAll of the alleged offences are said to have happened in Laing Close, apart from the offence of GBH which is alleged to have taken place in Franklyn Gardens nearby.\nThe court heard Mr Monzo crashed a van into a fence at about 07:00 BST on Tuesday, hitting a member of the public.\nHe then got out of the van, said he would kill the man and slashed his neck with a Samurai sword, the court was told.\nProsecutor David Burns told the court Mr Monzo broke into a nearby home where a couple were asleep with their four-year-old daughter.\nHe allegedly went into the bedroom and attacked the child's father, shouting about believing in God and causing injuries to his neck and arm, the court heard.\nMr Monzo is accused of then running up behind Daniel, who was walking to school, and attacking him.\nThe court heard police officers arrived and tried to help the teenager, before Mr Monzo appeared from a bush. The officers then chased him.\nThe court was told that he jumped out at a female officer and attacked her with the sword while she was on the ground, leaving her with arm wounds described by police as \"horrifically serious\".\nHe is also accused of injuring a male officer, who has a serious hand injury.\nSpeaking to the Press Association (PA), Aiste Dabasinskaite, Daniel's neighbour, said: \"We were shouting and waving towards Daniel as he came out. He had his headphones in so he wouldn't hear us. It just happened right before our eyes, it was horrible.\"\nAnother neighbour said she could no longer sleep at night \"because all I can see is him standing there with the sword\".\nDaniel's school, Bancroft's, in Woodford Green, said he was a \"true scholar\" who had a \"positive nature and gentle character\".\nIn a statement, it described him as a \"core member\" of the community, adding: \"Losing such a young pupil is something we will always struggle to come to terms with.\"\nA fundraising page, set up by a friend of Daniel's brother on Wednesday, has already raised \u00a335,000.\nMeanwhile, the sister of a man wounded in the sword attack has described her brother as a \"hero\" for protecting his family.\nHenry De Los Rios Polania, 35, an IT engineer from Hainault, is in hospital after being stabbed in his home.\nHis sister, Jessica De Los Rios, 31, said her brother had been left \"traumatised\" by the event, adding: \"To us, he's our hero.

    "Israeli officials are increasingly concerned that the International Criminal Court (ICC) is planning to seek arrest warrants for their military and political leaders on suspicion of war crimes. \nReports suggest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be among them.\nThe ICC, based in The Hague, has been investigating Israel's actions in the occupied territories for the past three years - and more recently the actions of Hamas as well. It has the power to charge and try individuals for the most serious crimes under international law.\nIt has previously issued arrest warrants for leaders including Russia's Vladimir Putin, Muammar Gaddafi of Libya, and Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony.\nMr Netanyahu has called the prospect of senior Israel figures joining the wanted list \"an outrage of historic proportions\", accusing the ICC of attempting to paralyse Israel's ability to defend itself.\nBut the fact that he's chosen to make such strident public comments suggests that, behind the scenes, such a scenario is being actively discussed. \nWhile the ICC has not confirmed the Israeli claims, when Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan KC visited Israel and the occupied West Bank last December his message was a clear one. \nThe British barrister toured the sites of Hamas' attacks in Israeli villages close to the Gaza fence, which Hamas-led gunmen burst through on 7 October.\nHe also met political leaders, and travelled to Ramallah to speak to the families of Palestinian victims about their experiences in Gaza and the West Bank. He condemned the violence suffered by civilians on both sides, and promised to investigate. \n\"All actors must comply with international humanitarian law,\" he clarified in a statement at the time. \"If you do not do so, do not complain when my office is required to act.\"\nMr Khan said the 7 October attacks - in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies - represented \"some of the most serious international crimes that shock the conscience of humanity, crimes which the ICC was established to address\".\nIn Israel's case, his concerns were twofold. He stressed the obligation to conduct its military operation in Gaza according to \"clear legal parameters that govern armed conflict\". \nIsrael has been accused of failing to sufficiently protect civilians during its months-long bombardment, although it insists it takes all necessary measures to avoid casualties. The Hamas-run health ministry in the territory says more than 34,500 people have been killed there since the war began, and that many of that number are children.\nMr Khan also underlined the need for humanitarian aid to get into Gaza, with access to food, water and medical supplies a basic right for civilians \"without further delay, and at pace and at scale\". He also urged Hamas not to divert or misuse the supplies when they did arrive, after accusations by Israel that its members were looting trucks and stealing aid, stopping it from reaching the wider population.\nIsrael isn't a member of the ICC and it says the court has no jurisdiction over it. But the court has ruled that since 2015 it does in fact have jurisdiction over the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza after the Palestinians ratified its founding treaty, the Rome Statute, as the State of Palestine. \nNo Western-style democracy has had an ICC arrest warrant issued for its leader before. If it happens to Mr Netanyahu, he'll be the first. Israelis have particular concerns about the stigma and potential isolation that would come with it.\nMichael Oren was Israel's ambassador to the United States between 2009 and 2013. He points to the recent case brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which accused Israel of genocide against the Palestinian population in Gaza - an accusation Israel vehemently rejects.\nIn January, the court issued an interim ruling that ordered Israel to take steps to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza, but stopped short of telling it to stop its military offensive.\n\"Israel emerged from those proceedings relatively unscathed, but the fact that the proceedings were held at all meant that Israel had lost the battle,\" he told the BBC.\n\"They should not have been held at all, and certainly it's a blow to our international standing and our security. Because a country whose leaders are accused of presiding over war crimes, that country is more vulnerable than a country that isn't.\"\nSir Geoffrey Nice KC, another British barrister, led the prosecution of the former Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic for war crimes at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).\nHe points out that the actions of both sides in this conflict are within the ICC's focus. \n\"Any investigation will not just be the Israeli Defense Forces and political and military leadership but also Hamas,\" he told the BBC. \n\"It's to be hoped that alleged Hamas fighters and leaders are not all shot on sight, that they are d",
    "Andrew Maximov has been working in the computer games industry for 12 years, but despite all that experience he still marvels at the amount of money spent on building the biggest titles.\n\"I used to work for PlayStation and the last game that I worked on, just production alone cost us $220 [\u00a3176m], and then you double that for marketing, and you are in half a billion dollars for every game that you put out there, which is a bit unsustainable for most companies.\"\nHe believes that artificial intelligence (AI) will play a crucial role in keeping the soaring costs of game production down, and save video game designers vital time by automating repetitive tasks. \nHis company, Promethean AI offers developers a set of tools to craft their own virtual worlds. Mr Maximov hopes to disrupt the way games are currently produced.\n\"What we're trying to do is replace that with a system that can learn directly from artists, so that artists can be the authors of their own automation.\"\nHumans will still play a key role in the production process. AI will work hand in hand with the human and enable them to be more creative.\n\"We can create a vision for a game and then the artist can click a button and ask an AI to give them feedback. Then they will get examples from their library of concept art and digital ideas that are relevant to their project,\" Mr Maximov says.\nSometimes the AI comes up with surprising ideas.\n\"I remember once we were trying to build a police station and we asked the AI to populate it, and it came back with a doughnut on every desk.\n\"Another time, we were building an apartment and it kept consistently putting a sock under the coffee table. We wondered if it was a bug but it turned out we had labelled it a bachelor apartment so I guess that it was logical to some extent,\" he says.\nCalifornian software firm Inworld is also employing AI to build elements of computer games.\nIt has created an engine that allows developers to add realism to game worlds and emotional depth to characters. The firm is also working on what it calls a narrative graph, developed in partnership with Xbox, which will use AI to help create storylines.\nChief executive Kylan Gibbs tells the BBC that he believes AI will allow developers to \"dream bigger than ever before\".\n\"The engine allows developers to add AI agents that can see, sense, and perceive the world around them, while also interacting with players and taking in-game actions. When you can imbue virtual characters with advanced cognitive capabilities, it unlocks a completely new paradigm for storytelling and gameplay,\" he says.\nNick Walton is the chief executive of gaming firm Latitude.io, and he believes AI has the power to personalise the gaming experience.\n\"We are at the start with AI and as it advances we will see very dynamic, adaptive worlds with characters that feel alive, with story arcs where you as the hero are doing unique things and having a very unique impact on the world.\n\"You could play a game where you find a town that no-one else cares about and no other player has spent time in, and you can get really invested in it and develop relationships with all the characters in it,\" he tells the BBC.\nHis firm developed AI Dungeon, a game that allows players to choose from a variety of worlds and create their own stories within it.\n\"It's kind of like those old text adventures where you type an action and then the game determines what happens next.\n\"But the key difference is that instead of having a developer pre-imagine everything they might do, the AI can dynamically decide what happens next. So any action is possible.\" \nHe said that he was surprised by the success of Dungeon, the first version of which was launched in 2019.\n\"It was started as a side project that I just put on the internet and within a week 100,000 people had played it,\" he says.\n\"I think there's just a lot of replayability because the story is different every time and you can take it in any direction. And there's this ability to have true choice which has always been a goal for many games.\"\nMore technology of business\nGreater reliance on AI could have a knock-on effect to the humans in the industry.\nThe chief executive of computer games giant EA, Andrew Wilson, recently told delegates at a conference that around 60% of the game publisher's development processes could be affected by AI tools. The firm recently laid off 5% of its staff, around 670 jobs.\nMr Maximov does not necessarily see AI replacing humans but rather allowing humans more \"creative dignity\", something that has been lost at some of the big games publishing houses where developers are given very repetitive tasks to do.\n\"There are a lot of developers that had watched Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings and were inspired to go and do something great but are now spending their days placing rocks outside a castle for a year,\" he said.\n\"There's a lot to be said for reclaiming the true purpose and value of these jobs, giving every artist the opportunity",

    "A man charged with murdering schoolboy Daniel Anjorin with a Samurai sword in London has appeared in court. \nMarcus Arduini Monzo, 36, was remanded into custody over the attack in Hainault on Tuesday morning.\nWestminster Magistrates' Court heard Daniel, 14, suffered fatal stab wounds and four other people were injured.\nIt is alleged he also hit a pedestrian with a van, attacked him, and broke into a family's home - where a couple were asleep with their young child.\nThe prosecutor alleged a series of \"horrific offences\" had been carried out. \nEarlier, Daniel's family said he was a wonderful child who was \"well loved\" and \"hard working\". \n\"No family should have to go through what we are experiencing,\" they said. \"Any family will understand it's an absolute tragedy.\"\nMr Monzo, from Newham, east London, has also been charged with two counts of attempted murder, two counts of causing grievous bodily harm, aggravated burglary, and possession of a bladed article.\nThe dual Spanish-Brazilian national stood in the dock in a grey tracksuit holding his left arm across his chest.\nHe spoke slowly to give his name and is due to appear at the Old Bailey on 7 May if a hearing is not available on Friday, the chief magistrate, Paul Goldspring, said.\nAll of the alleged offences are said to have happened in Laing Close, apart from the offence of GBH which is alleged to have taken place in Franklyn Gardens nearby.\nThe court heard Mr Monzo crashed a van into a fence at about 07:00 BST on Tuesday, hitting a member of the public.\nHe then got out of the van, said he would kill the man and slashed his neck with a Samurai sword, the court was told.\nProsecutor David Burns told the court Mr Monzo broke into a nearby home where a couple were asleep with their four-year-old daughter.\nHe allegedly went into the bedroom and attacked the child's father, shouting about believing in God and causing injuries to his neck and arm, the court heard.\nMr Monzo is accused of then running up behind Daniel, who was walking to school, and attacking him.\nThe court heard police officers arrived and tried to help the teenager, before Mr Monzo appeared from a bush. The officers then chased him.\nThe court was told that he jumped out at a female officer and attacked her with the sword while she was on the ground, leaving her with arm wounds described by police as \"horrifically serious\".\nHe is also accused of injuring a male officer, who has a serious hand injury.\nSpeaking to the Press Association (PA), Aiste Dabasinskaite, Daniel's neighbour, said: \"We were shouting and waving towards Daniel as he came out. He had his headphones in so he wouldn't hear us. It just happened right before our eyes, it was horrible.\"\nAnother neighbour said she could no longer sleep at night \"because all I can see is him standing there with the sword\".\nDaniel's school, Bancroft's, in Woodford Green, said he was a \"true scholar\" who had a \"positive nature and gentle character\".\nIn a statement, it described him as a \"core member\" of the community, adding: \"Losing such a young pupil is something we will always struggle to come to terms with.\"\nA fundraising page, set up by a friend of Daniel's brother on Wednesday, has already raised \u00a335,000.\nMeanwhile, the sister of a man wounded in the sword attack has described her brother as a \"hero\" for protecting his family.\nHenry De Los Rios Polania, 35, an IT engineer from Hainault, is in hospital after being stabbed in his home.\nHis sister, Jessica De Los Rios, 31, said her brother had been left \"traumatised\" by the event, adding: \"To us, he's our hero. He protected them - my niece and my sister-in-law.\"\nMs De Los Rios said her brother was recovering in hospital after sustaining a deep wound to his hand.\nShe said he was awake but had lost a lot of blood and it would be a \"really long, traumatising recovery for him\".\nIn Hainault, the police cordon has been lifted and floral tributes continue to be laid.\nSue, a retired minister, was among those paying her respects.\nShe said: \"It's just lovely the way in which this community is here for each other and supporting one another. \n\"We just hope and pray something like this will never happen again here.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A rare dye made from snails for the robes of the Roman elite almost 2,000 years ago has been unearthed at a cricket club. \nThe chunk of Tyrian purple, roughly the size of a ping pong ball, was dug up at Carlisle Cricket Club as part of ongoing yearly excavations.\nA Roman bathhouse was discovered at the site in 2017 and in the last three years 2,000 items including pottery, weapons, coins and semi-precious stones have been found. \nLead archaeologist Frank Giecco said the find was of \"international significance\" and the first time the precious pigment had been discovered in the UK.\nMr Giecco said the pigment was worth more than gold and would have been used to dye the clothes of figures in the imperial court and the \"highest echelons\" of society. \nHe said it was made from the glands of marine snail and about 12,000 were needed to obtain less than 2g of pigment.\n\"The collection of the snails and processing of the glands would have been very time-consuming, \" Mr Giecco said, adding: \"Hence the reason it is so expensive. \n\"It was used in ancient Greek and Roman wall paintings, as well as used as a dye in textiles.\"\nThe dye, which was mixed with beeswax to preserve it, was discovered at the site in October.\nHowever, it has taken several months of chemical analysis to verify that it is purple Tyrian. \nOther finds uncovered at the site have also been described as being of international significance, including a pair of Roman god sculptures discovered in May last year and thought to date back as far as AD200.\nThe sandstone heads once formed part of sculptures standing 12 to 15 ft (3.5 to 4.5m) high.\nIn 2021, tiles with a Roman imperial stamp were uncovered indicating a link to third century Emperor Septimius Severus.\nMr Giecco said that it could not be proved that the emperor visited the Carlisle building, but that there was \"compelling evidence\" to suggest it was linked to his imperial court. \n\"The building is actually dedicated to his wife and uses a north African style of bathhouse construction - the emperor was from Libya,\" he added. \nThis year's dig, carried out by volunteers, begins on 7 May and runs until 17 June.\nThere are still a few places left for volunteers to sign up. \nFollow BBC Cumbria on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Russia is causing disruption to satellite navigation systems affecting thousands of civilian flights, experts say.\nThe Baltic Sea, the Black Sea and the eastern Mediterranean - the regions where Russia's military has been most active - have seen an increase in disruption to the Global Positioning System (GPS). \nThis has left aircraft unable to receive GPS signals.\nIn March, a RAF plane carrying Defence Secretary Grant Shapps had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory.\nThe persistent disruption led Finland's flag carrier Finnair to suspend daily flights to Estonia's second largest city, Tartu, for a month, after two of its aircraft had to return to Helsinki due to GPS interference.\nTartu Airport relies solely on GPS, unlike most larger airports which have alternative navigation systems that allow aircraft to land even if the signal is lost.\nJuho Sinkkonen, Finnair's vice-president for flight operations, told the BBC their aircraft encounter this issue daily.\n\u201cPilots are reporting cases actively, and we get more than 100 reports per month,\u201d he said.\nHowever, Mr Sinkkonen said GPS interference is mainly a nuisance and carries few risks. \nThis is because while an aircraft is in flight - i.e. before approaching and landing at an airport \u2013 it can normally use other navigation systems, so losing connection to GPS does not pose an immediate threat to its safety.\nAccording to Cyrille Rosay, a senior cybersecurity expert at the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), while the problem existed before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 it is worsening.\nThe EASA now clocks \"several thousand incidents\" per year, Mr Rosay said.\nWhen asked where the blame lies, officials from the Baltic states don\u2019t hesitate.\n\"The source of interference is Russia,\u201d Estonia's Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told the BBC. \n\u201cWe have proof that it is coming from Russia, and Russia is violating all the international agreements.\"\nMr Tsahkna said the sources of interference were located near the Russian cities of St Petersburg, Kaliningrad and Pskov.\nOnline investigators agree, saying GPS jammers are likely located halfway between St Petersburg and Estonia and near the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea \u2013 where the RAF plane carrying Defence Secretary Grant Shapps was when its signal was jammed.\nMr Tsahkna said that by jamming GPS signals, Russia was \u201cviolating our territories\u201d and putting people and civilian airplanes in danger. \n\u201cThis is a violation of international agreements\u2026 And also I'm really sure that they know exactly what they're doing,\" he added.\nThe BBC has contacted Russia's Ministry of Defence for comment.\nThere have also been reports of maritime traffic in the Baltic Sea being affected by GPS interference.\nJamming is the most widespread form of such meddling, but there have also been numerous instances of \"spoofing\", when legitimate signals are replaced with fake ones, indicating a false location.\nKeir Giles, director of the Conflict Studies Research Centre, a British think tank, believes Russia is meddling with GPS for both offensive and defensive reasons.\nHe says that while on the one hand Russia is testing \"its capabilities for immobilizing Europe completely in time of crisis\", it is also trying to protect itself from possible missile and drone attacks.\n\"Ukraine has already found ways around Russia's GPS jamming, using other navigational systems to carry out drone strikes deep into Russia. But of course that doesn't mean that Russia doesn't benefit from making sure that GPS simply does not work,\" Mr Giles told the BBC.\nThe impact of GPS interference on Russia's own navigation is much less severe as it has its own sat-nav system, called GLONASS.\nAircraft may have backup systems to work around GPS jamming, but Dana Goward, president of the US-based Resilient Navigation and Timing Foundation, which protects and improves GPS communication, says that meddling with signals still poses serious risks because \"all of our systems and society has been structured around precise GPS signals\".\n\u201cWhen we take the GPS out, clearly to some degree the efficiency and the safety of the aviation system is going to go down,\u201d he added. \n\u201cPeople have to revert to old procedures that they're not quite so familiar with. There is going to be some harm, and we just hope it all stops before something bad happens.\u201d",
    "The parents of a teenager who died during a legal battle with the NHS have launched a fresh bid at the Court of Appeal.\nSudiksha Thirumalesh, who had a rare mitochondrial disorder, had been involved in a court fight with University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust over being moved to palliative care before her death in September.\nThe 19-year-old wanted to raise money for an experimental treatment but a court ruled she had a \"complete inability to accept the medical reality of her position\", which her parents are now appealing.\nThe Trust has opposed the appeal, arguing Ms Thirumalesh\u2019s failure to understand information she was given meant she could not make decisions on her medical care.\nBruno Quintavalle, representing parents Thirumalesh Chellamal Hemachandran and Revathi Malesh Thirumalesh, told the Court of Appeal in London that the student had no \u201cimpairment of mind\u201d.\nHe said on Wednesday that she was \"a young woman very well aware of what she's facing, very well aware of what the medical treatments entail, and very clear that she rejects the care pathway that the hospital wanted her to accept\".\nIn written submissions, Mr Quintavalle continued: \"At root, all that there was... was a disagreement between Sudiksha and her treating clinicians; Sudiksha could make a decision, it was just not the decision that the trust wished her to make.\"\nThe barrister said the court\u2019s previous decision significantly expanded the reach of the law about mental capacity.\nHe said it risked removing capacity from a large class of patients who do not accept their doctors' diagnoses or prognoses.\nVikram Sachdeva KC, representing the trust, said in written submissions that the court had previously considered the medical evidence and the consequences of potential treatment.\nJudges had said during the August hearing that the chances of Ms Thirumalesh being able to undergo treatment were \u201cexceptionally slim\u201d.\nThe barrister continued: \"A failure to accept this relevant information as true meant that Sudiksha did not understand all relevant information and therefore was unable to make a decision for herself in relation to her treatment.\"\nThe hearing before Lady Justice King, Lord Justice Singh and Lord Justice Baker was due to conclude on Thursday, with a decision expected in writing at a later date.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X, and Instagram, Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk",
    "More students are occupying their university campuses in the UK in protest against the war in Gaza. \nPro-Palestinian protesters in cities including Manchester, Newcastle and Leeds have set up tents outside university buildings.\nStudents at Goldsmiths, University of London, have occupied the library. \nThe student protests in the UK come after more than 1,000 people were arrested after pro-Palestinian protests on campuses across the US.\nWhile the number of students protesting in the UK is smaller than in the US, the number of universities seeing protests is growing.\nOne camp, at Warwick University, has been set up in the campus's piazza for a week. \nBut others, including at Sheffield and Bristol, started on Wednesday. \nProtest organisers told BBC News they wanted their universities to divest from Israel in response to its deadly military operation in the Gaza Strip. \nDivestment means selling off stock in Israeli companies or otherwise dropping financial ties. \n The prime minister's spokesman said police would \"have our full support\" if students in the UK tried to replicate protests at US universities.\nRishi Sunak's spokesman said: \"We've always been clear that people have a right to peaceful and lawful protest - but clearly, people shouldn't abuse that right to intimidate others, cause unnecessary disruption.\"\nPalestine Solidarity Campaign youth and student campaigns officer Stella Swain said: \"All the protests so far have been completely peaceful.\n\"There is nothing to indicate that they wouldn't be.\" \nAnd she hoped no politician, regardless of their views on the issue, would want to see police in the UK respond to protesters in the same way as officers in the US.\nOn Thursday, the Union of Jewish Students said the encampments were creating a \"hostile and toxic atmosphere\" on campuses.\n\"It is time that universities take their duty of care to Jewish students seriously,\" it added. \nStudent protesters rejected this characterisation of the demonstrations, telling BBC News Jewish students were camping with them. \nSamira, who asked for her surname to be withheld, said Jewish students were \"very much a part of\" the occupation at her university, Goldsmiths.\n\"I'm proud that there are Jewish students in the occupation with me and on the marches in central London with me,\" she said, adding the pro-Palestinian movement supported \"peace and justice\".\nManchester student Sam, who also asked for his surname to be withheld, said their occupation had been co-organised with Jewish students.\nStudents set up camp in Brunswick Park, near the university's campus, on Wednesday.\nAnd Sam said: \"This encampment has been co-organised by Jewish students.\n\"And there are several Jewish students who are here every day and staying every night,\" he said. \nUK universities have in general supported the students' right to free speech and to protest.\nGoldsmiths said: \"We recognise that people hold strong views over the war, and uphold their right to freely express themselves while being clear about the need to be respectful and within the law.\"\nIt was \"in dialogue with students over these issues\" and was funding scholarships for Palestinian students.\nThe University of Manchester, meanwhile, said while it \"fully recognises\" the right to protest, \"setting up camp in a city campus raises potential health and safety concerns, risks disruption to staff, students and our wider community, and ultimately is an unauthorised and unlawful use of the university's campus\". \n\"We will do everything possible to maintain business as usual,\" it added.

    "The former head of Scotland\u2019s prosecution service has said \u201cwe\u2019re all sorry\u201d over miscarriages of justice in relation to the Post Office Horizon scandal.\nLord Mulholland was lord advocate when the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) became aware of potential problems with the software.\nHe told BBC Scotland News \u201cany miscarriage of justice is a bad thing\u201d when asked about postmasters being convicted due to faults with the Fujitsu-designed system.\nCOPFS said there was no record of Lord Mulholland taking any decisions in relation to cases that involved Horizon evidence.\nMore than 900 sub-postmasters across the UK were prosecuted for crimes such as theft because of incorrect information from the software.\nThe scandal has been described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in the UK in recent times.\nLord Mulholland served as lord advocate between 2011 and 2016.\nBBC News revealed the Crown Office was made aware of potential problems with Horizon in 2013, but prosecutors did not officially  stop pursuing cases until 2015.\nIn England the Post Office prosecuted its own cases but in Scotland COPFS had sole responsibility for taking people to court.\nThe last prosecution in Scotland took place in 2014.\nBBC News approached Lord Mulholland - who is now a judge - on Thursday, after he had given evidence at the Sheku Bayoh public inquiry in Edinburgh.\nWhen asked whether he had anything to say to the victims, he said: \u201cAny miscarriage of justice is a bad thing so if you were subject to a miscarriage of justice then we\u2019re all sorry about it, but that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got to say.\u201d\nThere were up to 60 prosecutions in Scotland between 1999 and 2015 involving Horizon evidence.\nA total of 19 people have asked for their convictions to be overturned.\nSix have been cleared so far.\nThe Scottish government is hopeful of bringing forward legislation to clear those wrongly prosecuted before the summer.\nSome of the victims\u2019 solicitors have questioned why their previously convicted clients were not told by the Crown Office about concerns with the computer system in 2015.\nLord Mulholland said BBC News \u201cwould have to ask the Crown Office about that.\u201d\nThe current Lord Advocate, Dorothy Bain KC, has previously apologised for the way those who were wrongly convicted were \u201cfailed by trusted institutions and the criminal justice system\u201d.\nShe said the COPFS was \u201crepeatedly\u201d misled by the Post Office.\nThe Crown Office has said it is determined to ensure that all miscarriages of justice resulting from unreliable Horizon evidence are identified and overturned.\nA spokesperson said: \u201cIt was not until the decisions by the courts in England and Wales in 2019 and 2021 that the full extent of the bugs and errors in Horizon became known. Until that point, Post Office maintained that the Horizon system was reliable and safe.\u201d\nThey added: \u201cThe Post Office told COPFS in 2013 that its external lawyers had reviewed all potentially impacted Scottish cases and had found no issues.\n\u201cAs at 2015 COPFS was not provided with further evidence which was promised by Post Office to demonstrate that Horizon was as robust as they suggested.\u202fCOPFS therefore decided to no longer rely on Horizon until such time as that further evidence was provided by Post Office.\u201d\nIn relation to the role of Lord Mulholland as former head of the service, the spokesperson said:\n\"In her statement to the Scottish Parliament in January, Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain KC confirmed that there is no record of Lord Mulholland taking any decisions in relation to cases that involved Horizon evidence.\"\nA Post Office spokesperson previously said: \u201cWe are deeply sorry for past wrongs and are doing all we can to put these right, including extensive work to support overturning wrongful convictions. \n\"This work includes assisting the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.\u201d",
    "A farmer is being questioned on suspicion of murder and attempted murder over the shooting of two men during a burglary in Derbyshire, the BBC understands.\nDerbyshire Police was called to reports of a burglary in Eccles Road, in Whaley Bridge, at 01:20 BST on Wednesday.\nOfficers found a 19-year-old man with fatal gunshot wounds and another teen with a gunshot wound nearby.\nA man in his 50s was held on suspicion of murder and attempted murder.\nThe man who died has been named locally as Marcus Smith, who lived nearby and played football for a local team.\nA tribute has been shared on social media by a pub, where he appeared as a DJ.\nThe force said it was keeping an open mind about whether the incident was linked to a reported burglary at the property at about 15:30 BST on Tuesday.\nPeople in the town told the BBC they have been left unsettled by Wednesday's events.\nKeely Tomlinson, 25, said: \"I was shocked - you don't hear about things like that in Whaley.\n\"Everyone is the same, everyone says they are scared.

    "US President Joe Biden has urged pro-Palestinian protesters on university campuses to uphold the rule of law.\n\"We are a civil society, and order must prevail,\" Mr Biden said from the White House, in his first direct remarks about a wave of student unrest.\nPolice have detained more than 2,000 people nationwide in the past fortnight at college rallies and protest camps.\nThat includes 209 arrests early on Thursday at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).\nHundreds of officers in riot gear moved on to UCLA's main campus before dawn and cleared its pro-Palestinian camp.\nThey set off flash bangs and flares, loaded demonstrators on to police buses, and tore down the makeshift barriers and tents that had been erected on campus a week ago.\nIn a statement, UCLA called the camp \"both unlawful and a breach of policy. It led to unsafe conditions on our campus and it damaged our ability to carry out our mission.\"\n\"Demonstrators directly interfered with instruction by blocking students' pathways to classrooms,\" it added, while their clashes with pro-Israeli counter-demonstrators \"put too many [students] in harm's way\".\nAddressing the nationwide protests hours later, Mr Biden said: \"We are not an authoritarian nation where we silence people or squash dissent. But neither are we a lawless country.\n\"There's the right to protest but not the right to cause chaos. People have the right to get an education, the right to get a degree, the right to walk across the campus safely without fear of being attacked.\"\nThe Uncommitted National Movement, a group of Arab-American voters opposed to Mr Biden's re-election campaign this year, accused him of \"smearing\" anti-war protesters.\n\"It's clear Biden isn't listening to young people nationwide, or to the over half a million uncommitted voters asking him to change course. We hope he hears us before it's too late,\" leader Abbas Alawieh said.\nThe campus protests in support of Gaza have now spread to nearly 140 colleges in at least 45 states, according to a BBC tally, and at least six other countries.\nDemonstrators, who have been calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza war, are also demanding academic institutions financially divest from Israel and companies who stand to make money from the conflict.\nBut many colleges have called in the police, with violence erupting on some campuses, as well as rising reports of antisemitic harassment against Jewish students.\nThe tensions at UCLA's main Westwood campus erupted on Tuesday night when a masked pro-Israeli group breached the tent camp on Dickson Plaza and attacked campers with bats, tear gas and other items.\nPolice appeared to move slowly and were criticised by students, observers and some political leaders for their response.\nAfter regaining control of the area on Wednesday, law enforcement created a tight security cordon.\nAdministrators had already declared \"an unlawful assembly\" and, early on Thursday morning, officers moved in.\nAs police breached the perimeter, some demonstrators could be seen locking arms and using their plywood barriers as makeshift shields, while others donned hard hats and seemed to arm themselves with umbrellas. \nKaren Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, said she had been at an \"incident command post\" alongside law enforcement leaders at the campus throughout the operation.\n\"Harassment, vandalism and violence have no place at UCLA or anywhere in our city,\" she wrote in a statement.\nKenza, a UCLA student involved with the protests (she did not provide her last name), told the BBC the encampment had been \"completely peaceful\".\n\"It's absolutely ridiculous that we would be deemed as a threat to civil society when the reality is we have been harassed for the past week,\" she said.\nCampus operations will be limited on Thursday and Friday, with all classes moving to remote instruction, UCLA said.\nA handful of institutions - including Northwestern, Brown, the University of Minnesota and the University of Vermont - have reached agreements with protesters over divestment matters.\nBut arrests have been made in the past 24 hours at Yale, Dartmouth, Stony Brook, Portland State, the University of Wisconsin and the University of Texas at Dallas.",
    "Forty five people have been arrested after protesters and police clashed during a protest in south London over the planned transfer of asylum seekers to the Bibby Stockholm barge in Dorset.\nActivists surrounded a coach at a hotel in Peckham at about 08:40 BST.\nAt about 15:00 it was driven away from the hotel seemingly without passengers.\nIt comes as 711 people were detected crossing the English Channel in small boats on Wednesday, the highest number on a single day so far this year.\nThe Met Police has said that during the protest, some of its officers reported being assaulted.\nThe arrests were for offences including obstruction of the highway, obstructing police and assault on police. \nOne arrest was made for a racially aggravated public order offence but this person was not part of the protest group, the Met said.\nA Home Office spokesperson described the protesters' behaviour as \"intimidatory and aggressive\".\nThey said: \"As part of our commitment to significantly reducing the use of hotels, asylum seekers are being moved into alternative accommodation to reduce costs on the taxpayer. Accommodation is allocated to asylum seekers on a no-choice basis.\"\nThe spokesperson said: \"Asylum seekers can make representations if they believe they are unsuitable to be moved to the Bibby Stockholm. These are considered in full before any decision is made.\"\nMany of the protesters were sitting in the road, chanting.\nThey said that Bibby Stockholm was not a suitable place to house asylum seekers, and those due to be taken there had built relations in the community in Peckham and did not want to be moved.\nThe Home Office abandoned plans to move a group of asylum seekers to the Bibby barge in the wake of protests in Margate last week.\nHome Secretary James Cleverly said in a post on X: \"Housing migrants in hotels costs the British taxpayer millions of pounds every day. \n\"We will not allow this small group of students, posing for social media, to deter us from doing what is right for the British public.\"\nBy about 14:00, a crowd of some 150 people remained at the scene, with chants of \"We shall not be moved\" ringing out.\n\"This is what community looks like,\" and \"No borders, no nations, stop deportations,\" were among other chants made by those gathered. \nAt one point, eight police vehicles were parked at the scene, as well as three riots vans.\nThe road was closed to traffic in both directions. \nMet Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Ade Adelekan said in a social media post: \"My officers were quickly on scene and have engaged with the protesters at length.\"\nHe added: \"We will always respect the right to peaceful protest but we have been clear that where there is serious disruption and criminality then we will take decisive action.\n\"It saddens me greatly to say that a number of officers have been assaulted in the course of their duty following an incident in Peckham today where they sought to uphold the law.\"\nThe Home Office said it was planning to close 150 asylum seeker hotels by the beginning of May.\nA spokesperson said they were working \"closely with accommodation providers to manage the exit process in a way which limits the impact on local authorities and asylum seekers alike\".\nOn Wednesday, some 14 small boats were detected crossing the English Channel.\nProvisional figures, external from the Home Office, show that more than 8,000 people have arrived in the UK by small boats so far this year.\nThis is 34% higher than the total at the equivalent time last year.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A senior Fujitsu engineer made a false statement to court about the flawed Post Office IT system, contradicting a report he had written days earlier.\nThe BBC has obtained Gareth Jenkins' 2010 statement, which helped wrongly jail pregnant postmistress Seema Misra.\nIt said there were \"no cases\" where branch accounts could be altered without postmasters' knowledge.\nBut he had just produced a Post Office report which proposed remotely altering data in branches to fix a bug.\nMr Jenkins, Fujitsu's former chief IT architect, is currently being investigated by the Metropolitan Police for potential perjury, the BBC understands.\nAt least three Post Office lawyers were told about the internal report which contradicted Mr Jenkins' statement to court, but his report was not disclosed at the trial of Mrs Misra - who had been running a branch at West Byfleet in Surrey.  \nThe Post Office said it was \"deeply sorry\" for the suffering caused to victims and it \"remained focused\" on supporting the ongoing inquiry.\nMr Jenkins' report and an accompanying memo provide the clearest evidence yet that as early as autumn 2010 the Post Office and Fujitsu, which built the Horizon IT system, were aware of details about the software which could cast doubt on prosecutions, and were keeping them hidden.\nThe memo, which summarised a series of meetings about the report, said that if the bug was widely known, it could cause a \"loss of confidence in the Horizon system\", provide branches with \"ammunition to blame Horizon for future discrepancies\" and have \"potential impact upon ongoing legal cases\".\nThe Horizon bug, known internally as the \"receipts/payments mismatch\" issue, was causing discrepancies between the accounts postmasters saw and those on the Post Office main servers. According to the memo, it was known to be affecting 40 branches.\nIn his report on 29 September 2010, Gareth Jenkins suggested remotely altering data to resolve the bug.\nHe met other Fujitsu and Post Office representatives a few days later to discuss the possible solutions.\nThe memo says Mr Jenkins' proposal to remotely access sub-postmasters' accounts had raised \"significant data integrity concerns\", could lead to questions of \"tampering\" and could prompt \"moral implications\" of the Post Office \"changing branch data without informing the branch\". \nIn the end, the group chose a different solution - using debt recovery or refunds to make the balances match. The memo acknowledged this could \"potentially highlight to branches that Horizon can lose data\".\nNine days after delivering his report, Mr Jenkins submitted his final expert witness testimony, which was used by the prosecution in Mrs Misra's trial. In the months leading up to it, he had been drafting his statement for the court, with input from Post Office lawyers.\nMr Jenkins' testimony was also later used in the prosecution of many other sub-postmasters, where details of his report on the bug were again not disclosed. \nThe BBC has obtained his 2010 testimony, which states there are \"no cases where external systems can manipulate the branch's accounts without the users in the branch being aware and authorising the transactions\".\nOn the same day, 8 October, internal documents show that a number of Post Office lawyers had copies of both Mr Jenkins' contradictory claims - his witness statement, and the report about the bug in which he proposed remotely altering branch data.\nA member of the Post Office security team had attended the meeting that discussed Mr Jenkins' report and had emailed Rob Wilson, then head of the PO's criminal law team, expressing \"concern\" about the proposed solutions. He wrote that they \"may have repercussions in any future prosecution cases and on the integrity of the Horizon Online system\". \nAttached to his email were the meeting's memo and Mr Jenkins' report.\nMr Wilson then forwarded this email - and the attachments - to Jarnail Singh and Juliet McFarlane, senior lawyers who dealt with Post Office prosecutions.\nMr Singh was specifically assigned to Seema Misra's case and was responsible for disclosure - the duty to share information that might help the opposing side's case.\nIn a written statement to the public inquiry into the Horizon scandal last year, he said: \"I do not recall having seen this document.\"\nBut Post Office records reveal that just minutes after receiving the email in 2010, he had printed off Mr Jenkins' report.\nThe BBC showed Mr Jenkins' report and the meeting memo to Prof Charles McLachlan, an expert witness for Mrs Misra's defence team.\nProf McLachlan said they were \"completely incompatible\" with Mr Jenkins' witness statement at her trial.\n\"There's absolutely no question that he not only knew, but was recommending remote access at a point when his witness statement was claiming there was no remote access,\" he said.\nMr Jenkins' witness statement was made in response to technical issues originally raised by Prof McLachlan.\nSeema Misra said seeing the documents from 2010 made her \"e",

He really studied his craft.\"\nBevan described Tandy as a quiet man, who was not a showman but played a key role in creating ELO's music.\nHe said: \"His real forte was in the studio.

    "A 15-year-old child was prescribed dangerous levels of hormones by an unregulated online clinic without speaking to a doctor, a court ruling has revealed.\nNow 16, the teenager, known as J, was born female but identifies as a boy and has an autism diagnosis. \nJ got a prescription for testosterone and puberty blockers from Singapore-owned GenderGP in late 2022.\nHe had previously been unable to get the treatment through the NHS.\nJudge Sir Andrew McFarlane said: \"There must be very significant concern about the prospect of a young person such as J accessing cross-hormone treatment from any off-shore, online, unregulated private clinic.\" \nThe judgement highlights the lack of NHS gender services for children and young people in England and Wales, after the closure of the Tavistock Gender Identity and Development Service (Gids) in April. \nGids, rated as \"inadequate\" by inspectors in 2021, was the only specialist gender clinic for children and young people in the two countries. \nThe judgement says that, as a result: \"There is no relevant NHS service available for J.\"\nThe case illustrates how vulnerable children questioning their gender face huge waiting lists and sometimes resort to ordering medicines from overseas without adequate oversight from medical professionals.\nJ's father applied to the High Court last year to stop him continuing to get access to puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, arguing his son was too young to consent.\nThe judgement was largely finalised before last month's publication of the Cass report, which made numerous recommendations about the treatment of young people who identify as trans. \nThe review, published by paediatrician Dr Hilary Cass, says children have been let down by a lack of research and \"remarkably weak\" evidence on medical interventions in gender care. \nIt argues that the \"toxicity\" of the debate on gender means professionals are \"afraid\" to discuss their views openly. \nThe High Court judgement says J was diagnosed with autism and anorexia in 2020, and was sectioned under the Mental Health Act for treatment in 2021 after incidents of self-harm.\nJ first made contact with GenderGP in October 2022, with the support of his mother.\nTwo months later, after a fee was paid and a questionnaire completed, a prescription was issued for testosterone and puberty blockers, drugs sometimes used by people born female who identify as male to affirm their preferred gender.\nThe judgement says \"no medical examination, blood testing or other clinical evaluation was undertaken. J has not had any direct communication with a doctor at any stage during the referral to GenderGP\".\nThe only communication J had with a representative of GenderGP was with a Manchester-based counsellor, who is not registered with the Health and Care Professions Council regulator.\nGenderGP did not participate in the court hearing.\nAlthough the prescription was from a private doctor, J was given injections of testosterone by his local NHS GP every six weeks between January and August 2023.\nAn expert witness in the case, Australia-based consultant paediatric endocrinologist Dr Jacqueline Hewitt, was critical of the lack of physical and psychological checks carried out by GenderGP on J.\nDr Hewitt also raised concerns about the size of the doses of testosterone given to J, describing the level of the hormone in his blood during his treatment as \"dangerously high\". \nShe added: \"In Australia, the treatment provided by GenderGP would be unlawful.\"\nIn his judgement, Sir Andrew did not make a ruling about whether J was competent to consent to taking the drugs because the teenager is not on the medication at the moment.\nJ is not currently being treated by GenderGP, but is waiting to be seen at a new private London-based clinic.

    "Take That have become the latest act to move shows from the troubled Co-op Live arena amid a series of \"technical issues\".\nRival venue the AO Arena confirmed it would now host the band's five dates next week amid 24 hours of chaos for Manchester's new \u00a3365m venue. \nThe rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie also earlier announced a switch to the AO, and band Keane cancelled a show.\nPopstar Olivia Rodrigo also had a forthcoming concert cancelled. \nIn a new statement, Co-op Live said it would be taking a \"short pause\" and would welcome members of the public to the arena from 14 May.\nIt said it was taking a break to \"ensure the safety and security of fans and artists visiting the venue\".\nOak View Group, which owns the arena, has blamed defects with parts of its ventilation system for the cancellations. \nPosting on X, Take That said: \"This is not a decision we have taken lightly, but we wanted to give our fans as much notice as possible.\"\nOn Wednesday, hundreds of fans who went to the A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie gig found out the show had been axed as they queued up outside. \nThe rapper, real name Julius Dubose, said: \"Yesterday's cancelled Manchester show has been rescheduled for this Saturday at AO Arena! We won't give up that easy let's go!\". \nSigns that all was not well at the new arena emerged when it first cancelled what was supposed to be its inaugural act, a gig by comedian Peter Kay. \nAccording to the company, a nozzle used in the building's ventilation system became detached during a sound-check because of what it believed was a \"factory defect\". \nWhen staff could not guarantee other components were free of similar defects, OVG said it was left with no choice but to cancel. \nBy Ian Youngs, Culture reporter\nThe Take That announcement comes after a succession of highly embarrassing postponements and problems for Co-op Live. \nBut losing a residency by one of Britain's biggest bands - and local heroes - to its rival venue will arguably be seen as the biggest humiliation of the lot. \nIn a BBC interview in March, Co-op Live general manager Gary Roden - who has since resigned because of all the issues - spoke dismissively about the AO Arena, saying music stars would prefer to play at his newer venue. \n\"It's going to be difficult for an artist to say, 'Yeah, I've booked the arena that is 30 years old versus the arena that's brand new',\" he said.\nBut now, stars are turning back to the tried and trusted AO, which has been operating under a variety of names since 1995. \nCo-op Live said it was working \"incredibly hard\" to get the venue up and running for what remains of its opening season. \nThe statement continued: \"We are aware our actions have frustrated and angered ticket holders. We know you've incurred significant disruption, and are finding a way to help make it right.\"\nFans left in the lurch by Wednesday's last minute cancellation expressed concern about future events at the arena, which is now the UK's largest. \nYasin, 20, told the BBC he paid \u00a325 for parking and arrived at the venue only to be handed a piece of paper saying the A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie gig was off. \nHe said: \"I'm thinking, is this real? Why isn't it online? It was very unprofessional, I couldn't believe it almost, like is this the way we're finding out that it's been cancelled?\n\"It makes me question future events, if they're going to be planned properly or if it's going to be organised enough.\"\nThe Co-operative Group, which is the naming rights sponsor for the venue, said it was \"disappointed\" by the further schedule changes. \nA spokesman said: \"Co-op is a sponsor and does not own or run the venue, and we have made it clear to Oak View Group, who are responsible for the building, that the impact on ticketholders must be addressed as a priority. \n\"We are pleased that they will shortly be putting plans in place to do so.\"\nAO arena's general manager Jen Mitchell said it was \"great\" to be welcoming Take That to the venue \"for five nights in the heart of this wonderful city\".\nDo you have tickets to an upcoming event?

    "John Swinney looks set to become Scotland's next first minister after Kate Forbes confirmed she would not challenge him for the SNP leadership.\nMr Swinney, the former deputy first minister and party leader, announced his intention to succeed Humza Yousaf and offered Ms Forbes a \"significant\" role in his government.\nMs Forbes later confirmed in a statement she would not stand in the contest and endorsed Mr Swinney. \nThe former finance secretary had been the only other SNP politician to publicly state she was considering a leadership bid. \nShe said in a statement: \"I have concluded that the best way to deliver the urgent change Scotland needs is to join with John Swinney and advocate for that reform agenda within the Scottish government.\n\u201cI can therefore today announce that I will not be seeking nomination as the next SNP leader.\n\u201cJohn will therefore have my support and endorsement in any campaign to follow.\u201d\nMs Forbes said she had \u201clistened carefully\u201d to Mr Swinney\u2019s statement and welcomed his \u201ccommitment to ensure internal respect for robust and divergent debate in the party\u201d.\nShe said she had held \u201cfrank and constructive\u201d talks with the former deputy first minister.\nMr Swinney told BBC Radio Scotland\u2019s Drivetime programme he was \"delighted\" Ms Forbes had endorsed his campaign.\nHe said if he succeeded Mr Yousaf Ms Forbes would have a \u201cbig role\u201d in his government -

who questioned last year whether views expressed by Ms Forbes about gay marriage made her \"appropriate\" to be first minister - said he wanted her to play a \"significant part\" in his government if he becomes first minister. \nHe described her as a \"colleague and friend\".\n\u201cShe is an intelligent, creative, thoughtful person who has much to contribute to our national life,\" Mr Swinney said.\n\u201cAnd if elected, I will make sure Kate is able to make that contribution.\u201d\nHe told BBC Scotland News after his speech he had \u201calways believed\u201d Ms Forbes could made a significant contribution to the government, despite his criticism during the 2023 leadership contest. \nAn ally of Ms Forbes told BBC Scotland News that Mr Swinney would need to offer a \u201cbig job\u201d in the cabinet to win her support.\nFormer business minister Ivan McKee, a prominent backer of Ms Forbes, said she understood working together with Mr Swinney made \u201chuge sense for the unity of the party and the movement\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cSo I fully support Kate in that decision and fully get behind her in endorsing John as next party leader and first minister of Scotland.\u201d\nMr McKee added he would be \u201cvery surprised\u201d if anyone else stood for the SNP leadership.\nMr Swinney, who also pledged to deliver economic growth and social justice in Scotland, told the BBC\u2019s Nicola Sturgeon podcast last year that he had been trying to stand down from government since 2016.\nBut he said he was repeatedly talked into staying by Ms Sturgeon.\nAt his campaign launch, Mr Swinney insisted he would not be an \"interim leader\" or a \u201ccaretaker\" first minister and aimed to see out a full term should he win the leadership contest.\n\"I am offering to lead my party through the Westminster elections, to lead us beyond the 2026 elections, to contest, which I intend to win for the SNP and for Scotland,\u201d he said.\nHe was backed by SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn, deputy leader Keith Brown and cabinet ministers Neil Gray, Jenny Gilruth, Shirley-Anne Somerville and Mairi McAllan.\nMs McAllan introduced Mr Swinney at the launch event, describing him as a \"steadfast\" defender of Scotland's interests. \nCabinet ministers Angus Robertson and Fiona Hyslop also attended the campaign launch.\nMs Forbes, the MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, narrowly lost to Mr Yousaf in the SNP leadership election last year, receiving 48% of the vote in the final round of the ballot. \nShe was criticised during the campaign for revealing she would have voted against gay marriage legislation had she been an MSP at the time due to her religious beliefs as a member of the Free Church of Scotland.\nMr Swinney, also a Christian, questioned whether it would be \"appropriate\" for someone with such views to become SNP leader.\nMs Forbes was backed to succeed Mr Yousaf by a smaller number of SNP colleagues than Mr Swinney, including those regularly at odds with the party leadership such as the MP Joanna Cherry and MSP Fergus Ewing.\n\nNomina",

    "The investment bank Goldman Sachs has become the first to remove its cap on bankers' bonuses following changes to UK laws introduced last year.\nThe bank said this would give \"greater flexibility\" and was closer to what happens in other big financial centres such as Singapore and New York.\nBonuses were limited to twice basic pay in a move introduced by the EU in 2014. \nOther big banks are thought to be considering a similar moves.\nThe limit on bankers' bonuses was introduced by the EU in 2014 despite British opposition, to try to discourage the kind of excessive risk-taking that contributed to the 2008 great financial crisis. \nCritics argued that banks were able to get round it by simply increasing base salaries. This then made it harder to reduce salaries when bankers performed badly, or claw back pay if misconduct came to light. \nWhen it brought in the changes, the Financial Conduct Authority said the change should remove these \"unintended consequences\". \nThe decision was first announced by Kwasi Kwarteng during his brief stint as chancellor in 2022, in a bid to boost the competitiveness of London as a financial centre.\nBanks have argued that the bonus cap makes it harder to attract talent from the US and Asia to the UK. \nGoldman Sachs said in a statement: \"This approach gives us greater flexibility to manage fixed costs through the cycle and pay for performance. It brings the UK closer to the practice in other global financial centres, to support the UK as an attractive venue for talent.\"\nA number of other banks have reportedly been reviewing their pay policies in the light of the changes. \nWhen the decision to remove the bonus cap was announced last year, the Trades Union Congress general secretary Paul Nowak called it an \"insult to working people\" when \"millions up and down the country are struggling to make ends meet.\"\nThe change will not be universally welcomed by bankers, some of whom prefer to receive more of their income as guaranteed basic pay rather than bonuses which depend on their performance.

Actually people are really fearful that they\u2019ve got this precious organ and they don't want to do anything that\u2019ll risk it.\"\nThe centre also runs a monthly group, the Transplant Caf\u00e9,  for pre- and post-transplant patients to talk about any issues. \nPatients are also encouraged to write an anonymous letter of thanks, which is given to the donor\u2019s family by the centre.\nGary Lee received a heart transplant five years ago.\n\"I was literally dying\" he remembers. \"My organs kept shutting down.\"\nGary, like everyone I speak to, says he often thinks about the person who allowed him to live.\nAs a way of expressing his gratitude he says whenever he and his wife go abroad or away anywhere, \"we always look for a church and we always light candles for our donors and donor families everywhere we go\".\nDeborah Horrocks had a heart transplant in 2020.\n\"I\u2019m just so grateful that it happened - it gave me a second chance,\" she says.\n\"Both of my children got married last year and I\u2019ve got a grandson, and all this I wouldn\u2019t have been able to see...\"\nDeborah pauses, temporarily unable to speak, before continuing: \"Because I wouldn\u2019t have been here.\"\nIn the eyes of the law, every patient is a potential organ donor, unless they\u2019ve opted out.\nIn practice, though, families have to give their consent.\nAnd many just don\u2019t know what their relative would have wanted.\nMatt Collis says the situation is made far easier when someone has registered a decision to donate on the organ register, even though it is no longer a requirement.\n\"In my experience, that makes it very clear for families to understand that this is what their loved one wanted, and that I am there to help them with that,\" he says.\nMatt keeps in touch with donor families for several months afterwards, sometimes even longer.  \nOnce a year a special ceremony is held for every family to celebrate their loved one\u2019s life.\n\"These patients are so special and they have such an impact on transplant recipients,\" Matt says.\n\"I find that the families that I still speak to a year, two years down the line, they say that organ donation has really helped them. Because the death wasn\u2019t for nothing.\u201d\nI say to Matt that he obviously finds his job very rewarding.\nHe smiles and says: \"The families that donate are just wonderful.\n\"I find it amazing that in their time of grief and a time when their world has ended that they are willing and able to help other people.\"",
    "A 15-year-old child was prescribed dangerous levels of hormones by an unregulated online clinic without speaking to a doctor, a court ruling has revealed.\nNow 16, the teenager, known as J, was born female but identifies as a boy and has an autism diagnosis. \nJ got a prescription for testosterone and puberty blockers from Singapore-owned GenderGP in late 2022.\nHe had previously been unable to get the treatment through the NHS.\nJudge Sir Andrew McFarlane said: \"There must be very significant concern about the prospect of a young person such as J accessing cross-hormone treatment from any off-shore, online, unregulated private clinic.\" \nThe judgement highlights the lack of NHS gender services for children and young people in England and Wales, after the closure of the Tavistock Gender Identity and Development Service (Gids) in April. \nGids, rated as \"inadequate\" by inspectors in 2021, was the only specialist gender clinic for children and young people in the two countries. \nThe judgement says that, as a result: \"There is no relevant NHS service available for J.\"\nThe case illustrates how vulnerable children questioning their gender face huge waiting lists and sometimes resort to ordering medicines from overseas without adequate oversight from medical professionals.\nJ's father applied to the High Court last year to stop him continuing to get access to puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, arguing his son was too young to consent.\nThe judgement was largely finalised before last month's publication of the Cass report, which made numerous recommendations about the treatment of young people who identify as trans. \nThe review, published by paediatrician Dr Hilary Cass, says children have been let down by a lack of research and \"remarkably weak\" evidence on medical interventions in gender care. \nIt argues that the \"toxicity\" of the debate on gender means professionals are \"afraid\" to discuss their views openly. \nThe High Court judgement says J was diagnosed with autism and anorexia in 2020, and was sectioned under the Mental Health Act for treatment in 2021 after incidents of self-harm.\nJ first made contact with GenderGP in October 2022, with the support of his mother.\nTwo months later, after a fee was paid and a questionnaire completed, a prescription was issued for testosterone and puberty blockers, drugs sometimes used by people born female who identify as male to affirm their preferred gender.\nThe judgement says \"no medical examination, blood testing or other clinical evaluation was undertaken. J has not had any direct communication with a doctor at any stage during the referral to GenderGP\".\nThe only communication J had with a representative of GenderGP was with a Manchester-based counsellor, who is not registered with the Health and Care Professions Council regulator.\nGenderGP did not participate in the court hearing.\nAlthough the prescription was from a private doctor, J was given injections of testosterone by his local NHS GP every six weeks between January and August 2023.\nAn expert witness in the case, Australia-based consultant paediatric endocrinologist Dr Jacqueline Hewitt, was critical of the lack of physical and psychological checks carried out by GenderGP on J.\nDr Hewitt also raised concerns about the size of the doses of testosterone given to J, describing the level of the hormone in his blood during his treatment as \"dangerously high\". \nShe added: \"In Australia, the treatment provided by GenderGP would be unlawful.\"\nIn his judgement, Sir Andrew did not make a ruling about whether J was competent to consent to taking the drugs because the teenager is not on the medication at the moment.\nJ is not currently being treated by GenderGP, but is waiting to be seen at a new private London-based clinic.

    "A Sumatran orangutan in Indonesia has self-medicated using a paste made from plants to heal a large wound on his cheek, say scientists.\nIt is the first time a creature in the wild has been recorded treating an injury with a medicinal plant.\nAfter researchers saw Rakus applying the plant poultice to his face, the wound closed up and healed in a month.\nScientists say the behaviour could come from a common ancestor shared by humans and great apes.\n\"They are our closest relatives and this again points towards the similarities we share with them. We are more similar than we are different,\" said biologist Dr Isabella Laumer at the Max Planck institute in Germany and lead author of the research.\nA research team in the Gunung Leuser National Park, Indonesia spotted Rakus with a large wound on his cheek in June 2022.\nThey believe he was injured fighting with rival male orangutans because he made loud cries called \"long calls\" in the days before they saw the wound.\nThe team then saw Rakus chewing the stem and leaves of plant called Akar Kuning - an anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial plant that is also used locally to treat malaria and diabetes.\nHe repeatedly applied the liquid onto his cheek for seven minutes. Rakus then smeared the chewed leaves onto his wound until it was fully covered. He continued to feed on the plant for over 30 minutes.\nThe paste and leaves then appear to have done their magic - the researchers saw no sign of infection and the wound closed within five days.\nAfter a month, Rakus was fully healed.\nThe scientists concluded that Rakus knew he was applying medicine because orangutans very rarely eat this particular plant and because of the length of the treatment.\n\"He repeatedly applied the paste, and he later also applied more solid plant matter. The entire process lasted really a considerable amount of time - that's why we think that he intentionally applied it,\" explains Dr Laumer.  \nThe researchers also saw Rakus resting for much longer than usual - more than half of the day - suggesting he was trying to recuperate after the injury.\nScientists were already aware that great apes used medicine to try to heal themselves. \nIn the 1960s biologist Jane Goodall saw whole leaves in the faeces of chimpanzees, and others documented seeing great apes swallowing leaves with medicinal properties.\nBut they had never seen a wild animal applying a plant to a wound.\nDr Laumer says it is possible that it was the first time Rakus had done this type of treatment. \n\"It could be that he accidentally touched his wound with his finger that had the plant on it.  And then because the plant has quite potent pain relieving substances he might have felt immediate pain relief, which made him apply it again and again,\" she says. \nOr he could have learned the method from watching other orangutans in his group.\nThe researchers will now be closely watching other orangutans to see if they can spot the same medical skills that Rakus showed.\n\"I think in the next few years we will discover even more behaviours and more abilities that are very human-like,\" she suggests. \nThe research is published in the scientific journal Scientific Reports.",
    "Ticket-holders for Olivia Rodrigo's gigs at Manchester's crisis-hit Co-op Live arena have told the BBC they are angry and devastated after her shows were called off.\nThe US singer was due to launch her UK tour with two sold-out gigs at the new \u00a3365m venue this weekend.\nThose were due to be among the arena's first shows, but its opening plans have been hit by a string of delays and technical problems.\nThe venue was finally expected to officially launch with a show by US rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie on Wednesday. But that was called off at the last minute as thousands of fans were already queuing outside, after an incident when part of the heating and ventilation system became detached.\nThere is now uncertainty over when the venue will open, with Keane and Take That still scheduled to perform there in the coming days.\nThe arena, which is set to be the UK's largest indoor arena with space for 23,500 people, was originally due to be opened by comedian Peter Kay last week. His shows have been postponed twice.\nRodrigo, one of the world's biggest pop stars, was due to perform for about 40,000 people at the venue on Friday and Saturday.\nThe chart-topping star told fans she was \"sooooo disappointed\" not to perform.\n\"I'm so bummed and I really hope to see you all soon,\" the Drivers License hitmaker wrote on Instagram, saying she and her team were \"doing our best\" to reschedule the concerts.\nCatherine Pugh, from near Leeds, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Nicky Campbell she bought tickets for her daughter, who had spent three months in hospital last year.\nHer daughter \"instantly put a countdown on her phone\" and the family splashed out on new outfits and booked a hotel, she said.\nWhen the concert was postponed, she said \"the devastation my daughter is feeling is palpable and the concern is it impacts her recovery, I feel so sad for her\".\nDean McAllister, from Newcastle, told the station he bought tickets for his daughter as a surprise Christmas present.\nHe said he didn't know how to tell his daughter the bad news.\n\"I was angry last night and I've been up since 05:30 wondering what to do. She took it better than I did - it's been poorly managed from the top to the bottom,\" he added.\nScott Tostevin was due to fly from Guernsey with his friend and her daughter to see Rodrigo to celebrate her 18th birthday.\nHe estimated the trio had spent more than \u00a31,000 on flights and hotels.\nIn a statement, the arena's operators Oak View Group said they were \"deeply sorry\" for the upheaval.\nThey blamed Wednesday's problems on an incident during the soundcheck when \"a component of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system, used to direct air, separated from the ductwork\".\nThey said no-one was injured, but the whole system would need to be tested for further defects.\nThe Co-operative Group, which sponsors the venue, said it was \"shocked\" by the developments and was \"seeking a full explanation from Oak View Group\".\nThe Co-operative Group does not own the building and did not comment on whether it has a break clause in its sponsorship deal.\nThe deal also means its members can get \u201cearly bird\u201d specials on tickets.\nCo-op Live has been built next to Manchester City's Etihad stadium.\nIt is a joint venture between Oak View Group, co-founded by US music mogul Irving Azoff, and City Football Group, owned by billionaire UAE royal and deputy prime minister Sheikh Mansour.\nSinger Harry Styles is among the other investors.",
    "Cambodia has blamed factors including the heatwave gripping south-east Asia for a deadly ammunition warehouse explosion.\nTwenty soldiers were killed in the incident in Kampong Speu province, Cambodia on Saturday.\nRejecting claims that rebellious soldiers were to blame, officials said the blast was caused by a combination of faulty munitions and extremely hot weather.\nTemperatures of up to 43C (109.4F) are forecast for the country.\nAn office building as well as nearby barracks were destroyed, with 25 nearby homes affected, reports said.\nImages of the incident show a destroyed warehouse, a damaged military truck and a child with gashes being treated by medics. Multiple explosions can be heard on unverified social media video.\n\"The incident of the ammunition explosion on April 27, 2024... was a technical issue because the weapons are old, faulty, and the hot weather,\" Cambodia's defence ministry said in a statement, according to AFP.\nPrime Minister Hun Manet has said he was \"deeply shocked\" by the blast. He said authorities would cover funeral expenses and pay compensation of $20,000 (\u00a316,000) to the families of those killed, while injured soldiers will get $5,000, he said.\nLike large parts of south and south-east Asia, Cambodia has been struggling with hot weather in recent weeks. Temperatures could still hit 43C (109.4F) in the country by the weekend, Crisis24, a risk management company, told the Khmer Times.\nIn the Philippines, half the country is experiencing a drought, with temperatures reaching highs in several areas.\nThe heat has forced Bangladesh to suspend classes. The measures have affected 33 million students.\nIn Thailand, 30 people died of heatstroke between January and 17 April this year, compared with 37 in the whole of 2023, the health ministry said. \nUnicef has warned that more than 243 million children across eastern Asia and the Pacific are at risk of heat-related illnesses and death.\nOne climate expert has attributed the excessive heat to climate change and the impact of a powerful El Ni\u00f1o weather system in the western Pacific.",
    "Asylum seekers moved from Mount Street in Dublin have said their new tented accommodation was flooded on Wednesday night.\nThe men said illness, a lack of running drinking water and the isolated site has all impacted their situation.\nMore than 100 people have been moved to Crooksling in the Dublin mountains, an hour from the city centre.\nThe asylum seekers were bussed to \u201cmore appropriate accommodation\u201d according to the Irish government, on Wednesday morning.\nThis was the third clearance of a makeshift campsite outside the International Protection Office , and the second time asylum seekers have been sent to Crooksling.\nIn March, a number of men sent to the accommodation returned to the city centre citing lack of facilities and feeling unsafe.\nThe men at Crooksling are mainly from Palestine, Syria, Jordan and Algeria. They said they were nervous of the media and asked not to be identified.\nA group told BBC News NI that constant rain on Wednesday night meant water was leaking into their tents and flooded the small shelter.\nTwelve men are sharing one large tent, with about 10 large tents in the compound.\nThey said they could not tell the staff at the centre the tents had flooded because of a lack of translators on site.\nOne man said a number of people had developed health issues after sleeping in tents at Mount Street where sanitary conditions were poor and there was no access to toilets.\n\u201cA lot of people with medical issues like influenza, they have back pains, the neck pains everything from living in the tents,\u201d he said.\nA mobile medical facility visited Crooksling on Thursday to treat the men.\nAnother man claimed conditions at Crooksling were not liveable and many would like to leave.\nHe claimed they did not have access to running drinking water.\nThe men at Crooksling said meals are provided three times a day, but said there are no cooking facilities.\nThe Irish government has not confirmed where new asylum seekers entering the state will go as the state ran out of accommodation last year.\nA large crowd who gathered on Thursday at the International Protection office in Dublin were told there was no accommodation available and were given details of homeless services.\nCharities like the Irish Refugee Council now believe the number of homeless asylum seekers in Ireland stands at around 1,800 - on top of the estimated 14,000 Irish people without accommodation.\nThe Irish government's cabinet sub-committee on immigration will meet on Thursday after a week of diplomatic disagreement with Britain.\nThe committee, made up of ministers who have a role in the immigration issue, including housing, justice and integration, is set to debate the issues which have arisen from Justice Minister Helen McEntee's comments that 80-91% of new arrivals seeking asylum have crossed the border with Northern Ireland. \nMinisters are set to discuss ways in which derelict buildings such as defunct hospitals and hotels can be brought into state use to house those seeking asylum.\nThe committee, which deals with all issues surrounding migration, will also discuss efforts that are being made to process asylum applications quicker.\nThe Irish government has been keen to underline that their immigration system must be \"firm but fair\" but have recently ramped up mention of deportation and returns amid clashes between Garda\u00ed and anti-immigrant protestors.\nThe Irish government has recently expressed concern about the number of asylum seekers coming from the UK to the Republic of Ireland.\nOn Tuesday, a plan to draft new Irish legislation which would redesignate the UK as a \"safe country\" to which asylum seekers can be returned was approved.",
    "A government body set up to respond to national emergencies was severely understaffed just weeks before the country went into lockdown, the Covid Inquiry has heard.\nThe Civil Contingencies Hub was established to react to emergencies such as weather conditions.\nHowever it was employed to deal with a no-deal Brexit and the pandemic.\nChris Stewart, who worked for the Executive Office, gave evidence to the inquiry on Thursday.\nHe said that on 12 March 2020 there were four people working in the hub when there should have been at least 28.\nIn an email to the head of the civil service Mr Stewart said that the hub's only member of staff was \"on her knees\".\nMr Stewart, who acted as chief of staff for the hub, said it was understaffed due to resources and when posts fell vacant, they were not filled.  \nThe inquiry was shown another email from Ms Bernie Rooney, in which she said at this moment \"I'm a one person hub and all of the issues related to Covid-19 are moving at pace\".\nWhen probed further by the chair Baroness Hallett about the number of staff in the contingency hub, Mr Stewart said there were two in February and March.  \n\"It is unfortunate that we hadn't given enough thought to resilience at a senior level,\" he said.  \nThe inquiry heard that the Brexit team joined the hub on 14 March 2020 after the World Health Organization had declared a global pandemic on 11 March.\nMr Stewart said he accepted the point that that \"was very late in the day for having the sufficient planning resources\".\nHe said he would entirely agree with Sir David Sterling's statements at the inquiry on Wednesday that \"we were not as well prepared as we ought to have been\".\n\"We ought not to have been 18 months behind in our planning for an influenza pandemic,\" he said. \nHe told the inquiry that they \"got to where we got by mid-March by extremely hard work by a small and under-resourced team over a very short period\".\nHe said that was not a \"satisfactory position to be in\" and said it was not a position that he would seek to defend.\n\"We ought not to have been in that position. We ought to have been better prepared,\" he said. \nMr Stewart told the inquiry that it would have taken considerable time, effort and resources on the part of the Civil Contingencies Board and within all government departments to get to the point of being ready for a pandemic. \nMr Stewart said he agreed with Sir David Sterling's evidence on Wednesday that Northern Ireland had activated the contingency plan at the right time.\nHowever he said that, like Sir David would also accept if at the end of the inquiry it \"concluded that wasn't the case\".  \nRegarding the introduction of regulations that were imposed in Northern Ireland, the inquiry heard that ministers only had hours to pull them together before they were \"made\".\nMr Stewart said it was a most \"intense time of engagement\" involving mainly the first minister, deputy first minister, the health minister and the Department of Justice.  \nIn further evidence, the inquiry heard that before the pandemic outbreak there had been a considerable loss of experienced staff within the Public Health Agency.\nIn her evidence Dr Joanne McClean, who is the current director of Public Health, agreed the \"situation had deteriorated\". She said she had been a junior member of staff during the swine flu outbreak in 2009 but those with most experience had left or retired. \nShe said the PHA was not prepared in a number of ways but that was the case across the world because it was such an \"unprecedented event\". \nDr Jenny Pyper, who was interim head of the civil service in December 2020, also gave evidence to the inquiry.\nDr Pyper, echoing previous evidence from Sir David Sterling, said she was \"living meetings through the media\" which hampered decision making. \nShe said this \"added to the public loss of confidence in decision making\".   \nDr Pyper also told the inquiry that when she left her role as interim head on 3 September 2021, she returned her work mobile phone and laptop. \nShe told the inquiry that she had since been informed the devices \"cannot be located.\"\nShe says she \"did not reset\" her work phone, however she did delete messages from a personal phone which she says \"were not related to government decision making or response to the pandemic\".

    "Nine fishermen left Peterhead on the boat Quiet Waters in March 1954. None of them came home.\nThe boat sank and their deaths devastated their families and shocked the north-east fishing community.\nAmong those on board was my grandfather Billy Buchan, who was 29 when he died. My mum was just a baby when she lost him.\nOn the 70th anniversary of the tragedy she was given flowers, evidence that our community still remembers an event which shook my town and left that little girl without her dad.\nQuiet Waters was only a few months old when she left Peterhead, bound for North Sea herring grounds nearly 200 miles (322km) away.\nAt the helm was skipper Thomas Stephen, 46, along with his brother William Stephen, 44, as mate.\nTheir sons, Robert, 18,  and George, 21, were also on board.\nPeter Stephen, 47, George Buchan, 44, James McBeath Mair, 50, and John Murray Coull, 30,  completed the crew with my grandfather Billy.\nWhen they failed to return, an SOS was sent out and a major search was launched.\nGeorge Buchan's daughter, May Robertson, now 86, was 16 at the time.\n\"I was a daddy's girl, I just loved my father,\" she says.\nMay remembers the moment she learned something was wrong.\n\"There was a paper shop. I'm standing waiting, and there's a man next to me. He says: 'They're out looking for the boat'.\n\"I turned around and said to him: 'Excuse me, that's not the Quiet Waters you're speaking about?' He says yes.\n\"You know this, I don't know how I got across the road yet. I just burst out greetin'.\"\nLocal fishermen - friends of those missing - led the extensive search.\nIt was an anxious wait for those at home, according to May.\n\"We stood at the window, looking for the boats coming in,\" she says.\n\"There was always the thought 'they'll get them'.\"\nWhen wreckage was pulled from the water, 190 miles (306km) east of Peterhead, it confirmed the community's worst fears.\nAmong the discoveries was part of the wooden wheelhouse, and a fish box bearing the boat's name.\nMay says: \"They got wreckage. And that was it.\n\"My mother was never the same.\"\nDavid Stephen, 79, was just nine when he lost his father, brother, uncle and cousin in the tragedy.\n\"My brother Tom and my cousin Kenzi and myself were put up to stay with auntie Ruth,\" he says. \n\"We were there three weeks. The day that we were taken back to the house, there were people in the close, there were people standing in the stairways.\n\"When we went in to see where my mum was, there was a room full of fishermen. All tough, hard, fishermen.\n\"The thing that struck me then, and has lived with me ever since, there wasn't one word being spoken. But there were plenty tears.\"\n\"Tom and me sat down, and I can remember Tom saying: 'Never mind mum, we'll work for you'.\n\"My mother did say, many times, that if Tom and me hadn't been there, she would've just laid down and died.\n\"It took me years to pluck up the courage and say to her: 'Mother, when did you come to terms with losing father and Robert?'.\n\"She said: 'David, I got peace in my heart when I stopped asking why'.\"\nFor the wives and families left behind, life was hard.\nMy grandmother, Nellie, became a widow at 23. My mum, May, was just three months old.\nMay says: \"Times were rough. There was very little money, no insurance that she could turn to that would help her fend for her and me.\n\"Once she got her strength up, she really just had to go out and work.\"\n\"In the immediate aftermath, she was very very ill. Her whole body broke out in a skin disease which weakened her.\n\"You know she talked very very little about the tragedy. It wasn't something that was every brought up in the home. I think she just wanted to make a life for me and her.\n\"She was my mum and my dad. She sacrificed so much for me and wanted to give me the best chance possible,\" she says.\n\"The one thing that sticks out in my mind is the day I graduated.\n\"She just stood and looked at me. I just felt she was thinking 'I've managed, I've done my part - now it's up to you'.\"\nWe will never know exactly what happened to Quiet Waters, or how the men on board met their fate.\nThere were no bodies to bury, no gravesides for grieving.\nSadly, other fishing communities have similar tales of loss.\nAs much as this is a story about tragedy, hardship and unspoken grief, it is also about love, bravery and resilience.\nSeventy years on, the men of Quiet Waters are still remembered.\nAs are the women and children who picked up the pieces in the wake of the tragedy and did what they could to live their shattered lives to the full.",
    "A complaint has been filed against Russia at the UN, accusing the Russian air force of deliberately attacking a hospital in opposition-held northern Syria five years ago.\nIt is being brought by a Syrian man, backed by human rights groups, whose relatives were killed in the attack.\nRussia launched an air campaign in support of Syria's government in 2015 that helped turn the tide of civil war.\nIt has repeatedly denied that Russian forces have deliberately targeted hospitals.\nThe UN\u2019s own investigation into the conflict has documented widespread possible war crimes, including indiscriminate bombing by Russian and Syrian forces.\nBut so far, apart from a handful of cases in Europe against Syrian asylum seekers alleged to be former members of the Syrian military or its intelligence services, there has been little accountability.\nThe particular case brought at the United Nations Human Rights Committee in Geneva relates to the bombing of Kafranbel Surgical Hospital in Idlib province on 5 May 2019.\nA little-known clause in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights - to which Russia is a party - allows individual citizens to bring cases.\nDetailed evidence presented to the UN committee suggests the hospital, which was busy that day, was bombed four times in the space of 20 minutes.\nDuring this time flight spotters in the area, the evidence claims, saw a Russian fighter jet taking off from Russia\u2019s Hmeimim airbase, 60km (37 miles) to the west.\nThe evidence also includes an alleged audio recording of the pilot\u2019s communication with Russian ground control, confirming targets had been successfully hit. The times of the communications match those of the strikes captured on video by people on the ground in Kafranbel.\nTwo brothers at the hospital, the cousins of the Syrian man who has brought the case to the UN, were killed.\nThe deliberate targeting of a medical facility is, under international law, a war crime. Human rights experts say such attacked have regularly occurred during the Syrian civil war and other conflicts. \nThree other Syrian hospitals were reportedly hit by Russian planes on the same day in May 2019.\nHealth facilities have also come under in Ukraine, Sudan, and Gaza.\nThe Open Society Justice Initiative, the organisation backing the complaint, believes it is significant because, it says, \u201cit is the first time Russia is held to account\u2026 over violations committed in Syria\u201d.\nBut the UN Human Rights Committee, although it can hear cases like this one brought by individuals, cannot prosecute. That is the job of the International Criminal Court (ICC).\nNeither Russia nor Syria are parties to the ICC. Though the UN Security Council, the only body which can refer them to the court, has repeatedly been asked to act, Russia has vetoed attempts to prosecute violations in Syria.\nWhat the committee\u2019s 18 members elected by UN member states can do is issue a decision on whether the attack on Kafranbel hospital was a violation of international law.\nIt can also issue Russia with recommendations on how to ensure accountability, including launching a criminal investigation, or paying compensation to victims.\nHuman rights groups point out that in many cases of war crimes or crimes against humanity, the perpetrators are never brought before a formal court. But they say recognition, by a body like the UN committee, that violations have taken place, is at least some measure of justice.\nAnd if this complaint is upheld it could, rights groups argue, serve as a form of deterrence for future attacks on medical facilities.",
    "A head teacher asked a teenage girl about her sex life and said men would be \"all over her\", a court has heard.\nNeil Foden, from Old Colwyn, Conwy County, allegedly preyed on five girls over four years.\nThe 66-year-old was head of Ysgol Friars, in Bangor, and strategic head of Ysgol Dyffryn Nantlle secondary school in Gwynedd.\nHe denies 20 charges, including 13 of sexual activity with a child.\nOn Thursday, a jury at Mold Crown Court watched a video interview with a teenager who described how he touched her legs, waist and bottom, and asked her about her sex life.\nThe girl, known as Child D, said she met Mr Foden between 15 and 20 times, during which he was \"flirty\" and asked her personal questions.\nThey included him asking what sexual things she did with her boyfriend, and she said Mr Foden sometimes locked the door to the room they were in.\nIn the interview she described how he would rub her legs and shoulders and tell her she was \"an attractive young woman\" and that \"men would be all over her\".\nShe said this \"weirded her out\".\nChild D also detailed one occasion when she was \"upset and crying\" and Mr Foden held her tightly, \"restraining her\".\n\"I couldn't go anywhere,\" she said. \"He was breathing down my neck, putting his lips on my neck, pressing hard and breathing all around my ear.\" \nShe went on to describe how Mr Foden rubbed his hands over her bottom, up under her skirt and on her legs. \n\"I tried to duck under his arms and was crying and shaking,\" she said.\n\"I walked home and was really freaking out.\"\nThe girl said she told her boyfriend and he tried to convince her to tell her family, but she did not report anything until after Mr Foden was arrested last September. \nChild D also said another girl, known as Child A, told her she was in a relationship with a much older man, who she later said was Mr Foden.\nShe said Child A told her that they would go on drives, where he would carry out sexual acts on her.\nChild D added that Child A had also told her Mr Foden had \"masturbated\" on a FaceTime call, and had shown her a screenshot of it. \nDuncan Bould, defending Mr Foden, asked Child D whether it was correct she had refused a request from police \"if they could download the contents of your phone\".\n\"Yes. I said no,\" she replied. \nMr Bould added: \"I suggest you've made up these allegations\" before disputing that a door was ever locked by Mr Foden when he was in a room with her.\nThe trial continues.

    "The US has accused Russia of deploying chemical weapons as a \"method of warfare\" in Ukraine, in violation of international laws banning their use.\nState department officials said Russia used the choking agent chloropicrin to win \"battlefield gains\" over Ukraine. \nThe allegations, which US officials said were not an \"isolated\" incident, would contravene the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which Russia signed.\nThe Kremlin rejected the accusations, calling them \"baseless\". \nSpokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow that Russia stood by its obligations under the CWC, which prohibits states from developing or acquiring new weapons. Some 193 states have ratified the convention. \nThe Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), a global watchdog that oversees implementation of the CWC, says a chemical weapon is a substance used to cause intentional death or harm through its toxic properties.\nChloropicrin - which the US says Russia has used to \"dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions\" - is an oily substance which was widely used during World War One. It causes irritation of the lungs, eyes and skin and can cause vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea, according to the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC). \nThe chemical's use in war is expressly banned under the CWC, and is listed as a choking agent by the OPCW. \nThe state department also said Moscow had regularly used \"riot control agents,\" or tear gas, during the war. \nPresident Joe Biden has previously warned Russia against deploying chemical weapons in Ukraine. In March 2022, weeks after Moscow launched its invasion, Mr Biden vowed that President Vladimir Putin would pay a \"severe price\" if he did authorise the use of chemical weapons. \n\"We would respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use,\" Mr Biden said.\nBut there have been consistent reports that Moscow has ignored that warning. US Assistant Secretary for Arms Control Mallory Stewart has previously said Russia was using riot control agents in the conflict.\nAnd Ukraine says its troops have faced mounting chemical attacks in recent months. The Reuters news agency reported earlier this year that Russian forces had used grenades loaded with CS and CN tear gases. \nThe report added that at least 500 Ukrainian soldiers have been treated for exposure to toxic gases, and that one had died after suffocating on tear gas. \nThree Russian bodies linked to the country's biological and chemical weapons programme were sanctioned by the state department for their links to the production of chemical agents. Other firms that contributed to the government entities were also sanctioned. \nIn 2017, the OPCW said Russia had destroyed the last of its Cold War-era stockpile of the weapons, as required under the CWC. \nBut Moscow has since been accused of making incomplete declarations of its stockpile, according to the UK's House of Commons library.\nSince 2017, Russia has been accused of at least two chemical attacks - the Salisbury attack on a former Soviet intelligence officer and the 2020 poisoning of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. \nThe allegations come as part of a broader tranche of US sanctions which targeted 30 individuals, including three people officials say were involved in Navalny's death.\nThe men are all officials at the Siberian prison colony where the opposition activist died earlier this year. Russia denies involvement in the opposition leader's death. Navalny's widow has accused President Putin of killing him.\nMeanwhile, Russian forces in eastern Ukraine have continued their steady advance ahead of Victory Day celebrations on 9 May - the holiday commemorating Soviet victory in World War Two. \nMuch of the fighting has been taking place around Chasiv Yar, a Kyiv-controlled stronghold which Russia has been trying to reach after seizing the city of Avdiivka. It is thought Moscow wants to seize the town ahead of next week's celebrations. \nIt comes as President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed the head of Ukraine's Security Service's (SBU) cyber-security department, Illya Vityuk, amid allegations that he tried to use his position to punish a Ukrainian journalist who had reported on allegations of corruption against him. \nThe reporter was subsequently summoned to a military recruitment centre, prompting military chief Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi to launch an investigation. \nElsewhere, Human Rights Watch - a non-governmental organisation - has called for a war crimes investigation after it unearthed evidence that Russian forces executed over a dozen surrendering Ukrainian troops. The events allegedly occurred between December 2023 and February 2024, the body said in a statement. ",
    "TikTok will restore millions of songs to the platform after settling a dispute with Universal Music Group over royalties.\nIt means users will once again be able to make videos featuring songs from artists including Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande.\nA row over how much TikTok was paying saw the two companies trade accusations - and Universal withdraw some of the world's most famous singers.\nBut the rift now appears to have been healed with the firms announcing \"improved remuneration\" for artists, though they have not revealed how much money will change hands.\nIn an email to staff seen by the BBC, Universal's boss Sir Lucian Grainge said TikTok had agreed to \"key changes.\"\n\"Under the new agreement, artist and songwriter compensation will be greater than under our prior TikTok deal,\" he wrote. \nThe firms said they were \"working expeditiously\" to return Universal's music to TikTok, a process it is understood will take less than two weeks.\nThis will include restoring the audio to videos which were previously muted during the dispute.\nTaylor Swift, perhaps the label's biggest artist, had already separately agreed to return her music to TikTok - a deal she could make as she owns the copyright to her songs\n\"Music is an integral part of the TikTok ecosystem and we are pleased to have found a path forward with Universal Music Group,\" said TikTok head Shou Zi Chew.\nIt comes as the social media platform is facing a fight for its very survival in the United States, where it plans to challenge in court a law that could result in it being sold or banned in the country.\nTwo of the biggest stars returning to the platform are Drake and The Weeknd, who found themselves in the middle of a row over artificial intelligence (AI) in 2023.\nA song that used the tech to clone their voices went viral on TikTok, picking up 15 million views before it was removed.\nAt the time, Universal Music Group said it violated copyright law.\nThe deal that will see the two acts return will also build in what the companies are calling \"industry-leading protections\" around AI on TikTok.\nTikTok and Universal said in a statement that they would work together to \"protect human artistry\" in the face of the tech. \n\"TikTok is also committed to working with [Universal] to remove unauthorized AI-generated music from the platform, as well as tools to improve artist and songwriter attribution,\" they said.\nSir Lucian said the deal meant \"fake artist\" AI songs could be removed.\n\"TikTok has now addressed the primary concern we expressed in our open letter that AI generated content would massively dilute the royalty pool for human artists,\" he said.  \nThe platform had also made commitments over the training of AI on music without consent, he said, and he thanked musicians for supporting Universal's action. \n\"We will work together to make sure that AI tools are developed responsibly to enable a new era of musical creativity and fan engagement while protecting human creativity,\" said TikTok head of music business development Ole Obermann.\nPreviously, artists including Eilish and Nicki Minaj have called on tech firms to agree to not develop tools that can generate music using AI. \nIt remains to be seen whether the commitments the two firms have made will fully address those concerns.",
    "A Lincolnshire beekeeper said he was devastated after most of his bees starved to death.\nJohn Murray, who lives in a village near Spalding, has lost four of his five hives.\nMr Murray said the cold and wet April had left the bees unable to collect pollen, leaving them weak after the winter.\n\"We've had an elongated wet spell and they've just starved,\" he said.\nHe urged people to help by putting out shallow bowls of sugared water to allow bees to feed.\nHe added: \"Once a bee gets wet it dies. A lot of people want to help but we need more.\"\nMr Murray said he was concerned that bad weather along with pesticides used in farming was causing problems for the future.\nThe government recently approved the use of neonicotinoids which are toxic to pollinating bees, disrupting their ability to navigate and reproduce. \nIt was previously banned, but reintroduced following an outbreak of a virus in sugar beets.\n\"There is a delicate balance from insects to humans,\" Mr Murray added. \n\"If you take away the groundwork of the pollinator. \n\"We are wiping out the very creature that provides food for us through pollination\"\nThe government's National Bee Unit has put out a bulletin to beekeepers.

    "The UK economy will see the slowest growth of the largest developed nations next year, according to forecasts. \nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) predicted that UK gross domestic product - a key measure of economic health - will rise by 1% in 2025.\nThis is below the rest of the G7 nations, which include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US.\nThe OECD, which is a globally recognised think tank, said the UK economy would be \u201csluggish\u201d this year.\nThe organisation blamed the after-effects of a succession of interest rate rises in the UK for the lethargic performance.   \nIt also warned that some elements of inflation remained high and that uncertainty over when the Bank of England might change interest rates might put people off investing.\nThe UK economy is now forecast to expand by 0.4% this year, a downgrade from the OECD's previous projection for 0.7% growth.\nIt means that for this year only Germany will see slower growth, it said.\n\nThe OECD predicted that tax receipts in the UK would \"keep rising to historic highs\" of about 37% of GDP\". \nThe government has cut National Insurance twice since last year, totalling a 4% reduction. But the OECD said this \"only partially offsets the ongoing fiscal drag from frozen personal income tax thresholds\".\nFiscal drag means that as a person's salary rises, they can move into a higher income tax bracket.\nThe organisation also said that a government scheme to allow businesses to deduct the full cost of investing in machinery and equipment from their tax bill does \"less than fully compensate\" for an increase in corporation tax which rose from 19% to 25% this time last year. \nBut the OECD said that in the long-run these measures, as well as the government's free childcare scheme, \"could help to lower fiscal pressure\".\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt said the OECD's forecast showed the UK was \"winning the war\" against inflation.\n\"This forecast is not particularly surprising given our priority for the last year has been to tackle inflation with higher interest rates\", he wrote, adding that  \"growth matters\".\nBut Darren Jones, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"Today\u2019s news that growth has been downgraded again reminds the British people what they already know: after 14 years of failure, the Conservatives cannot fix the economy because they are the reason it is broken.\"\nMeanwhile, the Liberal Democrats accused the government of being \"economically illiterate\".\n\"Their no-growth policies have left the public enduring sky-high mortgage rates, the price of a weekly shop going through the roof, and stealth taxes hammering both pensioners and working people,\" said Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, Sarah Olney.\nThe Bank of England, which is independent from the government, sets interest rates and has a target to keep inflation at or close to 2%. \nInflation - which measures the pace of price rises - has slowed significantly from a 40-year high it reached in October 2022 to 3.2% in April. \nInterest rates have been held at 5.25% since last September. The OECD expects the Bank to start cutting borrowing costs from this autumn. \nThe think tank predicted that interest rates could fall to 3.75% by the end of next year.\nThe forecasts aim to give a guide to what is most likely to happen in the future, but can be incorrect and do change.\nThey are used by businesses to help plan investments, and by governments to guide policy decisions.\n",
    "\"Most organs come from patients who have had quite a sudden and tragic event... something like a very large stroke, or a big heart attack, or a traumatic event.\"\nFormer intensive care nurse Matt Collis specialises in talking to the families of such patients, delicately broaching the subject of whether they want their loved ones' organs to be given to others.\nThe stark reality is that less than 1% of people who die in the UK do so in circumstances which allow them to donate their organs.\nA long illness means the whole body is weakened, and a death outside of hospital means organs quickly deteriorate.\nVirtually all donors end their lives in intensive care units.\nI ask Matt how potential donors' families first react when he approaches them.\n\"Normally it\u2019s shock and it\u2019s not something they\u2019ve considered,\" he says, \"but most of the time once we sit down and explain the benefits of organ donation... most agree.\"\nIn the UK there are strict ethical guidelines on donation.\nThe patient will be treated by their own medical team until their death. Only then will the retrieval team, which saves their organs, see them.\nConsultant Vipin Mehta heads the retrieval team at the Wythenshawe Transplant Centre in Manchester, one of only six such units in the country.\n\"It\u2019s very emotionally draining in the beginning, especially when you start doing the retrieval process and you see what the donor has gone through,\" says Mr Mehta.\n\"So now we always have a moment of silence before we start the retrieval process.\"\nEvery transplant patient is acutely aware that their chance of survival is dependent on someone else\u2019s life ending.\nWythenshawe has a team of psychologists who help recipients come to terms with this.\n\"A big one is thinking about 'survivor guilt' for example, and I think that can be a real pressure for people after transplant,\" says consultant clinical psychologist Dr Zoey Malpas.\n\"They feel this overwhelming urge that they should be doing something amazing with their life. Actually people are really fearful that they\u2019ve got this precious organ and they don't want to do anything that\u2019ll risk it.\"\nThe centre also runs a monthly group, the Transplant Caf\u00e9,  for pre- and post-transplant patients to talk about any issues. \nPatients are also encouraged to write an anonymous letter of thanks, which is given to the donor\u2019s family by the centre.\nGary Lee received a heart transplant five years ago.\n\"I was literally dying\" he remembers. \"My organs kept shutting down.\"\nGary, like everyone I speak to, says he often thinks about the person who allowed him to live.\nAs a way of expressing his gratitude he says whenever he and his wife go abroad or away anywhere, \"we always look for a church and we always light candles for our donors and donor families everywhere we go\".\nDeborah Horrocks had a heart transplant in 2020.\n\"I\u2019m just so grateful that it happened - it gave me a second chance,\" she says.\n\"Both of my children got married last year and I\u2019ve got a grandson, and all this I wouldn\u2019t have been able to see...\"\nDeborah pauses, temporarily unable to speak, before continuing: \"Because I wouldn\u2019t have been here.\"\nIn the eyes of the law, every patient is a potential organ donor, unless they\u2019ve opted out.\nIn practice, though, families have to give their consent.\nAnd many just don\u2019t know what their relative would have wanted.\nMatt Collis says the situation is made far easier when someone has registered a decision to donate on the organ register, even though it is no longer a requirement.\n\"In my experience, that makes it very clear for families to understand that this is what their loved one wanted, and that I am there to help them with that,\" he says.\nMatt keeps in touch with donor families for several months afterwards, sometimes even longer.  \nOnce a year a special ceremony is held for every family to celebrate their loved one\u2019s life.\n\"These patients are so special and they have such an impact on transplant recipients,\" Matt says.\n\"I find that the families that I still speak to a year, two years down the line, they say that organ donation has really helped them. Because the death wasn\u2019t for nothing.\u201d\nI say to Matt that he obviously finds his job very rewarding.\nHe smiles and says: \"The families that donate are just wonderful.\n\"I find it amazing that in their time of grief and a time when their world has ended that they are willing and able to help other people.\"",
    "A recovering gambling addict has claimed bookmakers are not doing enough to stop people from betting excessively.\nHarj Gahley, from Slough, Berkshire, started gambling when he was 23 and said his problem \"spiralled out of control and nearly destroyed my life\".\nHe compared bookmakers' duty of care to that of a bartender being obliged to stop serving a heavily drinking customer from becoming too intoxicated. \nThe Gambling Commission, the industry's regulator, said protecting customers was \"at the heart of what we do\".\nIt comes after another Berkshire  gambling addict claimed he was allowed to spend \u00a3100,000 at a bookmakers before staff intervened.\nMr Gahley told BBC's Rena Annobil  he vividly remembered walking into a casino with friends after a night out in Birmingham and the thrill of turning \u00a320 into \u00a360 after playing blackjack. \nHe said after that he started going to the casino every week. \n\"Then twice a week, then it was three times a week and eventually it was every day - and then it wasn\u2019t just blackjack, it was roulette tables and slots,\" he said. \n\u201cThen I started gambling at my local bookmakers on horses, dogs and football as it was closer to home which meant less travelling and more money to spend on gambling.\"\nMr Gahley said: \u201c[Bookmakers] don\u2019t do enough in terms of stopping that person.\n\u201cIf you were an alcoholic in a bar and you\u2019d had too much to drink, the barman would say 'that\u2019s enough, no more for you'.\n\u201cThey would step in, you can\u2019t get another drink and they kick you out of the premises.\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t bookmakers doing the same?\"\nHe said he felt like he could not talk to anyone about his addiction - but his wife grew suspicious and began to query where all their money was going. \nHe described how on one day he found his pregnant wife \"balling her eyes out\" as he continued his destructive habit. \n\u201cI told her the truth about the gambling and the debt -  it took away the guilt from lying but it was followed by a massive amount of shame,\" he said. \n\u201cI was so deluded and selfish that I didn\u2019t understand the consequences to the people around me. \n\u201cI also felt that as a Sikh, the Asian culture got in the way of my recovery as gambling is considered very taboo, if not a sin.\"\nMr Gahley eventually sought out help and was able to use cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to overcome his addiction. \nMore than 28,000 people have been supported by interventions through National Gambling Helpline.\nThe Gambling Commission said: \"Protecting consumers is at the heart of what we do as a regulator and... we announced changes which will reduce the intensity of online games, improve consumer choice over receiving gambling marketing, introduce light-touch financial vulnerability checks and tighten processes to support age verification checks in premises.\"\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "Israeli officials are increasingly concerned that the International Criminal Court (ICC) is planning to seek arrest warrants for their military and political leaders on suspicion of war crimes. \nReports suggest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be among them.\nThe ICC, based in The Hague, has been investigating Israel's actions in the occupied territories for the past three years - and more recently the actions of Hamas as well. It has the power to charge and try individuals for the most serious crimes under international law.\nIt has previously issued arrest warrants for leaders including Russia's Vladimir Putin, Muammar Gaddafi of Libya, and Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony.\nMr Netanyahu has called the prospect of senior Israel figures joining the wanted list \"an outrage of historic proportions\", accusing the ICC of attempting to paralyse Israel's ability to defend itself.\nBut the fact that he's chosen to make such strident public comments suggests that, behind the scenes, such a scenario is being actively discussed. \nWhile the ICC has not confirmed the Israeli claims, when Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan KC visited Israel and the occupied West Bank last December his message was a clear one. \nThe British barrister toured the sites of Hamas' attacks in Israeli villages close to the Gaza fence, which Hamas-led gunmen burst through on 7 October.\nHe also met political leaders, and travelled to Ramallah to speak to the families of Palestinian victims about their experiences in Gaza and the West Bank. He condemned the violence suffered by civilians on both sides, and promised to investigate. \n\"All actors must comply with international humanitarian law,\" he clarified in a statement at the time. \"If you do not do so, do not complain when my office is required to act.\"\nMr Khan said the 7 October attacks - in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies - represented \"some of the most serious international crimes that shock the conscience of humanity, crimes which the ICC was established to address\".\nIn Israel's case, his concerns were twofold. He stressed the obligation to conduct its military operation in Gaza according to \"clear legal parameters that govern armed conflict\". \nIsrael has been accused of failing to sufficiently protect civilians during its months-long bombardment, although it insists it takes all necessary measures to avoid casualties. The Hamas-run health ministry in the territory says more than 34,500 people have been killed there since the war began, and that many of that number are children.\nMr Khan also underlined the need for humanitarian aid to get into Gaza, with access to food, water and medical supplies a basic right for civilians \"without further delay, and at pace and at scale\". He also urged Hamas not to divert or misuse the supplies when they did arrive, after accusations by Israel that its members were looting trucks and stealing aid, stopping it from reaching the wider population.\nIsrael isn't a member of the ICC and it says the court has no jurisdiction over it. But the court has ruled that since 2015 it does in fact have jurisdiction over the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza after the Palestinians ratified its founding treaty, the Rome Statute, as the State of Palestine. \nNo Western-style democracy has had an ICC arrest warrant issued for its leader before. If it happens to Mr Netanyahu, he'll be the first. Israelis have particular concerns about the stigma and potential isolation that would come with it.\nMichael Oren was Israel's ambassador to the United States between 2009 and 2013. He points to the recent case brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which accused Israel of genocide against the Palestinian population in Gaza - an accusation Israel vehemently rejects.\nIn January, the court issued an interim ruling that ordered Israel to take steps to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza, but stopped short of telling it to stop its military offensive.\n\"Israel emerged from those proceedings relatively unscathed, but the fact that the proceedings were held at all meant that Israel had lost the battle,\" he told the BBC.\n\"They should not have been held at all, and certainly it's a blow to our international standing and our security. Because a country whose leaders are accused of presiding over war crimes, that country is more vulnerable than a country that isn't.\"\nSir Geoffrey Nice KC, another British barrister, led the prosecution of the former Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic for war crimes at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).\nHe points out that the actions of both sides in this conflict are within the ICC's focus. \n\"Any investigation will not just be the Israeli Defense Forces and political and military leadership but also Hamas,\" he told the BBC. \n\"It's to be hoped that alleged Hamas fighters and leaders are not all shot on sight, that they are d",
    "A hydroelectric dam has collapsed in southern Brazil after days of heavy rains that triggered massive flooding, killing more than 30 people. \nOfficials say another 60 people are missing in Rio Grande do Sul state.\nAbout 15,000 residents have fled their homes since Saturday.

    "A teenager who died after a crash on the A5 in Omagh, County Tyrone, has been described as a \"great athlete\", by the principal of his old school.\nJamie Moore been named as one of the victims of the crash on Tuesday by Christos Gaitatzis, principal of Omagh High School.\nKamile Vaicikonyte, who was 17, was previously named as the other victim.\nBoth died at the scene on the Doogary Road at about 21:50 BST, police said.\nIn a statement, Mr Gaitatzis described Mr Moore, who was 19, as \"a pleasant young man\", who \"always tried to help the pupils and staff around him\".\n\"He showed genuine kindness to others and he engaged positively with many school events offering his time to give a helping hand to the school community and beyond,\" he said.\nMr Moore joined Omagh High School in 2016 and completed his GCSE's, leaving school in 2021.\nMr Gaitatzis said he was \"a great athlete and he demonstrated his athletic skills very well in our sports days\". \nHe was also described as a \"good footballer\" who \"helped the school to win in the football pitch\".\nMr Gaitatzis added that the school community was \"devastated with the news\".\n\"We want to extend our thoughts and prayers to Jamie's family for their loss such a kind young man.\n\"He will be remembered fondly for his kindness and pleasant manner.\"\nThe other victim, Kamile Vaicikonyte, was a pupil at St Ciaran's College in County Tyrone.\n\"Kamile was a lovely girl, she had a lovely smile,\" her principal, Paul Lavery told BBC News NI. \"There's a big cloud over the school today.\"\nThe headmaster added that on the day before the fatal crash, Kamile had taken part in demonstration at her school to remember people who have died on the A5.\nSt Ciaran's College in Ballygawley was supporting a campaign calling for safety upgrades to the route. \n\"It's just awful to think that 24 hours later she has lost her life on the same road,\" Mr Lavery said, adding that had \"heightened the tragedy\". \nStormont's Infrastructure Minister John O'Dowd has offered his \"heartfelt condolences\" to the families.\nHe is to meet police to discuss \"serious road safety concerns\" on the A5.\nThe principal also offered his \"heartfelt sympathy\" to Kamile's family and friends, saying people connected to the Ballygawley school were \"really distraught about what has happened\". \n\"Of course we're all extremely shocked and continue to be shocked and saddened,\" Mr Lavery said.\n\"There's a big cloud over the school today, but I would like to thank the community for all their support, and everyone who has tried to help us in this very, very difficult time.\"\nHe described Kamile as a quiet pupil but added that \"once the teachers got to know her she was very bubbly and just loved having fun and particularly enjoyed having fun with her friends\". \n\"She was a very important part of our school community, someone who had talked about her hopes and dreams for the future, which included going to university.\n\"I know she had done a placement in one of our local primary schools, so she may have been considering doing teaching in the future as well.\"\nThe principal also thanked the Education Authority's critical team \"who have come out very quickly and helped to support our pupils\". \nMr Lavery said his school has been \"very much impacted by road traffic accidents\" and the latest deaths had brought back memories for many people in the area.\n\"You can't get to St Ciaran's really without using the A5,\" he explained, adding it was a source of ongoing concern for pupils and their parents.\nThe infrastructure minister said he hoped police would meet him \"in the coming days\". \nHe said he does not want to face more delays \"which could, in turn, lead to more tragedies\".\nMr O'Dowd said: \"If I don't get the decision right, then we're going to face more delays so my determination is to get this decision right\" he said.\nSpeaking at the NI Policing Board meeting on Thursday, Chief Constable Jon Boutcher said officers would be meeting Mr O'Dowd in June to \"discuss all proactive measures possible\" regarding the A5.\n\"We will very much meet the infrastructure minister and we will do anything and everything within our power to make sure, whether it's speed reduction or increased visibility, that we do our part in preventing these tragedies from occurring again,\" he said. \nMr Boutcher said a pressing issue in tackling the high number of road deaths was that they are working with fewer officers. \nHe said that 21 officers had been cut from the road safety team and they needed to be \"creative\" and work collaboratively with partner agencies in order to effectively tackle this. \n\"Nothing is off the table to address this epidemic on our roads,\" Jon Boutcher said. \nMore than 50 people have been killed on the road since 2006 with upgrade work hit by a series of delays and legal challenges.\nThe demonstration at St Ciaran's College in Ballygawley also called for work to start on the long-awaited upgrade of the road.\nAs part of Monday's event, the school released a video where pupi",
    "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has banned lab-grown meat, saying he will \"save our beef\" from the \"global elite\" and its \"authoritarian plans\". \n\"Florida is fighting back against the global elite's plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs,\" Mr DeSantis said in a statement. \nThe first-in-the-nation law prohibits anyone from selling or distributing lab-grown meat in Florida.\nSimilar efforts are under way in Alabama, Arizona and Tennessee. \nLab-grown or \"cultivated\" meat was first cleared for consumption in the US in 2022.\nThe process of making cultivated meat involves extracting cells from an animal, which are then fed with nutrients such as proteins, sugars and fats. The end product is genetically indistinguishable from traditionally produced meat. \nStudies have suggested that eating cultivated meat can cut carbon emissions and water usage, and free up land for nature, compared to eating traditionally produced meat. \nThe World Economic Forum, an international non-governmental organisation in Switzerland, has for years touted lab-grown meat as an efficient and environmentally-friendly way to produce food, and feed a rapidly growing global population. It has also promoted insect farming as a \"credible and alternative protein source\". \nLobbyists for edible insects have launched a campaign asking the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to add mealworms, crickets protein powder and other insect products to the agency's database of safe ingredients. \nThese unconventional food sources have become fodder for the US culture wars. Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene made headlines two years ago after she insinuated the government was monitoring whether Americans were eating fake meat grown in a petri dish. \nAt an event on Wednesday announcing the new law, Mr DeSantis said he was \"fighting against an ideology that ultimately wants to eliminate meat production in the US and around the globe\".  \n\"In the state of Florida we've put down the marker very clearly; we stand with agriculture. We stand with the cattle ranchers,\" he said. \nFlorida's commissioner of agriculture Wilton Simpson applauded the legislation as a \"tremendous step in the right direction\". \n\"Florida is taking a tremendous step in the right direction by signing first-in-the-nation legislation banning lab-grown meat,\" Mr Simpson said. \nBut the move was also supported by an unlikely supporter of Mr DeSantis, Senator John Fetterman, a Democrat from Pennsylvania. It \"pains me deeply\" to agree with Mr DeSantis, Mr Fetterman wrote on X, \"but I co-sign this\". \nGood Meat, a cultivated meat company which says it is the first in the world to sell lab-grown meat, wrote on X it was \"disappointed\" by the new Florida law. \n\"In a state that purportedly prides itself on being a land of freedom and individual liberty, its government is now telling consumers what meat they can or cannot purchase,\" it said.

    "Scandal, hush-money payments, secret recordings and Donald Trump's alleged gag order violations took centre stage during his tenth day in court.\nThe court heard testimony from Keith Davidson, a lawyer who brokered porn star Stormy Daniels' hush-money deal.\nQuestioning of Mr Davidson grew hostile, as the defence tried to paint him as a sleazy Hollywood profiteer.\nHe pushed back, alleging the defence had wrongly used words like \"extortion\" to describe valid legal settlements.\n\"We're both lawyers. I'm not here to play lawyer games with you,\" the ex-president's lawyer Emil Bove said on Thursday in a particularly heated moment during cross-examination. \nMr Bove unearthed several celebrity scandals that Mr Davidson allegedly was involved in keeping quiet, apparently in an effort to shake the witness' credibility. \nMr Trump's lawyer asked whether Mr Davidson had \"extracted sums of money\" from actor Charlie Sheen and if he worked with a \"sex-tape broker\" on the behalf of reality star Tila Tequila. There were also stories about actress Lindsay Lohan's visit to a rehabilitation facility and professional wrestler Hulk Hogan's sex tape.\nMr Davidson repeatedly maintained that the settlements he was involved in were fair and legitimate. He also regularly cited attorney-client privilege. \nProsecutors, meanwhile, had called Mr Davidson to connect Mr Trump, his ex-lawyer Michael Cohen, and the $130,000 hush-money payment he paid to Ms Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election. \nThe former president pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal the payment. He also has denied any sexual encounter with Ms Daniels.\nMr Davidson detailed how the payout to Ms Daniels was shaped. He was also involved in an earlier deal with the National Enquirer magazine to conceal Playboy model Karen McDougal's claim that she had a romantic affair with Mr Trump.\nBBC News reporters are in the Manhattan courtroom covering the historic first criminal trial of a former US president. You'll find their updates and analysis on the BBC news website and app, and across TV, radio and podcasts.\nThe lawyer, who is based in Beverly Hills, California, emphasised that he assumed Mr Trump was behind keeping Ms Daniels quiet in October 2016. Emails and text messages indicated that he and others believed the hush-money agreement with his former client helped Mr Trump win the presidency just a month later.\n\"What have we done?\" Mr Davidson texted National Enquirer editor-in-chief Dylan Howard as the results rolled in on election night. \nAsked to explain the message, Mr Davidson told the court: \"There was an understanding that our efforts may have in some way\u2026 our activities may have in some way assisted the presidential campaign of Donald Trump.\"\nDuring a second set of questions, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass played recordings of Mr Davidson and Cohen on the phone, \"surreptitiously recorded\" by Cohen.\nIn one recording, Cohen says that Mr Trump told him several times that he \"hate[s] the fact that we did it\". Mr Davidson testified that he was referencing Stormy Daniels' hush-money deal.\n\"But my comment to him is, 'but every person that we've spoken to told you it was the right move',\" Mr Cohen adds in the recording.\nProsecutors called Douglas Daus, who works in the high-tech analysis unit at the New York County District Attorney's Office, toward the end of the day.\nMr Daus told the court he analysed two phones owned by Mr Cohen, extracting the data and 39,745 contacts - more than 10 pages included various contact details for Mr Trump alone. \nMr Cohen is expected to testify soon, but it is unclear exactly when. \nJustice Juan Merchan's ruling also is expected after prosecutors and the defence debated on Thursday whether Mr Trump violated his gag order again. He has been fined $9,000 for previous infractions. ",
    "The small town of North Bend in Washington is famous for its mountain wildlife. Cougar and elk are often seen - bigfoot \"sightings\" are frequent.\nNow something wilder has moved in - a zebra that escaped with three others earlier this week on the way to a zoo.\nWhile locals quickly \"wrangled\" three, catching the fourth has proven to be anything but black and white.\nOfficials say the animal has moved into the Cascade Mountains - and efforts to catch it could take days.\nThe animals escaped from a trailer on Sunday while they were being moved to Montana.\nCurious bystanders, including brunch-goers and a professional rodeo clown passing through town, managed to corner three of the zebras within hours after they wandered into a horse paddock.\nBut one remains on the loose five days later, leading to a large response by local volunteers and officials, and an outpouring of memes and silly adverts by Seattle-area businesses.\nDallas Clark, a professional tow company owner and horse trainer in his spare time, has been helping lead the volunteer effort to track down the missing zebra.\nHe's part of a group that normally helps rescue stray animals loose in the mountains - often hikers' dogs, but also the occasional farm animal.\nThe female zebra who was initially incorrectly reported to be a male \"stallion\", has been spotted by dozens of people throughout the week, and was last seen on Thursday morning.\nIt has been returning to a feeding station that his group erected to try to lure in the runaway, but lately the presence of curious Pacific Northwest safari-goers has been scaring the zebra farther into the national forest, he says.\nTrail cameras confirm that it is eating and drinking and is generally healthy, despite temperatures that have dropped down to near-freezing at night, and the confirmed presence of a mountain lion in the area.\n\"We have been out in rain, shine, snow, thunder, lightning just to make sure we know how it's doing,\" says Mr Dallas, 28, adding that much of the search is being done on horseback in thick steep vegetation. \n\"None of us has ever done a zebra before so this is all new. But we're trying to treat it no different than we would any other animal that's lost in the woods,\" he says.\nMeanwhile, locals have gone wild with zebra jokes online, posting photos of chefs wearing zebra-print aprons, AI images of a Bigfoot riding zebra, and pictures of the town's local elk with fake zebra stripes.\nMr Glass is critical of the official response so far, and calls for government officials to close trails in the area to keep people from spooking the animal.\nResidents of the town where the 1990s cult classic Twin Peaks was filmed are now glued to Facebook for updates on the elusive creature.\nMr Glass says he's confident the zebra will eventually be caught, but only after rescuers can build up \"trust with it\" and after the public has given it time to \"mellow\".",
    "A Guernsey politician says a policy of tax relief for spare room renters can be achieved by the end of the year as a solution to the ongoing housing shortage. \nPolicy and Resources Vice President Heidi Soulsby has been pushing for the amendment after it was passed by The States in late 2022.\nMs Soulsby is now renewing her commitment to the postponed plans after a Policy and Resources (P&R) report into the idea due for completion last March, never materialised. \nShe said: \"There was real frustration for me because it was a quick win, so hopefully now I am back on P&R I can really try to move that forward.\n\"At the same time as being able to house people coming over here, it could also help when it comes to loneliness and supporting the more elderly on the island who have a spare room to let.\n\"Building houses can take an extortionate amount of time, but we could actually do something that could happen quickly and deal with the crisis we\u2019ve got right now.\"\nIt comes as an independent report into the housing situation in Guernsey highlighted tax breaks for live-in landlords as an opportunity to alleviate the burden on the overcrowded housing market.\nA similar scheme was introduced in Jersey this year, providing an income tax exemption  for those letting out a room in their home using a 'rent-a-room' arrangement.\nThe tax-free allowance there is capped at \u00a310,000 gross income per year.  \nMs Soulsby said: \"We don\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel - this has been done elsewhere and I think it is something we could do relatively easily.\n\"We know it is multi faceted - it\u2019s a complex market failure we are seeing here and there\u2019s different ways we can deal with it.\"\nShe continued: \u201cIt\u2019s clear we have a market failure here and that non intervention has been a major reason for it. \n\"If we are going to make any change here and we absolutely have to, there needs to be government intervention.\n\"I am hoping with that backup and the drive within the states now we can make it happen.\"\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "If you look at the fictional pop group in new film The Idea of You, they might remind you of one of the world's biggest boy bands. \nIn fact, they might sound a little familiar too. \nFictional band August Moon's lead single is catchy, fun and poppy - and more than slightly reminiscent of One Direction's What Makes You Beautiful.\nBut it's not plagiarism. It sounds similar because it's been produced by the same duo, Savan Kotecha and Carl Falk.\nKotecha had his big career break working on The X Factor, and was the one of the people responsible for What Makes You Beautiful, one of the biggest pop songs of the 2010s.\nHe then went on to write for some of the world's other biggest artists, including Ariana Grande and The Weeknd.\nBut for the past few years, he's been working in film, with credits including the 2019 Charlie's Angels reboot and Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga. \nSo he's come full circle by working on a film about boy bands. \nKotecha says he initially agreed to be on the movie because he loves rom-coms.\nAnd as he's worked with acts like Westlife and One Direction, he was able to share his opinions about the boy band experience with the film's production team. \n\"We spoke a little bit about the characters,\" Kotecha says, speaking from LA before a writing session. \"They wanted to know a lot about what these characters would be going through.\n\"Even before One Direction, I've done this so much with Westlife and a bunch of other boy bands.\n\"So I gave my two cents of what I felt the character would be going through, and what was authentic and what wasn't authentic to the experience, at least from my point of view.\"\nBut, despite the comparisons with 1D, the songwriter says it was only after August Moon's song came out that he recognised the similarities. \n\"It sounds so dumb and na\u00efve of me,\" he said. \"But I didn't think about it.\n\"We were like, 'Oh, this feels very 1975-ish' and then as soon as it was released, I started seeing people saying that [it was like What Makes You Beautiful]. I was like, 'Oh, yeah, of course'.\"\nThe film is based on a 2017 book of the same name by Robinne Lee. \nIt stars Anne Hathaway as Sol\u00e8ne, a 40-year-old single mum who falls for lead singer Hayes Campbell, played by Nicholas Galitzine, after they meet at the Coachella festival. \nIt's a kind of forbidden romance, as Sol\u00e8ne's teenage daughter is there to see August Moon, the band Hayes is in. \nSome publications, including GQ, have suggested the film is essentially based on Harry Styles fanfiction.\nBut when the author was asked by Vogue in 2020 if The Idea of You was based on Styles, she said the One Direction singer was only one of her inspirations, along with a bit of Prince Harry and Eddie Redmayne. \nDespite the similarities, Kotecha maintains August Moon weren't set up to copy One Direction.\n\"Everyone's going to think that we're making this up, but other than the fact that they're boy bands, we didn't really talk about One Direction at all in that process,\" he says. \n\"I think the comparison has become a social media thing more than like a real comparison when we were making it. \n\"And even talking to the lead actor Nicholas, that wasn't really a part of the conversation.\"\nThat's something Galitzine himself has repeated, telling Variety he wasn't seeking inspiration from Styles.\n\"It's funny because it's not a comparison I've ever made,\" he said. \"But people really like to make it.\n\"Hayes Campbell, the man I'm playing, is a very different character, and we want him to exist in his own world.\"\nOccasionally posting covers on social media with a guitar, it's perhaps not surprising that Galitzine - who's previously appeared in Red, White & Royal Blue - was cast as the boy band's lead singer.\nAnd Kotecha says he's got \"real singing chops\". \n\"He's obviously such a great actor, but I was really impressed with how good a singer he is,\" he adds.\n\"You'll see when you watch the movie and hear the rest of the songs, he's got a dynamic voice and can do a lot of different things with it.\"\nWithout spoiling it too much, Kotecha says the film's music follows the typical path of a boy band - early pop domination, then going a bit edgier, and solo careers.\n\"It was really thought through and all the music represents a trajectory of the boy band - like the first very poppy single, then up to the guy going solo,\" he says. \nAnd while they might have been able to imagine a boy band for the big screen, Kotecha jokes there isn't a magic recipe for a pop group's success in real life. \n\"It's lightning in a bottle,\" he says. \"They have to be charismatic, talented kids, and they have to have chemistry together. I don't think you can ever teach that. \n\"And then obviously, great songs too - and hopefully we did that with August Moon.\n\"But if it was something that was just a formula, we would do it all day every day.\"",

    "A government body set up to respond to national emergencies was severely understaffed just weeks before the country went into lockdown, the Covid Inquiry has heard.\nThe Civil Contingencies Hub was established to react to emergencies such as weather conditions.\nHowever it was employed to deal with a no-deal Brexit and the pandemic.\nChris Stewart, who worked for the Executive Office, gave evidence to the inquiry on Thursday.\nHe said that on 12 March 2020 there were four people working in the hub when there should have been at least 28.\nIn an email to the head of the civil service Mr Stewart said that the hub's only member of staff was \"on her knees\".\nMr Stewart, who acted as chief of staff for the hub, said it was understaffed due to resources and when posts fell vacant, they were not filled.  \nThe inquiry was shown another email from Ms Bernie Rooney, in which she said at this moment \"I'm a one person hub and all of the issues related to Covid-19 are moving at pace\".\nWhen probed further by the chair Baroness Hallett about the number of staff in the contingency hub, Mr Stewart said there were two in February and March.  \n\"It is unfortunate that we hadn't given enough thought to resilience at a senior level,\" he said.  \nThe inquiry heard that the Brexit team joined the hub on 14 March 2020 after the World Health Organization had declared a global pandemic on 11 March.\nMr Stewart said he accepted the point that that \"was very late in the day for having the sufficient planning resources\".\nHe said he would entirely agree with Sir David Sterling's statements at the inquiry on Wednesday that \"we were not as well prepared as we ought to have been\".\n\"We ought not to have been 18 months behind in our planning for an influenza pandemic,\" he said. \nHe told the inquiry that they \"got to where we got by mid-March by extremely hard work by a small and under-resourced team over a very short period\".\nHe said that was not a \"satisfactory position to be in\" and said it was not a position that he would seek to defend.\n\"We ought not to have been in that position. We ought to have been better prepared,\" he said. \nMr Stewart told the inquiry that it would have taken considerable time, effort and resources on the part of the Civil Contingencies Board and within all government departments to get to the point of being ready for a pandemic. \nMr Stewart said he agreed with Sir David Sterling's evidence on Wednesday that Northern Ireland had activated the contingency plan at the right time.\nHowever he said that, like Sir David would also accept if at the end of the inquiry it \"concluded that wasn't the case\".  \nRegarding the introduction of regulations that were imposed in Northern Ireland, the inquiry heard that ministers only had hours to pull them together before they were \"made\".\nMr Stewart said it was a most \"intense time of engagement\" involving mainly the first minister, deputy first minister, the health minister and the Department of Justice.  \nIn further evidence, the inquiry heard that before the pandemic outbreak there had been a considerable loss of experienced staff within the Public Health Agency.\nIn her evidence Dr Joanne McClean, who is the current director of Public Health, agreed the \"situation had deteriorated\". She said she had been a junior member of staff during the swine flu outbreak in 2009 but those with most experience had left or retired. \nShe said the PHA was not prepared in a number of ways but that was the case across the world because it was such an \"unprecedented event\". \nDr Jenny Pyper, who was interim head of the civil service in December 2020, also gave evidence to the inquiry.\nDr Pyper, echoing previous evidence from Sir David Sterling, said she was \"living meetings through the media\" which hampered decision making. \nShe said this \"added to the public loss of confidence in decision making\".   \nDr Pyper also told the inquiry that when she left her role as interim head on 3 September 2021, she returned her work mobile phone and laptop. \nShe told the inquiry that she had since been informed the devices \"cannot be located.\"\nShe says she \"did not reset\" her work phone, however she did delete messages from a personal phone which she says \"were not related to government decision making or response to the pandemic\".

    "A \"vicious loan shark\" kidnapped one of his victims by forcing him into the boot of a car and driving him to a cashpoint to withdraw money, a court heard.\nRichard Dawson, 35, from Barnsley, received \u00a352,000 in repayments from 88 customers he had illegally lent money. \nHe was jailed for seven years at Sheffield Crown Court on Thursday after admitting kidnap, grievous bodily harm and illegal moneylending.\nSean Fritchley, mitigating, said Dawson's actions sounded like \"something from The Sopranos\" but that his client was \"ashamed\".\nTwo victims went to the police about Dawson after they became trapped in a \"cycle of debt\" with him. \nOn one occasion a male victim had his jaw broken by Dawson, as he was unable to make a repayment.\nProsecutor Simon Mortimer told the court how the victim had been forced into a car boot and driven to an ATM.\n\"This became common practice,\" he added.\nIn initial police interviews, the victim would not speak out against Dawson as he was \"fearful for his life\".\nMr Fritchley, for father-of-three Dawson, said his client was \"thoroughly ashamed of his actions\".\n\"He will do his time in a decent manner.\n\"He wants to get his head down and get back to his children.\" \nThe barrister said the kidnapping \"sounds like something from The Sopranos\", the 1990s TV show based on an Italian-American mafia head based in New Jersey.\nHe added: \"We accept it was a kidnap.\n\"He would tell him to get into the boot and he did so out of fear.\"\nHowever, the kidnappings were \"short-lived\" and did not include asking for funds for his release, Mr Fritchley said.\n\"It was more like a humiliation than anything else,\" he added.\n\nThe court was told bank accounts associated with Dawson, of Hill End Close, Barnsley, received more than \u00a350,000 in payments.\nHowever, judge Mr Recorder Langdale said: \"Those paying money into bank accounts were in the minority.\n\"The true cash profit will never be known.\" \nFollowing the sentencing, Tony Quigley, head of the England Illegal Money Lending Team at Stop Loan Sharks, said: \u201cThis man is a ruthless and cruel individual who deliberately targeted the most vulnerable people in the community, taking everything they had and leaving them with nothing. \n\"He knew they couldn\u2019t fight back and took advantage of that.\"",
    "A Guernsey politician says a policy of tax relief for spare room renters can be achieved by the end of the year as a solution to the ongoing housing shortage. \nPolicy and Resources Vice President Heidi Soulsby has been pushing for the amendment after it was passed by The States in late 2022.\nMs Soulsby is now renewing her commitment to the postponed plans after a Policy and Resources (P&R) report into the idea due for completion last March, never materialised. \nShe said: \"There was real frustration for me because it was a quick win, so hopefully now I am back on P&R I can really try to move that forward.\n\"At the same time as being able to house people coming over here, it could also help when it comes to loneliness and supporting the more elderly on the island who have a spare room to let.\n\"Building houses can take an extortionate amount of time, but we could actually do something that could happen quickly and deal with the crisis we\u2019ve got right now.\"\nIt comes as an independent report into the housing situation in Guernsey highlighted tax breaks for live-in landlords as an opportunity to alleviate the burden on the overcrowded housing market.\nA similar scheme was introduced in Jersey this year, providing an income tax exemption  for those letting out a room in their home using a 'rent-a-room' arrangement.\nThe tax-free allowance there is capped at \u00a310,000 gross income per year.  \nMs Soulsby said: \"We don\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel - this has been done elsewhere and I think it is something we could do relatively easily.\n\"We know it is multi faceted - it\u2019s a complex market failure we are seeing here and there\u2019s different ways we can deal with it.\"\nShe continued: \u201cIt\u2019s clear we have a market failure here and that non intervention has been a major reason for it. \n\"If we are going to make any change here and we absolutely have to, there needs to be government intervention.\n\"I am hoping with that backup and the drive within the states now we can make it happen.\"\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "Police officers \"committed misconduct\" in the initial stages of the investigation into the 2020 murder of showjumper Katie Simpson, the chief constable has told the Policing Board.\nJon Boutcher said the PSNI had received a 1,400 page Police Ombudsman report.\nMs Simpson's murder was originally thought by police to have been a suicide.\nMr Boutcher said the misconduct identified by the ombudsman was not \"gross or criminal\".\nResponding to a question from Alliance MLA and board member Nuala McAllister, he added that a disciplinary process is under way within the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).\nMs Simpson died following an incident in Gortnessy Meadows, Lettershandoney, on 3 August 2020.\nThe 21-year-old, who was from the village of Tynan in County Armagh, died in Altnagelvin Hospital six days later, having never regained consciousness.\nThe trial of a man for the murder of Ms Simpson ended abruptly last week after the defendant, Jonathan Creswell, was found dead.\nSentencing against three co-accused women, who pleaded guilty before Mr Creswell's trial began, will now be brought forward.\nMs McAllister has previously told BBC NI she had made disclosures to the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland about the case.\nShe said the issues she has brought to the attention of the ombudsman \"raise a lot of questions as to why Katie's murder was treated as a suicide for the first few months\".\n\"It is very, very frightening to know that this took place in society, and it was quite obviously a murder and the police did not treat it as such and I think that we need to get to the bottom of this,\" she said.\nSpeaking to the BBC's Evening Extra programme on Thursday, Ms McAllister said that she was \"not satisfied\" with what was said at Policing Board meeting.\nShe said: \"I respect that there was information which he [John Boucher] could not go into, and I was not surprised by any of the information which was shared.\n\"A lot of concerns have been vindicated, and that is important for people.\n\"But not all the concerns have been addressed,\" she added. \nThe Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland launched an investigation in 2021 after receiving complaints about the police investigation into the circumstances of Ms Simpson's death.\nThe police watchdog submitted a misconduct file to the Professional Standards Department of the PSNI last April about the conduct of what is believed to be six police officers.\nThe rank of the officers involved has not been disclosed publicly.",
    "The Liberal Democrats remain in control of Hull City Council - despite Labour taking three seats from them in Thursday's election.\nThe result leaves the Liberal Democrats with a total of 31 council seats to Labour's 26.\nCouncil leader Mike Ross said it was a \"strong result\", showing people had faith in the Lib Dems.\nLabour group leader Daren Hale said his party was heading towards retaking control of the Guildhall.\nNo other parties won any seats in an election that saw a turnout of just 21.43%.\nNotable results include Labour gains in the Avenue, Derringham and North Carr wards while the Liberal Democrats took University.\nA third of the council's 57 seats across 19 wards were up for grabs this year.\nMr Ross said: \"Tonight has seen a strong result for the Liberal Democrats in Hull.\n\"Residents have put their faith in us for the third year in a row. In return, our promise is to carry on listening to them and carry on getting real change for the city.\n\"Whether it is changes to bus lanes or cleaning up the city, this Lib Dem council is committed to being one that works for you. Our focus will be getting the basics right, working hard all year round and making sure our communities get the service they deserve.\"\nThanking those who voted for his party, Mr Ross added: \"We will now make good on our promise to make Hull a cleaner, greener and safer place.\" \nMr Hale told the Local Democracy Reporting Service that Labour had put the Liberal Democrats on notice and his party was heading towards retaking control of the Guildhall after losing it in 2022.\nThe council election in Hull was once again a battle between Labour and the Liberal Democrats.\nBut it was the Lib Dems who were celebrating after keeping control of Hull City Council despite losing three seats to Labour. \nAccording to the Electoral Commission, Hull had the lowest turnout in the local elections last year among unitary authorities with just 22% of the electorate voting. This year that figure was even lower at 21.43%.\nThose who did choose to vote will now be looking to the Lib Dems to deal with local issues and many more responsibilities which fall to our local authorities. \nMeanwhile, Labour will sit once again as the opposition group. This year's local elections may be over in Hull but the political fight between these two parties is set to continue.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

    "School safety procedures are being reviewed across Wales after two teachers and a pupil were stabbed.\nTeachers Fiona Elias and Liz Hopkin and a pupil were injured at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman in Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, last week, which led to the school being put in lockdown for about four hours.\nA 13-year-old girl has been remanded into secure youth detention accommodation charged with attempted murder and is due to appear at Swansea Crown Court next month.\nCouncils throughout Wales have contacted head teachers urging them to check emergency procedures are up to date in the wake of the incident.\nAmong them, Bridgend council said it had also asked head teachers to \"ensure that teachers, pupils, staff and governors are all aware of what to do in the event of an emergency situation\".\n\"While serious incidents such as this are, thankfully, rare, I want to reassure parents and carers that local schools have plans and procedures in place which can be quickly and efficiently implemented,\" said Jon-Paul Blundell, Bridgend's cabinet member for education.\nThe council is also due to meet head teachers to \"confirm that all relevant plans and procedures are in place\".\nBBC Wales has asked other education authorities about their school safety procedures.\nTorfaen council plans to discuss lockdown arrangements with education leaders across the Gwent region on 13 May. \nIt will also look at how it manages fencing repairs and magnetic locks as students have been able to break these, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nIn Wrexham, heads have been asked to \"check and confirm their emergency lockdown procedures,\" the council said.\nDenbighshire council has \"contacted all schools to remind them of the protocols and procedures in place to lockdown should the need arise\".\nSchool leaders in Monmouthshire recently attended \"critical incident training\" and all its \"secondary schools have appropriate systems and processes in place to respond to emergency incidents in school,\" the council said.\nCaerphilly council said it had \"robust policies and procedures in place to protect the school community\" which can be \"reviewed as appropriate to ensure they are up to date and reflect the latest advice and learning from emerging incidents\".\nNewport council said its procedures were up to date so \"we aren't planning a review at the moment\".\nIn Conwy school leaders have been asked to review safety procedures with all students and staff and to carry out practice if this has not yet been completed. \nGwynedd heads have been contacted to make sure all existing arrangements are \"active and effective\".

    "A ban on tackling is causing junior rugby league players to quit the game, a coach has claimed.\nThe Rugby Football League (RFL) has introduced tag rugby for under sixes to make the sport safer over concerns about head injuries.\nThe restriction will be gradually extended to cover under nines over the next two years.\nHowever, a coach at Hull-based club Skirlaugh RLFC said some players had left as a result of the new rules.\nReece Dean said some of the children were \"pretty shocked\" when the rules were introduced in December.\n\"A few kids have lost a bit of interest and we've had a couple leave,\" he said.\n\"It's the game we've all grown up playing and watching, and the kids go to Hull Kingston Rovers but for them it's a completely different game now.\nMr Dean said he understood the need to protect children from harm, but added he disagreed with the tackling ban.\n\"This is the best age to teach them tackling so that they are in good practice for when they are bigger and when it can be dangerous,\" he said. \n\"I've been teaching these kids how to tackle since they were three years old and in that time we haven't had a single head contact.\"\nMany parents are also unhappy with the changes. \nRyan McAllister, whose son plays for Skirlaugh, said: \"The kids didn't take up rugby to play tag so I think they should be able to still learn how to tackle. \n\"When they go up to open age rugby there's going to be a big difference between some lads that have been tackling for 10 years compared to these lads who will have only tackled for maybe five or six years.\" \nAmy Baker's son also plays in the under six team. \nShe said: \"I do think the children have adapted really well and the coach has been helping them learn the new rules. \n\"But some parents are a bit disheartened because they've got older children who play rugby but my son seems happy and when he goes to watch his uncle play he sees him tackling so he is going to get there eventually.\"\nThe RFL said the tackling ban was one of 44 recommendations from the sport's Brain Health and Clinical Advisory Group based on research by Leeds Beckett University into the effect of head injuries in the sport.\nOther changes introduced this season include lowering the legal tackle height for community and professional clubs from shoulder to armpit height. \n\"As with all of the 44 recommendations, the intention is to reduce the risk of concussions - but also, importantly in the changes being made to junior Rugby League, to delay the point at which players begin tackling,\" a RFL spokesperson said\n\"This is because of developments in medical and scientific knowledge relating to the young and developing brain, and also relating to the cumulative impact of head contact of whatever level - mirroring similar changes that have been made in other contact sports.\"\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

However, some large wards have several seats. \nAs in a general election, whoever receives the most votes wins. \nFor the first time, mayors and police and crime commissioners will also be elected under the first-past-the-post system. \nThe deadlines to register to vote in the May elections in England and Wales, or to request a postal or proxy vote, have passed. \nHowever, you can still request an emergency proxy vote if last-minute work commitments or a medical emergency mean you can no longer vote in person on the day. \nYou can do this up to 17:00 BST on polling day, Thursday 2 May. \nIf you use a postal vote it must be with your local council by 22:00 on polling day. \nYou can return your ballot papers by post in advance or hand them into a polling station or your local council on the day before the deadline.\nVoters will need to show photo ID in order to vote in person. You do not need your polling card. \nThere are 22 acceptable forms of ID, including passports and driving licences. You can use ID which has expired as long as you still look like the photo.\nAnyone registered to vote without the correct ID - or who no longer looks like their photo - can apply for a free document known as a Voter Authority Certificate.\nIt is too late to get one to use in the May elections. \nHowever, if you do not have valid photo ID or it has been lost, stolen or damaged you can still apply for an emergency proxy vote via the electoral services team at your local council before 17:00 BST on polling day.\nLocal councils are responsible for many public services, including: \nMost of these council seats were last contested in May 2021, after the 2020 elections were postponed because of the pandemic. \nVoting took place alongside other elections which were already scheduled. \nThe Conservatives made significant gains and ended 235 seats up, with Labour 327 seats down.\nOn the same day, the Tories took Hartlepool from Labour in a parliamentary by-election.  \nThe London Mayor represents the 8.9 million people living across the city and has a budget of \u00a320.4bn. \nThe mayor is responsible for Transport for London (TfL) and has some control over roads, policing and housing in the capital.\nOutside London, mayoral elections are also taking place in nine \"metro\" areas across England.\nThe West Midlands, Greater Manchester, Liverpool City, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and Tees Valley already have mayors. \nFor the first time, mayors will also be chosen in the East Midlands, the North East, and York and North Yorkshire.\nMetro mayors set out plans to boost their local economy, and have some powers over housing and transport. \nIf you include the London mayor, they control about \u00a325bn, covering 44% of the population in England.  \nVoters will also choose the mayor of Salford, the directly-elected leader of the city council.\nElections for 37 PCCs are taking place across England and Wales - although not in London, Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and York and North Yorkshire where the mayor performs this role. \nPCCs were introduced in 2012 to replace police authorities.

    "A planning inspector has backed a decision to refuse permission for affordable housing in a village.\nThe inspector found the proposal - to build 24 so-called \"First Homes\" in Roade near Northampton, would harm the character of the area.\nThe government's First Homes scheme means first-time buyers can get at least 30% off the house price when they purchase.\nThe result of the appeal has been welcomed by Roade Parish Council, which said the application had contravened the village's adopted Neighbourhood Development Plan.\nThe Higham Ferrers-based firm, Snowdon Homes, planned to build the homes in fields next to Northampton Road.\nDevelopments that consist mostly of First Homes can be approved - even if they do not conform to the area's local planning blueprint.\nThe company appealed after the application was turned down by West Northamptonshire Council.\nThe planning inspector who heard the appeal accepted that the development would \"help reduce the district-wide shortfall of affordable housing\".\nHe also found that there would be \"some modest socio-economic benefits during construction and local after-spend from future residents\".\nNevertheless, he said the development would \"cause harm to the setting and hence significance of Roade Conservation Area.. which I have found would not be outweighed by the public benefits\".\nHe added: \"There would also be harm to the character and appearance of the area.

    "A ban on tackling is causing junior rugby league players to quit the game, a coach has claimed.\nThe Rugby Football League (RFL) has introduced tag rugby for under sixes to make the sport safer over concerns about head injuries.\nThe restriction will be gradually extended to cover under nines over the next two years.\nHowever, a coach at Hull-based club Skirlaugh RLFC said some players had left as a result of the new rules.\nReece Dean said some of the children were \"pretty shocked\" when the rules were introduced in December.\n\"A few kids have lost a bit of interest and we've had a couple leave,\" he said.\n\"It's the game we've all grown up playing and watching, and the kids go to Hull Kingston Rovers but for them it's a completely different game now.\nMr Dean said he understood the need to protect children from harm, but added he disagreed with the tackling ban.\n\"This is the best age to teach them tackling so that they are in good practice for when they are bigger and when it can be dangerous,\" he said. \n\"I've been teaching these kids how to tackle since they were three years old and in that time we haven't had a single head contact.\"\nMany parents are also unhappy with the changes. \nRyan McAllister, whose son plays for Skirlaugh, said: \"The kids didn't take up rugby to play tag so I think they should be able to still learn how to tackle. \n\"When they go up to open age rugby there's going to be a big difference between some lads that have been tackling for 10 years compared to these lads who will have only tackled for maybe five or six years.\" \nAmy Baker's son also plays in the under six team. \nShe said: \"I do think the children have adapted really well and the coach has been helping them learn the new rules. \n\"But some parents are a bit disheartened because they've got older children who play rugby but my son seems happy and when he goes to watch his uncle play he sees him tackling so he is going to get there eventually.\"\nThe RFL said the tackling ban was one of 44 recommendations from the sport's Brain Health and Clinical Advisory Group based on research by Leeds Beckett University into the effect of head injuries in the sport.\nOther changes introduced this season include lowering the legal tackle height for community and professional clubs from shoulder to armpit height. \n\"As with all of the 44 recommendations, the intention is to reduce the risk of concussions - but also, importantly in the changes being made to junior Rugby League, to delay the point at which players begin tackling,\" a RFL spokesperson said\n\"This is because of developments in medical and scientific knowledge relating to the young and developing brain, and also relating to the cumulative impact of head contact of whatever level - mirroring similar changes that have been made in other contact sports.\"\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

    "Building society customers who lost their life savings when a trust fund firm went bust have been told they will get all their money back.\nPhilips Trust Corporation (PTC) went into administration in 2022 leaving more than 2,000 people out of pocket.\nSome of those people have argued Newcastle, Leeds and Nottingham building societies bore some responsibility for their money eventually ending up with PTC.\nGordon Crosthwaite, whose mother in law had lost thousands of pounds, said the financial offer was \"better than expected\".\nThe three building societies have now pledged to re-establish \u201c100% of each customer\u2019s PTC investment balance\u201d.\nIn a joint statement, they said: \u201cEach society is using their strong financial foundations to voluntarily offer support to their respective customers.\n\u201cThere is no legal or regulatory requirement to offer financial help.\u201d\nMr Crosthwaite said his mother-in-law Kathleen Birtley, from Northumberland, put about \u00a3105,000 into a PTC trust after initially being referred to the Will Writing Company by NBS.\nShe hoped the money would be used to take care of her disabled son when she died, he said.\nMr Crosthwaite said the family had been dealing with Newcastle Building Society (NBS) back and forth for two years trying to get the money back, and his mother-in-law was pleased with the building societies' pledge.\nNBS chief executive Andrew Haigh said: \u201cOur members understand our commitment to purpose and our support for the communities we serve, which makes it even more important that we go ahead with this voluntary support for members at this time of great difficulty.\u201d\nFor customers who put their properties into a PTC trust, the building societies will also provide up to \u00a32,400 towards the cost of changing trustees. \nAffected customers have been told they will be contacted by PTC\u2019s administrators, Kroll, by the end of May.\nThe Will Writing Company, whose services had originally been referred to customers by NBS, went into administration in 2018.\nAn entity connected with PTC took over its assets, the BBC understands. \nNBS said it wrote to customers to make clear it had no relationship with parties connected to PTC.\nSome customers said they had not received the first letter and argued they received a second letter too late to act on it.\nNewcastle solicitor Claire Springle previously told the BBC she believed some of her clients only ended up with PTC because they had accounts with NBS.\nShe said the building society referred some customers to the Will Writing Company to help them write wills and plan their estates, and the company then recommended some of those to its sister firm, Family Trust Corporation (FTC), to help them put their homes and savings into trusts.\nMany of her clients, most of whom were older, did this because they thought they could avoid future care costs, she said.\nWhen PTC took over parts of the Will Writing Company in 2018, several FTC customers switched the ownership of their trusts to PTC, according to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\nAfter PTC went bust in 2022, it emerged it had moved its customers\u2019 money to higher risk investments, the FCA said.\nNBS maintains PTC independently contacted customers, inviting them to transfer to itself some less risky regulated trusts that had been set up by FTC.\nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

But Town wouldn't be in this position in the league with a bad team.

    "Island residents and parents have said they are \"disappointed but not surprised\" at the resignation of the teacher in charge of Herm School.\nMary Carey was in the position for 18 years and has been described as \"incredibly unselfish\".\nThe island's primary school, which currently has four pupils, was closed at the beginning of this academic year by the States before reopening following public pressure.\nMrs Carey had been on a prolonged period of absence prior to the announcement.\nThe outgoing CEO of Herm, Craig Senior, has two children at the school who he said \"love and adore\" Mary Carey.\nHe said: \"One of the main reasons we came to Herm Island and put our roots down was the fantastic school-teacher that we have in Mary Carey. \n\"We're gutted, we're disappointed, but not surprised, considering how the last few months have been.\n\"When you're in a bubble like we are in the winter months, to have that relationship and that second-mother figure and schoolteacher is so, so very important.\"\nMr Senior said Mrs Carey was \"one of the best schoolteachers [he] ever had the pleasure to know and to work with\", who \"always put the needs and thoughts of the children first\".\nDeputy David de Lisle was at the forefront of the campaign which led to the States' u-turn on closing Herm School last year.\nHe said he was also disappointed to hear the announcement but was unsurprised given the \"disruption\" of the last year.\nHe said: \"Herm is losing a first-class person, first-class teacher, and someone who will be very difficult to replace.\"\nStates Education has said that while they did not comment on individual teacher resignations or personal circumstances, they could confirm they had staff in place to deliver education in Herm.\nMorgan Jones was one of the 40 children who Mrs Carey taught during her career at Herm School.\nShe said, \"Herm School was absolutely brilliant, and Mrs Carey made it what it was.\n\"When you hear the words 'Herm School', you associate it with Mrs Carey, and I feel sorry for the children who won't experience her teaching.\n\"Her legacy will live in Herm forever.\"\n",
    "The 175th anniversary of Boots the Chemist is being marked with an exhibition about its impact on everyday life.\nIn 1849, John Boot opened a store on Nottingham's Goose Gate, gaining a reputation for value for money.\nThe exhibition will focus on how the high street and retail have changed. \nCounter Culture: 175 Years of Shopping at Boots opens at Lakeside Arts' Djanogly Gallery on Friday and will run until 21 July. \nOrganisers said John Boot valued a \"healthcare for all\" approach, and by the time his son Jesse took sole control of the business in 1877, he had positioned it as offering traditional medicines at value prices.\nThe exhibition examines, they added, changing customer needs, cultural aspirations, and patterns of everyday life, and the corresponding evolution of technologies, display techniques, approaches to advertising, and architectural designs that have shaped modern shopping.\nRichard Hornsey, associate professor of Modern British History at the University of Nottingham, said: \"For this exhibition, we wanted to celebrate the history of Boots in a different way, by focusing on the Boots shopper. \n\"This is a celebration of ordinary experience and the factors that have shaped it over time.\"\nAmong the exhibits are 19th Century carboys - decorative glass storage bottles - that were commonly used by pharmacists to signal their trade to passers-by.\nAlso on display is a pharmacist's workbench, which shows how they would work before mass production, making up individual medicines according to each customer's needs. \nOne particularly pervasive area is advertising, with examples from World War One - featuring characters 'Reggie Sam' and 'Betty' - and the 'Mummy says\u2026.' campaign from the 1940s.\nSophie Clapp, company archivist at Boots UK, said: \"This is a wonderful way to celebrate our 175th anniversary within our local community. \n\"The exhibition places the Boots customer at the heart of our retail innovations and shows that our enduring position on the high street is due to the ways in which we have responded to their changing needs.\"\nThe exhibition is accompanied by a series of talks; on subjects as diverse as the Boots' 17 cosmetics brand and the company's branches in New Zealand and Fiji.\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A teenager has been sentenced to life for murdering another teen over a drug debt.\nArmin Mehdikhani-Sarvejahani will serve a minimum of 17 years for stabbing Mustafa Momand in Brighton in October 2023.\nThe trial at Lewes Crown Court had heard the killing happened over a \u00a320,000 drug debt.\nMehdikhani-Sarvejahani can be named for the first time after media organisations, including the BBC, made an application to get an anonymity order lifted.\nThe court heard how Mr Momand spent his dying moments running away in fear after he was knifed through the breast bone on Queens Road.\nThe A-level business and law student ran for 150m before he staggered and collapsed while his attacker yelled after him.\nJudge Mr Justice Constable KC said Mustafa was trying to turn his life around from being a \"minor pawn in the terrible drug business which destroys so many lives\".\nThe trial heard how Mr Momand had racked up a \u00a320,000 shared drug debt and that his parents had tried to save him from drug dealing and debts, and even begged the police to send him to prison.\nSentencing Mehdikhani-Sarvejahani, Mr Justice Constable said: \"He was a brave young man who took the decision to try and leave the drug world behind him with his parents' support, but this meant leaving this so-called unpaid debt.\n\"I have no doubt that you were tasked, as an expendable foot soldier, with inflicting lethal punishment on Mustafa.\"\nHe added: \"This tragic case serves as a stark reminder of the very real dangers that await young people who get involved in dealing drugs, of the appalling way in which young lives spiral quickly into effective servitude for the financial benefit of others and become treated as expendable, and most clearly, of the devastating consequences of ever more frequent knife crime.\"\nSpeaking after the sentencing, Det Ch Insp Alex Campbell described the murder as a \"senseless tragedy\".\n\"Time and again across the country, we see the heartbreaking consequences of carrying a knife. Mustafa Momand, a child, has tragically lost his life. His family and loved ones must live with his loss for the rest of theirs.\n\"His killer will enter adulthood inside a prison cell.

    "When North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un released his latest song two weeks ago, surely he couldn\u2019t have foreseen it becoming a hit on TikTok.\nBut the propaganda tune has gone viral online with Gen Z users bopping around to the synthy-electro pop.\nMost are clearly quite oblivious to the Korean lyrics praising a man who\u2019s vowed to \u201cthoroughly annihilate the US\u201d and launched dozens of ballistic missiles. \n\u201cLet\u2019s sing Kim Jong Un, the great leader/ Let\u2019s brag about Kim Jong Un, our friendly father,\u201d the song goes.\nIt\u2019s just a really great tune, TikTokkers say.\n\u201cTaylor Swift was not expecting to get blown out of the water right after dropping her new album,\u201d one fan joked online.\n\u201cWait, this slaps\u201d, \u201cThis song needs a Grammy\u201d, \u201cIt\u2019s so dystopian in the catchiest way\u201d \u2013 they are just some of the enthused comments under TikTok videos.\nBut the sunny pop hides something more sinister, experts say.\nFriendly Father is just the latest in a line of propaganda pop songs churned out by the Communist state in the past 50 years.\nIt\u2019s peppy, bright-tempoed and dangerously catchy \u2013 not that much different from Western pop hits.\nBut there is a certain Soviet-era tinge to it; Gen Z users describe it as \u201cAbba-coded\u201d, a reference to the Swedish superband.\n\u201cIn this case, the song has Abba written all over it,\u201c says Peter Moody, a North Korea analyst at Korea University.\n\u201cIt's upbeat, it could not be more catchy, and a rich set of orchestral-sounding sequences could not be more prominent,\u201d he says.\nBut there\u2019s more than just commercial considerations at play when writing a chart-topper in North Korea - authorities want an earworm that penetrates minds.\nThere\u2019s no space for abstract phrasing or timing that\u2019s overly complicated , says Alexandra Leonzini, a Cambridge University scholar who researches North Korean music.\nMelodies have to be simple, accessible, something people can easily pick up.\nTunes also need to be pitched at a vocal range where they can be sung by most people. The masses can\u2019t keep up with vocal gymnastics, so forget about multi-octave riffs.\n\nMs Leonzini says the songbook also rarely contains any tracks with real emotion. \"The idea is they want to motivate, to strive towards a common goal for the benefit of the nation\u2026 they don't tend to produce songs like ballads,\u201d she says.\nThere is zero tolerance for creative or artistic freedom in North Korea. It is illegal for musicians, painters and writers to produce works simply for the sake of art.\n\u201cAll artistic output in North Korea must serve the class education of citizens and more specifically educate them as to why they should feel a sense of gratitude, a sense of loyalty to the party,\u201d Ms Leonzini says.\nNorth Korea\u2019s government believes in the \"seed theory\", she adds, where every single work must contain an ideological seed, a message that is then disseminated en masse through art.\nMusic is one of its most powerful tools - and Pyongyang keeps its pop tracks for those at home. The state has paraded its opera troupes and symphony orchestras on overseas missions \u2013 but its lighter ensembles are kept for a domestic audience only.\nNorth Koreans wake up every morning to propaganda songs blasted over village town squares, say defectors. \nThe song sheet and lyrics of the latest songs - which only come out sparingly - are printed in newspapers and magazines; usually they also have to learn dances to go with it, says Keith Howard, an emeritus professor of musicology at London\u2019s School of Oriental and African Studies, who first visited North Korea in the 1990s.\n\u201cBy the time the song has sort of been taken into the body, it\u2019s become part of the person,\u201d he says.\n\u201cSo they know the lyrics so well, even if they're just doing the actions, even if they're just listening to it. A good ideological song does that - it needs to embed the message.\u201d\nAnd for regime watchers, the two-minute track released last month has an alarming new message.\nWhile Western music fans have been dissecting Taylor Swift's new songs or breaking down the Kendrick Lamar v Drake diss tracks, North Korean experts have been scrutinising Friendly Father\u2019s lyrics.\nIt\u2019s not the first song dedicated to Mr Kim. But there\u2019s a noticeable departure in the language and vocabulary used.\nHe is being referred to as \u201cfather\u201d and \u201cthe Great\u201d - terms previously reserved for North Korea\u2019s first leader, his grandfather Kim Il Sung.\nMr Kim was called the \"Great Successor\u201d when he took over the mantle in 2012 after his father Kim Jong Il\u2019s passing.\nHowever, more than a decade on, analysts think this may be a sign that he is shoring up his image as North Korea's \"Supreme Leader\".\nIn recent times, he\u2019s also replaced the lyrics in another propaganda song, switching out \u201cour father Kim Il Sung\u201d to \u201cour father Kim Jong Un\u201d.\nIt could be a sign of his direction. As a leader he has become increasingly hostile and aggressive in his rhetoric, pledging to build up his country\u2019s military arsenal.\nAt the start of this year, he also declared the No",
    " Thousands of students, at more than 130 colleges and universities across the US, have demonstrated in opposition to the ongoing war in Gaza with protests and encampments. \nMore than 2,000 demonstrators have been arrested, but the protests continue as universities prepare for graduation ceremonies in coming days.\nSince the 7 October attack by Hamas and Israel's retaliatory assault, students have launched rallies, sit-ins, fasts and, most recently, encampments against the war.\nThey are demanding that their schools, many with massive endowments, financially divest from Israel. \nDivestment, for many of the protesters, means cutting those endowments' ties to Israeli companies or ones that do business with Israel. Many also want their universities to end academic relationships with Israeli institutions.\nStudent activists say that companies doing business in Israel, or with Israeli organisations, are complicit in its ongoing war in Gaza - as are colleges investing in those companies.\nUniversity endowments fund everything from research labs to scholarship funds, mostly using returns from millions - and billions - of dollars in investments. \nThe encampments began last month, with dozens of students at Columbia University pitching tents on a campus lawn while the president of the New York City university testified before Congress about antisemitism. \nThe police moved in a day later and detained the protesters, sparking a wave of action at other colleges across the US. \nActivists quickly set up camp again at Columbia and eventually moved into an academic building.\nThe police were called in again due to vandalism and risks to public safety, the university said. \nMore than 100 arrests were made as both the building and encampment were cleared.\nThe escalating crisis at Columbia inspired similar protests and encampments across the country, including:\nThe BBC has counted more than 130 colleges and universities in the US where protests or encampments have arisen in the past few weeks. Protests have occurred in 45 states and Washington D.C. \nPro-Palestinian protesters have also gathered over the past week on university campuses in Australia, Canada, France, Italy and the UK.\nSome are negotiating with student activists while others are issuing ultimatums that have led to police being called in.\nAn agreement was reached between Northwestern University near Chicago and protesters that limits the size of the encampment.\nAnother deal was reached at Brown University where school officials agreed to hold a vote on divestment in October in exchange for students removing the encampment. \nNational politicians have called on colleges to do more, highlighting antisemitic incidents at some protests.\nJewish students at several campuses have told the BBC about incidents that made them feel uncomfortable or fearful.\nThese ranged from chants and signs supporting Hamas, a proscribed terror group, to physical altercations and perceived threats.\nMore than 2,000 people have been arrested at the demonstrations across the US, according to a tally compiled by the Associated Press. \nIn just the first two days of May alone, hundreds of arrests were made at campuses around the country, including Yale, Dartmouth, Stony Brook, Portland State, the University of Wisconsin and the University of Texas at Dallas. \nAt UCLA, 210 people were taken into custody after police moved in on a pro-Palestinian encampment. \nIn New York, 282 were arrested earlier this week after police cleared Columbia's Hamilton Hall - which had been occupied by protesters - as well as the encampment on campus. The figure includes detentions made at the nearby City College of New York. \nPro-Palestinian campus groups have for years called on their institutions to support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, as a means of pushing back against Israel.\nNo US university has ever committed to the BDS framework, although some have cut specific financial ties in the past.\nWhile divestment would have a negligible impact, if any, on the war in Gaza, protesters say it would shed light on those who profit from war and help build awareness of their issue.\nIn response, Israel has banned some BDS groups from entering the country. \nActivists at Columbia and elsewhere have highlighted the protests at the end of the 1960s against US involvement in the Vietnam War.\nThousands were arrested and there were violent clashes with police. \nFour students in Ohio were killed in 1970 when the National Guard opened fire. The National Guard is not being deployed to the Gaza campus protests.\nTheir deaths triggered a nationwide student strike and hundreds of universities closed.\nGraduation ceremonies across the US are kicking off this weekend and some protests are expected including at Indiana University and the University of Michigan. It remains to be seen exactly what demonstrations at commencements will look like. \nAt the University of Southern California, the commencement ceremony was cancelled al",
    "A former head teacher who referenced a member of staff arrested for a child sex offence has received an indefinite ban from teaching.\nAn independent panel concluded Carol Barker made \"a conscious attempt\" to withhold the information.\nThe 59-year-old was appointed head teacher of Woodlands Academy in Aspley, Nottingham, in 2010.\nMrs Barker said her \"trust of people's innate goodness\" should not have superseded her professional duty.\nA report detailing the hearing said the former head teacher faced 14 allegations, 13 of which were proven.\nThe panel heard that in May 2011 Mrs Barker gave a reference to Nottingham City Council for a male designated as Person A, who was applying for a teaching assistant role at the school.\nPerson A had previously been arrested over an allegation of sexual assault pertaining to a child in 2009.\nHe was known to Mrs Baker, who said in the reference that he had volunteered at the school since about 2006. However, he had held a paid role during that time, the report said.\nPerson A was subsequently employed in the role. In March 2016, another member of staff raised concerns that Person A had placed his hand inside a pupil's clothing.\nThe panel heard that Mrs Barker did not inform the pupil's parents of this, who found out through the police in 2019, and did not escalate the concerns until \"several\" internal school meetings had been held.\nIn June 2018, Person A was arrested for an allegation of a sexual nature against a child, the report said.\nThe panel heard that in September of that year, Mrs Barker instructed that Person A receive a pay rise.\nThe police informed Mrs Barker in November that they were investigating concerns in relation to the 2009 incident and the more recent allegation.\nThey confirmed in March 2019 that Person A was being investigated for sexual assault by touching of a boy under the age of 13 and sexual assault by digital penetration of a boy under the age of 13.\nPerson A was charged in September 2019 after leaving the school earlier that year.\nThe panel concluded this was \"a very serious type of dishonesty\" in the context of Mrs Barker's status in the teaching profession.\nIn a witness statement, Mrs Barker said: \"My trust of people's innate goodness and my own desire to believe that people are trustworthy should never have superseded my professional duty to protect children and my school population.\"\nThe statement expressed she was \"profoundly regretful and deeply ashamed\" that pupils and staff were put at risk.\nMrs Barker was also found to have failed to carry out \"adequate pre-appointment checks\" on another employee at the school in August 2018.\nThe panel found that the proven allegations and facts amounted to \"unacceptable professional conduct\" which may bring the profession into disrepute.\nIt added that Mrs Barker's conduct \"fell significantly short of the standards expected of the profession\".\nMrs Barker cannot appeal her teaching ban until 11 March 2028, four years from the order being made. \nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Lae arrived on time for her job interview at a lawyer's office in Bristol.\nBut after 20 minutes, it had been cancelled and she was asked to come back the next day.\nShe left upset, only to receive a message later saying the \"cancellation\" had actually been a test, which she had failed. \nShe did not get the job.\nShe says the experience was \u201ctotally bizarre\u201d and that it spurred her to start her own business, where she makes sure to stick to a much more straightforward hiring style.\nLae is not alone. According to recruitment agency Hays, over half of people have had a negative experience during the interview process for a new job.\nThe BBC has heard stories from dozens of people who went through odd, offensive, and off-putting interviews.\nThey got in touch following the news that John Lewis is changing its recruitment process by allowing applicants to see interview questions in advance, in an attempt to make the process fairer.\nSo what can bad interviews teach us? And what can interviewees and interviewers do to make the experience less questionable?\nAixin Fu also had a bizarre experience when she applied for a student ambassador job for minimum wage at a university.\nDuring a group interview, everyone was asked to crawl around on their hands and knees and \u201cmoo like a cow\u201d.\n\u201cWe did that for about three to four minutes,\u201d she recalls.\n\"At the time, I was quite annoyed. It was highly inappropriate.\n\"But there was a bit of peer pressure because everyone else was doing it.\"\nThe interviewer said they were trying to see if the candidates were \"fun\", though Ms Fu suspects that \"maybe someone just had a bit of a power trip\".\nJulie from Missouri in the US says she learnt that interviewers can sometimes be \u201creally isolated\u201d from what it\u2019s like to be an interviewee.\nThis was her takeaway from a video interview she did in 2022 to be a part-time copywriter. \nAt first, she felt it was going well. \u201cI was ticking all the boxes,\u201d she says.\nBut towards the end, the interviewer asked: \u201cSo how many years do you think you've got left in you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m in my early 60s,\u201d Julie says. \u201cI\u2019m not going to retire for quite a while.\u201d\nAgeism is not the only prejudice people may experience during interviews.\nPearl Kasirye, a content marketing manager, says she was asked about her heritage during a second interview for a partially remote PR role at a fashion brand in Milan.\nMs Kasirye lives in London and left Uganda to live and study in Europe as a child.\nShe says the employer was insistent on paying her a Ugandan wage rather than a London wage for the remote work because of her background.\nShe chose to withdraw her application.\n\u201cWhere you\u2019re from, you have no control over,\u201d she says, adding that she has interviewed people herself since and is \u201cso much more mindful\u201d about her questions.\nSometimes prejudice can be accidental \u2014 or at least less explicit \u2014 but still just as difficult for the interviewee.\nTom (not his real name) is an IT engineer who was once asked to film answers to questions for a warehouse assistant job, rather than talking to someone in a formal interview.\nTom describes himself as on the autistic spectrum, though it is not something he likes to share with people.\nHe says he needs clear instructions during an interview process and much prefers talking face-to-face, describing the filming process as \u201cdetached - like you\u2019re talking to a computer\".\nMany people also told the BBC they had been discriminated against during hiring based on their gender.\nAccording to data from hiring platform Applied, nearly one in five women have been asked whether they have children, or plan to have children, during hiring processes.\nOne of those is Applied\u2019s chief executive Khyati Sundaram, who says she has been asked \u201cmore times than I can count\u201d.\nIt is illegal for employers to ask candidates about their marital status, whether they have children, or whether they plan to have children.\nDespite this, Applied found the problem is even worse for women applying for senior roles, where two-fifths of women had been asked the same question.\nMs Sundaram says one of the reasons for this is the perceived \u201ceconomic lability\u201d of pregnancy. \u201cThe higher the pay, the more maternity you have to pay while finding a cover, and they don\u2019t want the hassle.\"\nSometimes the hiring process is bad not because of prejudice but because, as Ms Sundaram puts it: \u201cThere is no benchmark for what good looks like on the interviewer side.\"\nHer top tips for interviewers are to ask the same questions to every candidate and to design those questions with \u201cmarginalised groups\u201d in mind.\nAs for Aixin Fu, she says her experience taught her to assert herself more in future interviews, especially if asked to do something \u201cbizarre, unreasonable, or not a requirement for the job\u201d \u2014 such as moo like a cow.",
    "Kevin Spacey has responded to fresh allegations of inappropriate behaviour in the past, ahead of a new documentary due to be released next week.\nIn an interview with former GB News presenter Dan Wootton, he commented on claims made in an upcoming Channel 4 documentary.\nWhile accepting he may at times have behaved inappropriately in the past, he denied his behaviour was illegal. \nMr Spacey has been cleared of sexual assault in trials in the US and UK. \n\"I take full responsibility for my past behaviour and my actions. But I cannot and will not take responsibility or apologise to anyone who's made up stuff about me or exaggerated stories about me,\" Mr Spacey told Mr Wootton. \n\"I've never told someone that if they give me sexual favours, then I will help them out with their career, ever,\" he said. \n\"I've clearly hooked up with, you know, some men who thought they might get ahead in their careers by having a relationship with me. But there was no conversation with me, it was all part of their plan, one that was always destined to fail, because I wasn't in on the deal.\"\nSpacey Unmasked, a Channel 4 documentary, is due to be released next week.\nActors Ruari Cannon and Danny De Lillo are among those featured in the documentary. Both have given interviews published today alleging inappropriate behaviour by Mr Spacey. \nMr Cannon alleges that in 2013, Mr Spacey touched him inappropriately in public at a press night for an Old Vic theatre production. Mr Spacey said the allegation was \"ridiculous and it never happened\". \nMr De Lillo alleges the actor thrust his groin towards his face while he was seated at a production at the same theatre. Mr Spacey said he found the accusation \"completely offensive\". \n\"There were certainly times when I was inappropriate and flirty with people I worked with at that theatre, a few I had consensual liaisons with,\" he said.\nA number of other allegations from the documentary were put to Mr Spacey, who denied accusations of illegal behaviour in all cases.\n\"Were there times when I would flirt with some of the people who were involved in those programmes who were in their 20s? Yes. Did I ever hook up with another actor? Yes. Did I make a clumsy pass at someone who wasn't interested as it turned out? Yes.\"\nHe added: \"That may not have been the best decision and it's not one that I would do today. But it happened. It wasn't illegal, and nor has it ever been alleged to have been illegal.\"\nIn a statement released on Friday night, lawyers acting for Mr Spacey said there was no public interest in the public being misinformed with the publication of \"false and unverified allegations\" which were \"largely historic, dating as far back as almost 50 years ago\".\nMr Spacey, the lawyers said, had \"not been provided with anything more than very general, anonymised information\" about the claims and had been left \"with little choice but to make his own public statement\" in the form of his interview with Mr Wootton.\nMr Spacey said accusations against him by Anthony Rapp, who accused him of sexual assault, did not happen. If they did, Mr Spacey said \"when I was in my twenties, it would have been simply embarrassing but not criminal\". \nIn 2022, a New York court dismissed a sexual assault lawsuit against Mr Spacey by Mr Rapp, who alleged the actor inappropriately touched him at a party in 1986 when he was aged 14.\nLast year, in a separate trial in London, Mr Spacey was cleared of nine sexual offence charges relating to four men between 2001 and 2013.\nThe Hollywood star won best actor Oscar in 2000 for American Beauty, and best supporting actor in 1995 for The Usual Suspects.\nHe was also the artistic director at the Old Vic Theatre in London between 2004 and 2015.\nIn a statement, the Old Vic said it had conducted an investigation in 2017 into alleged inappropriate conduct by Kevin Spacey at the theatre between 2005 and 2013. \n\"There were no findings of fact regarding the alleged misconduct and there is no evidence of any formal complaints being made against Kevin Spacey during his tenure,\" the theatre said, adding that it took responsibility for what came to light and publicly apologised. \nMr Spacey's career came to a halt in 2017 after a number of accusations of inappropriate behaviour were made against him.\nAt the time, he had the starring role of Frank Underwood in Netflix political drama House of Cards, which he lost.\nMr Wootton, a former editor of the Sun's Bizarre column, last year admitted making \"errors of judgement\" following reported claims about payments to media colleagues for explicit material, but he strongly denied criminality.",
    "King Charles has been presented with a beautifully illustrated record of his Coronation, almost a year after the historic service at Westminster Abbey. \nFor at least 700 years, monarchs have been given a \"Coronation roll\".\nStretching for 21 metres, the hand-stitched manuscript was written by calligrapher Stephanie von Werthern-Gill.\nAnd there are no nightmare spelling mistakes, bar a single dot missing over an 'i'. \n\"Most marvellous illumination work,\" said the King, while Queen Camilla said she would need \"my specs\" to read it.\nFor the first time, the manuscript did not use any animal skin.\nBut spare a thought for the calligrapher who wrote it.\nLike a massive roll of historic wallpaper, the roll includes 11,500 elegantly inscribed words, using specially made ink.\nIn an epic achievement of concentration, Stephanie says she kept going for 56 days, without any weekend breaks, determined to keep her rhythm going, phone switched off, her calm sustained by breathing exercises and classical music. \n\"It was very intense,\" she says, but the outcome \"feels like a piece of art\".\n\"All the right spelling?\" joked the King, when he looked at the huge roll, which he said \"goes on for miles\".\nIn fact, there was only a single dot missing on a letter i in the hand-stitched pages of copperplate writing, which she'd managed to spot.\nThe result was shown to King Charles and Queen Camilla at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday, as the King continues his return to duties after more positive news about his ongoing cancer treatment.\nThis is the official state record of a monarch's accession and Coronation, but it is now as much an artwork as a formal document. \nIt includes intricate illustrations by Tim Noad, who must soon be the country's most widely viewed, but least well-credited, artist. Because as well as illustrating this historic document, he is the designer of the King's cypher, the logo that you will begin to see on new banknotes, public buildings, uniforms and eventually on new post boxes.\nThe roll records the ceremonies, processions and promises of the Coronation service and shows who was there in the Abbey, particularly those with a ceremonial role, as well as the long lists of royal guests, politicians and overseas representatives. \nBut not everyone gets a mention.\nWhen the document is finally lodged in the National Archives, there will be no record of Ant and Dec or Katy Perry having been there. And there is not even a hello for Lionel Richie. They have been reduced to a catch-all heading of \"Other groups\".\nThere is also no mention of the protests by anti-monarchists that day.\nThis Coronation roll, the first for 70 years, is intended to be more accessible than its predecessors, so there will be an online video version at www.coronationroll.gov.uk with recordings of some of those present, such as Leader of the Commons Penny Mordaunt, famous for her sword-carrying skills.\nThe King and Queen watched the video of themselves at their own Coronation. It was like the most upmarket-ever edition of Gogglebox.\nDeputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden, who presented the roll to the King, said: \"For the first time, this Coronation roll will be digitised - bringing the tradition into the 21st Century and giving as many people as possible the opportunity to see it.\"\nAlso for the first time the official signing of the roll was carried out in front of the cameras, at an event in the College of Arms in London, a venue atmospheric enough to have been used as a location in a James Bond film.\nThe finished roll, which travelled in a big covering of unhistoric looking bubble wrap, was carefully signed by the clerk of the crown in chancery, Antonia Romeo.\nThe original documents, signed by the King on the day in Westminster Abbey, in big black ink, are also now stitched into this long scroll.\nThe King, who has an occupational interest in signing things, looked at earlier versions of rolls on shiny parchment and said: \"You'd have frightful difficulty signing on that.\"\nThe oldest surviving roll is from the Coronation of Edward II in 1308. It is in remarkably good condition, considering it had been stashed away in the Tower of London for hundreds of years before later being more carefully protected in the National Archives.\nUntil this latest 2024 roll, all the previous versions had been written on materials made from animal skin. But this time the roll has been recorded on high-quality paper, reflecting other modern changes such as the Coronation oils also being made animal-free.\nDr Sean Cunningham, from the National Archives, said that rolls once had a very practical political purpose. It was documentary proof of the legitimacy of a reign, with evidence to show rebellious nobles about the promises they had made.\n\"In medieval times when the crown was contested a lot more, these were important records of the authority of an incoming monarch. It's about the loyalty and allegiance to that new king,\" says Dr Cunningham.\nThe rolls have also been crib sheets f",
    "Russian troops have been deployed to an airbase in Niger where American soldiers are located, US officials say. \nThe move comes after Niger's military rulers ordered the US to withdraw troops who had been countering Islamic insurgents in the region. \nRussian forces were present at the base in Niger's capital Niamey, but were not mingling with American troops, US officials told the Reuters news agency. \nDefence Secretary Lloyd Austin said the Russians posed no \"risk\" to US forces.\n\"The Russians are in a separate compound and don't have access to US forces or access to our equipment,\" Mr Austin told journalists in Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\"I'm always focused on the safety and protection of our troops... But right now, I don't see a significant issue here in terms of our force protection,\" the defence secretary added. \nNiger is in Africa's Sahel region, which is considered the new global epicentre of the Islamic State group.\nThe US has relied on the country as its primary base for monitoring regional jihadist activity, but its relations with the country's ruling military regime have deteriorated since it condemned last year's coup.\nIn turn, Niger has turned to Russia for assistance fighting Islamist insurgents in the south of the country. \nThe Russians deployed to Airbase 101 at Niger's international airport in Niamey are said to be military trainers. \nThey are said to be occupying a wing close to a contingent of US troops. \nAccording to Reuters, earlier this year officials in Niger told the US that about 60 Russian troops would be deployed to the country. It is unclear how accurate that figure is today. \nIt is also unclear how many American troops remain at Airbase 101.\nMost of the US troops in Niger are said to be at a drone base in the central city of Agadez, some 750km (460 miles) north-east of Niamey. \nRelations between the US and Russia have been deteriorating sharply since President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with the US leading Western efforts to supply weapons to the Ukrainians.  \nBut Paul Melly, West Africa analyst at the Chatham House think tank, says he sees no prospect of confrontation between the US and Russian troops.\nMr Melly told the BBC the Americans had tried hard to remain in Niger, but that the country's military leadership had rebuffed their attempts to link their security assistance to a timetable to return to civilian rule.\n\"For the junta, the attraction of the Russians is that they make no demands about governance and democratic rules,\" Mr Melly said.\nIn March, Niger ordered all US troops to leave the country. Military spokesperson Col Amadou Abdramane accused the US of raising objections about the allies that Niger had chosen. \nMr Melly said that there was no evidence the Russians had been urging Niger - or Mali and Burkina Faso - to expel Western forces, but they were clearly taken advantage of the situation. And it remains unclear, he said, what contribution the Russians would make to Niger's security.\nThe head of the US Africa Command has told the BBC the US is keen to remain engaged with Niger - as well as Chad.\nGen Michael Langley said that violent extremist organisations were the biggest threat to Africa's stability. \nOn Wednesday, dozens of of troops pulled out of Chad, after the country's military leaders raised concerns over their presence ahead of the 6 May elections.\nSeveral other military-led countries in the Sahel region have also recently strengthened ties with Russia and cut them with France, the former colonial power, as they try to fight an Islamist insurgency in the region.\nGen Langley said that the \"ultimate goal\" of the US was to continue a dialogue with those countries that have been taken over by military regimes to get them \"on a roadmap back to democracy\".\nLast year, Niger and Burkina Faso - which also experienced recent military coups - announced they were following Mali in withdrawing from the G5 international force set up to fight Islamists in the region. \nThe three military-run countries have instead set up their own grouping - the Alliance of Sahel States.",
    "\"All of Kashmir was, is and will remain a part of India,\" says actor Kiran Karmarkar in a recent hit film on the government's 2019 decision to revoke Indian-administered Kashmir's autonomy.\nA stocky man dressed in a starched white kurta, Karmarkar looks the part as Indian Home Minister Amit Shah in Article 370 - the film named after the constitutional provision that conferred special privileges on the Himalayan region, which is claimed by both India and Pakistan.\nThe scene is a real-to-reel depiction of Mr Shah's speech in the parliament moments after his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government announced it was doing away with the law.\nWhen the film released in February, some critics called it \"thinly veiled\" propaganda which \"justified many questionable actions\" of the government.\nBut the film was endorsed by top BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. \nMade on a budget of approximately 200m rupees ($2.39m, \u00a31.9m), the film eventually grossed over 1.1bn rupees worldwide.\nSince Mr Modi first came to power in 2014, the Hindi film industry has produced several films referencing government policies. But in the past four years, experts say a lot them have begun to explicitly steer towards propaganda - in 2019, a biopic of Mr Modi released just as polls closed.\nFive years on, as the country heads to another election, a clutch of films - all centred around the BJP's Hindu nationalist ideology - are in the pipeline or have been released.\nTwo of them - Accident or Conspiracy: Godhra and The Sabarmati Report - are based on the deadly anti-Muslim riots that broke out in Gujarat in 2002. Veer Savarkar, a biopic celebrating the legacy of the controversial 20th-Century Hindu nationalist leader, includes a dialogue that claims India would have been free of British rule much earlier if it wasn't for independence leader Mahatma Gandhi. \nFilm critics say the slew of releases points to the solidifying of a new genre of films that plainly aligns with the ruling party's ideology. They add that not all of them work at the box-office, but the stories with their outright fabrications of key events play a part in shaping public perception.\n\"Cinema has been weaponised for ideology on a scale not seen before,\" says Nandini Ramnath, film critic at Scroll.in. \"These films seek to challenge what we think we know about historical personages or important historical incidents. They are out to create a new alt-history.\"\nThis has also sparked concerns about the future of Bollywood, one of India's few cultural spaces whose appeal cuts across religious and political divisions, making it a unique binding force.\nFilmmakers behind these projects, however, reject the claim. \"My films are not political, they are of human interest,\" says Sudipto Sen, director of The Kerala Story - the 2023 film which claimed to tell the \"true story\" of Hindu and Christian women lured into converting to Islam and joining the Islamic State (IS) group. \nSen says his views don't reflect that of any political party and claims that his film angered many because of its \"exposition of the truth\". But when the film released, the Supreme Court ordered the makers to add a disclaimer that it was a fictionalised account and did not have \"authentic data\" to back its claim of 32,000 such conversions.\nOf course, this is not the first time Bollywood has tapped into nationalism and sold it to a willing audience. The industry has a history of high-octane patriotic, sometimes jingoistic, films. These films dramatise stories of heroes fighting a cast of villains - ranging from malevolent terrorists and corrupt politicians to tyrant colonisers.\nIndians also love to watch hyper-fictionalised films based on military victories, many of which show Pakistan as the \"enemy\" in what's supposed to be a reflection of real-life fault lines. \n\"Bollywood does not always get the facts right - in fact, it almost never does,\" says Ruchika Sharma, who teaches history at Delhi University. \"The industry has always taken liberties with storytelling to create the perfect legend.\" \nBut filmmakers, she adds, are now coming up with their own parallel versions of history that are not rooted in facts and amount to \"a destruction of the historical genre\".\n\"There is also a deliberate creation of binaries and the depictions have become dangerously sectarian.\"\nShe is particularly critical of Samrat Prithviraj, a 2022 film about a 12th-Century Hindu king who was killed in a battle against Muhammad of Ghor, a ruler from a region now in Afghanistan. \nMs Sharma says the film's constant reference to him as a Muslim invader was \"jarring and completely ahistorical\" because early Sanskrit texts describe him in \"deeply casteist terms\" and not on the basis of his religion.\n\"Every century of India's history is capable of giving us a drama as epic as the Game of Thrones,\" she adds. \"Yet we want to be stuck in this Hindu-Muslim divide.\"\nPrithviraj didn't do well, but box-office",
    "The next chapter of campus protests may soon begin, with universities across the US preparing for possible disruptions at graduation ceremonies.\nFour universities rocked by pro-Palestinian protests will hold graduations this weekend.\nMany others, including Columbia University, have scheduled ceremonies throughout the month and in June. \nUniversities are working to enhance security while protesters contemplate walkouts and other possible actions.\nProtesters set up camps and staged campus demonstrations to call on their universities to cut ties with Israel over the war in Gaza. \nMany colleges responded by calling police, leading to thousands of arrests. \nThere have been demonstrations at nearly 140 institutions across 45 states and Washington DC since the protests started at Columbia University last month, according to a BBC tally. \nStudent protesters have so far, for the most part, been quiet about plans for disruptions at graduations, which are known as commencements in the US. \nAt Indiana University, however, IU Divest and the Palestine Solidarity Committee - whose camp at Indiana University was cleared by police twice in recent weeks - have called for a walk-out at graduation events. \n\"Make your pro-Palestine stance clear at the 'Liberated Zone' instead,\" reads a post on Instagram, referencing a protest area at the university's campus in Bloomington. \"Join us in wearing your keffiyeh along with your cap and gown.\" \nThe walk-out will be timed to happen when Pamela Whitten, the university president, begins to speak. \nMs Whitten faced a no-confidence vote earlier in April from faculty members concerned about academic freedom after the cancellation of a Palestinian artist's exhibition and the suspension of a faculty member who served as a sponsor for a pro-Palestinian student group. \nFaculty members have also discussed holding \"a silent protest\" outside the commencement to make their displeasure known without interfering with the event, according to two sources who asked to remain anonymous.\nThe University of Michigan, Ohio State University and the University of Connecticut - all of which have experienced demonstrations over the last two weeks - have graduations on 4 and 5 May.\nUniversity of Michigan officials have announced plans for designated protest areas, where banners and flags will be prohibited and protesters will be subject to security screenings.\nThe commencement will be watched over by volunteers who will \"respond to disruptions, beginning with warnings\", according to the university's website. \nAlifa Chowdhury, of the Tahrir Coalition protest group, declined to comment on whether any disruptions were planned.  She said the university had \"completely ignored\" offers to negotiate.\n\"It makes sense that they have been implementing strategies and training staff to make sure protests aren't happening,\" she said.\nNearly 200 miles (320km) to the south, Ohio State University President Ted Carter has vowed to protect students' right to free speech while at the same time enforcing rules that bar \"intentional disruptions of university events, classes, exams or programming, including commencement\".\nHeba Latif, a Palestinian-American student and co-president of the school's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), would not say whether any protests were planned for the 5 May commencement ceremony. \nGraduation is scheduled for 15 May at Columbia. Police entered the campus earlier this week to clear a student occupation and are due to remain on campus throughout the commencement season.\nMahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian international student at Columbia, told the BBC that the protest movement would continue regardless.\n\"Students have been protesting since October,\" said Mr Khalil.\n\"They've received disciplinary notices from the university, and suspensions, probation, and that has not stopped anyone. \n\"I don't see how bringing in the police will stop this movement.\"\nProtesters at Columbia did not reply when asked repeatedly if any disruptions were planned.

    "There was a time when it seemed Tesla could do no wrong. \nIn little more than a decade, it went from technology upstart to mass-market carmaker, invested billions in its clean energy business, and saw its value rocket.\nBut now the company is struggling with falling car sales and intense competition from Chinese brands, as well as problems with its much-hyped Cybertruck.\nLower sales have hit its revenues, and hurt its profits. Its share price has fallen by more than a quarter since the start of the year. \nIt has cut prices in major markets, and is in the process of laying off some 14,000 employees - 10% of its global workforce. Those affected include senior executives and the entire team responsible for its much-admired supercharger network. \nSo is all of this just a bump in the road, or are the wheels coming off the Tesla bandwagon?\n\"It's about breaking a spell,\" explained Elon Musk to a specially invited audience at Tesla's California factory back in June 2012.\n\"The world has been under the illusion that electric cars can't be as good as gasoline cars,\" he said.\nMusk was speaking at the launch of the new Tesla Model S, a car he insisted would shatter that illusion. It was no empty promise. \nAt the time electric cars had a long-standing reputation for being slow, uninspiring and impractical, with very limited range.\nAlthough new models such as the Nissan Leaf were starting to develop a niche following, they had yet to make much of an impact on the wider market.\nThe Model S was powerful, had sportscar performance, and could travel up to 265 miles on a single charge. It wasn't cheap, starting at $57,000 (\u00a347,000) in the US for the lowest performance version, but it certainly made a point.\nSince then, Tesla has launched four more models, including the Model X SUV, the \"affordable\" Model 3 and Model Y, and the Cybertruck. \nIt now has huge, so-called gigafactories building cars in Shanghai and Berlin, in addition to its original facility in Fremont, California, and a number of other US sites. Last year, it delivered 1.8 million cars, suggesting it has established itself firmly as a mass-market manufacturer. \nBut according to Professor Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University's Centre for Automotive Industry Research, that is part of the problem. \"When Tesla first emerged, it had an exciting new product, a charismatic CEO, and it came across as really pioneering,\" he explains.\nNow though, the company \"is no longer the entrepreneurial new entrant and upstart disrupter, but increasingly an industry incumbent with all the challenges this brings when faced with a growing array of competitors in the same market space\".\nOther companies, like China's Nio, are offering more exciting products, says Prof Wells, while fellow Chinese firm BYD offers good performance at lower prices. \"Basically, the world has caught up with Tesla,\" he says.\nThere is no doubt that there is a lot more competition than there used to be. Following the diesel emissions scandal that engulfed it in 2015, Volkswagen began ploughing money into electric vehicles. \nAnd as governments around the world began looking seriously at eventual bans on the sale of new petrol and diesel models, other established manufacturers soon followed. Customers looking for an electric car with decent range and performance now have plenty of options to choose from. \nIn China, meanwhile, policymakers have for years seen the development of electric vehicles (EVs) as an opportunity to take a significant share of the global market, and promoted their development. The result has been the rapid growth of brands such as BYD. It overtook Tesla to become the world's biggest manufacturer of electric cars at the end of 2023, although a subsequent drop in sales allowed Tesla to regain its crown in the first three months of this year.\nAt the same time, as the EV market has become more established, in many parts of the world subsidies to help consumers buy them have been reined in. That may be one reason why the rampant growth in EV sales in recent years has eased off - and why the manufacturers themselves are having to drop their prices.\nAccording to independent auto analyst Matthias Schmidt, this has certainly had an impact on Tesla.\n\"Finance ministers who were previously happy to offer attractive incentives for the purchase of a battery electric vehicle in a market environment that appeared bare-shelved, with essentially a Tesla or a Tesla on offer, are now slamming their purses shut,\" he says. \nOne market in which this appears to have had a profound effect is Germany. A subsidy scheme offering thousands of euros off the cost of a new electric vehicle was abruptly ended in December. \nEV sales there fell sharply in the first three months of this year, with Tesla suffering a 36% drop compared to the same period in 2023.\nThe question now is whether Tesla can regain lost momentum. Its maverick chief executive, Elon Musk appears to be pinning his hopes on the company becoming a leader in",
    "Turkey has suspended all trade with Israel over its offensive in Gaza, citing the \"worsening humanitarian tragedy\" in the strip. \nThe Turkish trade ministry said the measures would be in place until Israel allowed an \"uninterrupted and sufficient flow\" of aid into Gaza. \nTrade between the two countries was worth almost $7bn (\u00a35.6bn) last year.\nIsrael's foreign minister accused Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of acting like a \"dictator\".\nIsrael Katz said on X that Mr Erdogan was \"disregarding the interests of the Turkish people and businessmen and ignoring international trade agreements\".\nHe added that he had instructed the foreign ministry to find alternatives for trade with Turkey, with a focus on local production and imports from other countries.\nThe ministry also says it will also take action to reduce economic connections between Turkey and the Palestinian Authority and Gaza, the BBC understands. \nTurkish Trade Minister Omer Bolat criticised Israel's \"uncompromising attitude\" towards a ceasefire, as well as the humanitarian situation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah: \"Turkey has suspended all export and import with Israel until a permanent ceasefire is established and the aid into the Gaza is allowed without any interruption.\"\nIn 1949, Turkey was the first Muslim-majority country to recognise Israel. But relations have worsened in recent decades. \nIn 2010, Turkey broke off diplomatic ties with Israel after 10 pro-Palestinian Turkish activists were killed in clashes with Israeli commandos who boarded a Turkish-owned ship trying to break Israel's maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip.\nRelations were restored in 2016, but both countries expelled each other's top diplomats two years later in a dispute over Israel's killing of Palestinians amid protests on the Gaza-Israel border.\nMr Erdogan has become increasingly strident in his criticism of Israel since the deadly Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October last year.\nHe has repeatedly criticised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, comparing him to Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini and Joseph Stalin and dubbing him \"the butcher of Gaza\".  \nMr Netanyahu has said Turkey's leader is the last person who can preach morality to Israel. In March he said President Erdogan \"supports the mass murderers and rapists of Hamas, denies the Armenian genocide [and] massacres Kurds in his own country\".\nThe Turkish leader has for months come under domestic political pressure to announce measures against Israel, from both opponents and allies. \nHis ruling AK party suffered its worst defeat in two decades in local elections at the end of March, and many religious voters supported the Islamist New Welfare party, which had called for hardline measures against Israel.\nNot long after the vote, Turkey imposed restrictions on 54 products being exported to Israel, from iron and steel to jet fuel, pesticides and construction equipment. \nThe trade ministry in Ankara said on Thursday that the action was now being extended to all exports and imports. Israel was Turkey's 13th biggest export market in 2023, receiving 2.1% of Turkish exports last year. Turkey was Israel's fifth biggest source of imports last year.\nIsrael has come under increasing criticism for conditions in the Gaza Strip. A UN-backed assessment said last month that 1.1 million people were facing catastrophic hunger and that famine was imminent in northern Gaza by May.\nOn Thursday, the White House said a pier built by the US military to facilitate the flow of aid into the territory would be open within days.\nThe US has published photos showing logistics vessels and personnel assembling the floating pier from steel segments, next to a US Navy ship.\nHowever, the UN says a maritime corridor can never be a substitute for delivery by land, and that land routes are the only way to bring in the bulk of supplies needed.\nEarlier this week, Israel reopened the Erez Crossing into the northern Gaza strip for aid convoys, under pressure from its Western allies and following repeated appeals from international aid organisations.\nHowever, Jordan said some of its aid lorries were attacked by Israeli settlers before reaching the crossing.\nA recent UN-backed report offered hard statistical evidence that the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza was turning into a man-made famine.\nThe UN's most senior human rights official, Volker T\u00fcrk, told the BBC that there was a \"plausible\" case that Israel was using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza.\nIsrael denies limiting aid deliveries and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute it to those in need inside Gaza. \nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 253 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 34,500 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nOn Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Israel and ",
    "Former White House aide Hope Hicks became emotional towards the end of her testimony Friday afternoon during former US President Donald Trump's hush-money trial. \nMs Hicks served as Mr Trump's campaign spokesperson during 2016 and was a close confidante. \nMr Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal the payment. \nHe has denied all wrongdoing. \nMs Hicks served as the Trump campaign's press secretary and held two stints as the White House communications director. She said after taking the stand in the New York courtroom: \"I'm really nervous.''\nMs Hicks also teared up at one point on the stand after a Trump lawyer asked if a White House position had been created so she could come on board. She returned after taking a short break.  \nHicks testified about her experience working with the former president and learning of the Access Hollywood tape recorded in 2005 that shows Mr Trump saying he could \"grab women\" by their genitals because he was famous. It surfaced weeks before the 2016 presidential election.\nMs Hicks started her testimony by answering questions about the events surrounding the tape's release. \nShe said at the time she was \"a little stunned\" to hear the tape and added she had \"the sense that this was going to be a massive story\".\nThe Washington Post obtained the tape, and the reporter on the story, David Fahrenthold, emailed Ms Hicks asking for comment from Trump's presidential campaign.\nShe testified that his email was her first warning about the tape and reviewed the email on a screen in the courtroom. \nMs. Hicks said she forwarded the email to several top campaign staffers, including Jason Miller, Kellyanne Conway, and Steve Bannon.\nShe said in the email: \"1) Need to hear the tape to be sure. 2) deny, deny, deny\".\nMs Hicks told the court it was a \"reflex\" to write \"deny, deny, deny.''\nCampaign aides then had a meeting, during which they shared the email with Mr Trump, Ms Hicks said.\n\"Everyone was just absorbing the shock of it... He [Trump] said that didn't sound like something he would say,\" Ms Hicks said during her testimony.  \n\"I was concerned, very concerned,\" she told the court.\nBBC News reporters are in the Manhattan courtroom covering the historic first criminal trial of a former US president. You'll find their updates and analysis on the BBC news website and app, and across TV, radio and podcasts.\n\"It complicated where we were trying to go with the campaign. It was pulling us backwards in a way that was going to be hard to overcome.\"\nWhen asked how Donald Trump reacted to the tape, Ms Hicks said she thinks Trump felt the recording was \"pretty standard stuff for two guys chatting with each other\".\nHicks later answered questions about Trump's reaction to a Wall Street Journal story, which alleged affairs with multiple women, including Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Hicks said Trump worried about the story. \"He was concerned how it would be viewed by his wife and he wanted me to make sure that the newspapers weren't delivered to their residence that morning,\" she testified. \nProsecutors asked Ms Hicks about messages she exchanged with Mr Cohen after the Wall Street Journal published the story.  \nMr Cohen wrote to Hicks that the story was \"lots of innuendos with little facts\". Hicks responded: \"I agree with most of that\" but said the article would get traction because \"the media is the worst\".  \nMr Cohen later replied to say the story was getting \"little to no traction\".  \nHicks explained in court that the story attracted a smaller audience than the story about the Access Hollywood tape. \nThroughout her testimony, even when detailing behind-the-scenes responses to damaging news, Ms Hicks often spoke positively about her former boss. She reserved her harshest assessments for Cohen. \nAsked if she would agree that Cohen would protect Mr Trump out of the \"kindness of his heart\", as the former president had claimed, Ms Hicks replied: \"That would be out of character for Michael.'' \nMs Hicks said that while Cohen was not involved in the campaign directly, he frequently tried to inject himself into it. \n\"He liked to call himself 'Fixer' or 'Mr Fix-it',\" Hicks said. \"And it was only because he first broke it.\" \nMs Hicks also testified about David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer magazine. \nShe said she did not recall being at a 2015 meeting between the former president, Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and Mr Pecker, according to her testimony. It was during this meeting that Pecker agreed to suppress negative stories about Trump - including alleged affairs - to help boost his campaign, Pecker testified.\nMr. Pecker was involved in the hush-money payment to Playboy model Karen McDougal to buy her story about an alleged affair with Trump, he testified last week.\nMs Hicks recalled phone calls between Mr Pecker and Trump, including one in which Trump congratulated Pecker on a story about Trump political opponent Dr B",
    "As Donald Trump sits at the defence table in the wood-panelled Manhattan courtroom over the next several weeks, he will be joined by a cast of characters who could feature in a Hollywood blockbuster. \nThere are a slate of intriguing potential witnesses, including an adult film actress, a fixer-turned-star-witness, a loyal money-man convicted of tax fraud and others. \nA white-collar defence lawyer who has bet his career on defending Mr Trump is leading the former president's defence team. Meanwhile, Manhattan's first black district attorney has assembled a crack team of Manhattan prosecutors who are very familiar with Mr Trump and his organisation. \nAnd the entire case is overseen by a seasoned New York Supreme Court judge who is well aware of Mr Trump's courtroom troubles and behaviour. \nMr Trump faces 34 charges of falsifying business records to disguise a hush-money payment to a woman with whom he allegedly had an affair. He has pleaded not guilty and denies having the affair. Below are the central players to know in the historic case. \nStormy Daniels - the adult film star - says she met Mr Trump in 2006 at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada. Ms Daniels - real name Stephanie Clifford - was 27 years old at the time, and a rising star in the adult film industry. She claims that Mr Trump propositioned her, and the two had sex soon after their introduction.\nMr Trump denies the encounter happened, but Ms Daniels alleges that a $130,000 (\u00a3105,000) hush-money payment she received from Michael Cohen - a lawyer for the Trump Organization - just before the 2016 election was to keep her silent about the affair. \nSince her allegations became public, she has become a frequent target of Mr Trump and his allies, but she has said that she is committed to testifying against the former president. \nMichael Cohen - the fixer - started working as Mr Trump's personal lawyer in 2006. He pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance crimes in 2018 over making the hush-money payment to Ms Daniels, but he maintains that he sent the money at Mr Trump's direction. \nHe alleges that the former president aimed to conceal the scheme and avoid scandal by reimbursing Mr Cohen via a series of payments that were recorded as legal expenses. Mr Trump has called his former confidant a liar, and his legal team has attempted to block Mr Cohen's testimony. \nAt one time, Mr Cohen said he would take a bullet for the former president. But he later became a key witness in investigations of Mr Trump - including Robert Mueller's probe into allegations of the Trump campaign colluding with the Kremlin.\nDavid Pecker - the tabloid publisher - is former CEO of American Media Inc (AMI), the parent company of the National Enquirer. When he led that tabloid, he pursued a practice known as \"catch-and-kill\" to support Mr Trump's 2016 presidential run. He did this by buying the rights to stories that cast Mr Trump in a bad light. He would then decline to publish them, which effectively suppressed the damaging information. He was the trial's first witness.\nKaren McDougal - the Playboy model - claims to have had an illicit affair with Mr Trump in 2006 and 2007, which the former president also denies. She says she was paid $150,000 by American Media Inc, the parent company of the National Enquirer, for her story. It forced her to keep quiet about the purported tryst. \nHope Hicks - the former White House aide - is expected to take the stand. A former press secretary for Mr Trump's 2016 campaign, Ms Hicks could play a pivotal role in the trial as one of his former close confidantes. \n Her name has already come up several times during the first three weeks of the trial. She was present at a 2015 meeting between Mr Trump, Cohen and Mr Pecker, when the tabloid publisher agreed to suppress negative stories about Trump to help boost his campaign, Mr Pecker testified.  Ms Hicks was also privy to the details of the hush-money payment to Ms McDougal, Mr Pecker said.\nDino Sajudin - the former Trump Tower doorman - could also take the stand. Mr Trump's team allegedly paid him hush-money as well, after he tried to sell a story to the National Enquirer about an unsubstantiated rumour that Mr Trump once fathered a child out of wedlock.  \nJustice Juan Merchan - the seasoned New York jurist - has previously spent time with Mr Trump in a Manhattan courtroom. He presided over the Trump Organization's tax fraud case that resulted in a hefty fine and jail time for the company's chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg.\nThat means the judge is well acquainted with Mr Trump's orbit and his courtroom tactics to delay, deny and deflect. That behaviour will likely draw Justice Merchan's ire. While he may be soft-spoken, he has earned the reputation of being a no-nonsense jurist. He has already shut down Mr Trump once during jury selection. \nMeanwhile, Mr Trump has claimed on social media that \"there has virtually never been a more conflicted judge than this one\", and he has attacked Justic",
    "Humans may have caught leprosy from squirrels in medieval times, researchers say.\nThey studied human and red squirrel bones from archaeological sites in Winchester, southern England, and found they had closely related strains of the bacteria that causes it.\nLeprosy is a chronic disease infectious between humans that attacks the skin, nerves and mucous membranes. No-one is thought to have caught it inside the UK for 70 years but it's still endemic in many parts of the world.\nArmadillos carry it and are suspected of passing it on to humans. Some modern red squirrels in the UK also have it, but there has never been a reported case of transmission to humans and experts say the risk is very low.\nIt\u2019s the first time a medieval animal has been identified as a host for the disease.\n\n\"The finding of leprosy in modern squirrels was surprising and then it's incredible that we found it in the medieval period,\" said study co-author Dr Sarah Inskip of the University of Leicester.\n\n\"It really goes against the narrative that it was a human disease specifically,\" she said.\n\nIt's not clear whether squirrels in medieval times gave humans leprosy or the other way around.\n\nBut the shared strain suggests it was circulating between people and animals in the Middle Ages in a way that hadn\u2019t been detected before, the researchers say.\n\nBack then, squirrel fur was used as a fine lining for clothes and some people also had pet squirrels. They were particularly popular with women. \nThe researchers studied 25 human and 12 squirrel samples.\n\nThe human remains came from a Winchester leprosarium (hospital for people with leprosy) and the squirrel remains from a nearby pit used by furriers.\n\nPrevious studies found that modern red squirrels from Scotland and Brownsea Island off the coast of southern England carry leprosy. \n\nPublic health England says the probability of humans catching it from squirrels is very low and there has never been a reported transmission.\n\n\nLeprosy is one of the oldest recorded diseases in human history and is still present  in Asia, Africa, and South America.\n\nThere are more than 200,000 new cases reported every year.\n\nIt's not known exactly how it spreads between people but prolonged, close contact with someone untreated, over many months, is needed to catch the disease.\n\n\u201cThe history of leprosy is far more complex than previously thought,\u201d said senior author of the study, Prof Verena Sch\u00fcnemann of the University of Basel in Switzerland.\n\n\u201cThere has been no consideration of the role that animals might have played in the transmission and spread of the disease in the past, and as such, our understanding of leprosy\u2019s history is incomplete until these hosts are considered.\" \n\nDr Stephen Walker, Associate Professor at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said: \"There's no doubt that in certain circumstances animals do appear to play a role, but the size of that role in global terms of leprosy hasn't been delineated and I would agree, does need more work.\n\"I think it highlights that we still have a lot of work to do to understand the transmission of this ancient disease better, in our efforts to try and reduce the impact globally.\"\n\nThe study is published in the journal, Current Biology.",
    "\"Most of my fame is based on people talking about songs or a gig they went to and a lot of the time, it\u2019s minutes of my time to make someone happy.\"\nAs understatements go, Richard Ashcroft\u2019s is something of a whopper.\nSince he announced his talents with The Verve\u2019s debut album A Storm In Heaven in 1993, his creativity, both while serving as the band\u2019s totemic frontman and as a mercurial solo artist, has delivered a storming and often sensational selection of songs.\nFew would deny him a little arrogance, not least because his magnum opus, 1998\u2019s Urban Hymns, which spawned four Top Ten singles in the shape of Bitter Sweet Symphony, The Drugs Don\u2019t Work and Lucky Man, remains one of the top 20 biggest-selling albums of all time in the UK, ahead of Adele\u2019s 25, Ed Sheeran's X and U2\u2019s The Joshua Tree.\nAnd arrogance, thanks to the much-loved and often parodied video for Bitter Sweet Symphony which saw Ashcroft striding down a street while passers-by bounced off him, is what he has somewhat unfairly become known for.\nA quarter of a century on from that, the ever-angular and stridently confident Ashcroft admits it was something he played up to at the time.\n\u201cI was the mouthy lead singer,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sport, and there\u2019s levels to it, and you want to be at the top, you want to be the Messi, and you want to be the George Best.\u201d\nHe says it was about doing \u201ceverything with conviction\u201d, which was fine \u201cas long as it was not just empty arrogance\u201d.\n\u201cThere was a lot of people that got it wrong and tried but they had nothing to back it up with.\n\u201cI was like \u2018I am going to write some of the best songs\u2019.\n\u201cA few years later, I am walking all over the world hearing my song.\u201d\nNow in his early fifties, Ashcroft is much more sanguine than he was \u2013 and he is ready to pass on the wisdom of his years.\nAnd in his sights, thanks in part to his son\u2019s musical tastes and what he\u2019s heard at home, is what he sees as the problems in today\u2019s music.\n\u201cThe youth have such easy access to a plethora of stuff, but they are very discerning now,\u201d he says.\n\u201cMy son loves Lana Del Rey [and] there\u2019s a certain aesthetic and style and a quality with that, but they\u2019re looking for other things after all the plastic stuff.\n\u201cIn reality, we\u2019re still human and we still want the good stuff.\n\u201cWe still want quality, we still want the stuff that moves us.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Ashcroft, with two Ivor Novello Awards for Songwriter of the Year and Outstanding Contribution to British Music, has the ability to provide what he believes is needed.\nAnd he says he is determined to do so, as a way of repaying what he received as a teenager growing up in the shadow of Manchester\u2019s vibrant music scene in the 1980s.\n\"The Smiths\u2026 Happy Mondays\u2026 these people were all relatively local,\u201d he says.\n\u201cThey were not from America, and I thought \u2018these people are from Manc, I can get a bus to there\u2019 and that had quite a profound effect.\u201d\nHe says that despite being \u201cbanned from doing music at GCSE because I was naughty on the xylophone\u201d, that wider musical schooling the region gave him spurred him to success.\n\"I won the lottery in the sense of when I got into music as I could go and see these people,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIt was such a beautiful education.\"\n\"It is important when you see people from the streets you live in, and it was the same for me watching the Stone Roses back in the day.\n\u201cYou think \u2018oh wow, maybe I could to this\u2019.\u201d\nHe says passing on that spirit to a new generation of bands is vitally important to him in order to give them the confidence to follow in his footsteps, as he did with his heroes back in the early 1990s.\n\"When you first tell people you\u2019re going to be in a band or creative, you get mocked a little bit, because you might not be amongst anyone who\u2019s ever done it before,\" he says.\n\"But you have to be a pioneer [and] you also have to take control over your life and your destiny.\"\nHe says a major step in his efforts to inspire will be two shows at Wigan Warriors\u2019 Robin Park, which have been titled simply as \u201cThe Homecoming\u201d.\nFor Ashcroft, it will be a chance to relive memories of one of his favourite gigs with his former band.\nIn May 1998, more than 30,000 fans thronged on to Wigan\u2019s Haigh Hall estate to witness what Ashcroft calls, in a nod to the \u201cmythical\u201d landmark show by Stone Roses eight years earlier, \"my own version of Spike Island\".\n\"It was a very celebratory day for the fans and the people and the locals,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI was born in Billinge Hospital and when I stepped on to the stage, I turned around and I could actually see it in the distance.\u201d\nHe says such was the effect of the show, which came at the height of The Verve\u2019s fame in the months after Urban Hymns was released, that years later, \u201clads in the pub were like \u2018if you see Rich, tell him nice one, because it just gave a sense of pride on that for the town\u2019\u201d.\n\u201cA lot of stories came from the Haigh Hall gig and it influenced a lot of people and inspired them a bit.\u201d\nAnd it is that sense of pride he aims to bri",
    "Apple sales have fallen in almost every market across the globe, according to the latest results from the tech giant.\nThe company said that demand for its smartphones dropped by more than 10% in the first three months of this year, while overall sales fell in every geographic region except for Europe.\nApple said that overall, revenues across the company declined by 4% to $90.8bn (\u00a372.5bn), which was the biggest drop for more than a year.  \nNevertheless, the results were not as bad as expected and Apple's share price rose in after-hours trading in New York. \nThe company said the figures were distorted by Covid-related supply disruptions, which led to unusually strong sales during the same period last year. \nIt said it expected sales to return to growth in the months ahead, noting upcoming product launches and investments in artificial intelligence (AI). \nOverall sales in the critical greater China market dropped by 8%. Mr Cook attempted to reassure investors about the state of the business in the world's second largest economy, noting that iPhone sales were actually up in \"mainland\" China.  \n\"I maintain a great view of China in the long term,\" he said. \nCompetition in that market has been intensifying from local rivals such Huawei.\nGil Luria, senior software analyst at DA Davidson, said companies such as Huawei do well in China because \"it is the homegrown brand\".\n\"But in terms of features, functionality and prestige, iPhone still has an advantage over any other handset,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.\n\"So any time consumers get the choice and have the resources they\u2019re going to buy an iPhone \u2013 that\u2019s not any different in China.\"\nStruggles at the company - which has endured a streak of sales declines for five of the last six quarters - marked a contrast with the wider market.\nGlobally, smartphone shipments rose 10% in the first three months of the year, expanding after a long lacklustre period, according to research firm Canalys. \nMr Luria said that for Apple, there hasn't been \"significant improvements to the handset\" since the iPhone 12 was launched almost four years ago \"when Apple introduced 5G connectivity which compelled a lot of consumers to upgrade the phone\".\nHe added: \"What they\u2019re hoping for now is that they can introduce enough new AI features into the iPhone 16 which will come out later this year in order to finally drive a big iPhone upgrade cycle.\u201d\nApple is also facing legal battles with regulators in the US and Europe over its app store fees.\nA separate anti-monopoly lawsuit in the US against Google threatens the lucrative payments Apple receives from the search giant in exchange for making Google the default search engine on Safari, Apple's internet browser.\nAccording to court filings, those payments amounted to about $20bn in 2022, a sum that helped lift Apple profits.\nPre-tax profit for the three months was flat at $28bn and the company announced that it was setting aside $110bn to buy back shares.\nFinance chief Luca Maestri said Apple sales were expected to rise in the \"low single digits\" in the three months to June. \nHe added that the firm expected double digit growth in its services business, offering more guidance than the company typically provides.\nLooking ahead, Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, said: \"China is holding up better than expected and there are a host of upcoming events/catalysts on the horizon that could improve investor sentiment.\"",
    "UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron has said it is up to Ukraine to decide how to use British weapons and insisted it has the right to strike targets on Russian territory.\nDuring a visit to Kyiv, he said the UK would provide \u00a33bn ($3.75bn) per year for as long as necessary.\n\"Just as Russia is striking inside Ukraine, you can quite understand why Ukraine feels the need to make sure it's defending itself,\" Lord Cameron said.\nRussia condemned what it called \"another very dangerous statement\".\n\"This is a direct escalation of tension around the Ukrainian conflict, which would potentially pose a threat to European security,\" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.\nLord Cameron did not directly endorse the idea of British weapons being used to strike targets inside Russia. \nBut until now, the UK has generally let it be understood - without spelling it out - that weapons such as the long range Storm Shadow missile should only be used inside sovereign Ukrainian territory. There have been several examples of its successful use in Russian-occupied Crimea, including against elements of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet.\nHowever, coming on the heels of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s pledge to give Ukraine \u00a33bn ($3.76bn) in military assistance every year for the foreseeable future, it seems Lord Cameron wanted to emphasise that it is up to Ukraine to decide what it does with it.\nThe US has reportedly urged Ukraine to halt its strikes on oil refineries in Russia, fearing it could provoke an escalation in the conflict. \nMr Peskov also took aim at French President Emmanuel Macron, who said this week that the West would \"legitimately\" have to consider whether to send ground troops to Ukraine \"if the Russians were to break through the front lines, if there were a Ukrainian request\".\nMr Macron's remarks to The Economist were a \"very dangerous trend\", said the Kremlin spokesman. However, the French leader made clear in his interview that if Russia won in Ukraine, there would be no security in Europe.\nRussian forces have seized several villages in eastern Ukraine during recent advances, taking advantage of Ukraine's shortages of weapons and manpower.\nUkrainian intelligence officials also believe Russia is gearing up for a summer offensive in the north-eastern regions of Kharkiv and Sumy. \nThe commander of the national guard, Oleksandr Pivnenko, warned recently that Russia was preparing \"unpleasant surprises\" and quietly recruiting 30,000 people a month.\nA Russian strike on Kharkiv on Friday killed an elderly woman in her home, and a tram carrying passengers also came under fire, according to Mayor Ihor Terekhov.\n\nUkraine's military says Russia's immediate target is the strategic hilltop town of Chasiv Yar, 15km (9 miles) west of the devastated city of Bakhmut. \nOfficials believe the eastern town could enable Russian forces to attack major eastern cities such as Kramatorsk and Slovyansk. The military has suggested Moscow is keen to seize Chasiv Yar before Russians mark victory in World War Two on 9 May.\nHowever, a Ukrainian military spokesman has denied that Russian troops have broken through to the Siverskyi Donetsk-Donbas canal on the outskirts of the town.\nRussia claimed on Friday that its forces had captured three villages in Ukraine's east in the past two weeks. Military spokesman Lt Col Nazar Voloshyn said the invading force had gained a foothold in the village of Ocheretyne but Ukrainian soldiers were working to drive them out.\nLord Cameron, who met President Volodymr Zelensky in Kyiv, said it was Russia that had launched an attack into Ukraine and Ukraine \"absolutely has the right to strike back at Russia\".\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said his remarks were tantamount to admitting the West was involved in a \"hybrid war\" against Moscow.\nThe UK has provided billions of pounds in military support for Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, ranging from tanks and precision-guided missiles to air-defence systems.\nA year ago the UK confirmed it had begun supplying long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles with a range of more than 250km (155 miles).\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said he had appealed to Lord Cameron to help restore the country's energy infrastructure which has been badly damaged by repeated Russian missile strikes.\n\n\n",
    "Security is being tightened for the Eurovision Song Contest in Sweden's third city Malmo, with large demonstrations planned to coincide with the event and the country already on high alert.\nPolice and organisers say they're well-prepared and hoping for a \"joyful\" event. \nThe annual feel-good celebration of pop and showbiz is this year shrouded by complaints from some quarters over Israel's participation amid the war in Gaza. Sweden was already facing heightened security challenges, and Malmo is expecting one of the country's biggest ever policing efforts.\nAs many as 100,000 visitors are set to descend on this city on Sweden's south-west coast for the world's largest live music contest.\nColourful Eurovision banners decorate many of the city's streets, and it's the third time that Malmo is playing host, after Swedish artist Loreen won last year's competition in Liverpool, with her hit song Tattoo. \nA programme of festivities kicks off on Saturday, with semi-finals next Tuesday and Thursday, culminating in the grand final on 11 May. An estimated 200 million viewers worldwide are expected to tune in for the four-hour spectacle.\nForces have been drafted in from across Sweden, with reinforcements from neighbouring Denmark and Norway. Swedish police are usually armed, but some officers will carry larger weapons as a precautionary measure.\nMalmo police chief Petra Stenkula said the whole country was already \"on a terror level of four out of five\".\n\"I think it's obvious that the world's insecurity has also affected Eurovision,\" she told the BBC. \"In Sweden, and Malmo in particular, there have been protests against Israel taking part in the competition.\"\nThe police chief said there were no specific threats to the event, but the alert level was raised last August, following a spate of Quran-burnings that angered the Muslim world. \nAn internal police report, highlighted by Sweden's public broadcaster SVT, described Sweden as a \"priority target\" for violent jihadist groups. The 23-page threat assessment for Eurovision also cited unrest, cyber attacks and disruption of the broadcast as other potential risks.\n\"In Sweden, police are used to working with very complex issues, and we think we have good planning,\" said Petra Stenkula.\nCameras have also been set up and drones are being used for surveillance. Guests will also have to pass through airport-style security controls including scanners and searches, when entering venues and no bags are allowed.\n\"It's a huge thing for the city of Malmo. So, of course, it's important that everything works smoothly,\" said Per-Erik Ebbestahl, Malmo's security director. \"We feel very well prepared.\"\nAuthorities have been planning for months and also working with their counterparts in Liverpool, which hosted last year's competition. \"It's been very, very, helpful for us,\" he told the BBC.\nMalmo has hosted the Pope and also a Holocaust Remembrance conference two years ago. But the city's security director says what is new is the general threat towards Sweden and large gatherings.\n\"It's not aimed at Eurovision per se,\" he said, pointing out that similar security had been in place for recent ice hockey playoffs, and was also planned for this month's Taylor Swift concerts in Stockholm.\nFencing had been erected and additional cameras were being mounted when the BBC visited the Malmo Arena on Thursday. Inside the venue, rehearsals were already under way for a show featuring 37 acts.\n\"We have really exciting shows coming up,\" said Ebba Adielsson, SVT's executive Eurovision producer. \n\"We know the debate out there, we know about the demonstrations and we are well prepared. We hear it and we respect it,\" she said. \"But I sincerely hope that it doesn't overshadow it that much.\nIsraeli contestant Eden Golan, 20, and her song Hurricane will undoubtedly be in the spotlight. \nOriginally titled October Rain, the song had alluded to the Hamas attacks on southern Israel last 7 October. Israel's public broadcaster agreed to modify the lyrics, and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which is responsible for the contest, gave the song the green light.\nAbout 1,200 people were killed in Israel and 253 others taken hostage during the Hamas attacks.\nMore than 34,500 people have been killed in Gaza since then by Israeli's military offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nCommentators have suggested that it is one of the most politically-charged Eurovisions ever. \nEarlier this year, 1,000 Swedish musicians signed an open letter urging Israel's exclusion.  \nArtists have also been targeted by criticism, and in a statement last month the EBU said: \"We firmly oppose any form of online abuse, hate speech, or harassment directed at our artists.\" \nSpeaking to international reporters, this week Denmark's entrant SABA said she'd been under huge pressure: \"I've received a lot of messages and people can be very personal... even on the street.\" \nIsrael's National Security Council on Thursday issued ",
    "Former Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson was turned away from his local polling station after forgetting to bring acceptable photo ID. \nAs first reported by Sky News, he returned later with the necessary ID and was able to vote. \nHe cast his ballot in South Oxfordshire, where voters are choosing a police and crime commissioner.\nNew rules requiring photo ID to vote were introduced by Mr Johnson's government in the Elections Act 2022. \nThe change was rolled out last year, with local elections in May 2023 the first time voters needed to show ID. \nAccording to the Electoral Commission, about 14,000 people were unable to vote in last year's local elections in England as a result of the new rules.\nThere are 22 acceptable forms of ID, including passports, driving licences, older or Disabled Person's bus passes and Oyster 60+ cards.\nPeople who are registered to vote can also apply for a free document known as a Voter Authority Certificate. \nThe government has also said it intends to make veterans' ID cards a valid form of voter identification after some former service personnel were turned away from polling stations. \nArmy veteran Adam Diver, 48, said he felt \"gutted\" when he was turned away from a polling station in Fleetwood, Lancashire, after presenting his veterans' ID card. \nMr Diver, who served in the Army for 27 years, said he felt as if his service was \"invalidated\" when his card was rejected. \n\"I thought you could use it as an ID card. It's like a driving licence, you can't get any more official,\" he said.\nVeterans minister Johnny Mercer apologised to Mr Diver on social media.\n\"The legislation on acceptable forms of ID came out before the veterans ID cards started coming out in January this year,\" he wrote.\n\"I will do all I can to change it before the next one.\"\nA No 10 spokeswoman said: \"It is our intention for the new Veteran Card, which was rolled out in January, to be added to the official list.\"\nVeteran Cards have been issued to people leaving the army since 2018. They were rolled out more widely to all veterans in January this year. \nThe government is consulting on adding the card to the list of acceptable voter ID, which already includes armed forces identity cards.\nMeanwhile, Conservative MP Tom Hunt said his dyspraxia caused him to lose his passport and he had to arrange an emergency proxy vote. \nMr Hunt, who represents Ipswich, said he does not want to \"blame everything on my dyspraxia\", but it is \"well known that sadly we are slightly more prone to lose things\". \nHe warned people \"persecuting\" him online to be \"very careful with their words\". \nPeople can apply for an emergency proxy vote until 5pm on polling day if their ID has been lost, stolen or damaged.\nAsked about problems reported over voter ID, Transport Secretary Mark Harper said there were \"bound to be, when you have millions of people voting, a small number of issues\". \nHowever, he said he thought \"most voters have actually found it perfectly straightforward to vote with the necessary ID across the country\". \nAsked about Mr Johnson being turned away, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris, who served as his chief whip, told BBC Radio: \"As someone who knows Boris well, I can't say it completely surprises me... I do know that he then simply went home, got some ID, went back to the polling station and voted Conservative.\"  \nThe Electoral Commission said \"most voters who wanted to vote were able to do so\", despite voter ID requirements. \n\"We will now begin to collect evidence from voters, electoral administrators, partner organisations, and campaigners to understand their experiences of the elections and identify any potential obstacles to participation,\" a spokesman said.\nElectoral Commission chief executive Vijay Rangarajan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that large-scale campaigns to raise awareness of the rules appear to have been successful.\nAsked about issues some voters faced, he said: \"It looks as if these are teething problems at the moment but we're going to evaluate this really carefully.\"",
    "The government has been defeated in court - for a second time - for not doing enough to meet its targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.\nEnvironmental campaigners argued that the energy minister signed off the government's climate plan without evidence it could be achieved.\nThe High Court ruled on Friday that the government will now be required to redraft the plan again. \nIn response the government defended its record on climate action.\nA Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The UK can be hugely proud of its record on climate change. We do not believe a court case about process represents the best way of driving progress towards our shared goal of reaching net zero.\"\nThe legal challenge was brought by environmental groups Friends of the Earth, ClientEarth and The Good Law Project.\nTony Bosworth, lead campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said it was \"an embarrassing day for the government\".\nSpeaking outside the court to BBC News he said: \"What we now need to see is a climate plan which is robust, which is comprehensive and which is fair, which makes sure we meet all our climate targets, and which does that in a way which doesn't leave anybody behind.\"\nThe three groups had previously won a case against the government back in 2022 arguing that its Net Zero Plan was not detailed enough to explain how the UK would cut its emissions - as required by the Climate Change Act.\nIn response the government produced a plan which laid out how each of its policies would cut emissions. \nBut the campaigners said the former Energy Secretary Grant Shapps did not consider the risks to deliver the plan and signed it off assuming all the policies would be achieved. \nIn his judgement, Mr Justice Sheldon said: \"It is not possible to ascertain from the materials presented to the Secretary of State which of the proposals and policies would not be delivered at all, or in full.\"\nLater on Friday, the judge is expected to provide a deadline for reviewing the plan.\nAsked about the judgement, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he had not seen the ruling in detail but was \"proud of our track record\" on climate change.\nEd Miliband, Labour's shadow secretary of state for climate change and net zero, reacted to the High Court's ruling saying it signified a new low even for what he said was \"a government that has totally failed on energy and climate for fourteen years\".\nThe government had previously been warned that the plan was not sufficient by its own climate watchdog. \nWhen the new plan was published in March 2023 the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC) said it was even less confident that the government could achieve its climate goals than before it published the plan.\nThe UK has a target to reduce its emissions by 78% by 2035 against 1990 levels. But the UKCCC estimated the government plan would only deliver a fifth of the emissions cuts needed in the coming decade.\nIt said of the plan published in 2023: \"Despite over 3,000 pages of new detail, [our] confidence in the UK meeting its goals from 2030 onwards is now markedly less than it was in our previous assessment a year ago.\"\nIn particular the committee criticised the government's failure to support clean energy and its support for new fossil fuel projects.\nIn July 2023 Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced 100 new North Sea oil and gas licences - on the basis this would secure jobs and energy security for the UK.\nThe International Energy Agency has previously said there is no need for investment in new oil and gas projects to meet global energy demand.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every Tuesday.

Yeah, do it,\" he laughed.\nDame Joanna follows in the footsteps of comedian Catherine Tate, who fronted the jury last year, as well as previous alumni Nigella Lawson, Mel Giedroyc, Richard Osman and Cheryl Baker.\nEach country's jury is populated by five music professionals, who judge the finalists on their music and lyrics, assigning points to their 10 favourite acts.\nLast year, the UK panel gave the maximum 12 points to the eventual winner, Swedish singer Loreen. \nA separate televote also saw the UK public award Loreen five points. \nDame Joanna started her career as a model in the 1960s before transitioning into acting.\nShe was a Bond girl in the 1969 film On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and later had a brief but memorable role as Elaine Perkins in Coronation Street.\nHer first major part was in the TV action series The New Avengers, where she played the British intelligence agent Purdy.\nShe won a Bafta for her role as the outrageously boozy former model Patsy in the sitcom Absolutely Fabulous, and was nominated for a Tony Award after appearing in the Broadway revival of La B\u00eate in 2011.\nTen years later, she was made a Dame in the Queen's New Year Honours list for her services to drama, entertainment and charity.\nShe will deliver the UK's Eurovision scores in a year when controversy over Israel's participation has overshadowed the contest.\nMusicians and politicians in several countries called for the country to be suspended while the Israel-Gaza war continues.\nOrganisers have resisted calls for the country to be suspended, saying the show \"is not a contest between governments\".\nHowever, Israel was forced to change the lyrics of its song October Rain, after officials decided the original was too political.\nThe first version was widely considered to be a reference the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, with some lyrics paying tribute to the victims. It has now been rewritten under the revised title Hurricane.\nSeveral pro-Palestinian protests are planned for Malmo next week in the run-up to the contest, and the Jerusalem Post reported that Israeli contestant Eden Golan had arrived at the contest with \"three times\" the usual number of security guards.",
    "Foreign interference is a \"stain\" on Canada's electoral process and undermined the right to a system free from \"coercion or covert influence\", a public inquiry has found. \nIts report also found that China \"stands out as a main perpetrator\" of such interference.\nThe inquiry investigated meddling in Canada's last two general elections, in 2019 and 2021.\nBut it did not find the outcome of the votes had been affected.\n\"Our systems remain sound,\" said Commissioner Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue at a press conference, following the report's release on Friday.\n\"Voters were able to cast their ballots, their votes were duly registered and counted, and there is nothing to suggest that there was any interference whatsoever in this regard.\"\nThe preliminary report is the first of two expected by the commission. \nIt explores foreign meddling in the two elections as well as how information on interference was handled by senior officials during the election period.\nThe report says China \"clandestinely leveraged\" Canadian officials in an effort to help its \"favoured\" candidates win office in 2019. \nChina did so by using Canada-based officials as \"proxy agents\" to exclude \"political candidates perceived as 'anti-China' from attending\" local election-related events, the report says.\nThe report also says intelligence assessments indicated at least two transfers of funds - roughly $250,000 (\u00a3192,000) each - from Chinese officials in Canada, \"possibly for foreign interference-related purposes\".\nAnother of the foreign-meddling tactics mentioned in the report is the targeting of diaspora Canadians by threatening their families in their countries of origin. It accused both China and Russia.\nThe 194-page document is based on the first phase of hearings by the inquiry, which in April heard public testimony by witnesses including members of parliament, national security officials, senior government aides and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\nIn his testimony, Mr Trudeau defended his government's efforts to ensure election integrity and said the 2019 and 2021 federal votes were \"free and fair\" and decided only by Canadians.\nThe commission also held hearings behind closed doors on classified intelligence related to the matter. \nIn the public hearings, Canadians learned some of the ways China and other foreign governments could have attempted to interfere in the last two elections.\nIn one briefing note at the inquiry, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) said the Chinese government \"clandestinely and deceptively\" interfered in both elections.\nThe intelligence service has cautioned that the declassified information could be single-sourced, incomplete and with \"varying degrees of reliability\". \nSome of the allegations heard by the inquiry include: \nChina and India have repeatedly denied any allegations that they are among the countries that have interfered in Canada's affairs.\nThose affected by the alleged meddling efforts have accused officials and CSIS of not doing enough to combat it, or of keeping them in the dark altogether.\nThere will be more hearings this autumn with a final report by the inquiry expected at the end of the year.

    "Ever felt your contribution at work goes unnoticed? Try being a stunt actor.\nThey're some of the unsung heroes of the film industry, regularly risking their bodies and even their lives to thrill audiences.\nAnd when it all goes according to plan, you're not supposed to notice them.\n\"The better they are at their job, the more they disappear,\" Ryan Gosling told the BBC earlier this week.\nThe Canadian actor plays title character Colt Seavers in new blockbuster The Fall Guy - the story of a stuntman who gets seriously hurt on a film set.\nWith some exceptions such as Tom Cruise, who famously insists on doing almost all his own stunts, doubles usually take the place of A-list stars in the most nail-biting scenes.\nAnd The Fall Guy was no exception.\nSo both Ryan and and co-star Emily Blunt said they'd back calls for stunt performers to have their own category at the Oscars.\n\"They dress like us, they do the dangerous things for us. They take the hits for us, they put themselves in harm's way for us,\" said Ryan.\nCurrently there's no Academy Award dedicated to stunts but other bodies such as The Screen Actors Guild do celebrate them. \nUp-and-coming stunt actors have been telling BBC Newsbeat it's about time they got more recognition for their work on set, and the effort it takes to even get there.\nTo become a professional it helps to be signed on the British Stunt Register, which told Newsbeat there are 470 registered stunt performers working in the UK.\nGetting on to the books means mastering six disciplines, and for Catriona Scott those are scuba diving, horse riding, trampolining, taekwondo, rock climbing and stunt driving.\nThat doesn't happen overnight, and the 30-year-old from Edinburgh has been training for seven years.\n\"I studied at Glasgow University and I did a year abroad in America,\" she tells Newsbeat, after arriving on a motorcycle in true stuntwoman style. \n\"While I was there, I did a three-month internship in LA and I met two stunt performers. It was like, 'Oh, that's a job?!'\n\"As soon as I realised that was something that you could actually do as a job, it was like, 'that's what I want to do'.\"\nShe was inspired by films including Lord of The Rings and Harry Potter growing up, and her dream once she qualifies is to perform in a major film franchise.\nTwo stunt actors who know a thing or two about putting themselves in harm's way are Jules Wallace, from Glasgow, and Ayesha Hussain, from London.\nJules got into stunts after training in martial arts and has performed in fight scenes for productions including Enola Holmes and The Last Duel.\nAyesha, meanwhile, got scouted while working as a knife thrower and will soon appear in Deadpool 3.\nLike Catriona, they're both training for the BSR to take their careers to the next level.\n\"Stunt performers put in a lot of time and effort to get to where they are,\" says Jules. \"And they literally risk their lives on the job.\"\n\"It really is one of those jobs that you go to work and you could have the most safe, incredible team, but you still don't have 100% guarantee that you're not going to go home severely injured, or worse,\" adds Ayesha.\nThat was what happened to David Holmes - Daniel Radcliffe's stunt double in the Harry Potter series.\nIn January 2009 he broke his neck rehearsing a stunt for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and sustained a spinal injury that left him paralysed.\nAyesha says it's important for the industry to give greater visibility to stunt performers so audiences appreciate the work that goes into great stunts as well as inspire the next generation of talent. \n\"We deserve a bit more now,\" she says.\n\"There are so many gifted young people who would be an absolutely tremendous stunt performers but they just have no idea that it exists as a career.\"\nJules says it's \"good that people are taking the time to give them a little bit of recognition\" because there's not much out there.\n\"It would be wonderful to see stunts getting an Oscar,\" says Catriona.\n\"We are the reason why so many movies are so incredible,\" adds Ayesha.\n\"And literally every other department seems to have an Oscar category except us and we're the ones arguably taking the highest risk.\"\nNewsbeat has asked the Oscars whether they might consider an award for stuntmen and women but has not had a response.\nJoining the BSR will give you access to film and TV productions looking for stunt performers, but it's not easy to get on the list.\nThe six disciplines you need to master must cover different skills including strength, vehicles, fighting and falling. \nOnce an expert has tested you in these areas, a panel from the BSR will examine your training history before signing you off.\nEven then, you'll only be a probationary member and will continue to be graded until you reach the level of a stunt co-ordinator. \nThe BSR told Newsbeat it was \"fantastic\" to see The Fall Guy \"shine such light on the stunt community and the exceptional work they do\". \nNicholas Daines, a BSR coordinator whose stunt ",
    "A housing developer has gone into administration, leaving an estate it was working on unfinished.\nJME Developments, based in Higham Ferrers, Northamptonshire, owns the Little Stanion estate near Corby.\nResidents say they are worried the estate might not be finished.\nThe administrator says she is developing a \"plan for the way forward\".\nThe estate has been under construction for more than a decade and some houses and the village hall have not been built yet.\nJME Developments said in October it was hoping to finish the site in 2028, nearly eight years after construction should have been completed.\nThe developer was hoping that North Northamptonshire Council would waive sums it had agreed to pay back to the community for each home sold.\nAs first reported by the Northamptonshire Telegraph, the appointment of administrator Rachel Fowler to manage JME Developments' affairs followed a high-court application by the Alternative Bridging Corporation.\nMs Fowler told the BBC: \"I am working with the JME team and secured lenders to assess the works required on site and develop a plan for the way forward.  \n\"We are mindful of the residents already there and want to minimise the impact on them.\"\nA petition to wind up the company was presented in March by Ballycommon Services, which said it was a creditor of JME Developments.\nJME told residents it was dealing with the petition \"in a professional manner\".\nThe firm added: \"It would be appreciated if all would refrain from unhelpful gossip in advance of the court process.\"\n\nThe Telegraph reported that a letter had been sent by residents to North Northamptonshire Council asking for a public meeting about the situation.\nThey are concerned about roads not being completed on the estate and a community centre that was promised but never built.\nJason Smithers, Conservative leader of the council, said: \u201cWe have been made aware of the news about JME Developments going into administration. This is disappointing news for all concerned.\n\u201cWe are gathering information to fully understand the issues and will continue to monitor the situation.\u201d\nFollow Northamptonshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has called the overnight local elections results \"disappointing\" despite his party retaining the Tees Valley mayoralty.\nThe Conservatives have lost over 400 council seats, while Labour won the Blackpool South by-election.\nLabour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said voters showed Mr Sunak they wanted a change in the last big test of public opinion before a general election.\nNearly 90% of the 107 councils up for election have declared so far. \nSir Keir said the Blackpool result - a massive 26% swing to Labour - was a message to the Tory leader that it was time to move on and call a general election.\n\"That wasn't just a little message, that wasn't just a murmur, that was a shout from Blackpool - we want change,\" he said.\n\"And Blackpool speaks for the whole country - it's saying that we've had enough now.\"\nIn a rare bright spot for the Tories, Ben Houchen was elected for a third term in Tees Valley, with a much reduced majority.\nSpeaking at a press event in Teesside International Airport, Mr Sunak said the results showed at the general election election voters \"are going to stick with us\".\nMr Sunak said Labour \"knew they have to win here in order to win a general election\". But voters know \"the Conservatives are building a brighter future for Teesside and a brighter future of Britain,\" he added.\nLeading pollster Sir John Curtice said Lord Houchen's success was \"heavily personal\" and the results are not \"particularly reliable\" for an indication of Conservative fortunes in a general election.\nLord Houchen denied allegations he shied away from campaigning as a Conservative or the prime minister in his campaign literature.\nWhen asked whether the Conservatives could win another term in government, he told the BBC: \"There's always a chance but the government needs to do a lot better at delivering for people... We need to give them the excuse to vote for us.\"\nFormer vice-chair of the Conservative party Ben Bradley lost his bid to become the first mayor of the East Midlands. Labour's Claire Ward, the former MP for Watford, won the election with a 52,000 vote majority.\nLabour's Kim McGuinness had a comfortable win in the race to become the first mayor of the North East.\nAnd Labour's David Skaith won the new York and North Yorkshire mayoral election - which includes Mr Sunak's Richmond constituency - with a majority of almost 15,000 over the Conservatives.\nMost other mayoral results - including London, where Labour's Sadiq Khan is aiming to win a third term - will come on Saturday.\nConservative MP Dame Andrea Jenkyns, a longstanding critic of Mr Sunak, urged him to listen to the electorate and change course, saying the party needed to \"wake up, be conservative, or we lose\".\nBut fellow Tory MP for Cleethorpes, Martin Vickers, backed Mr Sunak's leadership and called the idea of changing leader \"complete madness\" just months away from a general election.\nLabour will be particularly pleased to have regained control of key council targets Hartlepool, Thurrock, Rushmoor and Redditch - areas where they are aiming to win at the general election later this year.  \nBut, there is evidence that Labour's stance on Gaza is hurting the party in areas with a significant Muslim population.\nIn Oldham, where two Labour councillors quit the party over Gaza earlier this year, Labour lost control of the council. \nLabour MP Pat McFadden, the party's national campaign coordinator, admitted \"strong feelings\" around the Middle East were \"a factor\" in the losses, adding: \"I don't think there's any point denying that  - it does get raised\".\nThe Workers Party of Britain, which has fiercely attacked Labour over its Gaza position, won four council seats including in Manchester where it defeated Labour's deputy leader of the council. \nReform UK is doing well in the areas where it has fielded candidates - and nearly beat the Tories into second place in Blackpool South. \nReform leader Richard Tice said the results showed his party \"is rapidly becoming the real opposition to Labour\". \nThe Green Party is also performing well and heading for a record number of councillors. \nThe Liberal Democrats won Tunbridge Wells, but failed to take one of its other key target areas of Wokingham.\nLib Dem Leader Sir Ed Davey said his party's \"general election campaign starts today\".\nSpeaking in Winchester, Sir Ed said: \"The votes are still being counted, but the message from across the country is loud and clear: people from around our great country have had enough of this out of touch Conservative government.\"\nVoters are switching to the Liberal Democrats because they \"have had enough of being taken for granted and being let down\", he added.\nThe by-election in Blackpool South was triggered by the resignation of former Conservative MP Scott Benton, who was suspended from the party after being caught in a lobbying sting.\nLabour candidate Chris Webb overturned a majority of 3,690 to defeat Conservative David Jones in the constituency, which was previously h",

    "The family of a man who was killed in a \"catastrophic\" road collision in Bradford has issued a plea to drivers urging them to be responsible for their actions.\nArsalan Khalid Baig, 24, died in hospital the day after the car he was a passenger in smashed into a wall on a sharp 90-degree bend on an industrial estate in July 2022. \nThe driver, Mohammed Azad Khan, who also died, had been travelling at about twice the road's 30mph limit and had cannabis in his system, an inquest was told. \nAfter the inquest, in which the coroner delivered a narrative verdict, Mr Baig's family urged people to \"grasp the gravity of their decisions behind the wheel\".\nThe inquest, at Bradford Coroner's Court, heard that the crash happened as the men were travelling along Dryden Street in an Audi SQ5 at about 23:30 BST on 30 July 2022.\nMr Khan, a married 24-year-old, was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency services. \nAnother passenger accompanying Mr Khan and Mr Baig suffered a broken leg in the crash.\nNone of the passengers had been wearing seatbelts at the time of the collision, the inquest was told.\nThe amount of cannabis in Mr Khan's system was nine times above the legal drug-drive limit, while laughing gas canisters were also found in the vehicle, it heard.\nRecording a narrative conclusion, assistant coroner Angela Brocklehurst said the lives of Mr Khan and Mr Baig might have been saved had seatbelts been worn. \nIn a statement following the inquest, members of Mr Baig's family said he was \"a very much loved and important part of our now broken family\" and that his death had left an \"irreplaceable void\". \nThey added: \"He was a happy, bubbly child, full of life, who had aspirations for his bright future that have now been left unachieved. \n\"Words cannot express the profound grief we feel knowing his life was cut short unjustly.\n\"We urge everyone to grasp the gravity of their decisions behind the wheel, understanding the immense ripple effects they can trigger. \n\"Additionally, let us heed a crucial lesson from this tragedy: the important of ensuring the sobriety and attentiveness of those behind the wheel before entrusting them with our lives.\"\nAnother fatal collision had since occurred on the same bend when a pick-up truck crashed into the wall in October last year, killing the 33-year-old driver, the inquest had heard. \nMs Brocklehurst said she had \"noted from the evidence\" during the inquest that there was an \"absence of speed notification signs\" along the road before the corner and a \"lack of hazard warning signs indicating a sharp bend\". \nShe said she would issue a notice to Bradford Council requiring it to consider taking steps to prevent future deaths on the road.\n\"It's time people knew about these dangerous spots,\" she added.\nA spokesperson for Bradford Council said: \"The council will work with the coroner\u2019s office and the police on this matter and any relevant actions pertaining from the discussions will be considered.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

Some 155 people have already died from flooding in the country.\nHowever, the government has not suspended transport between Dar es Salaam and the islands of Zanzibar.\n\"We want all people doing maritime activities and transporters to take caution, and follow advice from the meteorology agency so as to reduce risks,\" said Mr Matinyi.\nOn Friday afternoon, shops and businesses close to the ocean in Dar es Salaam were operating as normal but some people said they were going home early because of the risk of heavy rains.\nBack in Nairobi, Phylis, already forced to leave her home, urged the authorities to have a firm plan when it comes to relocation.\n\"If the government demolishes our houses, at least give us a solution. Tell us where to go. We don't know where to go,\" she said.",

    "The family of a man who was killed in a \"catastrophic\" road collision in Bradford has issued a plea to drivers urging them to be responsible for their actions.\nArsalan Khalid Baig, 24, died in hospital the day after the car he was a passenger in smashed into a wall on a sharp 90-degree bend on an industrial estate in July 2022. \nThe driver, Mohammed Azad Khan, who also died, had been travelling at about twice the road's 30mph limit and had cannabis in his system, an inquest was told. \nAfter the inquest, in which the coroner delivered a narrative verdict, Mr Baig's family urged people to \"grasp the gravity of their decisions behind the wheel\".\nThe inquest, at Bradford Coroner's Court, heard that the crash happened as the men were travelling along Dryden Street in an Audi SQ5 at about 23:30 BST on 30 July 2022.\nMr Khan, a married 24-year-old, was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency services. \nAnother passenger accompanying Mr Khan and Mr Baig suffered a broken leg in the crash.\nNone of the passengers had been wearing seatbelts at the time of the collision, the inquest was told.\nThe amount of cannabis in Mr Khan's system was nine times above the legal drug-drive limit, while laughing gas canisters were also found in the vehicle, it heard.\nRecording a narrative conclusion, assistant coroner Angela Brocklehurst said the lives of Mr Khan and Mr Baig might have been saved had seatbelts been worn. \nIn a statement following the inquest, members of Mr Baig's family said he was \"a very much loved and important part of our now broken family\" and that his death had left an \"irreplaceable void\". \nThey added: \"He was a happy, bubbly child, full of life, who had aspirations for his bright future that have now been left unachieved. \n\"Words cannot express the profound grief we feel knowing his life was cut short unjustly.\n\"We urge everyone to grasp the gravity of their decisions behind the wheel, understanding the immense ripple effects they can trigger. \n\"Additionally, let us heed a crucial lesson from this tragedy: the important of ensuring the sobriety and attentiveness of those behind the wheel before entrusting them with our lives.\"\nAnother fatal collision had since occurred on the same bend when a pick-up truck crashed into the wall in October last year, killing the 33-year-old driver, the inquest had heard. \nMs Brocklehurst said she had \"noted from the evidence\" during the inquest that there was an \"absence of speed notification signs\" along the road before the corner and a \"lack of hazard warning signs indicating a sharp bend\". \nShe said she would issue a notice to Bradford Council requiring it to consider taking steps to prevent future deaths on the road.\n\"It's time people knew about these dangerous spots,\" she added.\nA spokesperson for Bradford Council said: \"The council will work with the coroner\u2019s office and the police on this matter and any relevant actions pertaining from the discussions will be considered.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "The announcement \"mind the gap\" is almost as much a part of travelling in London as the Tube sign or a red bus. But when is the gap between the train and the platform too far and too dangerous?\nEric Leach thinks he has the answer to that, and it is 30cm, or 12 inches. He knows this because while lying on the platform in agony having fallen over while getting off a train, he had time to look at the vertical drop between the train and the platform.\nIn February, at Ealing Broadway station in west London, he stepped off an Elizabeth line train onto the platform. Such was the force from the drop, that he broke a bone in his foot. He collapsed on the platform.\nEric, who also suffered bruising to his right knee, says the gap is not acceptable: \"It's a 12-inch gap. Mums with buggies, people with heavy luggage, elderly people, of course it's not acceptable. \n\"It's a scandal, someone will be seriously injured or die. It's a death trap.\"  \nThe fall happened in rush hour: \"It was very, very painful. \n\"I was trying to get off. Other people were trying to force their way on. I was terrified looking at the gap, lost my balance and came down and fell and broke a bone in my left foot. And mashed up my right knee. \n\"I was on the ground for about 20 minutes. I was taken home in a taxi and a couple of days later I realised I was bad so I went to Ealing hospital. \"\nSince his fall, he has heard of others who have fallen at the same station and has complained to Transport for London (TfL).\nTfL says safety is its \"number one priority\" but it recognises gaps can be \"larger at some older stations\".\nWhat particularly annoys Eric is he thinks that for a new railway, this is a missed opportunity. The Elizabeth line was opened in May 2022, a cost of \u00a319bn.\nAs a train comes in to Ealing Broadway, Eric points out where it happened. \"Look at this gap, it's ridiculous,\" he says.\n\"This is a modern, \u00a319bn railway system, and we have that. \n\"It's a brand new line and a brand new station. It's difficult enough getting on but getting off is even more dangerous. \n\"Somebody is going to fall there, bang their head and die. They either have to raise the platform or lower the track.\"\nSo is there a legal safety limit to what the gap should be between trains and platforms? \nCertainly some gaps at platforms in London are big. Bank station and Clapham Junction spring to mind. \nAnd the central section of the Elizabeth line is blessed with flat boarding between the platform and the train. So why not in the west? \nThe platforms at Ealing Broadway are actually owned by Network Rail and aren't new. Before the introduction of Elizabeth line services, they were used by GWR trains out of London Paddington. \nSafety guidance says new platforms should not have a horizontal gap larger than 27.5cm (10.8in) or a vertical gap of more than 23cm (9in). \nHowever, Rail Safety and Standards Board rules only apply to new stations, so Ealing Broadway as an older platform doesn't fall under the regulations. \nThe rules don't apply.\nThe government's Office for Road and Rail says: \"Under current health and safety law, railway operators should reduce the risk from gaps as far as is reasonably practicable. \n\"For existing station platforms, a judgement has to be made as to whether it would be reasonably practicable to reduce the gaps or whether the cost would be disproportionate to the level of risk.\"\nThere are also injuries due to the gap on the London Underground, with hundreds being affected every year. \nA Freedom of Information request shows more than 300 passengers were involved in gap incidents in 2015 for example.\nTfL said at the time: \"Incidents of our customers being injured getting on and off Tube trains are rare, with fewer than one incident in every four million journeys last year. \n\"The majority of incidents result in either no injury (approximately 50%) or where only a minor injury was caused. Major injuries are very rare and account for fewer than 2% of all incidents.\"\nBut in May 2020, a man died after being hit by the Tube train he had been on after falling through the gap on the Bakerloo line at Waterloo station.  \nThe curve of the track meant the passenger was difficult to detect on the drivers' CCTV, the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) found.\nThe RAIB found London Underground's risk assessments did not identify extra risks caused by curved platforms at certain stops. \nIt made a number of recommendations. Among them, London Underground was told to recognise and assess location-specific risks so they could be properly managed. \nTfL says that so far there have been three incidents involving gaps since the opening of the Elizabeth line.\nWith regard to the injury to Eric Leach, a TfL spokesperson said: \u201cWe are sorry that one of our customers sustained an injury at Ealing Broadway station in February and we wish him a full and speedy recovery. \n\n\"Safety is our number one priority and, while the gap between the platform complies with the required safety standar",

She lives there with her partner and small child.\nHer street in the Chestnut Grove area of Craigshill has 13 homeowners and seven housing association tenants.\nAshleigh says she was \u201cabsolutely shocked\u201d and \u201cpanicked\u201d when she was told by the local housing association, Almond Housing, her home was 100% RAAC-made.\nHer housing association neighbours are moving out permanently and their houses will be boarded up with metal bars to stop people entering.\nAshleigh says she has been given estimates in the region of \u00a340,000 for the whole house to be appropriately treated.\n\u201cI\u2019m devastated because this was meant to be our forever home,\" she says.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in complete limbo.

    "A night-time knock on the door during Storm Babet warned Jonathan Sheppard that the flood waters were heading his way.\n\"Lincolnshire is flat, so the water just keeps going,\" he said.\nIt inundated his much-loved garden, which looked like a low, flowing river. His hollyhocks floated away.\nBut the waters never got into his home - thanks to some raised beds near the doors, sustainable growing in the garden, and good fortune.\nNow Flood Re - a scheme designed to provide affordable insurance for flood-risk homes - is urging other homeowners to be smart about their gardens.\nSensible planting, it said, would reduce the risk of damage, high costs, and the heartache of temporary homelessness caused by flooding.\nMr Sheppard, one of a handful of amateurs displaying at the Chelsea Flower Show, said he was continuing to use his garden to reduce the risk following last October's flood.\n\"I've planted willow, which sucks up a lot of water,\" he said.\nThere are more raised beds. Pots and planters are off the ground. \n\"Instead of fighting against it, you have to work with nature. We all have to think what will thrive in a changing climate,\" he said.\nThe campaign by Flood Re comes as homeowners may be heading back out into their gardens over the bank holiday weekend. \nThe heavy rains of recent days and weeks could have left gardens in a state, and some people considering the risk of flooding in their area.\nBosses of the insurance scheme said people spent hundreds of pounds on their gardens, but one in eight had experienced the impact of flooding in their green spaces.\nMany were oblivious to the risk, but properly managed, domestic gardens could channel, absorb and store large quantities of water, limiting the risk to property and the local area.\nEnvironmental designer Ed Barsley said: \"What's positive to note is that there are a variety of practical and cost-effective measures that garden owners can take to save themselves emotional and financial stress further down the line.\u201d\nIdeas include choosing a variety of plants such as willow, water mint and astilbe, as well as slowing the flow of water into the garden during heavy rain.\nAndy Bord, chief executive at Flood Re, said: \"Gardens are cherished spaces that bring joy to so many of us, so why wouldn\u2019t we want to not only protect them from harm but actively harness their power to prevent them from future damage?\"\nThe organisation will display its own garden at the Chelsea Flower Show. Celebrity gardener Naomi Slade helped design the outside space, which aims to demonstrate how domestic gardens can recover quickly after heavy rainfall.\nIt is also hoped visitors will be provided with ideas for flood-proofing their own gardens.\nFollowing a flood, Flood Re's Build Back Better scheme allows people, through participating insurers, to claim up to \u00a310,000 for flood resilience measures over and above the cost of work to repair damage caused by a flood.",

    "There has been lots of noise and lots of numbers.\nAnd, for plenty of us, not a lot of sleep.\nAnd there are still more results to come this weekend.\nBut how do things look right now?\nFirstly, dire election results are becoming a dangerous habit for the Conservatives. \nThere were last year's local elections.\nSeveral by-elections since.\nAnd now these elections.\nThe picture for Rishi Sunak has been consistently bleak.\nIf his premiership set out with two aims, steadying the ship of government and reviving Conservative fortunes, it's fair to say he did achieve the first of these.\nGone was the rolling psychodrama of Boris Johnson's last few months and Liz Truss's entire vanishingly brief tenure.\nBut as for the second, making the Tories popular again? The evidence suggests this has been a spectacular failure.\nHe yanks various policy levers. He sets ideas out with passion. And they appear to make barely any difference whatsoever to either his or his party's fortunes.\nIn contrast - and blackening the Tory mood still further - is Labour's relatively newly discovered knack of winning where they need to win in a general election.\nThey used to be rather good at stacking up loads of votes in places where they won already, and nowhere near enough votes in places where they didn't.\nThat appears to be changing.\nStrikingly, though, there is no sign, yet at least of this prompting a Conservative insurrection against the prime minister. \nWhy? Because the results for them are grim but perhaps no more grim than feared.\nOne senior figure suggested Conservative MPs were \"remarkably chilled\".\nA former cabinet minister said the results were \"not catastrophic\" - while also tacitly accepting they pointed to likely general election defeat. \nLabour are confident of exactly that - that these results point to them being on track to winning a majority when the whole country goes to the polls.\nThe Liberal Democrats see evidence of their capacity to capitalise on Conservative woe; Reform UK too. \nAnd the trend of a steady rise for the Green Party in local politics continues. \nIn essence these results cement the status quo - a buoyant Labour Party, the Conservatives morose, the smaller parties chipper.\nThis brings us to the big picture point - yes, the Conservatives are in dire straits and Labour are in a strong place.\nBut, remember, Labour have to do astonishingly well by any historical comparison to win a general election, and that remains the case.\nIt is this central fact - as well as the relative fortunes of the parties - that will shape the conversation between now and the general election.",
    "A police officer accidentally fired his gun on the Columbia University campus while clearing pro-Palestinian protesters from a building on Tuesday, the New York Police Department said. \nNo one was injured, and the bullet was found in a nearby wall.\nThe matter is being investigated, city officials said.\nPolice arrested 112 protesters this week after college leaders sought help clearing the Manhattan campus - a move that fractured the school community. \nThe NYPD held a press conference on Friday to address the issue, following days of criticism for not announcing the incident when it happened three days prior.\n\"Accidental discharges happen every single year and we average about eight a year and we don't get request [for information] on it,\" NYPD spokesperson Sergeant Tarik Sheppard said. \n\"If you do ask about it, we'll talk about it like we're doing right now.\"\nThe NYPD said in a statement on Thursday night that an unnamed Emergency Service Unit officer was using a firearm's flashlight attachment to illuminate a barricade inside Hamilton Hall, which protesters occupied after being ordered to disperse.\nAn officer fired a single shot into a wall a few feet away. The NYPD said it immediately investigated the incident and determined it was an accidental discharge. No student was near the area when the shot was fired, officials said.\nThe police force did not publicly disclose the gunshot or its internal probe, however, until The City, a local news organisation, reported the matter. \nThe officer's body camera captured the shooting, and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office was given the footage for its Police Accountability Unit to review.  \nColumbia University President Minouche Shafik called the NYPD to the campus Tuesday to clear Hamilton Hall, a school building that protesters occupied on Monday night. It was the second time Ms Shafik had police on campus in response to the pro-Palestinian encampment.\nStudents and faculty will have very limited access to the campus for the remainder of the year, just weeks before the semester's end. The university announced that all final exams would be held online. \nPolice released video of prying open doors, climbing through a second story window and clearing chairs and desks from stairwells in Hamilton. While the footage seemed to show that protesters had caused minor damage, it did not show a violent response from them. \nUniversity students told the BBC earlier this week that the police acted \"rough and aggressive\" toward protesters, though the NYPD has denied this. \nThe police said protesters detained on Tuesday were charged with a variety of offences: burglary, obstructing governmental administration, criminal mischief, resisting arrest, trespassing and disorderly conduct. NYPD data showed that about 29% of those arrested on campus were not affiliated with the university. \nThe protests at Columbia University have helped to spark a greater US student movement to call attention to the conflict in the Gaza Strip. The Hamas-led health ministry says that more than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the conflict. \nThe BBC has found that there were nearly 140 campus protests or encampments in response to the war in Israel, which followed Hamas's 7 October attack that killed 1,200 people.\nThe students are demanding that their schools divest from arms manufacturers as well as institutions and businesses affiliated with Israel. They also want schools to publicly disclose their institutional investments. \nUS lawmakers and officials have grown concerned that the demonstrations and encampments have led to a rise of antisemitic incidents and made campuses unsafe for Jewish students. That has led to increased pressure on university leaders to address the protests. \nEducation Secretary Miguel Cardona was scheduled to meet with a group of Jewish leaders on Friday, and he reportedly sent a letter to university officials that condemned \"abhorrent\" acts of antisemitism on campus. \n\"As the 2023-24 school year comes to a close, I remain incredibly concerned by the reports of anti-Semitic hate directed at students on some campuses,\" he wrote in the letter that was obtained by CNN.\nSome universities have been able to end the pro-Palestinian protests peacefully. The University of Minnesota and Rutgers University announced on Thursday that they struck agreements with protesters to clear encampments. \nIn exchange, school administrations agreed to consider the students' divestment demands and make their investments publicly accessible. \nBut most protests have not ended as harmoniously, particularly in recent days. \nPolice cleared demonstrators from an encampment at the University of California, Los Angeles, on Wednesday arresting about 200 people. \nAt Portland State University in Oregon on Thursday, authorities removed protesters from a library building and detained dozens of students. \nEarly on Friday morning, student organisers said that the NYPD put 50 protesters at New Yo",

    "One of the UK's leading organisations helping victims of torture and trafficking is preparing legal action over the government's Rwanda plan. \nAsylum Aid said it has urgently asked the Home Office to rethink, saying the scheme will not protect abuse victims. \nThe Home Office declined to comment on legal challenges, but a spokesman said Rwanda was a safe country.\nIn a separate development, a court document disclosed on Friday suggests the first flight could be on 1 July.  \nThe Home Office has begun detaining migrants in preparation for trying to send a flight in the summer. \nAsylum Aid works with some of the most vulnerable refugees in the UK. It is part of the Helen Bamber Foundation, an internationally-recognised organisation dedicated to providing specialist therapeutic support to torture survivors. \nThe charity said that it had put the Home Office on warning that it intends to take ministers to court because the rulebook for officials now implementing the scheme undermines a key safeguard for refugees that remained in the plan. \nIn its detailed policy guidance, the Home Office tells caseworkers they \"must\" conclude Rwanda is safe even if they have been presented with compelling evidence that sets out why an individual could not be sent there because of their specific circumstances. \nCaseworkers have also been ordered to ignore claims that Rwanda might send a migrant on to a dangerous country, even though the legislation seemingly allows individuals to present evidence that would leave them at risk of harm. \nThe risk that Rwanda would send migrants to countries that torture was the key factor in the Supreme Court's decision last November to declare the original plan unlawful.\nThe government has previously said the wording of the legislation means that someone with a very specific and narrow case for protection would not to be sent to Rwanda if they would suffer irreparable harm. But in practice, predicts the charity, officials will end up refusing to consider such compelling evidence. \nAsylum Aid says that if the Home Office does not change the directions to caseworkers, to give migrants a fair chance of presenting their case, they will ask a judge to rule whether ministers are failing to follow the law. \nAlison Pickup, the charity's director, said: \"We have brought forward this legal action to ensure that the Home Office properly considers any individual cases against removal to Rwanda, including on the grounds that they would be returned from Rwanda to the place they fled.\"\nA Home Office spokesman said: \"We remain confident in the country's strong and successful track record in resettling people.\"\nIndividual migrants could separately begin their own legal challenges from as early as next week - and on Friday another potentially crucial case moved a step closer. \nThe First Division Association, which represents senior civil servants, fears ministers will direct them to ignore any interim ruling from the European Court of Human Rights to delay a flight, even though they are under a legal duty to comply with court orders. \nMr Justice Chamberlain said government lawyers had confirmed that the earliest date for a flight would be 1 July - the first time that a specific date has been mentioned. \nThat meant there was a \"powerful public interest\" in fast-tracking the union's case to a hearing in the first week of June, despite a government request for more time to prepare. \n\"The defendants [ministers] should not need as long as they have sought to file their detailed grounds, given that they have been on notice that a challenge on this issue was likely since March 2024,\" he said. \nThe Home Office has been contacted for comment.

    "There were missed opportunities to stop a violent man from murdering his ex-partner and her nine-year-old son, a report has found.\nBethany Vincent, 26, and Darren Henson, known as DJ, were stabbed to death by Daniel Boulton at their home in Louth, Lincolnshire, in May 2021.\nA council review found Boulton's mental health needs were prioritised over the risk he posed to Ms Vincent and DJ.\nThe authority said it had taken action to address issues raised in the report.\nBoulton was jailed for a minimum of 40 years at Lincoln Crown Court in February 2022 after he walked 28 miles (45km) from a homeless hostel in Skegness on 31 May 2021 to Ms Vincent's house on High Holme Road where he stabbed her nine times, before stabbing DJ 14 times in his bedroom.\nThree years after the murders, Lincolnshire County Council has published a combined Child Safeguarding Practice Review and Domestic Homicide Review into their deaths.\nIn the report, author Dr Russell Wate said the level of the killer's risk to Ms Vincent and her family was \"underestimated throughout\", which included signs of coercion and control, given his history of domestic abuse-related offences.\n\"What is unequivocal is that the lines of communication between agencies was not sufficient to fully understand the risks involved. \n\"Opportunities to have addressed a more thorough understanding of the perpetrator's risk towards Bethany and DJ became secondary to the perceptions of the needs of the mental health of the perpetrator and he manipulated this to his advantage.\"\nHe said \"a considerable amount of time and effort\" had gone towards towards supporting Boulton's needs and meant \"Bethany's safeguarding needs became secondary\".\nDr Wate criticised \"a distinct lack of joined-up working in this case\" and said threats and comments made by the perpetrator were \"effectively disregarded\". \n\"The exercise of coercion and control was not identified even though there were indicators of such behaviours. Those signs were missed, even though they were part of the evidence from Bethany in her witness statements.\n\"The fact that the perpetrator was repeatedly returning to Bethany's home was an obvious indicator of the escalation of the risk of harm. This escalation should have been identified.\"\nHe also said the killer's hatred of DJ was \"a most concerning aspect that no agency acted to address\".\nDr Wate said the report used the victims names instead of the customary pseudonyms following their family's wish for them to have \"a voice\" during the review. \n\"No words can adequately describe their loss and as a panel, our motivation is to ensure that this review delivers an open and holistic picture of who they both were and how the learning identified can contribute to protecting other victims in the future.\"\nHe made a series of recommendations \"to co-ordinate the raising of professionals' awareness, knowledge and understanding\" of domestic violence, risks of harassment and stalking following a separation and coercive and controlling behaviours. \nIn a statement, Martyn Parker of the Safer Lincolnshire Partnership, said: \"This was a tragic incident, and our thoughts are with Bethany and Darren's family and friends at this difficult time. \n\"The review has helped identify some general learning points and local organisations have already taken action to address these. \n\"These steps will improve communication and information sharing between agencies and ensure everyone working with local families has a better understanding of issues such as domestic abuse and coercive and controlling behaviour. \n\"We hope that this can help reduce the likelihood of similar tragedies in future.\"\nFollow BBC Lincolnshire onFacebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

    "Riot police have forcibly removed pro-Palestinian protesters taking part in a sit-in at France's prestigious Sciences Po University in Paris.\nProtesters had occupied some buildings to demand that the university cut ties with Israel over the way it is conducting its war in the Gaza Strip. \nAfter their removal, groups headed to the Panth\u00e9on to continue their action.\nPro-Palestinian protests have been taking part in university campuses in several countries, most notably the US, over the past few days.\n\nIn Paris, dozens of riot police went into the buildings on Friday morning. \nThey came out with defiant protesters.\nOne of them said officials had given them an ultimatum to leave within 20 minutes, but that students had defied the order.\nParis police said  \"91 people were removed without incident\".\nPrime Minister Gabriel Attal's office was equally determined, saying the authorities would deal with such protests firmly.\n\nSciences Po closed its main buildings on Friday in response to the sit-in.\nA spokesperson said some of the Sciences Po campuses in Reims, Le Havre and Poitiers were also affected by protests.\nSimilar protests were held in Lyons and Lille.\nBut the protests in France have been more contained than in the US, a point emphasised by Mr Attal on Thursday.\n\"In contrast to what we see abroad, namely across the Atlantic, no permanent protest camp... has been established in France,\" the prime minister said.\nHe was referring to the days-long camps set up in several American universities, which police have had to dismantle with the arrest of hundreds of people.\nIsrael has come under increasing criticism for conditions in the Gaza Strip. \nA UN-backed assessment said last month that 1.1 million people were facing catastrophic hunger and that famine was imminent in northern Gaza.\nThe UN's most senior human rights official, Volker T\u00fcrk, has told the BBC that there is a \"plausible\" case that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza.\nIsrael denies limiting aid deliveries and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute it to those in need inside Gaza.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 34,600 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nOn Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Israel and Hamas that \"the time is now\" for a deal to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza and free the remaining hostages held there. He said a deal was on the table and Hamas should agree to it.\nMediators are awaiting a response from Hamas to the latest proposal.\nIt reportedly involves a 40-day ceasefire and the release of more than 30 Israeli hostages in exchange for many more Palestinian prisoners.",

    "A woman who had a miscarriage after being injured by an abusive partner has watched MSPs debate her campaign for a change in the law.\nNicola Murray, from Perth, was just six weeks pregnant when she miscarried in 2013 after her abusive ex-partner flew into a rage and hit her with his car.\nHe pleaded guilty to culpable and reckless conduct and was ordered to pay \u00a3300 in compensation.\nMiss Murray's work with other abused women led to her petitioning the Scottish Parliament in 2021 to campaign for a change in the law.\nMiss Murray says she lost three babies while a victim of domestic violence between 2009 and 2017. \nShe is now calling for courts to be able to hand down longer sentences.\nAt a previous appearance before Holyrood's Citizen Participation and Public Petitions Committee Miss Murray told MSPs an average of four pregnant women a day were reporting incidents of domestic abuse.\n\"Sadly for some of those women that abuse will result in miscarriage, stillbirth, forced termination or other serious complications of pregnancy,\u201d she told BBC Scotland News.\nOn Thursday, Conservative MSP Jackson Carlaw, convener of the Public Petitions Committee, chaired a full chamber debate on Miss Murray's petition.\nHe quoted Miss Murray, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s not just that you have to deal with the loss itself, it\u2019s the circumstances of the loss and the fact that the perpetrator can get away with it so easily.\n\u201cIt\u2019s often the case that they are not even charged at all. \n\"However if they are, the sentencing is inappropriate, which is like rubbing salt in the wounds of victims. \n\"It\u2019s almost like saying to them that what happened meant nothing.\" \nMiss Murray had proposed an amendment to the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2018 which was drafted by Dr Mary Neal, a reader in law at Strathclyde University, in 2017.\nIt would create a specific offence of \u201ccontributing or attempting to contribute, through violence, abusive behaviour, deception and/or coercion to the ending of a partner\u2019s or ex-partner\u2019s pregnancy\u201d.\nThis would apply if the behaviour was either intended or reckless in contributing to the end of pregnancy.\nConservative MSP Pam Gosal referred to the five-year sentence Stephen Ramsay received for attempted murder after attacking his pregnant partner in 2019, causing her lifechanging injuries and loss of their twins at 32 weeks.\n\"Comparatively, elsewhere in the UK he could have received a life sentence for child destruction,\" Ms Gosal said.\n\"While nothing can heal the profound loss suffered, in such cases stricter sentences could play a pivotal role in deterring abusers.\"\nThe SNP's John Swinney, who is Miss Murray's constituency MSP, told the chamber further consideration of the issue was needed.\nHe said a solution needed to be found to address the circumstances Miss Murray had experienced but he wondered whether the answer lay in changing sentencing guidelines or in creating a new offence.\nJustice Secretary Angela Constance said jail sentences had been imposed in some cases, demonstrating that existing laws could be used effectively.\n\u201cIt is likely to prove difficult both medically and causally to demonstrate, for example, that psychological abuse led to a woman\u2019s miscarriage,\u201d she said.\nIn her closing remarks, Ms Constance said: \u201cNo doors are ever closed and solutions still have to be found because our journey on ending violence against women and girls is far, far from over.\u201d\nMSPs unanimously agreed to note the petition but said further consideration would be needed before any amendments to the law are made.",

    "Talks over the future of steelmaking in south Wales have broken down as unions have refused to agree to Tata Steel's restructuring plans.\nUnions said the company had disregarded the impact of the changes on workers, their families and communities.\nBoth blast furnaces in Port Talbot are expected to close this year with 2,800 jobs lost across the UK as a result, and all those employed at the blast furnaces leaving their roles by the end of the year. \nA Tata Steel spokesperson said it has put forward an extensive offer that includes an enhanced employee support package and a generous proposal for a skills and retraining scheme.\nTata and the unions have been in consultations for seven months after the company said it wanted to end blast furnace iron production in south Wales this year.\nIt currently employs 4,000 workers at Port Talbot and will begin a voluntary redundancy process in May.\nThe company plans to build a \u00a31.25bn electric arc furnace to produce steel in a way which is less polluting than traditional blast furnaces but requires fewer workers.\nTata said the move would secure the future of steel making at the site and the UK government is contributing \u00a3500m towards the cost of the project.\nIn a joint statement, the Community, GMB and Unite unions said the offer to workers was a \"callous attack\" and \"completely unacceptable\". \nAccording to the unions, Tata had hoped to get workers to agree to the closure of both blast furnaces by September.\nThey also said steelworkers who refused to take voluntary redundancy would be moved to a training programme which pays minimum wage after four months.\nIn addition, they said there was no guarantee on avoiding compulsory redundancies.\nCharlotte Brumpton-Childs, GMB's national officer for steel said: \"The strength of feeling is palpable, members feel they are being disregarded and being abandoned, and they're angry.\"\nRoy Rickhuss, general secretary of Community, said: \"Tata talks the talk and wants to be seen as a caring responsible employer, but the reality is they are determined to cut jobs and punish their most vulnerable employees who want job security.\"\nHe said the union would consult its members on their next steps.\nTata Steel said it had paused discussions with the unions without coming to an agreement.\n\"Following seven months of information sharing and consultation, last week we confirmed that we will be proceeding with our restructuring plans and a \u00a31.25billion investment in green steelmaking to secure over 5000 jobs in Tata Steel UK. This week we have continued our open and constructive discussions with Trades Union partners through the UK Steel Committee.\n\u201cOur focus remains on creating a sustainable steel industry in the UK that supports manufacturing supply chains and steel communities through a just transition to low CO2 steelmaking,\" a company spokesperson added.\n\nThe Welsh government said:  \u201cWe have consistently argued that there is a better deal for the industry and Tata workers that could and should be struck - securing a longer, fairer transition towards the greener production of steel in Wales. \n\"The Welsh government will continue to make the case for that fairer transition and do all we can to support the skilled and loyal workforce and those in the supply chain.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Jeremy Miles said in the Senedd it was \"essential\" that Tata \"does all it can to avoid compulsory redundancies\" and ensures affected employees get \"appropriate help and guidance to reskill or seek employment\".\n",

    "People will have to show valid photo ID at polling stations when voting in the next general election. \nYou will not need to show ID if you have a postal vote. \nSince May 2023, voters have had to show a valid form of photo ID at polling stations to vote in person at most elections.\nThe rules apply to:\nThere is no need to show ID if voting:\nVoters in Northern Ireland have had to show photo ID since 2003.\nThere are 22 acceptable forms of ID, including:\nYou can use out-of-date photo ID as long as you look the same. \nIf you wear a face covering, such as a medical mask or a veil worn on religious grounds, you will be asked to remove it briefly so polling station staff can check that your ID looks like you.\nAfter the May local elections, Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer apologised to a man who said he was not able to use his veterans' ID card to vote. \nA No 10 spokeswoman said the government intended to add the veterans' card - which was rolled out in January - to the list of valid ID.\nYou can exchange a paper driving licence for a photocard, or apply for a photocard travel pass if you're aged 60 or over, disabled or registered blind or partially sighted.\nAlternatively, anyone registered to vote without the correct ID - or who no longer looks like their photo - can apply for a free document known as a Voter Authority Certificate. \nVoters in Northern Ireland can use an Electoral Identity Card.\nIf you go to the polling station without the correct ID, you will be asked to come back with valid documentation.\nIf you think your ID has been wrongly rejected, the Electoral Commission says you should notify the presiding officer at the polling station. If this does not resolve the issue, you can raise your concerns with your council's returning officer.\nPolling station staff record how many voters are turned away, as well as the number who return with valid ID.\nAccording to the commission, about 14,000 people were unable to vote in the May 2023 local elections in England as a result of the new rules. \nThe government said this would stop votes being stolen, although that is quite unusual in the UK.\nThere were 1,462 cases of alleged electoral fraud reported to police between 2019 and 2023, according to the Electoral Commission. \nOf these, 10 led to convictions, and the police issued four cautions. Most resulted in the police taking no further action. \nThe Electoral Commission has called on the government to expand the list of accepted ID and to allow voters to cast their ballot without ID if another registered voter could vouch for their identity.",
    "Exams are under way, with hundreds of thousands of students hoping to secure a place at university.\nGetting a degree is expensive, but does uni pay for itself through higher future earnings?\nOne of the biggest costs of going to university is the course itself.\nMost students take out loans to pay for their undergraduate tuition.\nThe annual cost for UK students varies:\nStudent rents have risen sharply in recent years, according to data from 10 university towns and cities. \nAverage annual rent rose from \u00a36,520 in 2021-22 to \u00a37,475 in 2023-24, according to research by the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) and housing charity Unipol. The figures do not include London and Edinburgh.\nStudent rents are particularly high in some cities like Bristol and Nottingham, where the average cost was \u00a39,200 and \u00a38,427 respectively.\nHepi warned that maintenance loans in England now only just cover average rent. It said that without family support or part-time work, students \"will have no money to live off\" after housing costs. \nIf you are leaving home to study, it is generally cheaper to live in university-owned accommodation. \nIn 2021-22 (the latest UK-wide figures available) average rent for university-owned rooms ranged from \u00a36,471 in England to \u00a34,565 in Northern Ireland.\nStudents also need to budget for other big expenses, such as food, transport, course materials and going out.\nResearch by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas), based on a survey of about 500 respondents, suggests that students spent \u00a3219 per week on average in late 2022.\nMore than half of students had a job last year, according to Hepi.\nMost UK students are eligible for a tuition fee loan.\nMaintenance loans are also available, for living costs. \nThese are means-tested, so the amount you get depends on your family's income.\nThe maximum maintenance loan if you live away from home and outside of London ranges from \u00a310,227 in England to \u00a36,776 in Northern Ireland in 2024/25.\nYou are charged interest on your total loan from the day you take it out. Eligibility and repayment rules differ across the UK.\nLoan repayment rules changed in England last year. You're likely to pay back more, over a longer period of time, than people who went to university earlier.\nThe government says new students \"will not repay more than they originally borrowed over the lifetime of their loans, when adjusted for inflation\".\nBut Martin Lewis, of MoneySavingExpert.com, said extending the repayment period would increase \"costs by thousands\" for lower and mid earners.\nEligible students in Wales and Northern Ireland can claim maintenance grants which are not repaid.\nFull-time undergraduates normally resident in Wales are entitled to at least \u00a31,000. There is up to \u00a310,124 for students from the poorest backgrounds who study in London. \nIn Northern Ireland the maximum grant is \u00a33,475. \nThe Scottish government offers financial support to certain categories of students, such as those with dependants. \nAcross the UK, students in financial difficulty can apply for hardship funding and they may also be entitled to financial assistance from charities.\nMost students will leave university owing money. \nThe Student Loans Company says graduates in England leave university with average debts of \u00a344,940.\nIn general, most graduates can expect to earn more than non-graduates, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA).\nHowever, it suggests the extra money earned from a university education has declined.\nAccording to HESA's survey of 2020-21 graduates, the average salary reported 15 months after gaining a degree was \u00a329,699.\nEarnings also depend on the subject studied and university attended. \nResearch by the IFS think tank in England suggests, on average, women who studied creative arts and languages degrees earned the same amount in their lifetime as if they had not gone to university.\nWomen who studied law, economics or medicine earned over \u00a3250,000 more during their career than if they had not got a degree.\nMen who studied creative arts on average earned less across their lifetimes than if they had not attended university. Male medicine or economics graduates earned \u00a3500,000 more. \nAttending university can help students from poorer backgrounds earn more than their parents might have done, according to research by education charity the Sutton Trust in England.\nBut only a fifth of graduates who were eligible for free school meals went on to be in the top 20% of earners - compared to almost half of graduates who attended private schools.\nThe Sutton Trust says attending a selective university, like a Russell Group university, gives young people the \"best chance of being socially mobile\".

    "A teenager who stabbed another boy to death with a zombie knife at a 16th birthday party has been detained for life.\nShane Cunningham, Leo Knight and Cartel Bushnell, whose rights to anonymity were lifted by the judge, fatally stabbed Mikey Roynon during an argument at a house party in Bath, Somerset, on 10 June 2023.\nCunningham, 16, was convicted for murder while his two friends, also 16, were convicted for manslaughter after being acquitted of the more serious charge.\nBushnell has been detained for nine years and Knight was detained for nine years and six months.\nThe boys all previously denied murder, but in March 2024, Cunningham was found guilty of murder, while the other two were found guilty of manslaughter.\nMr Justice Saini imposed a life sentence at Bristol Crown Court earlier and ordered that Cunningham should serve a minimum term of 16 years custody before he can be considered for parole.\nMikey's mother, Hayley Ryall, cried as her victim impact statement was read out on her behalf in court.\nIn the statement she said she could not bear to look at photos of her son, knowing she would never see his face again.\nShe described feeling like she was living in a film, or in a nightmare and said: \u201cThe day my Mikey was killed, my life changed forever.\n\u201cChristmas used to be magical, but I\u2019ll never celebrate it again.\n\u201cNew Year was the same; how could I look forward to the year ahead without him?\u201d\nMikey\u2019s father, Michael Roynon, said in his statement: \u201cI feel so tortured at the loss of my boy...I feel like I have a life sentence.\"\nWhile Mikey's Grandmother Teresa Owen said she would \"swap places with Mikey in a heartbeat\", if she could.\nOver the course of six weeks, the jury at Bristol Crown Court heard how trouble had started at a girls\u2019 16th birthday party in the Weston area of Bath.\nThe police investigation uncovered CCTV footage of the teenage boys travelling on the bus from Wiltshire to the party.\nLeo Knight was seen to have a knife hidden in his trousers, visible when he bent over on the bus to the party, Avon and Somerset Police said.\nDuring the trial, jurors heard that Cunningham had stabbed Mikey but claimed he had been acting in self defence. \nCunningham alleged that Mikey had swung a knife toward his friends in the host's garden, but it was Mikey who was badly injured. Mikey was left bleeding heavily from a wound to his neck and collapsed on the driveway. \nThe defendants fled the party and later disposed of their weapons and clothing. Avon and Somerset Police said the boys were seen on CCTV talking about what had happened, and the weapon used to kill Mikey was later found by officers in a drain.\nDet Insp Mark Newbury, the senior investigating officer for the case, said Mikey's death was as \"utterly senseless as it is heart-breaking\".\n\"Justice has been served and whilst I am pleased that what we've done is right for Mikey and his family, it does not bring me or my team any satisfaction.\n\"So many lives have been ruined by what happened last summer in Bath, including those of the three young boys who are now behind bars.\"\nMr Newbury said that agencies were working closely together to support young people and understand what leads them to carry a knife.\nHe said officers needed the support of communities and parents in particular in this regard.\n\"Please, talk to your children and tell them about Mikey.\n\"Tell them how he lost his life because other children his age brought knives to a party.\n\"Tell them how they are now locked up and their futures are changed forever.\"\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A 15-year-old boy has been found guilty of murdering Leeds teenager Alfie Lewis in a fatal stabbing.\nAlfie, also 15, died in hospital after being knifed in the heart in Church Road, Horsforth, last November.\nWitnesses described seeing Alfie being pushed to the ground by the boy before being stabbed twice \"in full view\" of a group of school children.\nThe boy was convicted following a trial at Leeds Crown Court and will be sentenced in June.\nSobs were heard from Alfie's family in the public gallery, who hugged each other as the verdict was announced. \nMost were wearing T-shirts with pictures of Alfie, saying \"Forever 15\".\nThe judge, Mr Justice Cotter, told the defendant: \"You have been found guilty of murder.\n\"There is only one sentence I can pass. What I have to determine is how many years you will be detained before you are able to be released.\"\nThe boy, who had denied murder instead saying it was him who was scared when he pulled the weapon, showed no visible emotion as the verdict was read out. \nHe later held hands with his parents through a gap in the dock glass before being taken away.\nFollowing the verdict a statement from Alfie's family was read outside court by his brother Antony Lewis.\nIn the statement he thanked the police, emergency services, prosecutors and and the wider community of Horsforth for their \"compassion and support\".\n\"Most of all we would like to say 'thank you' to our Alfie, for giving us all your love, joy, and humour and making us smile every day in the 15 years we had to enjoy and love you. \n\"You are always in our hearts and our minds, and until we are all together again keep dancing in the sky our beautiful boy. \n\"We miss you and we love you, always.\"\nDuring the two-week trial, the jury of five men and seven women heard that Alfie was attacked near Horsforth School just before 15:00 GMT on 7 November 2023 while on his way to meet some friends.\nProsecutor Craig Hassall KC said the defendant, who was 14 at the time, had walked \"purposefully\" towards Alfie before stabbing him, using a knife he had taken from a kitchen drawer at home.\nHe said witnesses recalled Alfie looking \"surprised and shocked\" and asking the defendant \"what are you doing?\".\nAlfie was left fatally injured in the road as children from nearby St Margaret's Primary School in Town Street left for the day or waited to be collected.\nA post-mortem examination revealed the fatal stab injury was a 5.5in (14cm) wound to Alfie's chest, which punctured his heart.\nDet Ch Insp Stacey Atkinson said there had been nothing which could have justified the \"murderous violence\" Alfie's attacker used to end his life.\nShe said: \"Alfie was only 15 years old and was not involved in gangs or any other criminality that could have put him at risk of knife crime.\n\"He had simply gone to meet his friends from school and was not looking for a confrontation with anyone.\"\nMs Atkinson said the youth convicted of Alfie's murder had launched \"a deliberate and determined attack, repeatedly stabbing Alfie, who was completely defenceless, leaving him fatally wounded\".\nThe convicted boy will be sentenced on 21 June.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "There were missed opportunities to stop a violent man from murdering his ex-partner and her nine-year-old son, a report has found.\nBethany Vincent, 26, and Darren Henson, known as DJ, were stabbed to death by Daniel Boulton at their home in Louth, Lincolnshire, in May 2021.\nA council review found Boulton's mental health needs were prioritised over the risk he posed to Ms Vincent and DJ.\nThe authority said it had taken action to address issues raised in the report.\nBoulton was jailed for a minimum of 40 years at Lincoln Crown Court in February 2022 after he walked 28 miles (45km) from a homeless hostel in Skegness on 31 May 2021 to Ms Vincent's house on High Holme Road where he stabbed her nine times, before stabbing DJ 14 times in his bedroom.\nThree years after the murders, Lincolnshire County Council has published a combined Child Safeguarding Practice Review and Domestic Homicide Review into their deaths.\nIn the report, author Dr Russell Wate said the level of the killer's risk to Ms Vincent and her family was \"underestimated throughout\", which included signs of coercion and control, given his history of domestic abuse-related offences.\n\"What is unequivocal is that the lines of communication between agencies was not sufficient to fully understand the risks involved. \n\"Opportunities to have addressed a more thorough understanding of the perpetrator's risk towards Bethany and DJ became secondary to the perceptions of the needs of the mental health of the perpetrator and he manipulated this to his advantage.\"\nHe said \"a considerable amount of time and effort\" had gone towards towards supporting Boulton's needs and meant \"Bethany's safeguarding needs became secondary\".\nDr Wate criticised \"a distinct lack of joined-up working in this case\" and said threats and comments made by the perpetrator were \"effectively disregarded\". \n\"The exercise of coercion and control was not identified even though there were indicators of such behaviours. Those signs were missed, even though they were part of the evidence from Bethany in her witness statements.\n\"The fact that the perpetrator was repeatedly returning to Bethany's home was an obvious indicator of the escalation of the risk of harm. This escalation should have been identified.\"\nHe also said the killer's hatred of DJ was \"a most concerning aspect that no agency acted to address\".\nDr Wate said the report used the victims names instead of the customary pseudonyms following their family's wish for them to have \"a voice\" during the review. \n\"No words can adequately describe their loss and as a panel, our motivation is to ensure that this review delivers an open and holistic picture of who they both were and how the learning identified can contribute to protecting other victims in the future.\"\nHe made a series of recommendations \"to co-ordinate the raising of professionals' awareness, knowledge and understanding\" of domestic violence, risks of harassment and stalking following a separation and coercive and controlling behaviours. \nIn a statement, Martyn Parker of the Safer Lincolnshire Partnership, said: \"This was a tragic incident, and our thoughts are with Bethany and Darren's family and friends at this difficult time. \n\"The review has helped identify some general learning points and local organisations have already taken action to address these. \n\"These steps will improve communication and information sharing between agencies and ensure everyone working with local families has a better understanding of issues such as domestic abuse and coercive and controlling behaviour. \n\"We hope that this can help reduce the likelihood of similar tragedies in future.\"\nFollow BBC Lincolnshire onFacebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

    "A company that runs Plymouth's fish market is set to cease trading in three weeks.\nStaff at Plymouth Trawler Agents (PTA) received redundancy letters on Friday morning informing them the business would cease trading on 17 May.\nThe firm was set up in 1994 and has about 100 shareholders, a board of six directors and about 24 employees.\nPTA has been contacted for comment but has yet to reply. Sutton Harbour Group, which owns Plymouth Fisheries, said it was open to working with interested parties to take over the PTA's services. \nThe company runs an auction sale daily from Monday to Friday, where vessels land their catches the night before and provide them to the PTA.\nBuyers can bid in person or digitally for a box or tub of fish including mackerel, squid and cuttlefish.\nRikki Down said his family had been operating as fish merchants in the city since 1971, and that the news had been \"quite a shock\".\nHe said: \"If there is nobody to take over the auction, nobody comes forward, it could very well be the end of the auction in Plymouth.\"\nHe said you would still be able to fish out of Plymouth but the catch would have to be \"transported\".\n\"Boats are going to divert presumably to Brixham or Newlyn and we'll have to transport fish from there.\n\"It means more labour, more vehicle costs, later deliveries, it means a lot.\"\nAnother fisherman said: \"When I turned up this morning and was told about it I wasn't impressed.\n\"I mean they have known about this for months and nobody said anything to us,\" he said.\nA spokesman for Sutton Harbour Group said it would \"take some time to consider its implications\".\n\"The company is interested in working in collaboration with the fishing industry and other interested parties in finding an effective and viable solution, which would enable the replacement of the services for which PTA was responsible,\u201d it said.\nThe final auction will take place on the same day as the closure of PTA.\nFollow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Labour has won the police, fire and crime commissioner election in Northamptonshire.\nDanielle Stone will take on the role after she saw off competition from Conservative candidate Martyn Emberson.\nThe Liberal Democrat candidate, Ana Savage Gunn, came in third place.\nThe departing Tory commissioner, Stephen Mold, did not seek re-election after he made misogynistic comments about chief fire officer, Nikki Watson.\nMs Stone, a teacher and West Northamptonshire councillor, received 43,684 votes - an 11.8% increase on Labour\u2019s figure in the 2021 commissioner election.\nMr Emberson, a former chief fire officer, collected 39,740 votes for the Conservatives, down 17.5% on the 2021 figure. Ms Savage Gunn came third with 27,799.\nMs Stone told the BBC: \u201cI\u2019m feeling elated. It was always very uncertain how the result would pan out.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened is that the public has voted for change, and we certainly do need that.\u201d\nShe added that people were \u201cfed up\u201d with the Conservative government, council and commissioner.\nThe West Northamptonshire Liberal Democrats said they were \u201cextremely pleased with our result and the number of voters who have recognised the positive campaign by Ana Savage Gunn\".\nIt added: \u201cThis result shows that residents are disgusted with how the Conservatives have conducted themselves, bringing the office of police, fire and crime commissioner in Northamptonshire into disrepute.\u201d\nThe election had been overshadowed by controversies which involved the outgoing Conservative commissioner, Stephen Mold.  \nHe made misogynistic comments about Northamptonshire's chief fire officer Nikki Watson at a meeting. \nHe apologised, but announced he would not stand for re-election.\nHe also faced criticism for appointing Ms Watson while she was under investigation following a complaint about her time with Avon and Somerset Police.\nAfter the results were shared, Adam Brown, the Conservative leader of West Northamptonshire Council, said: \"Clearly we didn't reach enough voters.\n\"There was a difficult backdrop to our campaign, but I congratulate Danielle Stone on her election and I'll work constructively with her for the benefit of our residents.\"\nFollow Northamptonshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Last summer, I Kissed A Boy made history as the UK's first gay dating show. Now it's the girls' turn.\nI Kissed A Girl - as you might have guessed - puts a cast of lesbian and bisexual women at the centre.\nTen contestants are shacked up in an Italian villa and, as the title suggests, they're introduced with a kiss. \nLike its predecessor it will be hosted by Dannii Minogue, but this time it's TikTokker Charley Marlowe stepping in to the voiceover booth. \nThe contestants on the show come from a range of backgrounds, and BBC Newsbeat spoke to three - Priya, Amy and Demi - about their journeys before the show. \nPriya is a Sikh, and says she's been fortunate to feel embraced by her religion, something she speaks about on the show. \n\"Just because you're queer doesn't mean you can't be religious,\" she says. \n\"I just think your own relationship with God is very personal and you don't have to share that with anyone else.\"\nBy speaking about her own experiences it on the programme, Priya hopes to encourage \"other South Asian and queer women to feel comfortable with who they are\".\n\"It might be different for other people, but I'm a Sikh,\" she explains. \nWhile some Sikhs face homophobia and there are opposing views on same-sex marriage within the religion, Priya says she follows the interpretation of love as something that exists on a spiritual rather than physical level.\n\"Basically, the religion is just like falling in love with a soul,\" she says.\n\"It's not necessarily a gender, or a person, but a soul. \n\"I think that's really beautiful. \n\"And that's why I love the religion so much and I do speak about it on the show.\"\nBut Demi had a more difficult time coming out to her family.\nShe has a Nigerian background, and same-sex activity is illegal in the country. \nWhile she says she was able to casually drop the fact she liked girls in to conversation, Demi says she hasn't spoken to her dad since appearing on the show.\n\"He made suggestions that I'd go back to the villages in Nigeria where they didn't really accept queer people - so that was very hurtful at the time,\" she says.\n\"And then, since I also told him that I was going on the show, we haven't spoken.\n\"So yeah, I think it's difficult. But I'm 24 - it doesn't affect me as much as it would have, like, in my youth. It's fine.\"\nDemi says she has a strong support network thanks to her mum and sister and new friends from the show. \n\"Even when all that happened with my dad, I felt still quite safe, because of my friends,\" she says.\nAmy has two sisters who are gay, and says she's been out to her family for a few years now. \nBut she says being on the show will still be interesting because a lot of people at home don't know about her sexuality. \n\"Growing up, I found it quite difficult,\" she says.\n\"So they're going to see my face and hear my voice, which is going to be quite an experience.\"\nShe says her sisters would have loved to see a show like I Kissed A Girl when they were younger.\n\"If we had that growing up, that would have been such an amazing thing to see,\" she says.\nAmy says she hopes the show will challenge another preconception lots of LGBT females face - how they're expected to look.\n\"I had different kind of levels of what I would consider masculine, feminine, and then going in and meeting all these new people completely changed that,\" she says. \n\"It's really just knocking down that binary.\"\nDemi and Priya say that one of the biggest challenges they face is people assuming they're heterosexual because they present as more feminine. \n\"They assume you're not a lesbian, because of the way you look,\" Priya says. \n\"I feel like we're all femme here,\" Demi says. \"So I think everyone comes to the assumption that we're not looking for other women or non-binary people.\"\nWhether they find love or not will be revealed on the show, but all the contestants say the show has helped them make \"friends for life\".\n\"I had no gay friends, like the only people I knew who were gay were the women I dated,\" Priya says. \n\"And coming into that environment, meeting all these amazing, colourful, beautiful women and building friendships with each and every one of them is so amazing. \n\"And I'm gonna have queer friends for life.\"\nAmy says meeting the other girls on the show, who come from all over the UK, gave her the chance to meet people she never normally would.\n\"So it's just adding just layers and layers and layers to my chosen family,\" she says.\n\"And it's amazing.\"\nI Kissed a Girl will begin on BBC iPlayer on 5 May.

    "Just weeks before the first ballot was cast in this year's Indian election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was at an event in Delhi rubbing shoulders with people known by names like BeerBiceps and Curly Tales.\nThe event - an awards show, congratulating some of the country's top social media stars on their work - was an acknowledgement of the power of the influencer which a few years ago may have seemed unimaginable.\nAnd as politicians prepared to battle it out for India's billion votes, these influencers were being lined up to play a crucial role in reaching the young, the disinterested and the disillusioned. \nBut even as some celebrate social media's democratisation of the media - a place where any one can share their views freely - others paint a darker picture, one where threats are rife, and the truth can be set aside for the right pay cheque.\nA decade ago, you would have struggled to find anyone calling themselves an \"influencer\".\nBut now, says Vinay Deshpande, co-founder of Rajneethi, a political management consultant firm, \"it's become a profession\".\n\"I know teenagers who are doing this part-time to earn pocket money.\"\nPocket money underplays the earning potential somewhat, however. At the lower end, people can charge around 2,000 rupees ($24; \u00a319) a day, but top influencers can pull in about 500,000 rupees for a post - equivalent to the monthly salary of someone in top-level management.\nThe creator of the Ranting Gola channel revealed to the BBC that political parties and election management firms have offered as much as \"100,000 to 500,000 rupees for a single campaign\". \nIt is no small amount - but then, it could turn the tide in a candidate's favour.\nMr Deshpande says they have helped an opposition candidate win an assembly election by pushing out content through a curated list of local influencers with a small but active following.\n\"Social media content is powerful and can influence the way a person feels about an issue,\" Mr Deshpande says. \"It gives social currency to a belief or opinion - but this can lead to a lack of critical thinking about an issue,\" he adds.\nPreethi Aggarwal, 25, is one of those who turns to apps like Instagram, YouTube and Twitter to help her understand the news.\nLike thousands of others, Ms Aggarwal follows a bunch of \"political influencers\", or people who talk about politics on social media to \"really understand what's going on\".\n\"News can get boring and complicated sometimes. I think these people [influencers] make it fun and easier to understand,\" she says, adding the context and their own perspective help her form her opinions.\nBut the problem is, whose perspective is she getting?\nYouTuber Samdish Bhatia reveals numerous politicians have reached out to him, especially in the months before this election, offering him millions of rupees to interview them. \n\"But they wanted me to share questions in advance or get the video approved before it's published,\" he says, adding that he declined the offers because he \"likes to maintain editorial control\".\nThe particular trend for longer form, slightly chummy interviews - where politicians get to show off their human side - is particularly vulnerable to management, says Joyojeet Pal, an associate professor at the University of Michigan.\n\"Many of these interviews are carefully managed by politicians,\" Mr Pal says.\nBut even if they aren't, a gentler style of questioning can also blur the line between interview and promotion, says Mr Pal. \n\"If your questions aren't holding power to account, then the interview just becomes a platform for easy publicity.\"\nBut for Mr Pal, this is just one of the problems he sees with politics on social media.\nIn a recent research paper, he examined some of India's top influencers and who they interviewed, finding BJP leaders were featured more often than opposition leaders.\nHis research also found an overall drop in the number of accounts posting content critical of the incumbent government in recent years, while the amount of pro-BJP content had increased.\n\"This hints at a growing hesitancy among people to be openly critical of the  government whereas there seems to be more confidence in putting up polarising content or content that supports the government's ideologies,\" Mr Pal says.\n\"And this is dangerous for democracy,\" he adds. \nInfluencers supporting the opposition certainly suggested they were working in a hostile environment.\nA number who post content that's critical of the government declined to speak to the BBC for this piece citing fear of repercussions by the government. They also run their channels under pseudonyms to keep their identities secret.\nThe Ranting Gola told the BBC that she has often received comments that are abusive or threatening because of the videos she posts and that her Instagram account has been disabled numerous times, even though the platform hasn't given her a clear reason for doing so.\nShe also only spoke to the BBC on the condition that her name not be revealed.\nThe B",
    "A huge diplomatic row has erupted after Spain's transport minister suggested Argentina's president had used drugs. \nOscar Puente said Javier Milei had ingested \"substances\" during his election campaign last year. \nMr Milei hit back condemning the \"slander and insults\" and attacked the policies of Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez. \nThe clash comes after a cooling of relations between the two countries since the election of the Argentine far-right leader. \nThe row started on Friday when Mr Puente was speaking during a panel discussion organised by his Spanish Socialist Workers' Party.\n\"There are very bad people who, just being themselves, have reached the top. Milei, for instance. Trump,\" he told attendees. \nReferring to the Argentine president appearing on TV during his election campaign last year, he said he did not know what state Mr Milei was in - \"prior to ingestion or after ingestion\" of substances.\nIn its response, Mr Milei's office said Spain had more important things to deal with, like the corruption accusations against Mr S\u00e1nchez's wife - which Madrid's public prosecutor has said should be shelved for lack of evidence.  \nThe statement went on to say the prime minister's Socialist policies had brought \"death and poverty\" to Spaniards, \"endangered women by allowing illegal immigrants who attacked them\" and undermined Spain's integrity by making deals with separatists - a reference to the coalition government with Catalonia's largest separatist party.\nIn turn, the Spanish foreign ministry has issued a statement in which it \"rejects the unfounded words\"  which \"do not correspond to the relations between the two brotherly countries and peoples\".\nMr Milei has publicly supported Spain's far-right anti-immigration Vox party. \nHe is due to visit Spain in two weeks' to attend the launch of Vox's European election campaign, newspaper El Pais reported.\nMr Milei has a history of spats with other world leaders. \nHe has described Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva as an \"angry communist\" and corrupt, and called Mexico's President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador \"ignorant\".\nHe also called the Colombian President Gustavo Petro \"a terrorist murderer\" referring to him being a past member of a guerilla group. \nThe insult caused Colombia to expel a number of Argentine diplomats in response.

    "Efforts have intensified to secure a deal for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages, with talks resuming in Cairo on Saturday. \nHamas said its delegation was travelling in a \"positive spirit\" after studying the latest truce proposal.\n\"We are determined to secure an agreement in a way that fulfils Palestinians' demands,\" it said. \nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said \"taking the ceasefire should be a no-brainer\" for the militant group.\nHamas's negotiators have returned to the Egyptian capital to resume long-running talks - brokered by Egypt and Qatar - that would temporarily pause Israel's offensive in Gaza in return for freeing hostages. \nIn a statement released last night, Hamas said it wanted to \"mature\" the agreement on the table, which suggests there are areas where the two sides still disagree. \nThe main issue appears to involve whether the ceasefire deal would be permanent or temporary. \nHamas is insisting any deal makes a specific commitment towards an end to the war, but Israel is reluctant to agree while the group remains active in Gaza. It's thought the wording being discussed involves a 40-day pause in fighting while hostages are released, and the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails.\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted there will be a fresh military ground operation in the southern Gazan city of Rafah, even if a deal is agreed. Israeli media reported on Saturday that his position remained unchanged despite the latest round of talks.\nBut the US - Israel's biggest diplomatic and military ally - is reluctant to back a new offensive that could cause significant civilian casualties, and has insisted on seeing a plan to protect displaced Palestinians first. An estimated 1.4 million people have taken shelter in Rafah after fleeing the fighting in the northern and central areas of the strip.\nAddressing the prospects of a truce on Saturday, minister Benny Gantz, a member of Israel's war cabinet, said: \"An official response to the outline has not yet been received. When accepted - the war management cabinet will meet and discuss it. Until then, I suggest to the 'political sources' and all decision-makers to wait for official updates, to act calmly and not to get into hysteria for political reasons.\"\nThe Director of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Williams Burns, has travelled to Cairo to help broker the latest talks, according to two US officials who spoke to the BBC's US news partner, CBS News.\nMr Blinken has also been a key figure in the negotiations, and visited Israel again this week to meet Mr Netanyahu. Speaking on Friday in Arizona, Mr Blinken said \"the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire was Hamas\".  \nSo far, ceasefire talks have continued for months without a breakthrough. There hasn't been a pause in fighting or a release of hostages since the end of November. There have been moments in that time where a new agreement has seemed imminent, but a deal has fallen apart before it could be signed. \nEven in this latest round of discussions, caution is needed. A source familiar with the talks told the BBC that the negotiations remained complex, and any breakthrough could still take several days. \nA source told the Washington Post that the US had urged Qatar to expel Hamas's political leadership, if the group continued to reject a ceasefire.\nOn Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in Democracy Square in Tel Aviv calling for the release of hostages.\nRelatives of the hostages also gathered at the Kirya military base in Tel Aviv to urge the government to make a deal. Some accused Mr Netanyahu of trying to undermine a proposed truce, and others called for an end to the war.\nAyala Metzger, daughter-in-law of 80-year-old hostage Yoram, said the government must agree to end the war if that is the price for the release of the hostages.\nThe war began after Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups attacked villages and military bases in southern Israel, killing at least 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages.\nDuring the subsequent Israeli military campaign in Gaza, 34,654 Palestinians have been killed and 77,908 wounded, according to figures from the Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "In January 2020, they were seniors in high school. Graduation was just around the corner. But so was a deadly pandemic. \nBy mid-March, Covid had upended daily life and many students were forced to spend their final months of school at home. Proms were cancelled. \nFour years later, those same students are now in college about to graduate. And once again, they face a similar souring of what would normally be a festive occasion. \nPro-Palestinian protests have erupted at over 130 college campuses across the US, as organisers demand their universities cut ties from companies linked to Israel. \nThey've set up vast encampments in the middle of university grounds and defied multiple warnings to disperse, sparking police raids and over 2,000 arrests. \nThree seniors explain how they're dealing with this tumultuous ending of their academic careers - for the second time. \nMadison Morris, 22, University of Texas \nThe day the state troopers came in, that was also the day I had my last final exam. When I got to campus, they were already there and were closing in on students. \nThe tension was super high. I had never been that close to so many police before. It was scary. \nI didn't really study for my exam later that day - I couldn't focus. All I kept thinking about was what I had just seen. I doubt I did as well on the exam as I wanted.\nMy last day of class was the day I saw protesters - my fellow students - who were peacefully gathered on the main lawn, getting dragged away by police and arrested. \nThat's something that's going to be ingrained in my memory forever. Those are going to be the memories of my final moments in college.\nIt's hard to even feel happy right now while seeing all the negative stuff that's happening. I feel like I can't even really celebrate my accomplishments, because I'm just so overwhelmed. \nGraduation is next week. I had been looking forward to it for the last four years, because I didn't get to have a real one in high school. Because of Covid, we had to wear masks and there was social distancing. It wasn't the same. \nI was really hoping for a traditional graduation this year. I have been trying to make the most of my senior year and really just take it all in, but it's hard when stuff like this is going on. Like Covid, honestly, it all feels super dystopian. \nCraig Birckhead-Morton, 21, Yale University\nI was one of the 48 students arrested on 22 April. I woke up in the encampment at 6:30 to warnings from our safety marshals that we're being surrounded by the police. They told us to get up and prepare for arrest. I went to class the same day. It's been a very difficult time - a whole new level of stress. \nI have two final papers due. I have an Arabic project due. And I'm still behind on it because of everything that's going on.\nSenior year is extremely important, considering my family in all of this. They want to see me graduate. It's been a major concern of mine. \nWe still haven't heard how the university plans to respond. And in many ways that's scarier than our actual legal charges. \nWe might not be allowed to walk at graduation. We might not receive our diplomas or final transcripts. For me, the transcript is critical. I need it to matriculate into the master's programme I was accepted into at Columbia.\nPersonally, I feel that all this knowledge I'm acquiring at Yale needs to go to a just cause. That's why I felt it necessary to hold the line on this. The situation in Palestine is unacceptable.\nI remember the first week of March during my senior year of high school. We were sent home and things were made remote. \nWe didn't know that would be the end, but it was. No prom, no graduation. The pandemic was a major disruptor, but so were the Black Lives Matter protests. That was also a crucial part of the end of my high school experience and something that led me into organising and where I am today.\nMelissa Manesh, 21, University of Southern California\nThis is supposed to be a happy time, the last few days on campus we'll ever have as students. And now it's being taken over by protesters. There's so much chaos happening. It's frustrating. \nThe protesters are ruining student life. Libraries aren't being open at a time when most people are trying to study for final exams. \nThere are helicopters flying around. Only two entrances are open to campus, which forces some of us to walk extra-long distances. Protesters are also blocking a huge area on campus and making it feel unsafe to walk through. \nI know for the Jewish students, a lot of us are scared. They'll shout at you. They'll call you a genocide supporter. We don't want to see these protesters and their signs that are extremely offensive. It heightens the stress of having to study. It's hard not to think about this when it's all happening right in front of you. It's extremely distracting. \nIf you had told me that graduation was going to be cancelled, I wouldn't have believed you. When we found out, we were all really distraught and upset. This wa",

    "Efforts have intensified to secure a deal for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages, with talks resuming in Cairo on Saturday. \nHamas said its delegation was travelling in a \"positive spirit\" after studying the latest truce proposal.\n\"We are determined to secure an agreement in a way that fulfils Palestinians' demands,\" it said. \nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said \"taking the ceasefire should be a no-brainer\" for the militant group.\nHamas's negotiators have returned to the Egyptian capital to resume long-running talks - brokered by Egypt and Qatar - that would temporarily pause Israel's offensive in Gaza in return for freeing hostages. \nIn a statement released last night, Hamas said it wanted to \"mature\" the agreement on the table, which suggests there are areas where the two sides still disagree. \nThe main issue appears to involve whether the ceasefire deal would be permanent or temporary. \nHamas is insisting any deal makes a specific commitment towards an end to the war, but Israel is reluctant to agree while the group remains active in Gaza. It's thought the wording being discussed involves a 40-day pause in fighting while hostages are released, and the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails.\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted there will be a fresh military ground operation in the southern Gazan city of Rafah, even if a deal is agreed. Israeli media reported on Saturday that his position remained unchanged despite the latest round of talks.\nBut the US - Israel's biggest diplomatic and military ally - is reluctant to back a new offensive that could cause significant civilian casualties, and has insisted on seeing a plan to protect displaced Palestinians first. An estimated 1.4 million people have taken shelter in Rafah after fleeing the fighting in the northern and central areas of the strip.\nAddressing the prospects of a truce on Saturday, minister Benny Gantz, a member of Israel's war cabinet, said: \"An official response to the outline has not yet been received. When accepted - the war management cabinet will meet and discuss it. Until then, I suggest to the 'political sources' and all decision-makers to wait for official updates, to act calmly and not to get into hysteria for political reasons.\"\nThe Director of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Williams Burns, has travelled to Cairo to help broker the latest talks, according to two US officials who spoke to the BBC's US news partner, CBS News.\nMr Blinken has also been a key figure in the negotiations, and visited Israel again this week to meet Mr Netanyahu. Speaking on Friday in Arizona, Mr Blinken said \"the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire was Hamas\".  \nSo far, ceasefire talks have continued for months without a breakthrough. There hasn't been a pause in fighting or a release of hostages since the end of November. There have been moments in that time where a new agreement has seemed imminent, but a deal has fallen apart before it could be signed. \nEven in this latest round of discussions, caution is needed. A source familiar with the talks told the BBC that the negotiations remained complex, and any breakthrough could still take several days. \nA source told the Washington Post that the US had urged Qatar to expel Hamas's political leadership, if the group continued to reject a ceasefire.\nOn Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in Democracy Square in Tel Aviv calling for the release of hostages.\nRelatives of the hostages also gathered at the Kirya military base in Tel Aviv to urge the government to make a deal. Some accused Mr Netanyahu of trying to undermine a proposed truce, and others called for an end to the war.\nAyala Metzger, daughter-in-law of 80-year-old hostage Yoram, said the government must agree to end the war if that is the price for the release of the hostages.\nThe war began after Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups attacked villages and military bases in southern Israel, killing at least 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages.\nDuring the subsequent Israeli military campaign in Gaza, 34,654 Palestinians have been killed and 77,908 wounded, according to figures from the Hamas-run health ministry.",

One former official who worked on the intelligence reports told the paper the evidence was \"gobsmacking\".\nThe Sunday Times reveals that a huge investigation into the suspected murders of Afghan civilians by a rogue SAS unit was actually prompted by the squadron's commanding officer. \nThe unnamed soldier - one of the army's most senior Special Forces officers - reported to police that troops under his command had committed war crimes by murdering prisoners in Afghanistan, it says. \nEmails from the ensuing inquiry have now come to light suggesting other senior officers were aware of the killings but failed to report them, the paper says.\nAnd the Sun on Sunday claims that the actor Will Ferrell has bought what it calls a \"large stake\" in Leeds United Football Club.

    "The US has blamed the Rwandan army and M23 rebel group for the deadly bombing of a displacement camp in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nAt least nine people, including seven children, were killed in the strike on the Mugunga camp in the eastern city of Goma on Friday.\nThe Congolese army and M23 blamed each other for the attack.\nRwanda, which borders DR Congo, is widely accused of backing the rebel group and called the US accusation \"ridiculous\".\nRwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makalo said the Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) was a professional army that would never attack a camp for Internally Displaced People (IDP).\nThe US State Department said Friday's attack came from positions held by the RDF and the M23 group. \nA spokesperson said the US was \"gravely concerned about the recent RDF and M23 expansion\" in eastern DR Congo and called on both parties to \"respect human rights and adhere to applicable obligations under international humanitarian law\".\n\"It is essential that all states respect each other\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity and hold accountable all actors for human rights abuses in the conflict in eastern DR Congo,\" they added.\nImages circulating on social media showed bodies lying on the ground at the camp on Friday. \nMost residents had fled there to escape fighting in their home towns and villages.\nLt Col Guillaume Njike Kaiko, a spokesman for DR Congo's army in the region, said the strike had come in retaliation for earlier Congolese attacks on Rwandan army positions.\nPresident F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, who has spent several weeks abroad, will be returning to the central African country this weekend following the attack. \nRebel and government troops have both been accused in recent months of abuses against civilians as they vie for territorial control.\nThe latest strike comes days after M23 fighters claimed they had seized the town of Rubaya - an area which is at the heart of mining coltan used for making mobile phones and batteries for electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, a military court in Goma has sentenced eight DR Congo soldiers to death for \"desertion\" and \"cowardice\" when fighting rebel forces.\nM23, formed as an offshoot of another rebel group, began operating in 2012 ostensibly to protect the ethnic Tutsi population in the east of DR Congo, which had long complained of persecution and discrimination. \nUN experts have said that the group is backed by neighbouring Rwanda, which is also led by Tutsis, something that Kigali has consistently denied.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",
    "An outburst of pro-Palestinian protests and clashes with law enforcement on US college campuses has dominated headlines, and started conversations among diplomats scrambling to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East.\nIt puts US President Joe Biden in a new kind of domestic political bind.\nHe is caught between a left flank that is demanding peace, and Americans concerned that the unrest is disrupting university education and posing a threat to civil order.\nA message scrawled on a tent at a refugee camp in Rafah, the beleaguered southern Gaza Strip city, captured exactly how far word of recent US campus protests has travelled.\n\u201cThank you students for Columbia,\u201d it read. \u201cThank you. Thank You. Thank you.\u201d\nOther tents had similar messages of gratitude and solidarity, captured in video and photographs by American journalists on the scene.\nOver the past several weeks, police have arrested more than 2,000 protesters on dozens of college campuses across the US. \nLate Tuesday night at the University of California Los Angeles, a masked pro-Israeli group assaulted a pro-Palestinian student protest camp, before officers were called to the campus. Classes were cancelled. On Thursday, California police cleared the pro-Palestinian encampment.\nA similar scene played out at Columbia University, as New York City police in riot gear forcibly removed protesters who had barricaded themselves into an academic building and cleared that college's pro-Palestinian camp.\nThe unrest comes at a tense moment in the Gaza War. \nThe Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) appear to be preparing for a massive military operation in Rafah, a refuge for more than a million civilians. The Israelis have said it is the last redoubt of Hamas forces.\nMeanwhile, the US is pushing the Israelis and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire that would last weeks and include the release of some Hamas-held Israeli hostages, an increased flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza, and the return of Palestinians to the northern part of the territory, where the Israeli incursion began months ago.\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken recently concluded his seventh trip to the region since the start of hostilities, meeting with Arab leaders and the Israelis in a last-ditch attempt to forestall a Rafah operation that observers say is likely to cause a humanitarian disaster.\nAt a State Department briefing on Thursday, spokesman Matt Miller said that the Israelis had made significant concessions in recent negotiations \u2013 agreeing to conditions that Hamas had said were necessary to reach a deal.\n\u201cEvery day that goes by without a ceasefire right now is on Hamas,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are the ones that are holding up an answer to this proposal, and they are the ones that are holding up an immediate ceasefire.\u201d\nOn Friday, a Hamas leader said the group was reviewing the latest proposal in a \u201cpositive spirit\u201d, and a delegation was sent to Cairo for ceasefire talks on Saturday.\nAny sign of progress will be welcome news for a Biden administration that is coming under increasing pressure to stop \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 the civilian bloodshed and suffering in Gaza.\nIn his press briefing, Mr Miller was dismissive of the impact of American campus protests on US efforts, but he acknowledged that it was difficult to avoid US media coverage of the unrest even overseas, and that the topic came up in conversation during Mr Blinken\u2019s Middle East trip.\nOfficial American dismissiveness aside, the political pressure on Biden because of these protests is growing.\nFor months, the president has been resisting calls from factions within the Democratic left to back away from his vocal support for Israel.\nHe\u2019s done this despite clear political risk, as more liberal voters \u2013 particularly the young and people of colour, who make up a key part of his electoral coalition \u2013 have grown increasingly critical of what they view as a policy that is tolerant, if not supportive, of aggressive Israeli actions in Gaza.\nPolls show Mr Biden is in a tough fight for re-election in November, where even a slight softening of support in battleground states could be the difference between victory and another four years of Donald Trump in the White House.\n\u201cBecause of the razor-thin margins in some places like Wisconsin and Michigan that are going to be pivotal in the election, I think it creates more potential for the Gaza War to matter,\u201d says Jessica Weeks, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin, which has been the site of pro-Palestinian encampments and subsequent police arrests.\nAt least so far, that seems to be a risk Mr Biden is willing to take. \nVocal objections about the administration\u2019s support of Israel from the president\u2019s left flank have been a recurring theme in the months since Israel\u2019s invasion began. What\u2019s new \u2013 and potentially more complicating \u2013 is the pressure now coming from right and centre, as campus unrest has dominated the headlines.\nRepublicans, sensing vulnerability, have gone on",

    "Three Indian nationals have been arrested and charged over the killing of a Sikh separatist leader in Canada, which sparked a major diplomatic row between the two countries.\nHardeep Singh Nijjar, 45, was shot dead last June by masked gunmen in a busy car park in a Vancouver suburb.\nThe diplomatic row escalated after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged India's government may have been involved.\nDelhi strongly denied the allegation.\nIn announcing the arrests on Friday, Superintendent Mandeep Mooker said the three suspects were Karan Brar, 22, Kamal Preet Singh, 22, and 28-year-old Karan Preet Singh. \nHe said all three had been living in Edmonton, Alberta where they were arrested. They have been charged with first-degree murder, court records show, as well as conspiracy to commit murder. \nAll had been in Canada for three to five years, police said.\nPolice added that investigations were continuing, including into \"connections to the government of India\".\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters. Certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today,\" Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said.\nInvestigators have been working with counterparts in India but the collaboration has been \"rather difficult and rather challenging\" for several years, they said.\nPolice said there may be others involved in the killing, and there may be further arrests or charges.\nIndia's Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said the country would wait for Canadian police to share information on those arrested, adding the suspects \"apparently are Indians of some kind of gang background\".\nMr Nijjar was a Sikh separatist leader who publicly campaigned for Khalistan - the creation of an independent Sikh homeland in the Punjab region of India.\nIn the 1970s, Sikhs launched a separatist insurgency in India which saw thousands killed before it was quelled the following decade. Since then, the movement has been mostly limited to countries with large Sikh populations.\nIndia has in the past described Mr Nijjar as a terrorist who led a militant separatist group - accusations his supporters say are unfounded. They say he had received threats in the past because of his activism.\nHe was shot dead at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, a city about 30km (18 miles) east of Vancouver on 18 June last year.\nThose close to him have said he was warned by Canadian intelligence services before his death that he was on a \"hit list\" and there had been threats on his life. \nMoninder Singh, a member of the British Columbia Gurdwaras Council who was friends with Mr Nijjar for 15 years, told BBC News that the Sikh community was grateful to see progress in the investigation.\nHowever he said there were still \"public safety concerns\" and \"a lot of tension. There's frustration. And there's a hope, as well.\"\nThree months after Mr Nijjar was killed, Mr Trudeau, standing in the House of Commons, said Canada was looking at \"credible allegations potentially linking\" the Indian state to the killing. \nThe allegation had been strongly denied by Indian officials, who accused Canada of providing shelter to \"Khalistani terrorists and extremists\". \nThe row between the two countries led Delhi to ask Ottawa to reduce the number of envoys it had in India.\nMr Trudeau has also faced pressure to provide evidence for his allegation of Delhi's involvement.",

But, earlier this week Steel was given the all-clear by doctors.\n\"On Tuesday morning in the most mundane fashion someone rang from the hospital - I knew they were going to ring - and they said 'it is all alright'.\n\"But of course - and I don't know why - they don't tell you straight away. So there was about five minutes of 'how are you, how have you been, what have you been up to?'\n\"I just stayed calm and they mundanely said it is good news.\nSteel - who has a new series of Mark Steel's in Town coming up on BBC Radio 4 - had successful rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy to help treat his cancer.\n\"I don't recommend chemotherapy or radiotherapy as recreational drugs. It is quite brutal, but you have to think this is the way they cure it - and it does. \n\"There were several weeks when everything went. I had no voice at one point and I was just coughing up industrial levels of mucus. barrages of it into a little Tupperware salad bowl.\"\nSteel praised the facilities at UCLH which were also visited by King Charles in his first public-facing engagement since his own diagnosis.\nThe comedian said the chemotherapy room is \"one of the most positive places\" he has ever been to.\n\"You just have to get through it,\" Steel added. \"It is an immense relief and it is luck. \n\"It is partially the magnificence of the health service and you have to get yourself in the right frame of mind, mostly it is luck.\"\nIf you have been affected by any of these issues in this story you can visit BBC Action Line.",
    "The granddaughter of icon actress Diana Dors says it is important to keep her legacy alive, 40 years on from her death.\nBorn in Swindon, Wiltshire, in 1931, Diana Mary Fluck, famously known as Diana Dors, was known for films such as My Wife's Lodger and The Weak and the Wicked.\nShe died on 4 May 1984 aged 52 after being diagnosed with cancer. \nDiana's granddaughter Ruby Lake said she was \"proud\" her grandmother's legacy and said she was a \"national treasure\".\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Wiltshire, she said: \"She was the first of her type to own her sexuality and use it to her advantage. I\u2019m always quite pleased when women are able to capitalise on their beauty and their looks but also she was a very intelligent woman as well, so she capitalised on that too.\"\nMs Lake, the daughter of Diana's son Jason Dors Lake, who died in 2019, said it wasn't until she was around 16 years old that she realised \"how big of a British icon\" she was.\nMs Lake said despite not ever meeting her grandmother, she knows that she was \"a very low-key person\", \"very gentle\" and \"quite a private person\".\n\"She was just a mum to my dad,\" she added.\nMs Lake said over the years she had learnt so much about her character.\n\"I feel like I\u2019ve definitely inherited her work ethic.

    "A campaign has been launched to establish the UK's first memorial dedicated to journalists who have died while reporting from conflict zones.\nOn the Record: The National Memorial to Journalists on the Frontline is an initiative led by Press Gazette, Andrew Baud, and a group of journalists across the sector.\nIt is hoped it will be sited at the National Memorial Arboretum in Alrewas, Staffordshire.\nSince 2000, 16 UK journalists have been killed in the course of their reporting, according to the International Federation of Journalists. \nIn 2023 alone, 128 journalists and media workers were killed worldwide. \nThe group behind it hope that a sculpture in future will be complemented by a digital database containing the stories of UK journalists who died in the line of duty.\nOrganisers say the project aims to honour bravery and sacrifice in pursuit of the truth by creating a permanent place of remembrance for journalists who have lost their lives.\nAndrew Baud, who has worked closely with the National Memorial Arboretum for more than 16 years, said: \"Some time ago I received a letter from a member of the public who asked why there wasn\u2019t a memorial to war correspondents at the Arboretum. \n\"Having worked with journalists for my whole professional life and understanding the importance of remembering those who have sacrificed their lives for the greater good, the creation of a memorial to journalists reporting from the front line has become a personal mission for me.\"\nOrganisers are now seeking a wide range of partners to assist with the development of the project, helping with various tasks including fundraising, memorial design, database research, and curating the stories of individual journalists.\nPress Gazette editor-in-chief Dominic Ponsford said: \"Journalists risk their lives every day to shine a light into some of the darkest corners of the world. \n\"This memorial should serve as a reminder of the importance of the work we all do in the news business.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Three Indian nationals have been arrested and charged over the killing of a Sikh separatist leader in Canada, which sparked a major diplomatic row between the two countries.\nHardeep Singh Nijjar, 45, was shot dead last June by masked gunmen in a busy car park in a Vancouver suburb.\nThe diplomatic row escalated after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged India's government may have been involved.\nDelhi strongly denied the allegation.\nIn announcing the arrests on Friday, Superintendent Mandeep Mooker said the three suspects were Karan Brar, 22, Kamal Preet Singh, 22, and 28-year-old Karan Preet Singh. \nHe said all three had been living in Edmonton, Alberta where they were arrested. They have been charged with first-degree murder, court records show, as well as conspiracy to commit murder. \nAll had been in Canada for three to five years, police said.\nPolice added that investigations were continuing, including into \"connections to the government of India\".\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters. Certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today,\" Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said.\nInvestigators have been working with counterparts in India but the collaboration has been \"rather difficult and rather challenging\" for several years, they said.\nPolice said there may be others involved in the killing, and there may be further arrests or charges.\nIndia's Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said the country would wait for Canadian police to share information on those arrested, adding the suspects \"apparently are Indians of some kind of gang background\".\nMr Nijjar was a Sikh separatist leader who publicly campaigned for Khalistan - the creation of an independent Sikh homeland in the Punjab region of India.\nIn the 1970s, Sikhs launched a separatist insurgency in India which saw thousands killed before it was quelled the following decade. Since then, the movement has been mostly limited to countries with large Sikh populations.\nIndia has in the past described Mr Nijjar as a terrorist who led a militant separatist group - accusations his supporters say are unfounded. They say he had received threats in the past because of his activism.\nHe was shot dead at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, a city about 30km (18 miles) east of Vancouver on 18 June last year.\nThose close to him have said he was warned by Canadian intelligence services before his death that he was on a \"hit list\" and there had been threats on his life. \nMoninder Singh, a member of the British Columbia Gurdwaras Council who was friends with Mr Nijjar for 15 years, told BBC News that the Sikh community was grateful to see progress in the investigation.\nHowever he said there were still \"public safety concerns\" and \"a lot of tension. There's frustration. And there's a hope, as well.\"\nThree months after Mr Nijjar was killed, Mr Trudeau, standing in the House of Commons, said Canada was looking at \"credible allegations potentially linking\" the Indian state to the killing. \nThe allegation had been strongly denied by Indian officials, who accused Canada of providing shelter to \"Khalistani terrorists and extremists\". \nThe row between the two countries led Delhi to ask Ottawa to reduce the number of envoys it had in India.\nMr Trudeau has also faced pressure to provide evidence for his allegation of Delhi's involvement.",

I am proud we answered fearmongering with facts. \n\"It is truly an honour to be re-elected for a third term and an increased margin of victory. Today is not about making history it is about shaping our future.\"\nMr Khan also used his victory speech, which was initially interrupted by heckles, to urge Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to call a general election.\n\"For the last eight years London has been swimming against the tide of a Tory government and now with a Labour party that's ready to govern again under Keir Starmer.\n\"It's time for Rishi Sunak to give the public a choice - a general election wouldn't just pave the path for a new direction for our country but it will make bold action that Londoners want to see a reality.\"\nHis main rival Ms Hall then congratulated Mr Khan on his victory as she said campaigning to be mayor had been an \"honour and privilege\".\n\"I will continue to hold Sadiq to account, for hard-working families, motorists and women,\" she said. \"I urge Sadiq to make London better for all our sakes.\"\nCounting started at 09:00 BST on Saturday and all candidates attended City Hall for the official announcement at about 17:00.\nMr Khan won constituencies including Lambeth & Southwark, Barnet & Camden, City of London & East, Merton & Wandsworth, Greenwich & Lewisham, Enfield & Haringey and North East - all of which he won at the last contest in 2021.\nHe gained West Central from the Conservatives, with a 5.2% swing to Labour from the Tories, and South West from the Tories with a 2.7% swing.\nMs Hall held outer London boroughs of Havering & Redbridge, Croydon & Sutton, Bexley & Bromley, Ealing & Hillingdon and Brent & Harrow.\nOverall Mr Khan won 1,088,225 votes comfortably beating Ms Hall who secured 812,397 votes.\nThe Liberal Democrats edged the Green Party to third place, while Reform UK's candidate Howard Cox finished fifth with 3.2% of the overall vote.\nLib Dem candidate Rob Blackie said: \"We've increased our vote everywhere in London and [are pleased] to have got into third place for the first time in a long time.\"\nGreen London Assembly member Caroline Russell described mayoral candidate Zo\u00eb Garbett as \"a break out\" during the campaign and \"someone who brought a ray of sunshine\".\nSpeaking at City Hall ahead of the official results, London Assembly's Labour group leader Len Duvall effectively called the election result for Mr Khan.\nMr Duvall told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: \"I think the trends are there. I think this looks like Sadiq has crossed the line and has got a third term.\"\nHe believed Liberal Democrat and Green voters appeared to have \"lent\" their support on the mayoral ballot to Mr Khan, while Reform UK took votes from the Conservatives.\nThe former Conservative Minister for London was critical of Ms Hall and said the Tories ran an \"incredibly underwhelming campaign\".\nPaul Scully, who stood unsuccessfully in the Conservative's selection process to be its mayoral candidate, told the BBC the Tories had \"gifted\" Mr Khan a third term.\nVotes were also counted for London Assembly constituency members and London Assembly London-wide members.\nWith all 14 constituency results in for the London Assembly election Labour has 10 seats, the Conservatives three and the Liberal Democrats one.\nThe voting breaks down to Labour recording 983,216 votes (39.70%) with the Conservatives on 673,036 (27.18%).\nThe Greens finished third with 319,859 (12.92%), ahead of the Lib Dems on 274,049 (11.07%) - and Reform UK on 183,358 (7.40%). \nFinally, the London-wide top-up list, which decided the other 11 Assembly members, elected the following on Saturday night:\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The US has blamed the Rwandan army and M23 rebel group for the deadly bombing of a displacement camp in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nAt least nine people, including seven children, were killed in the strike on the Mugunga camp in the eastern city of Goma on Friday.\nThe Congolese army and M23 blamed each other for the attack.\nRwanda, which borders DR Congo, is widely accused of backing the rebel group and called the US accusation \"ridiculous\".\nRwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makalo said the Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) was a professional army that would never attack a camp for Internally Displaced People (IDP).\nThe US State Department said Friday's attack came from positions held by the RDF and the M23 group. \nA spokesperson said the US was \"gravely concerned about the recent RDF and M23 expansion\" in eastern DR Congo and called on both parties to \"respect human rights and adhere to applicable obligations under international humanitarian law\".\n\"It is essential that all states respect each other\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity and hold accountable all actors for human rights abuses in the conflict in eastern DR Congo,\" they added.\nImages circulating on social media showed bodies lying on the ground at the camp on Friday. \nMost residents had fled there to escape fighting in their home towns and villages.\nLt Col Guillaume Njike Kaiko, a spokesman for DR Congo's army in the region, said the strike had come in retaliation for earlier Congolese attacks on Rwandan army positions.\nPresident F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, who has spent several weeks abroad, will be returning to the central African country this weekend following the attack. \nRebel and government troops have both been accused in recent months of abuses against civilians as they vie for territorial control.\nThe latest strike comes days after M23 fighters claimed they had seized the town of Rubaya - an area which is at the heart of mining coltan used for making mobile phones and batteries for electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, a military court in Goma has sentenced eight DR Congo soldiers to death for \"desertion\" and \"cowardice\" when fighting rebel forces.\nM23, formed as an offshoot of another rebel group, began operating in 2012 ostensibly to protect the ethnic Tutsi population in the east of DR Congo, which had long complained of persecution and discrimination. \nUN experts have said that the group is backed by neighbouring Rwanda, which is also led by Tutsis, something that Kigali has consistently denied.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

This exhibition bring these things wonderfully together.\"\nDr Criscenzo-Laycock said she hoped the free exhibition would \u201cbuild up a picture of the natural environment\u201d of Egypt and Sudan - where the White Nile and Blue Nile unite after flowing from Tanzania and Ethiopia respectively.\n\u201cWhile we have borders, animals do not \u2013 we\u2019re looking at the area as an ecosystem,\" she said. \nShe said there was a misconception that those living around the Nile were \"obsessed with death but actually they were obsessed with life\".\n\"They conceived the afterlife as an idealistic version of real life.\"\nThe display showcases pottery etched with animal-inspired designs and their incorporation in hieroglyphic writing.\nIt also highlights how creatures were a source of food, with remnants used for clothing, tools and jewellery.\nSome animals were hunted to extinction, while other wild species moved due to environmental change and increases in human and livestock population.\nDr Criscenzo-Laycock said the exhibition would show \"how humans view animals from the point of view of ideology\".\nSome of the most recognisable Nile symbols are hybrid figures, particularly the human-headed, lion-bodied Great Sphinx of Giza.\n\"Animal imagery was used as an expression of divine power but also human agency,\" said Dr Criscenzo-Laycock, who is based at Garstang Museum of Archaeology.\nShe highlighted the goddess Taweret, shown as a hippopotamus, who was \u201cevoked to protect mothers in childbirth\u201d.\n\"It\u2019s because they\u2019re terrifying.

This lecturer was giving her talk in the middle of an encampment, which university students set up on Wednesday to protest against the war in Gaza.\nHere in Newcastle, about 40 students have set up camp on the university\u2019s quadrangle, with tents for sleeping, a makeshift first-aid centre, and tables for all the snacks donated by supporters - including crisps, water, and a Colin the Caterpillar cake.\nStudents themselves do coursework or exam revision on the grass, or slip off for seminars and lectures, as they would if it were student halls.

All of those I speak to tell me they feel \u201cproud\u201d to see their students taking part.\nRunning along the perimeter are hand-painted signs.\nNaomi, who\u2019s asked that we don\u2019t use her full name, shows me a sign that she\u2019d painted the night before.\n\u201cIt says \u2018Tzedek, Tzedek, Tirdof\u2019,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt means \u2018justice, justice, shall you seek\u2019.\u201d\nNaomi says the sign - written in Hebrew - reflects how her Jewish faith has shaped her view of the conflict in Gaza.\n\u201cI was always raised with a very strong sense of justice, because of my Jewish community,\u201d she explains, adding that the sign \u201cencompasses so much of what my Judaism means to me\u201d.\n\u201cIn many ways, if I hadn\u2019t been Jewish, I wouldn\u2019t feel so firmly in solidarity with Palestine, because of the sense of social justice that my faith gives me.\u201d\nNewcastle students are just one of many student bodies across the country to set up similar occupied protests this week.\nSimilar outdoor camps have been erected on campuses including at Leeds, Manchester and Sheffield, while a camp outside Warwick University has been in place for 10 days. At Goldsmiths, University of London, students have occupied the library, inside the university building.\nEarlier this week the Union of Jewish Students (UJS) released a statement saying campus protests in support of Gaza were creating a \u201chostile and toxic atmosphere for Jewish students\u201d.\nGuy Dabby-Joory, from the UJS, told me they knew there were Jewish supporters of the movement, but that they\u2019d heard a lot of concerns from members.\nThese UK protests have sprung up amid the backdrop of much larger demonstrations and occupations on campuses across the US - most prominently at Columbia University, New York, and at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).\nThose protests have seen more than 2,000 people detained over the past fortnight.\nWhile the calmness of the Newcastle camp feels a million miles away from those scenes, those who are taking part tell me that their counterparts in the US have seen what they\u2019re doing, and have been in touch.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some people from Columbia message us,\u201d Frank, another student protester, tells me. Frank\u2019s pronouns are they/them, and they asked that we not use their real name. \u201cThey just wanted to send us their solidarity - and that is really warming to see.\u201d\nThey say the group behind the occupation - Newcastle Apartheid Off Campus - had been organising in support of Gaza for several months, and that the occupation was planned before the recent disorder kicked off in the US. But the occupation was partly organised now to say to US students: \u201cYou\u2019re not alone.\u201d\nStudents in the UK share some common goals with their US counterparts - in particular, the call for their universities to sever financial and research ties with Israel, a process known as divestment.\nBut as well as this, Frank tells me they feel an emotional connection to students in Gaza - who, in better times, are no different to them.\n\u201cThere are tens of thousands of students in Gaza, and their lives are completely upended. There's no way you can pursue an education when you've got bombs raining down on you,\u201d Frank said. \n\u201cWe\u2019re sat in a peaceful university, studying, and they don\u2019t have that opportunity.\u201d\nAlthough it\u2019s quiet now, rallies that are held at 5pm daily attract hundreds of other students. Frank estimates there were around 200 people at the last one.\nI ask one of the staff members - Dr Jemima Repo, a reader in political and feminist theory - whether she worries at all about the camp becoming disruptive during exam season.\n\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d she says. The camp itself, while on the campus and visible, is set apart from walkways and entrances.\n\u201cAs far as I understand the relationship between campus security and police has been very good,\u201d Dr Repo says",
    "The owner of Gwen's house in Gavin and Stacey has said she expects more coach loads of visitors following the announcement that the BBC hit TV show is to make a return for a final episode on Christmas Day. \nGlenda Kenyon, 70, said her life changed after she answered a letter from the show producers looking for a house on Trinity Street in Barry, the Vale of Glamorgan, in 2006. \nHer terraced home, set on a steep street overlooking the Bristol Channel, became one of the comedy's main locations which is still visited by regular coach tours.\n\"I think it's put Barry on the map, she said. \n\"Since we've had Gavin and Stacey they started building houses, schools. I think that's what we needed.\"\nGlenda's home has had nearly 30,000 visitors, with Gavin and Stacey fans coming from as far away as Australia, Hawaii and India. \nAnd could a new episode prompt even more?\n\"I'm in for it, I am,\" joked Glenda. \"It's bound to get more [busier].\"\nGlenda, who has lived in Barry for 35 years, said being associated with the comedy has changed her life.\nWhen the house is needed, the crew temporarily remove her furniture and replace it with Gwen and Stacey West's interiors - and Glenda is put up in a hotel.\nWhat does she want to see in finale?\n\"I hope they finish off the fishing trip because I am desperate to find out,\" she said.\nSince the show began in 2007, fans have been sharing their theories on the mystery fishing trip involving Uncle Bryn and his nephew Jason.\nIn the last Christmas special, Bryn and Jason were finally ready to tell the whole family what happened, but they were interrupted.\nJames Corden ended speculation about new Gavin and Stacey material by announcing a final episode of the show will air on Christmas Day.\nWriting on Instagram, the former talk show host said: \"It's official! We have finished writing the last ever episode of Gavin and Stacey\".\nHe added: \"See you on Christmas Day, BBC One. Love Ruth and James.\"\nIt confirmed the episode has been written with co-creator Ruth Jones, who has shared an on-screen relationship with Corden in their roles.\nViewers will be hoping to find out what has happened between Nessa and Smithy, but also to see how their on-screen son, \"Neil the Baby\", is doing.\nThe final episode could be a bittersweet moment for fans - the 2019 Christmas special was the most watched show in a decade, bringing in more than 17 million viewers.\nRunning for three series between 2007 and 2010, it started off as a BBC Three sitcom but was soon shifted to prime time BBC One.\nSet in both Essex and Wales, it has become a cult classic, despite only winning a handful of awards at the time; two Bafta TV awards in 2008 and one National Television Award in 2010.\nIt also won a Must-See Moment Bafta in 2020, voted for by the public, for the moment when Nessa proposed. \nThe show also picked up an impact award at the National Television Awards in 2020 - showing its longevity in the comedy space.",
    "The Liberal Democrats have won 104 new council seats and gained control of two councils in Thursday's local elections.\nLib Dems now run Dorset and Tunbridge Wells councils, but failed to take one of its other key target of Wokingham.\nThe party made gains in traditionally Conservative voting areas of the south of England, known as the \"blue wall\".\nLeader Sir Ed Davey claimed voters were switching from the Tories because they \"have had enough of being taken for granted and being let down\".\nThe Lib Dems won extra council seats in West Oxfordshire, Winchester and Cheltenham, while gaining control of Dorset Council from the Conservatives.\nWith just one of 107 councils to declare, the party has returned 521 councillors at these elections, more than the Conservatives on 513.\nThis would be the first time since 1996 it has beaten the Tories in a local vote, although historical comparisons between local elections are tough because of the different seats up for grabs each time.\nOn Saturday, the party took the London Assembly seat for the South West constituency, which includes the boroughs of Hounslow, Richmond and Kingston.\nThe BBC's projected national share, calculated using results from key wards, has the Lib Dems on 17% nationally, behind the Tories on 25%.\nThis is down three points on last year - when the party hit 20% for the first time since entering into coalition with the Conservatives in 2010.\nBut it is broadly in line with its projected share since the Brexit referendum in 2016. \nSir Ed said Conservative MPs would be \"looking over their shoulder\" ahead of the general election later this year.\nTo emphasise the point at a rally on Friday, party activists wore inflatable dinosaur costumes and blue Conservative rosettes holding a banner saying \"Make this Conservative government history\".\nUnder Sir Ed, the party has become well known for campaign stunts featuring large and outlandish props.\nThese have included turning the hands on a clock face in the style of Parliament's Big Ben, to demonstrate \"time's up\" for Rishi Sunak, and Sir Ed knocking down a giant blue wall with an orange Lib Dem hammer.",
    "For most people, running a marathon is a huge achievement \u2013 something to tick off the bucket list.\nFor 61-year-old Steve Edwards, though, it has become something of an obsession.\nHe is about to run his 1,000th 26.2-mile race - something only 50 people in the world have accomplished.\nBut what drives him, and with each race getting harder and harder, could this be his last?\nSteve ran his first marathon, in Coventry, in 1981 as a \"naive\" 18-year-old after seeing a poster at his local gym.\n\"I hadn't a clue about what a marathon entailed or how to prepare,\" he says.\n\"But I guess you could say that ignorance is bliss because I went into it open-eyed and just looking forward to it.\"\nDespite having just five weeks to prepare, Steve finished in a respectable three  hours and 38 minutes, but admits he struggled beyond mile 15.\n\"The next day I got out of bed and my legs were like gate posts,\" he laughs. \"I couldn't walk properly for a week and I vowed never to do it again.\"\nHe soon forgot that pledge. Steve enjoyed the \"runner's high\" so much he gave up kung fu, and, like many others during the running boom of the 1980s, joined a running club.\nOver the next four decades, Steve would accomplish countless world records and some truly staggering achievements.\nHe has, on average, run an official marathon every 13 days for the past 36 years, with a combined distance of more than 26,000 miles (41,800km)  \u2013 further than the circumference of the earth.\nIn the marathon world he is known as 'The Godfather', and completing 1,000 marathons in the fastest ever average finish time will certainly cement his place in history.\nBut what is arguably most telling is that every race Steve has entered, he has finished.\nThe retired IT worker from Longborough, Gloucestershire, thinks his unwavering determination and strength is a result of being picked on at school.\nBorn with a deformed left hand, he \"suffered at the hands of bullies for many years\".\n\"Growing-up I was always saying 'I am capable, I can do this',\" he says.\n\"Running gave me a new type of self-confidence that I didn't have in my school years and I'm now very resilient and stubborn.\"\nIn 2010, Steve ran his 500th marathon and planned to stop competing. \n\"I was worn out,\" he says. \"But on the way home I said to my wife 'I think I've got a few more in me.'\"\nHe hoped to complete his 1,000th marathon in 2022, the year he turned 60. However, during the Covid-19 pandemic many races were cancelled and he soon lost his motivation.\nDespite still training, including weightlifting, six days a week, his body never fully recovered from \"all the wear and tear\" and he was close to giving up.\n\"People think I'm a machine,\" he says. \u201cBut sometimes getting out of bed and taking those first few steps to go to the toilet or get a cup of tea I feel like I'm not capable of running one mile, let alone 26.\n\"It now takes me a good few miles to find a rhythm... and I find that I'm getting anxious the day before a race.\"\nAt 09:00 BST on Monday, Steve will be joined by dozens of supporters as he sets off to complete a challenge 43 years in the making.\nHe says he chose Milton Keynes Marathon for the finale as he has completed more races there than anywhere else.\nAsked how he might feel once the race is over, he chokes up and tears fill his eyes.\n\"I don't think it's quite hit me yet what it's going to feel like,\" he says.\n\"Because I know the day after I'll be thinking 'It's all over'. Part of me gets emotional about it.\"\nSteve is still unsure whether he will continue running competitively.\nHe says he has promised his wife Teresa he will stop taking part in challenges.\n\"A part of me is looking forward to not having to train,\" he adds. \"I might pick it up again after a break, but I might not.\"\nOrganisers of the Milton Keynes Marathon have announced a new award in recognition of the \"commitment shown by Steve and Teresa\".\nThe 'Team Edwards Lifetime Achievers Award' will be given to a runner every year who has shown devotion to the sport.\nDuring his marathon-running career, Steve has gone through 100 pairs of shoes, travelled as far afield as New Zealand and raised tens of thousand of pounds for charity.\n\"Personally, I want to look back and know that I achieved my potential,\" he says.\n\"I want to be able to look in the mirror and say 'You gave every race your best on that particular day'.

    "\"This is the moment,\" a senior Tory excitedly told me just before these local elections began. \nThe moment when Rishi Sunak's leadership was in jeopardy - they hoped at least. \nIf the results were as dreadful as months of shocking national opinion polls suggest, there was a chance that Conservative MPs would find the desire and the gumption to push for change at the top.\nOn Saturday night, West Midlands Mayor Andy Street lost his berth after a nail-biting count. \nThat will be a huge disappointment to the Conservatives who had hoped to hang on there.\nEspecially with a razor thin margin, and after counting some votes again and again.\nLike Ben Houchen on Teesside, Andy Street had campaigned as his own man, not a party apparatchik.\nRecounts, and bundles of votes being checked, tell you how close that outcome really was. \nThe Street result is a huge last minute disappointment, and the council election results are dire. One minister told me there are \"lots of places where panic could come from\". \nBut even with the Street defeat, it seems \"the moment\" is more likely to be the one where Rishi Sunak's position as leader has been confirmed. So far.\nWhy? \nWell, Tory HQ can't mention the mayor in Tees Valley, Ben Houchen's victory, often enough. \nBefore the elections, the party was urging its own MPs and the public to concentrate on where there were prominent local politicians. \nIt was a not very subtle pre-poll expectation management exercise. Lord Houchen, a local big character, did indeed buck the national trend. \nAnd that showed that in areas where Conservatives had a good, well-known candidate and chucked the kitchen sinks at their campaign, they can win. \nAlthough \"there's an irony that a Boris guy, Ben, has saved Sunak\", one Tory jokes.  \nBut the result there does give the party at least one reason for cheer. \nSign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.\nSecond, the pundits' calculators suggested that if the whole country had voted on Thursday, the gap between the Conservatives and Labour comes out at 9%: not, theoretically, an insurmountable gap to close when the general election campaign is miles away and could bend the curves. \nOne cabinet minister said that after months of \"frothing at the mouth about apocalypse actually, maybe we could have a hung parliament. This will encourage people to believe there is a fight worth having.\"\nRemember too, Labour fell so far behind in 2019 that it needs to shift millions of votes, not a few here and there, to win outright when it comes to the national question. \nAnd even if the numbers look scary in lots of parts of the country, with the Tories losing hundreds of campaign foot soldiers, changing the leader to an as-yet-undecided alternative candidate might just cause more disruption, more bellyaching, more turmoil. \nIf chaos in the Westminster party has been part of the problem, why on earth would it be the solution? \nA former minister says: \"There just isn't the impetus to roll the dice one more time.\" \nThere is no one guiding idea or philosophy that binds the malcontents together either, beyond 'it looks grim, surely we need to do something or else we're out of a job?' \nAnd there is no agreed candidate. \nIndeed, one of those who might be tempted to run, former cabinet minister Suella Braverman, has written in the Sunday Telegraph that while she believes the party must change course, changing the leader is not the answer. \nRewind to the Theresa May days. The rebels weren't just well organised, they agreed they needed a more dramatic departure from the EU and they had a candidate waiting in the wings - Boris Johnson. \nThey were pushing for a different policy platform and they had a big personality, bristling with ambition, eager to plot. That's just not the case now. \nAnd yet, one Tory describes it as \"Alice in Wonderland\" to suggest the victories of a mayor with strong personal backing like Ben Houchen means things are going to be OK for the national party.  \nAnd look at some of the other mayoral contests, the West Midlands, the East Midlands, or the embarrassment for Rishi Sunak of losing the mayoral contest in his own North Yorkshire neighbourhood. \nLook at the map, not the mayors. Those councils the Conservatives have lost - Nuneaton, Redditch, Milton Keynes, Rushmoor, Basildon and so many others.  \nIt's like a roll call of towns and areas where the Labour party hopes to win MPs at the general election. Add in the Lib Dems taking Dorset council, Tunbridge Wells and kicked the Tories out of control in Gloucester, and, in fact, winning more councillors than the Conservatives for the first time since 1996.\nOne former Tory minister told me, it has \"been an appalling night and no amount of spin from the national party can hide the fact that we are in very, very big trouble\". \nMany of them are areas that were captured by the Tories as David Cameron made his way to Number 10 ",
    "Almost all results are in from council elections across England, in the last big test of public opinion before a general election.\nAll of the results from the mayoral contests and all but one of the results from local councils have now been announced. \nHere are the key takeaways from the results.\nLabour gained more than 180 council seats to take control of eight councils, including Milton Keynes and Nuneaton, where there are traditional bellwether seats for general elections.\nIn key wards identified by the BBC, its vote share was up 3% compared to 2021, the last time most seats were contested.\nThe results, however, are only partially useful for working out the national picture, because independents feature more strongly in local votes.\nThere were also no contests in Scotland and Northern Ireland, whilst only police and crime commissioners were elected in Wales.\nIts best early result was arguably in the by-election in Blackpool South, held alongside the local contests, which it won with a 26% swing from the Tories. \nThis is in line with national opinion polls, which suggest Sir Keir Starmer is heading for victory at this year's general election, whenever it is called.\nAnd its victory in the West Midlands mayoral race - a late result which saw Richard Parker beat incumbent Tory Andy Street - was dubbed by Sir Keir a \"phenomenal result\" for Labour.\nThe party has lost over 470 councillors, just under half of the seats it was defending, in a bad day for Rishi Sunak.\nIt has returned only 515 councillors overall at these elections, fewer than the 522 council seats won by the Liberal Democrats.\nThe Tories lost control of 10 councils, including Basildon in Essex, which gained an iconic status for the Tories under Margaret Thatcher, when the Tories won working class areas that had traditionally voted Labour. \nDespite the dismal results, however, the signs are that the prime minister's internal critics are holding off on a leadership challenge.\nMr Sunak can point to to Tees Valley, where incumbent Tory Ben Houchen won a third term as regional mayor, with senior figures saying the party is still in with a chance at the general election.\nLabour won a trio of newly-created regional mayor roles, continuing its recent successes in this area in recent years.\nAlthough its victory in the North East was widely expected, it will be particularly pleased with its victory in the East Midlands, expected to be a key battleground at the general election,\nIts York and North Yorkshire win also provided the party with a PR coup, as the region contains Rishi Sunak's constituency.\nLabour's Sadiq Khan won a third term as London mayor and Richard Parker defeated Andy Street in the West Midlands by the narrow margin of just 1,508 votes. \nLabour has suffered some heavy losses in wards with a large number of Muslim voters, in a sign its stance on the Israel-Gaza war is affecting its vote in those areas.\nIn 58 local council wards analysed by the BBC, where more than 1 in 5 residents identify as Muslim, Labour's share of the vote was 21% down on 2021, the last time most seats were contested.\nBut there is some evidence the biggest drops in support are largely confined to wards where the party's support was already very strong.\nGeorge Galloway's strongly pro-Palestinian Workers Party of Britain won four seats - two in Rochdale, one in Calderdale and one in Manchester, where they ousted the Labour deputy leader of the council Luthfur Rahman.\nIt was a good election for smaller parties, with the Lib Dems and Greens winning council seats in areas they will be targeting at the general election.\nThe Liberal Democrats have made gains of 104 councillors so far and won Tunbridge Wells and Dorset.\nIt failed to take control of West Oxfordshire and Wokingham, both target areas.\nThe Greens have gained over 70 seats, including 10 on Bristol City Council, an area it is targeting at the general election, where they fell narrowly short of an overall majority.\nThe party has increased its vote share in areas with a high Muslim population, as well in areas with lots of students.\nNigel Farage and Richard Tice's party won 16.9% of the vote in Blackpool South, coming third, only 117 votes behind the Tory candidate.\nThis was its best performance yet in a Westminster by-election, although not as good as the 28.9% it won in Peterborough in 2019 in its previous guise as the Brexit Party.\nThe share of the vote suggests that while about two-thirds of the Tory vote may have gone to Labour, about a third went to Reform - something that may worry Tory election strategists.\nHowever, the party has only won two council seats so far, both in Havant, near Portsmouth.\nAssessing the party's performance here is more difficult, however, as it is only standing just over 326 candidates in 316 wards, a very low number.\nBoris Johnson hit the headlines after being turned away from his local polling station after forgetting his voter ID.\nThe former prime minister, whose government introduced t",
    "Fans of one of the world's oldest football clubs fear for its future if it slips out of the national leagues for the first time in its history.\nStranraer FC sit at the foot of the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) and,  with just one game left in the regular season, look in serious danger of ending up in the play-offs to avoid relegation.\nJust 10 years ago the Blues were battling with Rangers in League One and earning a draw at Ibrox in front of 45,000 fans. \nBut the glory days seem long gone with the country's third oldest club, founded in 1870, at real risk of losing its league status.\nThey must win this weekend against league winning Stenhousemuir to have any chance to avoid finishing bottom of the table and facing a play-off to survive.\nSitting at Scotland's south-west corner, Stranraer consistently have the SPFL's lowest attendances, and fans are pleading for more local people in Wigtownshire to support the club.\nAlan Hannah, who has supported them for more than half a century, described his dismay. \"Things have declined and declined for the past 15 or 20 years, and there's less and less fans coming through the gates.\" \nThe 57-year-old has strong connections to the club. His father played in the reserves, and his grandfather sat on the board. \nBut he feels Stranraer will continue to struggle until more local people support the club. \n\"With barely any fans coming through the gates, there's no money to get better players,\" he said.\n\"Since dropping to League Two the last four years have been a downward slope. We've got a young squad, and that lack of experience isn't helping.\n\"But the attendances are not good enough, and we're unlikely to get big investors outside of the central belt\".\nWhile attendances at Stair Park have slid to as low as 273 when Elgin City visited in March, there remains a core of loyal fans. \nOne of those is Alex Smith, who has moved away from his native Wigtownshire to Durham, but travels more than 17,000 miles every season to attend all of Stranraer's fixtures - home and away. \nThe 73-year-old feels it would be \"catastrophic\" for the area if the team fall into the regional Lowland League. \nHe believes if that happened, Stranraer would struggle to get players to come down from the central belt - but it won't change his support\n\"My love for the club dates back to the 1960s,\" he said.\n\"They were the first professional side I ever watched as our local side, and it's just been under the skin ever since.\n\"It will be catastrophic if we get relegated to the Lowland league. But if it comes, it comes, I'll still be there, as it's not a week without seeing Stranraer on a Saturday.\"\nStranraer season ticket holder Rhuri Paton said the current plight was \"tough to take. The 31-year-old feels that the lack of funding is to blame.\nHe said: \"There's been a slow decline. We have one of the lowest crowds, and expenses like bus travel that others don't so this sadly isn't a surprise in the fan base\".\nHe believes relegation is a one-way ticket for the Blues.\n\"This decline has happened to other clubs, Albion Rovers, Brechin, Cowdenbeath. None have come back to professional football. So it's worrying, but you could see it coming.\"\nMr Paton is adamant the club's committee structure is one of its positives, and that young players like using Stranraer \"as a stepping stone because they get treated very well by the management\".\nBut he feels that will change if they drop down and worries whether Stena Line - whose shirt sponsorship of the Blues is the longest-running in football - will continue. \nLaurence Nelson hosts the \"It\u2019s No Easy\" unofficial Stranraer FC weekly podcast.\nThe 61-year-old fears the club he's supported since the 1960s is set to go through \"one of its darkest episodes\".\nHe said: \"My father used to drag me along to Stair Park to begin with, that's what got me started.\n\"He was the generation that saw Stranraer come out of the South of Scotland league and be a fully fledged SPFL club, and I'm possibly going to see them drop back out.\"\nMr Nelson also believes finance is the key  issue, and there will be no coming back if Stranraer drop out of the national leagues.\nHe adds: \"We've not seen a team come back from dropping down to the Lowland League, and if that happens then I feel for the younger fans.\n\"I've seen us win Second Division titles, win the Challenge Cup, cup shocks, a win at Easter Road against Hibs, a draw at Ibrox. \n\"But it feels like we're swilling the drain.\"\nLike all the club's other fans he will hoping they can somehow leapfrog Clyde on the final day of the season - or else triumph in the play-offs if that's where they end up.\nFollow the BBC for the South of Scotland on X. \nListen to news for Dumfries and Galloway on BBC Sounds.

    "Plans to expand water fluoridation to 1.6 million more people to prevent tooth decay are to be discussed.\nThe Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) wants to introduce fluoridation to more areas of the North East.\nThe plans are currently out for public consultation and will be discussed by Durham County Council on 13 May, though areas across the whole region will be affected.\nFluoride is a naturally occurring mineral which protects teeth against decay and that has historically been added to water in some areas to provide additional protection for oral health.\nDocuments submitted to the council's health and wellbeing board said 26% of five-year-olds living in non-fluoridated areas in County Durham had suffered tooth decay. \nThat was 2% higher than those living in areas where fluoride had been added to water, the document said.\nThe statement also said 120 children under five had to have a tooth removed in hospital due to decay in the year up to March 2023.\nNorthumbrian Water has supplied artificially fluoridated water since the late 1960s to  Chester le Street, Consett, and Stanley in County Durham, Alnwick, Hexham and Cramlington in Northumberland and parts of North Tyneside, Newcastle and Gateshead.\nNow DHSC wants to expand the scheme to Darlington, Durham, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland, South Tyneside, Stockton, Sunderland and areas not currently covered in Gateshead, Newcastle, Northumberland and North Tyneside.\nThe government body said a small number of rural areas could not be covered, as it would not be cost-effective. \nThey added that for every \u00a31 spent on water fluoridation in the area, it expects to save \u00a313 after five years. \nA presentation that will be shown to councillors aims to bust myths about the practice, including that fluoridation is a form of \"mass medication\".\nDocuments state: \"A medication is typically used to relieve symptoms. Fluoride is a mineral, not a medication. It is proven by decades of research to prevent tooth decay.\n\"Fluoridation works in addition to fluoride in toothpaste.  It is a public health measure endorsed by the four UK chief medical officers.\"\nWhen the plans were announced earlier this year, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said: \"Water fluoridation can reduce the prevalence of tooth decay and improve dental health equity across the UK. \n\"It should be seen as a complementary strategy, not a substitute for other effective methods of increasing fluoride use such as tooth brushing.\"\nDurham County Council is expected to make a decision on its response to the consultation before it closes on 17 June. \nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "It may be hard to imagine how an 83-year-old woman could instil such fear into victims of her money lending scheme that they paid her tens of thousand of pounds of interest on top of illegal loans.\nBut loan sharks like Tabitha Richardson - who was told to repay more than \u00a3173,000 to six victims this week - are on the rise due to financial pressure being felt by people across the UK.\nThere are more loan sharks than ever under investigation, according to the agency Stop Loan Sharks Wales which brought Richardson's actions to light.\nMethods of intimidation include threats of violence, stealing goods in lieu of payment and even kidnapping.\nRyan Evans, a client liaison officer with Stop Loan Sharks Wales, said he was seeing more active cases now than in the whole of his 11-year stint with the agency.\nPerpetrators and their victims often belong to the same communities, he said, and recent cases have come from within church groups and the care industry.\nIt was his job, as someone who deals with victim support and safety, to speak to a couple of Richardson's victims after a concerned relative made contact with his team, which is run by the Wales Illegal Money Lending Unit.\nRichardson, from Newport, was a businesswoman who had previously run pubs and had at one time worked for a legitimate lending firm, at which time she would have had a licence.\n\"It seems over time that that firm ceased, but she carried on lending on an ad hoc basis to people who she claims requested it,\" Ryan said.\n\"She would not have been licensed at that point so the criminal offence was lending money without the required licence.\n\"She'd been lending money for a good number of years up until that point and that's how we stumbled upon it, through the investigation.\"\nRyan said the reasons why people were borrowing had changed in recent years. \n\"Prior to the pandemic it was something coming into the household, they didn't legislate for it - your washing machine, fridge-freezer.\n\"We're not seeing that now. [It's] because of everyday bills.\"\nA total of 63% of victims report borrowing from a loan shark for this reason, he said.\nSeemingly respectable people like Richardson can create enough fear in people - particularly those who are already vulnerable - to keep them in financial thrall for years.\n\"So at the lower end of the spectrum, like you've got with Tabitha, there are nasty things like little menacing texts, harassment, that type of level.\n\"The text messages were, 'you don't want me to come looking for you'. 'Don't make me come and find you', things of that nature.\n\"But that can increase. In Richardson's case there were threats to talk to members of the victims' families, to tell them what's been happening.\"\nThe situation for the victim can then worsen. As more of their income goes just to pay even the interest on loans - which was 40% in Richardson's case sometimes but can run to thousands of percent in some cases - other bills such as gas and electric don't get paid either.\nMore serious methods of intimidation can be employed. There have been threats of violence, taking goods in lieu of payment. There was even a kidnapping recorded in one of the cases Ryan said he dealt with.\nFor Richardson's victims, Ryan said they were not necessarily afraid of her directly but of people she knew, and this is a common theme.\n\"We come across that quite a lot with loan sharks. They are not necessarily the people who will be meting out the violence, or the threats of violence. It would be somebody they know, or somebody they are connected to.\n\"When we deal with cases in north Wales, it's normally 'people in Liverpool' - when we investigate, they're not [connected to them].\n\"In south Wales it's a bit more varied who they're 'connected' to. But it's normally somebody with a bit of a reputation. But when you look more into it from an investigative point of view, that's really not the case at all.\"\nRichardson was a good example, which he said was especially common in Wales, of being \"the big fish in a small pond\".\n\"On the face of it, Tabitha was a very successful businesswoman. She's got a bit of money behind her. People know that she's lent money before; people will go to her.\"\nRyan said that for Richardson, the sums involved might not have been a huge amount in the greater scheme of things, but it represented an enormous amount to those paying her.\n\"They were struggling to eat, struggling to heat their homes. One set of victims was trying to live off \u00a3100 a month and they were dropping money to her.\"\nAs in many similar cases, the amount of money people started off borrowing was low, but because they were repaying 40% interest on top of the capital, it snowballed from there.\n\"What happens then is if you're on a low income, you're already struggling. So to service that debt, you need to borrow some more,\" Ryan said.\nThe amounts ranged from \u00a380 to \u00a320,000 over a period of time.

    "A new exhibition aims to showcase a different side to ancient Egypt. \nCreatures of the Nile focuses on the animals that were central to life in the ancient civilisation.\nDr Gina Criscenzo-Laycock, who is curating the display at the Victoria Gallery and Museum in Liverpool, said: \u201cPeople usually think of mummies but we wanted to bring out a different side.\"\n\"Egypt gets a lot of attention and so do animals. This exhibition bring these things wonderfully together.\"\nDr Criscenzo-Laycock said she hoped the free exhibition would \u201cbuild up a picture of the natural environment\u201d of Egypt and Sudan - where the White Nile and Blue Nile unite after flowing from Tanzania and Ethiopia respectively.\n\u201cWhile we have borders, animals do not \u2013 we\u2019re looking at the area as an ecosystem,\" she said. \nShe said there was a misconception that those living around the Nile were \"obsessed with death but actually they were obsessed with life\".\n\"They conceived the afterlife as an idealistic version of real life.\"\nThe display showcases pottery etched with animal-inspired designs and their incorporation in hieroglyphic writing.\nIt also highlights how creatures were a source of food, with remnants used for clothing, tools and jewellery.\nSome animals were hunted to extinction, while other wild species moved due to environmental change and increases in human and livestock population.\nDr Criscenzo-Laycock said the exhibition would show \"how humans view animals from the point of view of ideology\".\nSome of the most recognisable Nile symbols are hybrid figures, particularly the human-headed, lion-bodied Great Sphinx of Giza.\n\"Animal imagery was used as an expression of divine power but also human agency,\" said Dr Criscenzo-Laycock, who is based at Garstang Museum of Archaeology.\nShe highlighted the goddess Taweret, shown as a hippopotamus, who was \u201cevoked to protect mothers in childbirth\u201d.\n\"It\u2019s because they\u2019re terrifying.

    "From bone-chilling thrillers to hilariously dark comedies, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton's anthology has managed to shock and surprise viewers for the past decade.\nAhead of the ninth and final season of Bafta award-winning Inside No. 9, they have been reflecting on the show's history, and it wasn't always plain sailing.\n\"There have definitely been times where TV executives have thought we can't achieve certain things, but we've always proved them wrong,\" explains 56-year-old Pemberton.\nThe pair haven't been afraid to experiment over the years, having produced an entirely silent episode, one all in iambic pentameter and now, in the final series, an episode filmed from a doorbell camera. \nPemberton remembers one particular episode that bosses said would never work.\n\"We wrote an episode where all the characters were filmed talking into a fixed cameras, and to prove that it would work, we directed it ourselves. \n\"It actually ended up being one of the most gripping episodes we've ever made.\"\nThe episode, Thinking Out Loud, was praised highly by critics, and is often included in a roundup of best episodes. \nThe i newspaper awarded the episode five stars and Sarah Hughes wrote that it \"pulled the rug from underneath its audience's feet\".\nThe actors also said bosses weren't too sure about the format of the show when they first suggested it.\n\"When we first pitched the idea of an anthology format with individual stories lasting 30 minutes, it felt radical and wasn't very well received,\" explains Shearsmith.\n\"But now the tide has turned,\" he says, with the likes of Charlie Brooker's TV show Black Mirror proving successful, with seven nominations at this year's TV Baftas. \nIn total, Pemberton and Shearsmith, who previously worked together on black comedy show The League of Gentleman, have written 55 standalone episodes of Inside No. 9 which can be watched in any order. \nThe duo credit the success of the show to the variety of genres it crosses and the self-contained nature of each episode.\nShearsmith says people are now more interested in commitment-free TV instead of drawn-out series with convoluted plots and too many characters. \nPemberton describes the series as \"a box of chocolates and one of them is poison\". \n\"Sometimes you think the story is one genre and then halfway through it turns into another,\" he says. \"It does so well because you never know what you're going to get.\"\nPrevious series have been met with a positive response from critics, with the eighth one receiving five stars from Carol Midgley at The Times, who described it as \"exquisite\".\nAnd the pair definitely have pulled off some pretty impressive stunts over the years. \nIn 2018 their Halloween special episode tricked viewers into thinking the live show had run into technical difficulties so an old episode would air instead. It turned out the technical difficulties were actually all planned and part of the spooky twist. \nBut the problem with these kind of stunts and tricks is that they can only be done once. \nRegular Inside No. 9 viewers know to always think outside the box and expect the unexpected. \nSo how do the writer and actor duo continuously manage to surprise viewers and deliver some killer (sometimes literally) twists? \n\"It has become increasingly difficult when people know to watch for red herrings, but we just try and focus on inventing good stories that will hook you quickly and only need 30 minutes to tell,\" says 54-year-old Shearsmith. \n\"The last 30 seconds of a show shouldn't be everything, it's actually all about the journey,\" he adds. \"The punchline of a joke doesn't make sense without the actual joke.\"\nPemberton says that it's important for the them to \"plant the seed early\" and says many viewers watch the episodes again, to see all the things they didn't spot the first time round. \n\"The answer is there all along,\" Pemberton tells the BBC. \nSpeaking about the new series that airs on 8 May, there's not much that Shearsmith and Pemberton will give away. \nBoth say they are \"very cagey\" when it comes to giving out information about the show, as part of its appeal is people don't know what to expect. \nPemberton says the films and shows that have stuck with him the most over the years are the ones where he's gone in blind. \"I think if I had read a synopsis or seen a trailer before it would have ruined it for me.\" \nHowever, the duo are particularly excited about the first episode of the final series, which will be the 50th episode in the anthology. \nBoo to a Goose sees an ensemble of British actors including Siobhan Finneran and Charlie Cooper all stuck on a late night train that has broken down. \n\"Every series we do an ensemble piece and we love it, because we put together our favourite actors, trap them together and see what happens,\" Pemberton says. \nAs the series come to an end, the pair say they are feeling a mix of emotions. \nShearsmith says he never thought the show would be as successful as it is and is \"delighted\" that it has",

    "Hull KR has confirmed it has terminated a commercial deal with P&O Ferries just one day after it was announced.\nOn Friday the club revealed P&O would become a 'Platinum Partner'.\nHowever, the move was criticised by some who cited the mass sacking of ferry workers two years ago.\nIn a statement, the rugby league club admitted it had \"underestimated the continuing depth of feeling\", adding it was \"inappropriate\" to continue with the partnership. \nThe club insisted it had entered into the partnership with P&O \"in good faith\", adding it was designed to \"support many grass roots activities\".\nFollowing the announced, the club had engaged with supporters, stakeholders and Hull East MP Karl Turner, said the statement.\nIt continued: \"It is important to us that our community know we will always try to do the right thing, and to represent them in the best way possible.\"\nEarlier, a P&O spokesman said: \"We are proud to have operated in the heart of Hull for almost 60 years. \n\"Through our partnership with Hull KR we aimed to make a deeper contribution to the local community around our port and particularly to grass roots activities. We wish the club well and hope to work with them again in future.\u201d\nHull KR announced on Friday that P&O would be the Robins' Official Ferry Partner for the 2024 and 2025 Betfred Super League seasons\nAt the time, Rovers said the collaboration would \"elevate both brands\" with the closeness of the club's stadium at Craven Park and the port.\nHowever, Darren Procter, national secretary of the Rail and Maritime Transport Union (RMT), who formerly worked for P&O in Hull, said he was \"absolutely astounded\" by the move.\nThe shipping company, which runs services between Hull and Rotterdam, sacked 786 seafarers in 2022, leading to protests by workers and politicians.\nThey were fired without notice or union consultation and replaced with low-paid agency staff, which the company later admitted had broken the law.\nFollowing the sackings, the government announced a review of all its contracts with P&O Ferries.\nMr Procter, who had left P&O before the sackings but who joined in the protests as part of his role with the RMT, led calls for the Rovers to reconsider the partnership.\n\"People are still scarred to this day with the actions P&O Ferries took,\" he added.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter)\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

    "A new home has finally been found for a \"gentle giant\" rescue dog that spent almost a year at an RSCPA centre in Derbyshire.\nStanley is settling into his new home in Wiltshire - 180 miles away from the rehoming centre where he had been living.\nWhen he was rescued in May 2023 he had infected ears, fur loss, and wounds caused by self-trauma.\nHe has now been adopted by Nikki Farbrother and her husband Crispin.\n\"As soon as I saw the picture of Stanley I fell in love with him because he's just so gorgeous,\" said Mrs Farbrother.\n\"It said on the website that he had been there for almost a year, and that broke my heart a little bit because no dog deserves to be in kennels for that long.\"\nStanley's new owners had previously looked after dogs as volunteers for Guide Dogs for the Blind but decided to get their own \"forever dog\".\nTheir son had also been looking to adopt his own dog. He sent his mum a link to an Akita called Snow who was being rehomed by RSPCA Chesterfield and North Derbyshire, which is near where he lives.\nMrs Farbrother then started looking at the other dogs who needed homes, which was when she spotted Stanley, who is a crossbreed.\nShe emailed the centre, filled in some forms, then she and her husband travelled up to see Stanley and brought him home the same day.\n\"They don't normally do that but we were travelling from such a long way,\" said Mrs Farbrother.\n\"He's the biggest, loveable, gentle giant. He just wants to sit on your lap.\n\"Wherever you are he will come and sit on your lap and get as close to you as he can.\"\nTheir son has also reserved Snow, meaning two dogs at the rehoming centre have hopefully found their forever homes.\nStanley had spent a total of 341 days at the rehoming centre.\nHe had previously lived outside in what the RSPCA described as \"unsuitable conditions\", before his previous owner agreed to sign him over to the charity.\nStanley had scars on his body from self-injury, which can be a sign of separation anxiety in dogs, when they become distressed from being left alone.\nStaff at the centre had tears of happiness when they saw Stanley go to his new home.\nA spokesperson said: \"We never gave up looking for a home for Stanley, we knew the right family was out there waiting to find him and they were.\n\"No one deserves this more and we wish Stanley and his new family lots of happy and fun-filled adventures.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Parkour athletes say the daring discipline has helped to boost their mental health by facing fears, managing setbacks and building confidence.\nThe sport sees participants, called traceurs, attempt to get from point A to point B in the fastest way possible.\nIt is done without equipment and often involves acrobatic flips and jumps.\nProfessional traceur, Danny Pierce, from Bristol, said: \"You realise your potential is so much more than you previously thought.\"\nThough it often carries a reputation of danger and disruption- fuelled by videos of extreme choreography at nauseating heights - some say the sport unlocks feelings of \"hope\" and \"mindfulness\". \nMr Pierce, 33, is a parkour practitioner and coach with an online following of almost 40,000 people.\n\"I was always interested in movement from a young age,\" he said.\n\"Always climbing and finding a thrill from doing something I knew was scary and dangerous, but still within my ability.\"\nDespite its controversy, parkour was officially recognised as a sport in the UK in 2017, by all five of the UK's sports bodies. \nOne explanation for the sport's growing popularity is its accessibility to athletes of all capabilities. \nAs Mr Pierce attests, the aim of the discipline is not to be competitive, but to progress at a personal level.\n\"I love the idea of making myself better at moving and the challenge and fun that comes with pushing yourself. It's a massive confidence builder,\" he said.\nCharlotte Boenigk is the CEO and founder of Esprit Concrete: Free Your Instinct, an organisation in Bristol that delivers parkour for mental health.\nThe sessions focus on supporting the development of psychological strength and resilience by \"bringing the benefits of adventure therapy into the urban environment\".\n\"Parkour allows the person to move more mindfully, connecting their mind, body and environment while reducing feelings of anxiety and overwhelm,\" Ms Boenigk said.\n\"Participants also describe how the feelings of success and achievement triggered in the sessions allow them to gain a sense of hope, and see that there are positive solutions to challenges,\" she added.\nMs Boenigk said the discipline also has the potential to uncover repressed feelings of trauma, anxiety or fear, which can then be managed using \"positive coping strategies\". \nEmma Brech, CEO of mental health support charity, Bristol Mind, says she believes parkour can be used not as an 'escape', but a way of facing your fears head on.\n\"In therapy, we talk a lot about 'turning into difficulty' rather than trying to deny it, avoid it or suppress it,\" she said.\n\"We're constantly having to overcome obstacles in life, so if we've got a physical outlet that lets us practice those skills in a structured and exciting way, it enables us to do things like manage risks, problem solve, and overcome barriers in our own self-concept by showing us what we're capable of.\n\"It's about listening to our body, relating to it and learning from it, rather than pushing it to extremes.\"\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "People attending big concerts or sports events are being let down by rail services run by Transport for Wales (TfW), according to a group of Senedd politicians.\nTrain services are \"simply inadequate\" for major events like Sunday's Bruce Springsteen\u2019s concert at Cardiff's Principality Stadium, according to a report by the Climate Change, Environment and Infrastructure Committee.\nIt has urged TfW to improve its planning ahead of other large concerts, with Taylor Swift and Foo Fighters due to perform at the stadium and the Manic Street Preachers playing at Cardiff Castle.\nTfW said it would \"consider all recommendations and then officially respond in due course\".\nThe report by a cross party group of Members of the Senedd said there was a lack of trains leaving Cardiff later in the evening after gigs had finished.\nIt\u2019s singled out Wales football matches as an example of poor service with the last train from Cardiff often leaving minutes after the full-time whistle.\nPast criticism led to TfW arranging special late trains with extra carriages for the Euros play-off double header against Finland and Poland.\nThe committee said TfW must also discuss with Network Rail about rescheduling engineering works when they clash with concerts or big sporting events.\nIt has also called for the rail operator to pay passengers to get to their destination in a taxi if a train is cancelled and no rail replacement service has been arranged.\nBetween January and July 2023, stations in Wales had the highest rate of cancelled services in Britain.\nTfW also scored bottom of a rail satisfaction survey by Transport Focus, an independent watchdog for transport users.\nHowever, David Beer, its senior manager for Wales, said passengers have been \"welcoming the wider introduction of new trains, providing much-needed capacity, and addressing cancellations\".\n\"It is good to see evidence of this recovery reflected in our rail survey now showing improvements in satisfaction with all aspects of the journey,\" he said.\nNew timetables will be introduced on the South Wales Metro network from 2 June.",
    "Singer Gabrielle has said she is considering wearing an eyepatch again, which she described as \"truly empowering\".\nThe Brit Award winner, who has previously described having a lazy eyelid, said she started wearing an eyepatch ahead of her number one debut hit \u201cDreams\u201d in 1993.\nShe told BBC Radio Wales that although she only wore it for a year, it was a \"game changer\" for her career.\n\u201cPrior to that, if I\u2019d have a conversation with somebody, I would never look that person directly in the eye,\" she said.\n\"I\u2019d be looking elsewhere whilst having a conversation, which on the surface seems really rude, but I was very insecure about my eye and the way I looked,\u201d she added.\nShe said the decision to wear an eyepatch at such an early stage of her career felt risky at the time.\n\"As a man being different is so different to being a woman and having differences,\"  Gabrielle told the Lucy Owen programme.\n\"[My mum] said, \u2018you do know everyone is going to ask you about it now\u2019, but I had nothing to hide in the sense of my reasons for wearing it.\n\"The moment I wore the eyepatch, and could actually have a conversation one-on-one without my eyes wandering because I didn't want you to notice my eyelid so much, it changed me. \n\"I felt truly empowered.

    "Major pub chain Greene King has called time on its brewery of more than 200 years and announced plans to move to a new \u00a340m site by 2027.\nThe company has produced cask ales from Westgate Brewery, in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, since it was founded in 1799.\nGreene King, which was sold to Hong Kong operator CKA in 2019, owns about 2,700 pubs, restaurants and hotels in the UK.\nEnvironmental and efficiency reasons were cited for the move to a new \"state-of-the-art\" facility on the edge of the town.\nWhat has the reaction been and what does it mean for Bury St Edmunds?\nGreene King, known for brands like Abbot Ale, Greene King IPA and Old Speckled Hen, said the move represented a \"long-term commitment to British brewing\".\n\"I hope that people do see the intent behind this is very much an investment to protect the long term position in Bury St Edmunds and all the jobs that go with it,\" said Matt Starbuck, managing director of brewing and brands at the company.\nPublic consultations will be held and Mr Starbuck anticipated all work would be completed by 2027. \nHe said Greene King was \"committed to retaining our heritage and having an ongoing presence in the centre of Bury St Edmunds\". \nThe brewer said the new site - just over two miles (3.2km) away from the Westgate Brewery - would cut water usage in the brewing process by more than 50% per pint, alongside improvements in energy efficiency.\n\u201cWe have been brewing in Bury St Edmunds for over 200 years,\" Mr Starbuck said.\n\"We are passionate about our craft and the development of this state-of-the-art facility will allow us to maintain brewing at the core of our business going forwards.\"\nIt hoped to submit a full planning application in June.\n\nLaura Jenner, 35, a HR advisor from the town, believed that while the plans were \"exciting\" there was some \"sadness\".\n\"There's a lot of history with [Westgate] - it's a beautiful building and it seems a little bit sad that it will lose that history,\" she said. \n\"But times change and if that makes better business sense, fair enough.\n\"I think if they want to get the best out of the community and Bury St Edmunds, then they really need to give back.\n\"People of all ages in Bury care - they care how the town is impacted and there is a lot they can get out of people if they listen.\"\nIan Norris, who was born in Bury St Edmunds before moving to Scotland, said the company was \"massively important for the town\".\n\"It's not just [important] for employment but because of the vast amount of land that they own in the heart of the town,\" he said.\n\"The local authorities need to be sure that they are involved in the decisions around all of that land and not just let Greene King decide.\"\nTom Appleton, a local arts consultant, said there was \"great growth opportunity\" for the arts here. \n\"Potentially opening up a new space for the theatre would be a really interesting way of being able to better connect the community outside of Bury St Edmunds,\" he said.\nMr Appleton added it was \"loud and clear\" many residents were concerned about the heritage of the site\n\"Being in tune of one's heritage and respectful of it is going to be really important for them,\" he added.\nNethergate Brewery is another brewery based nearby in Long Melford with a taproom and shop in Bury St Edmunds.\nGeneral manager Rob Crawford said while it would not be affected, he understood the move.\n\"If they vacate the town centre that might impact the number of visitors but I can understand the need for a modern brewery,\" he said.\n\"The efficiencies that modern technology can bring can make brewing cheap.\"\nKat Lawson-Phillips is co-founder of Artefact Brewing - a small brewery that operates in nearby Ixworth.\nWhile what they do is \"completely different\" to Greene King, Mrs Lawson-Phillips also said she appreciated the need for a \"modern and efficient\" facility.\n\"From a production and brewing perspective, having a purpose-built, state-of-the-art and sustainable premises is the dream and hugely attractive,\" she said.\n\"But as somebody who lives locally and has grown up locally it is sad to think all this history, heritage and the town centre is going to change.\"\nNick Boley, the Campaign for Real Ale's campaigns and communications director, said the company welcomed Greene King's move to a \"larger and more sustainable brewery\".\n\"Despite the long history of its current brewery in Bury St Edmunds, a move to a more environmentally focused brewery is certainly a good thing,\" he said.\n\u201cGreene King\u2019s commitment to remain in Bury St. Edmunds is a boon to the town, retaining hundreds of jobs and maintaining the town\u2019s historic status a great brewing town.\"\nThe company is due to launch a \"public consultation programme\" on 8 May.

    "A British vet who worked in Kenya for 55 years has recounted the time he went for \"a pee\", only to see a lioness staring back at him. \nHugh Cran, who lives in Somerset and trained in Edinburgh in the 1960s, was also charged at by a wild elephant.\nHe said that every day was a challenge in the unforgiving environment of the Rift Valley, as he travelled miles on rough roads, performing impromptu surgery by torchlight with dirty water.\nMr Cran, who has now written a book, said: \"I once got out of the car to pee and saw a lioness peering at me through the bush.\"\nBut he said the experience only sought to encourage his passion for working in the country.\nMr Cran, from Castle Cary, had answered an advert to be an assistant vet in the Rift Valley shortly after finishing his training. \nHe covered a 100mile (160km) radius of untarmacked roads in the course of his daily work.\n\"I had darting equipment so I was called out to dart zebras which had been snared, or injured lions or cheetahs which had a broken leg or jaw,\" he said.\n\"The distances were so great you couldn't nip back to the surgery and out again, so I used to carry everything in my car for any possible emergency.\"\nHe said over the years he had \"many chance encounters\".\n\"I was threatened twice; on one occasion I was charged by an elephant on the top of a mountain,\" he said.\n\"When that happened you had no time to do anything except get out of the way.\"\nThe second was his close call with the lioness.\nMr Cran said his interest in Africa had been sparked at an early age.\n\"I was always very keen on reading about Africa; King Soloman's Mines, that sort of thing, and I always wanted to work in the Tropics,\" he said.\nBut when he took the job in Kenya he had no idea how long he would end up there.\n\"I intended to stay to test the waters for a year or so but ended up staying rather longer,\" he added.\nAs a young vet he quickly had to adapt to the very different working environment from that he was used to.\n\"Frequently I'd go into my surgery in the morning and turn on the taps, and there was no water,\" he said.\n\"I'd turn on the switch, and there was no electricity. Sometimes in the middle of an operation, say at night, the power would somehow stop.\n\"Vets in this country would probably be appalled, but I think the results were just as good as they would be if you had all the equipment which one gets in this country.\"\nOn one occasion Mr Cran was asked to help a crew filming a flock of pelicans with the help of a microlight aeroplane.\nHe said it was a stunning encounter he has never forgotten.\n\"They were trained to follow the microlight in formation as if it was one of the flock, they were so tame and trusting,\" he said.\n\"If the plane dropped back another bird would take its place as part of an extraordinary interaction. \n\"They were wonderful, wonderful birds.\"\nMr Cran kept diaries of his experiences and has used them to spark the memories he has retold in his book.\nRift Valley Fever, which is named after a disease spread by mosquitos affecting humans and livestock, was published on 25 April.\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and, X.

So what next?\nWell, exactly what it says - no one is technically in control.\nAlthough the Green Party won the highest number of votes, they were two councillors shy of an overall majority.\nThat means councillors within the party will now negotiate with councillors from other parties to find a solution.\nParties which have found themselves in these positions on councils across the country have in the past selected other parties who will work with them.\nThe BBC understands Tony Dyer could become the council's leader.\nMr Dyer, who returns as the councillor for Southville, is the Green nominee for the new role.\nThe decision on who takes on the role of leader and deputy leader, plus the roles of committee and commission chairs and vice chairs, will be taken by full council on 21 May.\nA list of nominated persons will be published ahead of this meeting (likely on 13 May).\nAs of the local election, the council has switched from being run by a directly-elected mayor to a series of eight committees.\nThe committees will run the different parts of the council, including some of their biggest services such as adult social care, housing and transport.\nAs the city moves to uncharted ground, compromise and negotiation will be necessary in order to make the difficult decisions.\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Actor Bernard Hill, best known for roles in Titanic and Lord of the Rings, has died aged 79.\nHe played Captain Edward Smith in the 1997 Oscar-winning film and King Th\u00e9oden in the Lord of the Rings.\nHis breakout role was in 1982 BBC TV drama Boys from the Blackstuff, where he portrayed Yosser Hughes, a character who struggled - and often failed - to cope with unemployment in Liverpool. \nHe died early on Sunday morning, his agent Lou Coulson confirmed.\nWith him at the time were his fiancee Alison and his son Gabriel.\nElijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd, the actors who played the hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, paid tribute to their co-star at Comic Con in Liverpool. \nAstin began by saying: \"We love him. He was intrepid, he was funny, he was gruff, he was irascible, he was beautiful.\"\nBoyd recounted watching the trilogy with Monaghan, saying: \"I don't think anyone spoke Tolkien's words as great as Bernard did. He would break my heart. He will be solely missed.\"\nAlan Bleasdale, who wrote Boys from the Blackstuff, said Hill's death was a \"great loss and also a great surprise\".\n\"It was an astonishing, mesmeric performance - Bernard gave everything to that and you can see it in all the scenes. He became Yosser Hughes.\"\nHe added: \"I was desperate to work with him. Everything he did - his whole procedure for working, the manner in which he worked and his performance was everything that you could ever wish for.\n\"You always felt that Bernard would live forever. He had a great strength, physically and of personality.\"\nHill, who was from Manchester and lived in Suffolk, was due to return to TV screens in series two of The Responder, a BBC drama starring Martin Freeman, which begins airing on Sunday.\nLindsay Salt, director of BBC Drama, paid tribute to him, saying: \"Bernard Hill blazed a trail across the screen, and his long-lasting career filled with iconic and remarkable roles is a testament to his incredible talent.\"\n\"From Boys from the Blackstuff, to Wolf Hall, The Responder, and many more, we feel truly honoured to have worked with Bernard at the BBC. Our thoughts are with his loved ones at this sad time.\"\nIn Boys from the Blackstuff, Hill drew praise for his gritty portrayal of Yosser Hughes, an intense character who pleaded \"Gizza [give us a] job\" as he sought work. \nThat show won a Bafta for best drama series in 1983, and in 2000 it was ranked seventh on a British Film Institute list of the best TV shows ever made.\nAnother of Hill's memorable BBC TV performances came in the 2015 drama series Wolf Hall, adapted from Hilary Mantel's book about the court of Henry VIII. Hill portrayed the Duke of Norfolk - an uncle of Anne Boleyn and an enemy of Cardinal Wolsey.\nIn Peter Jackson's epic trilogy The Lord of the Rings, Hill joined the cast for the second film, 2002's The Two Towers, and returned to the franchise for 2003's The Return Of The King, which picked up 11 Oscars.\nOther roles in Hill's decades-long career included the 1976 BBC TV series I, Claudius, an appearance in 1982's Gandhi, Shirley Valentine in 1989, The Scorpion King in 2002 and 2008 Tom Cruise film Valkyrie. \nHe was meant to be at Comic Con Liverpool on Saturday, but had to cancel at the last minute, the convention said in a post on X.

One of the most famous musical myths is simply not true. \nThe daughter of Mama Cass Elliot from folk vocal group Mamas and the Papas, Owen Elliot-Kugell, has a clear message to share about her mother's cause of death: \"There was a ham sandwich, but she didn't eat it and she didn't choke on it. So enough with the jokes.\"\nAnd there have been a lot of jokes, for almost half a century, including by Mike Myers as Austin Powers. \nIn the 1997 film, the time-switching special agent is writing a list of friends he knows in London and then scoring them out when he remembers they have died. After naming Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin he mournfully sighs: \"Mama Cass. Deceased. Ham sandwich.\" \nCass Elliot (Mama was a nickname which she preferred not to use later in her career) sang on some of the mid-60s most memorable singles, including California Dreamin', Monday Monday and Dream a Little Dream. Her powerful voice was a crucial element of the harmonies that made the Mamas and the Papas so loved.\nBy 1974, she had gone solo and had just completed a two-week run at the London Palladium, when she died at the age of 32 in the Mayfair flat she had borrowed from her fellow American singer Harry Nilsson. The autopsy stated her cause of death as a heart attack and that there were no drugs in her system. \nHer only child, Owen, was seven at the time and back at home in the US when she was told the news. \nNow, ahead of the 50th anniversary of her mother's death on 29 July, she has written a memoir My Mama, Cass, both as a tribute and as a way of correcting the sandwich-based inaccuracy.\n\"It's beyond frustrating, almost immeasurable,\" she says down the line from LA, explaining how it has been, having to live with the ham sandwich legend for 50 years. \n\"Even as a little girl, when I was hanging out with my friends at school, they didn't know who my mom was, but I would go home to have playdates with some of these kids and it was kind of frequent that one of their parents would make a comment to me like, 'Hey, did your mom really die choking on a ham sandwich?'\n\"It bothered me because it was such a horrible story, and I knew that it wasn't true. And it just felt so cruel to have a rumour like that perpetuated. It tortured me.\"\nUnderstandably, she has done extensive work to piece together what did happen in the days leading up to her mum's death; an itinerary which included playing her final Palladium show before \"staying up for 36 hours\".\nShe was due to go to Mick Jagger's birthday party all night, then head straight to a brunch thrown in her honour, followed by an afternoon tea hosted by a US journalist. \n\"By the time she got back to her flat, it was evening the following day,\" continues her daughter. \"She was hungry, and her dancer made her a sandwich from the only thing that was in the flat, ham, and left it on her bedside table. She never even took a bite.\"\nWhat also still upsets Elliot-Kugell is that the ham sandwich myth plays into another issue which was present throughout her mum's life - weight.  \nFrom the age of seven Cass had battles with obesity. As a teenager she was prescribed amphetamines to speed up her metabolism. \nElliot-Kugell describes it as \"the beginning of a very bad cycle.\"\nCrash dieting and drug taking would feature over the course of the rest of Cass's life. \nBut what makes her so proud of her mum is the way that she \"pursued and persevered until she made it.\"\n\"She knew when she was a teenager that she wanted to be a performer and told everybody that she was going to be the most famous fat girl that ever lived. She had that forethought of knowledge as a child. I think that's pretty cool. I think that's really cool.\"\nA move from Baltimore to New York after school led to Cass becoming part of the Greenwich Village folk scene, before heading to Washington DC and then California, to join the Mamas and the Papas, but only after a delay due to the founding member, John Phillips, having to be persuaded that Cass's weight would not hold the group back. \nEliot-Kugell believes that things would have been completely different for her mother if there had been the same attitudes towards fat shaming then that there are now, describing her as a \"trailblazer\".\n\"She paved the way for these other young ladies nowadays who are of a heavier stature to break through in the music business and be accepted for who they are. I really do believe that she helped lay the groundwork for a lot of people.\"\nThe book highlights examples of everyone from Dean Martin to her own band members making jokes in public about Cass's weight, and how she would have to \"grin and bear it\" to survive, especially when it came to TV appearances.\nBy the early 1970s, Cass was regular on US variety shows, guest hosting the Tonight Show and regularly appearing on the Carol Burnett Show, but at a cost. \nShe would inevitably appear in skits making fun of her weight. Elliot-Kugell names one particular routine involving a ",
    "\nThe fallout from the Conservatives' losses in the local elections in England is on most front pages. \nRishi Sunak has reportedly told the Times that Britain is heading for a hung parliament, with Labour as the largest party. The paper says that's the first time he's conceded his party is on course to lose its majority. \nThe prediction for a hung parliament came from the elections expert, Michael Thrasher, but the Times says other pollsters have dismissed his calculation, which is based solely on how people voted in the local elections, and assumes that Labour will win only one seat in Scotland.\nAccording to the Daily Telegraph the prime minister has abandoned the idea of holding a general election in the summer, and the vote is now expected in October or November. \nThe paper says he is hoping that by then, an improving economic picture and deportation flights to Rwanda will give him better chances of re-election.\nUnder the headline \"Prepare for disaster - that's all Tories have left\" Britain's former chief Brexit negotiator, Lord Frost, says in the Telegraph that last week's results point to fewer, perhaps many fewer, than 200 Tory MPs after the next general election. \nHe argues the party is in trouble because it's been trying to be \"inclusive and mainstream\" instead of implementing Conservative policies such as deregulation, being tough on migration, and cutting taxes and public spending.\nIn an editorial, the Sun says Mr Sunak has six months to win Tory voters back and can now concentrate on that without being distracted by - what it calls - \"ludicrous leadership speculation\". \nThe paper says the prime minister should put more money into people's pockets and leave the European Convention on Human Rights if it prevents flights to Rwanda.\nWriting in the Daily Express, the former Conservative leader, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, argues that \"despite the bad results, it is not over yet\" if the party now focuses on delivering on the public's priorities. He says Mr Sunak has to stop the boats, limit legal immigration, cut taxes and reduce European regulation stifling our financial services.\nLabour's campaign co-ordinator, Pat McFadden, has told the Guardian that his party is planning to target the south of England heavily at the general election. He said the local elections had shown that some \"blue wall\" seats in the region were turning red.\nThe Daily Mail says there are fears that many councils will now be dominated by the war in Gaza rather than local services. The paper says more than 40 pro-Palestinian campaigners have been elected as councillors. \nAway from politics, the Daily Mirror highlights a campaign for more support for former football players living with dementia. The paper says last year the Premier League and Professional Footballers' Association pledged one million pounds for them, but campaigners say the game must go further.\nAnd finally the Telegraph says a report by the UK's biggest investment company claims Britain's economy would be better off if it had fewer buy-to-let landlords.

    "More than 300 people have attended a vigil to pay tribute to Daniel Anjorin, a teenager who was fatally stabbed with a sword while on his way to school.\nThe 14-year-old was attacked in Hainault, north-east London, on Tuesday morning.\nOn Sunday, mourners gathered metres away from where Daniel was killed, at Hainault Underground station car park, to pay their respects.\nDaniel's family was not present at the vigil.\nThe family's church, Jubilee Church London, also paid tribute to Daniel and his family at a service on Sunday. \nPastor Tope Koeoso told the congregation what had happened was \"tragic and unimaginable\".\nHe said the family have been members of the church for more than 15 years and that Daniel was baptised there so \"whatever touches them, touches us all\".\n\"This has hit all of us,\" he said.\nHe added pastors had been supporting the family from the early moments of when the attack happened.\n\"One of the first people his brother called was the youth leader who immediately went to him to give emotional and spiritual support,\" he said.\n\"I know the family would want to say thanks to the police for the sensitive way they've cared for the family and protected them,\" he said, adding: \"Although our hearts are heavy and the pain is deep, our faith is strong.\" \nAt the vigil held earlier in the day in Hainault, Harris, a 17-year-old boy who knew Daniel, told the crowd: \"He was a kid that was not in any type of trouble. I'm not just saying that.\n\"He never did anything wrong. He focused on school, he got good grades, he (went) to church.\n\"His family are appreciating all your support. They've noticed everything you guys are doing community-wise, fundraiser-wise, Arsenal as well. They've noticed it all.\n\"On their behalf, thank all of you.\"\nArsenal, the football team Daniel supported, paid tribute to him during their Premier League game at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday.\nDuring the match there was also a moment of applause in the 14th minute, with a banner reading \"RIP Daniel\" among the crowd.\nBouquets of flowers, handwritten notes, Arsenal FC memorabilia and teddies have been left at the bottom of Laing Close in Hainault, as well as a painting of Daniel.\nA family friend said the number of floral tributes left showed the outpouring of support from the whole country.\nAlistair Soyode said people had come from \"near and far\" to pay their respects and offer solidarity.\n\"The flowers that have been laid are not just coming from one section of the community,\" he said.\n\"This is a full representation of what the United Kingdom is. Different people from different communities, nationalities, are showing their sympathies and prayers by laying flowers in this spot.\"\nIn a statement issued by the Met Police, his parents said: \"We as a family are devastated by the loss of our beloved son Daniel.\n\"It is difficult for us at this time to process what has happened to him and that he will never come home. Daniel had left the house for school and then he was gone.\n\"Our children have lost their loving and precious brother and we have lost the most loved and amazing son.\"\nHis school, Bancroft's, in Woodford Green, said he was a \"true scholar\" who had a \"positive nature and gentle character\".\nIn a statement, it described him as a \"core member\" of the community, adding: \"Losing such a young pupil is something we will always struggle to come to terms with.\"\nMarcus Arduini Monzo, 36, from Newham, east London, has been charged with murdering Daniel.\nHe has also been charged with two counts of attempted murder, two counts of causing grievous bodily harm, aggravated burglary, and possession of a bladed article.\nHe was remanded in custody and will next appear in court at the Old Bailey on Tuesday.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Sweden has a global reputation for championing high taxes and social equality, but it has become a European hotspot for the super rich.\nOn Liding\u00f6 island there are huge red and yellow wooden villas on rocky cliff tops, and white minimalist mansions with floor to ceiling windows.\nLess than half an hour's drive from Stockholm city centre, this is one of Sweden's wealthiest neighbourhoods.\nSerial entrepreneur Konrad Bergstr\u00f6m flicks the light switch in his wine cellar, to reveal the 3,000 bottles he's got stored there. \"French Bordeaux, that's what I love,\" he says, flashing a bright white smile. \nElsewhere, there's an outdoor pool, a gym upholstered in reindeer leather, and a workshop-cum-nightclub, complete with a large metal urinal.\n\"I have a lot of musical friends, so we play a lot of music,\" explains Bergstr\u00f6m. He made his money co-founding businesses including a headphones and speaker company, and this home is one of four properties he owns in Sweden and Spain.\nIt's not a surprising lifestyle for a successful entrepreneur, but what might surprise global observers is how many people have become as wealthy as Mr Bergstr\u00f6m - or even richer - in Sweden - a country with a global reputation for its leftist politics.\nAlthough a right-wing coalition is currently in power, the nation has been run by Social Democrat-led governments for the majority of the last century, elected on promises to grow the economy in an equitable way, with taxes funding a strong welfare state.\nBut Sweden has experienced a boom in the super rich over the last three decades. \nIn 1996, there were just 28 people with a net worth of a billion kronor or more (around $91m or \u00a373m at today's exchange rate), according to a rich list published by former Swedish business magazine Veckans Aff\u00e4rer. Most of them came from families that had been rich for generations.\nBy 2021, there were 542 \"kronor billionaires\", according to a similar analysis by daily newspaper Aftonbladet, and between them they owned a wealth equivalent to 70% of the nation's GDP, a measure of the total value of goods and services in the economy.\nSweden - with a population of just 10 million - also has one of the world's highest proportions of \"dollar billionaires\" per capita. Forbes listed 43 Swedes worth $1bn or more in its 2024 rich list.\nThat equates to around four per million people, compared to about two per million in the US (which has 813 billionaires - the most of any nation - but is home to more than 342 million people).\n\"This has come about in a sort of a stealthy way - that you haven't really noticed it until after it happened,\" says Andreas Cervenka, a journalist at Aftonbladet, and author of the book Greedy Sweden, in which he explores the steady rise of Sweden's super rich.\n\"But in Stockholm, you can see the wealth with your own eyes, and the contrast between super rich people in some areas of Stockholm and quite poor people in other parts.\" \nOne reason for the rise of the new super rich is Sweden's thriving tech scene. The country has a reputation as the Silicon Valley of Europe, having produced more than 40 so-called unicorn start-ups - companies worth more than $1bn - in the past two decades.\nSkype and Spotify were founded here, as well as gaming firms King and Mojang. More recent global success stories include the financial tech start-up Tink, which Visa acquired for around $2bn during the pandemic, healthcare company Kry, and the e-scooter company Voi. \nAt Epicenter - a shared office and community space with a giant glass atrium - veteran entrepreneur Ola Ahlvarsson traces this success back to the 1990s. He says a tax rebate on home computers in Sweden \"wired or connected all of us much faster than other countries\".\nA serial co-founder himself, he also points to a strong \"culture of collaboration\" in the start-up scene, with accomplished entrepreneurs often becoming role models for - and investors in - the next generation of tech companies. \nSweden's size makes it a popular test market, too. \"If you want to see if it works on a larger market, you can - at limited cost and without too much risk for your brand or for your stock price - try things here,\" says Mr Ahlvarsson. \nBut Mr Cervenka argues there is another narrative that deserves more attention - monetary policies which he says have helped transform the country into a paradise for the super rich.\nSweden had very low interest rates from the early 2010s until a couple of years ago. This made it cheap to borrow money, so Swedes with cash to spare often chose to invest in property, or high risk investments like tech start-ups, many of which shot up in value as a result.\n\"One of the big factors that's driven this huge increase in billionaires is that we've had, for a number of years, quite a strong inflation in the value of assets,\" says Mr Cervenka.\nAlthough top earners in Sweden are taxed more than 50% of their personal incomes - one of the highest rates in Europe - he argues that successive governments  - on ",
    "Four Israeli soldiers have been killed in a Hamas rocket attack near one of the main crossings used to deliver aid into Gaza, Israel has said.\nThe Kerem Shalom crossing was closed overnight by Israel following the strike.\nSubsequent Israeli strikes in the southern Gazan city of Rafah have reportedly killed at least 12 people. \nIsrael's military said early on Monday it was urging Gazans sheltering in parts of Rafah to evacuate.\nIt comes as talks aimed at securing a ceasefire deal in Gaza and the release of hostages have stalled.\nThe Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said 10 projectiles had been fired from an area near the Rafah crossing in southern Gaza, about 3.6km (2.2 miles) from Kerem Shalom. \nHamas's armed wing claimed responsibility and said its target was a nearby Israeli army base. \nThey were fired from a site some 350m from a civilian shelter, the IDF said\nIt called the launches \"another clear example of the terrorist organisation's systematic exploitation of humanitarian facilities and spaces, and their continued use of the Gazan civilian population as human shields\".\nHamas denies it uses civilians as human shields.\nThe Israeli military confirmed a counter-strike in Rafah, saying it struck the launcher from which the projectiles were fired and a nearby military structure.\nThere were two Israeli strikes on Sunday, killing at least 12 people according to Gaza health officials.  \nThe latest violence follows two days of talks with mediators in Cairo, Egypt. \nThere has been little progress, with both Israel and Hamas saying they will not give ground on key demands, but discussions are expected to resume on Monday. \nHamas said its delegation would travel to Qatar to consult with the group's leadership.\nCIA chief William Burns, who has also been involved in mediation efforts, has left the Egyptian capital for talks in Doha, according to reports.\nThe truce proposal is believed to involve a 40-day pause in fighting, allowing the release of hostages in Gaza and a number of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails.\nHamas said it viewed the current proposal in a \"positive light\", but the main sticking point appears to be whether the ceasefire deal would be permanent or temporary.\nThe group is insisting any deal makes a specific commitment towards an end to the war, but Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected that on Sunday.\n\"The state of Israel cannot accept this [Hamas's demands], we are not prepared to accept a situation in which the Hamas brigades come out of their bunkers, take control of Gaza again, rebuild their military infrastructure, and return to threatening the citizens of Israel in the settlements surrounding the southern mountains, in all parts of the country.\n\"This will be a terrible defeat for the state of Israel,\" he added.\nThe war began after waves of Hamas gunmen stormed across Gaza's border into Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages.

    "A man has been taken to hospital following a serious assault in a car park in Bushmills, County Antrim in the early hours of Sunday morning. \nThe man in his 20s was found nailed to a fence, with a nail through each hand, shortly after midnight.\nTwo vans, one belonging to the injured man, were found on fire in the car park near Dundarave Park. \nPolice said paramilitary involvement was one key line of inquiry.\nGraffiti on nearby public toilets has been linked to the assault and arson.\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said the man was left with potentially life-changing but not life-threatening injuries.\nPolice said it was a \"sinister attack.\" \n\"We live in a democratic society where there is no justification for this.

    "This is an attempt to right a rock wrong. One of the most famous musical myths is simply not true. \nThe daughter of Mama Cass Elliot from folk vocal group Mamas and the Papas, Owen Elliot-Kugell, has a clear message to share about her mother's cause of death: \"There was a ham sandwich, but she didn't eat it and she didn't choke on it. So enough with the jokes.\"\nAnd there have been a lot of jokes, for almost half a century, including by Mike Myers as Austin Powers. \nIn the 1997 film, the time-switching special agent is writing a list of friends he knows in London and then scoring them out when he remembers they have died. After naming Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin he mournfully sighs: \"Mama Cass. Deceased. Ham sandwich.\" \nCass Elliot (Mama was a nickname which she preferred not to use later in her career) sang on some of the mid-60s most memorable singles, including California Dreamin', Monday Monday and Dream a Little Dream. Her powerful voice was a crucial element of the harmonies that made the Mamas and the Papas so loved.\nBy 1974, she had gone solo and had just completed a two-week run at the London Palladium, when she died at the age of 32 in the Mayfair flat she had borrowed from her fellow American singer Harry Nilsson. The autopsy stated her cause of death as a heart attack and that there were no drugs in her system. \nHer only child, Owen, was seven at the time and back at home in the US when she was told the news. \nNow, ahead of the 50th anniversary of her mother's death on 29 July, she has written a memoir My Mama, Cass, both as a tribute and as a way of correcting the sandwich-based inaccuracy.\n\"It's beyond frustrating, almost immeasurable,\" she says down the line from LA, explaining how it has been, having to live with the ham sandwich legend for 50 years. \n\"Even as a little girl, when I was hanging out with my friends at school, they didn't know who my mom was, but I would go home to have playdates with some of these kids and it was kind of frequent that one of their parents would make a comment to me like, 'Hey, did your mom really die choking on a ham sandwich?'\n\"It bothered me because it was such a horrible story, and I knew that it wasn't true. And it just felt so cruel to have a rumour like that perpetuated. It tortured me.\"\nUnderstandably, she has done extensive work to piece together what did happen in the days leading up to her mum's death; an itinerary which included playing her final Palladium show before \"staying up for 36 hours\".\nShe was due to go to Mick Jagger's birthday party all night, then head straight to a brunch thrown in her honour, followed by an afternoon tea hosted by a US journalist. \n\"By the time she got back to her flat, it was evening the following day,\" continues her daughter. \"She was hungry, and her dancer made her a sandwich from the only thing that was in the flat, ham, and left it on her bedside table. She never even took a bite.\"\nWhat also still upsets Elliot-Kugell is that the ham sandwich myth plays into another issue which was present throughout her mum's life - weight.  \nFrom the age of seven Cass had battles with obesity. As a teenager she was prescribed amphetamines to speed up her metabolism. \nElliot-Kugell describes it as \"the beginning of a very bad cycle.\"\nCrash dieting and drug taking would feature over the course of the rest of Cass's life. \nBut what makes her so proud of her mum is the way that she \"pursued and persevered until she made it.\"\n\"She knew when she was a teenager that she wanted to be a performer and told everybody that she was going to be the most famous fat girl that ever lived. She had that forethought of knowledge as a child. I think that's pretty cool. I think that's really cool.\"\nA move from Baltimore to New York after school led to Cass becoming part of the Greenwich Village folk scene, before heading to Washington DC and then California, to join the Mamas and the Papas, but only after a delay due to the founding member, John Phillips, having to be persuaded that Cass's weight would not hold the group back. \nEliot-Kugell believes that things would have been completely different for her mother if there had been the same attitudes towards fat shaming then that there are now, describing her as a \"trailblazer\".\n\"She paved the way for these other young ladies nowadays who are of a heavier stature to break through in the music business and be accepted for who they are. I really do believe that she helped lay the groundwork for a lot of people.\"\nThe book highlights examples of everyone from Dean Martin to her own band members making jokes in public about Cass's weight, and how she would have to \"grin and bear it\" to survive, especially when it came to TV appearances.\nBy the early 1970s, Cass was regular on US variety shows, guest hosting the Tonight Show and regularly appearing on the Carol Burnett Show, but at a cost. \nShe would inevitably appear in skits making fun of her weight. Elliot-Kugell names one particular routine involving a ",

He would break my heart. He will be solely missed.\"\nAlan Bleasdale, who wrote Boys from the Blackstuff, said Hill's death was a \"great loss and also a great surprise\".\n\"It was an astonishing, mesmeric performance - Bernard gave everything to that and you can see it in all the scenes. He became Yosser Hughes.\"\nHe added: \"I was desperate to work with him. Everything he did - his whole procedure for working, the manner in which he worked and his performance was everything that you could ever wish for.\n\"You always felt that Bernard would live forever.

    "In the picturesque village of Tintern, in south Wales, an elderly gentleman can often be found taking pictures at community events and family celebrations.\nBut David Hurn, 89, is far from your average photographer.\nOver the past seven decades he has documented everything from the Aberfan disaster to the Beatles at the height of Beatlemania.\nIn the '70s he set up Newport\u2019s prestigious School of Documentary Photography, producing scores of photographers.\nAnd these days the man often described as Wales' most important living photographer has streams of new admirers, after getting to grips with social media.\n\"Twitter and God knows what\u2026 I don't even know what they all mean, I just don't understand it,\" he said.\n\"But I suddenly discovered that there was this thing called Instagram.\"\nIn 2016, the self-taught photographer casually started an account on the social media platform, sharing his musings on photography and photos taken throughout his career.\nNow these Instagram posts - which have helped him build up a following of more than 54,000 Instagram followers - have been brought together in a photo book titled David Hurn: On Instagram.\nDavid, who was raised in Cardiff, never intended to become a photographer.\nIn fact he had his heart set on becoming a vet, but his dyslexia meant he left school with no qualifications.\nNational Service and a transfer to The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst followed.\nOne day he was in the officers' mess - the social space and accommodation for personnel - when he picked up a copy of the magazine Picture Post and became overwhelmed by an image on one of its pages.\n\"Suddenly I started to cry really quite violently. It was not just little tears, it was big sobbing,\" he said.\nThe image was of a Russian army officer buying his wife a hat in a department store in Moscow.\nIt triggered a memory of his own father returning from World War Two and taking him and his mother to Howells department store in Cardiff and buying her a hat.\n\"It was the first memory I had of the love between my mother and my father,\" said Hurn.\n\"I instantly realised that all Russians don't eat their children.\n\"This one simple picture I believed more than the propaganda.\"\nOn leaving Sandhurst he headed for London.\n\"I kind of learnt photography by sitting in the coffee bars and shooting a bit,\" he said.\nIt was in a coffee bar that he met the politician Michael Foot, who at that time was working as a journalist.\nFoot told him about the unfolding uprising in Hungary and suggested he go there and take pictures - and that is exactly what he did. \nHe got into Budapest in an ambulance after contacting the Red Cross.\nHe met journalists from Life magazine whose photographer had been unable to get into the city so he was asked to work for them.\n\"Little did they know that I was up in my room reading my book on how to put film in my camera,\" laughed David.\n\"I learned very quickly that it's better to start at the top than the bottom. \n\"If you start at the top you just cling on and learn very quickly.\"\nHis first pictures appeared in Life Magazine and then the Observer.\nHe said: \"Suddenly, sort of, at the age of 22 I had a name.\"\nHurn quickly built a career covering current affairs, but it was not long before his career took a more glamorous turn.\nOne of the first big stars he photographed was Sophia Loren while she was making the film El Cid in 1960.\n\"Sophia was wonderful. We became very good friends and so we would eat every night together,\" said Hurn.\nWhen the fashion magazine Harper's Bazaar wanted Loren to do a fashion shoot, she agreed to do it on the condition that Hurn took the pictures - which led to more fashion work.\nIn 1963, Hurn was asked to take publicity shots of Sean Connery for the Bond film From Russia with Love.\n\"Now that\u2019s a very funny story,\" he laughed.\nThey were in Hurn\u2019s west London studio to shoot the poster when the publicist realised they had forgotten to bring the gun for Connery to pose with.\n\"I said \u2018don't panic, one of my hobbies is target shooting with a pistol,\" said Hurn.\nHe produced his Walther air pistol which can be seen in the finished poster.\nThe following year, at the height of Beatlemania, he spent about seven weeks photographing John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr at Abbey Road Studios during the filming of A Hard Day\u2019s Night.\n\"I got on with them very well,\" he said.\n\"I must be one of the few people that's played Monopoly with The Beatles.\"\nAnd he said he spotted some tension between the band.\n\"I wasn't totally convinced that they actually really liked each other all that much,\" he said.\n\"It didn't surprise me when they quickly broke up later.\"\nWhat were they like?\n\"I found John a little bit aloof to everybody\u2026 Paul had an attitude of being slightly pompous, absolutely understandable because it turns out that he was really the guy writing the thing, George was off on a world of his own\u2026 and Ringo was just a nice guy.

    "The Rwandan government won't guarantee how many migrants it can take from the UK if flights start to depart. \nRishi Sunak has promised that migrants arriving in the UK without permission will be sent to Rwanda rather than allowed to claim asylum in the UK. \nAround 52,000 have come to the UK since the law was changed in 2023 and are in line for deportation.\nRwanda has signed a five-year deal with the UK, with costs estimated to be at least \u00a3300 million already.\nLast month the prime minister's plans for the UK to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda passed Parliament.\nSpeaking on 22 April, Mr Sunak said the first flight to Rwanda would leave in 10 to 12 weeks. Previously, the government said it aimed to start the flights in spring.\nMr Sunak said there would be \"multiple flights a month through the summer and beyond\".\nWhen Parliament approved the legislation, according to Home Office there were 52,000 asylum seekers who could potentially be sent to Rwanda.\nBut, speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Rwanda's government spokesperson Yolande Maloko said: \"I cannot tell you is how many thousands we're taking in the first year or in the second year.\"\nBut, when asked if Rwanda could accommodate all of the people in the current backlog. \n\"This will depend on very many factors that are being worked out now,\" Ms Maloko said. \nSign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.\nPressed to give a commitment on the number that could be given homes in Rwanda Ms Makolo said \"we are ready\".\nBut, she would not give an assurance it would be able to take the 52,000 people the UK would like to send, merely saying it would be \"thousands\".\nMinisters have said repeatedly they want the notion of being sent to Rwanda to be a deterrent for those trying to come to the UK. \nBut, Ms Makolo said Rwanda had been \"attacked unjustly\".\n\"Living in Rwanda is not a punishment. It is a beautiful country, including the weather,\" she added. \nTransport Secretary Mark Harper also appeared on the show and was asked whether the UK government has a back-up plan.\nAlthough he didn't answer directly, Mr Harper said the government has a \"plan to start flights going in 10 to 12 weeks that is being worked on by the Home Office\".\nMr Harper added: \"We want a steady rhythm of flights going to Rwanda through this year.\n\"We will continue working closely with Rwanda on the partnership agreement we have got that has got all of the safeguards in place that people want to see.\n\"I think if you can set up a system of deterrent through those flights you will break the business model of the organised crime groups who traffic people across the very dangerous waterway of the English Channel.\"\nLabour's Pat McFadden told the programme he thinks the government will succeed in getting flights running to Rwanda but believes it won't fix the migration problem or be value for money.\nHe declined to scrap the scheme on the the first day of a Labour government, should it win the next general election, but reiterated the party does not want to continue with Mr Sunak's policy.\nMr McFadden also said he doubted Labour would work to return any asylum seekers back to the UK.\nSeparately, Ms Makolo denied Rwandan involvement in the bombing of a displacement camp in the Democratic Republic of Congo. \nAt least nine people, including seven children, were killed in the strike on the Mugunga camp in the eastern city of Goma on Friday.\nThe US has blamed the Rwandan army and M23 rebel group. \nMs Makolo said the US government had been \"very hasty to blame us without looking, without investigating this incident and without talking to the people who are affected. \n\"It's something that we outright reject and it's unfair,\" she added.",

Now, even more so given tight restrictions on reporting from Gaza.\"\nForeign journalists are banned from entering Gaza, and Al Jazeera staff there have been some of the only reporters on the ground.\nFor years, Israeli officials have accused the network of anti-Israeli bias. \nTheir criticisms of the broadcaster have intensified since the 7 October Hamas attacks on southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 were taken hostage. Some 128 of those hostages are still unaccounted for, with at least 34 presumed dead. \nAt least 34,683 Palestinians have been killed and 78,018 injured in Israel's subsequent military campaign in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nLast month, the Israeli parliament passed a law giving the government power to temporarily close foreign broadcasters considered a threat to national security during the war against Hamas.\nQatar, where Al Jazeera is headquartered, is mediating talks between Israel and Hamas over the now almost seven-month-long conflict. \nPrevious negotiations mediated by Qatar led to a temporary ceasefire and the release of 105 Israeli hostages in November.\nAl Jazeera has accused Israel of deliberately targeting its staff. \nJournalists including Hamza al-Dahdouh, the son of Al Jazeera Gaza bureau chief Wael al-Dahdouh, have been killed by Israeli strikes. Israel denies targeting journalists.\n\"Israel's suppression of free press to cover up its crimes by killing and arresting journalists has not deterred us from performing our duty,\" the network said in its response to Sunday's ban.",

He became Yosser Hughes.\"\nHe added: \"I was desperate to work with him. Everything he did - his whole procedure for working, the manner in which he worked and his performance was everything that you could ever wish for.\n\"You always felt that Bernard would live forever. He had a great strength, physically and of personality.\"\nHill was due to return to TV screens in series two of The Responder, a BBC drama starring Martin Freeman, which begins airing on Sunday.\nLindsay Salt, director of BBC Drama, paid tribute to him, saying: \"Bernard Hill blazed a trail across the screen, and his long-lasting career filled with iconic and remarkable roles is a testament to his incredible talent.\"\n\"From Boys from the Blackstuff, to Wolf Hall, The Responder, and many more, we feel truly honoured to have worked with Bernard at the BBC. Our thoughts are with his loved ones at this sad time.\"\nIn Boys from the Blackstuff, Hill drew praise for his gritty portrayal of Yosser Hughes, an intense and memorable character who pleaded \"Gizza [give us a] job\" as he sought work. \nThat show won a Bafta for best drama series in 1983, and in 2000 it was ranked seventh on a British Film Institute list of the best TV shows ever made.\nAnother of Hill's memorable BBC TV performances came in the 2015 drama series Wolf Hall, adapted from Hilary Mantel's book about the court of Henry VIII. Hill portrayed the Duke of Norfolk - an uncle of Anne Boleyn and an enemy of Cardinal Wolsey.\nOther roles in Hill's decades-long career included the 1976 BBC TV series I, Claudius, an appearance in 1982's Gandhi, Shirley Valentine in 1989, The Scorpion King in 2002 and 2008 Tom Cruise film Valkyrie. \nHe was meant to be at Comic Con Liverpool on Saturday, but had to cancel at the last minute, the convention said in a post on X. As news of his death broke, the organisers said on the platform they were \"heartbroken\" at Hill's death, and wished his family \"a lot of strength\".\nScottish musician Barbara Dickson also paid tribute on X, saying he had been \"a really marvellous actor\".\nShe added: \"It was a privilege to have crossed paths with him.

    "Prostate cancer scans have been delayed because of an issue over medical supplies, a hospital trust has said.\nThe problem concerned the \"failure\" of a radioactive liquid used in the procedure, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (OUH) said.\nIt said the issue had delayed scans for patients in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire for a month.\nThe NHS trust said an alternative supplier had been found and it was working to clear the backlog.\nTerry Mott, 60, from Long Hanborough, Oxfordshire, was diagnosed with stage three prostate cancer on 16 March.\nHe was initially told by Churchill Hospital in Oxford to expect an appointment for a PET (positron emission tomography) scan within two weeks before a treatment plan could begin.\nHowever, in a hospital email seen by the BBC, Mr Mott was told scans in the Thames Valley region had \"suffered significantly over the last month from being unavailable due to failure of the tracer required to complete the scan\".\nMr Mott said: \"I just find it upsetting, trying to digest that I have got cancer...I'm just concerned that it doesn't spread.\"\nThe retired baggage handler said his own father died from prostate cancer at the age of 69, which was adding to his distress.\nHe said: \"I'm just so angry that you can get it done privately and there's no issues with that, yet when it comes to the NHS [the tracer is] breaking down,\" he added.\nThe tracer is a mildly radioactive substance which is injected into a vein in order to show up where the cancer is and whether it has spread.\nThe NHS email said the hospital would normally scan 24 prostate patients per week but had not been able to do so.\nIn a statement, an OUH spokesperson said: \u201cA localised supply issue with PSMA [prostate-specific membrane antigen] radiotracers for prostate cancer scans has been identified, resulting in some patients at OUH waiting longer than usual for a scan.\n\u201cAn alternative tracer supplier has been found, and local NHS staff are working hard to clear the backlog and ensure all patients get the scans they need as a matter of urgency.\u201d\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "A Canadian man has flown thousands of miles to Yorkshire to meet the stem cell donor who helped save his life.\nRod Neander, who was diagnosed in 2018 with blood cancer, said he had found the chance to thank Tom Marshall, 30, from Sheffield, \"overwhelming\".\nMr Marshall donated his stem cells to Mr Neander after having signed up to the Anthony Nolan register aged 18.\nFollowing the visit last month, Mr Marshall described Mr Neander as \"more like family\" than a friend.\nHe said before signing up to the stem cell register, he had often previously given blood, but he had then read a pamphlet on the subject.\n\"I saw it as an opportunity to help people. If I could do it then I thought, 'why not?'\"\nAfter finding out he was a match for someone, Mr Marshall donated stem cells at Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital in April 2020.\nHe said he had felt \"a bit of excitement and a bit of apprehension\" on getting the call, but felt it was his \"opportunity to do something good for someone else\".\nThe recipient, Mr Neander, a grandfather-of-three in his early 60s, had previously been diagnosed with a blood cancer known as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.\nAfter the donation, the pair had to wait some time to meet up because the Anthony Nolan Trust asks that there be no contact between patients and donors for two years.\nOnce this period was up, Mr Marshall and Mr Neander started communicating via email and video calls, before Mr Neander made the trip from Canada to Sheffield in April.\nMr Marshall said meeting Mr Neander in person \"made me feel that donating stem cells is the best thing that I've ever done\".\n\"Becoming a dad has made me realise time is so precious and donating stem cells to give Rod more time is the best gift that I have ever given,\" he said.\n\"The blood we share hasn't just made us friends but more like family.\" \nMeanwhile, Mr Neander said: \"The chance to say thank you to Tom, my stem cell donor, is overwhelming.\"\nThe transplant had allowed him to \"get back to the things I love\", Mr Neander said.\nHenny Braund, chief executive of the Anthony Nolan Trust, said: \"Our donors like Tom are incredible.

    "Two Nasa astronauts are due to head for the International Space Station aboard a new spacecraft.\nBoeing\u2019s Starliner will blast off from Cape Canaveral in Florida, in its first crewed test flight.\nThe mission has been delayed for several years because of setbacks in the spacecraft's development.\nIf it is successful, it will become the second private firm able to provide crew transport to and from the ISS, alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX.\nNasa no longer wants to own and operate such vehicles, preferring now to buy the service from the commercial sector.\nThe scheduled lift-off is set for 22:34 local time on Monday (03:34 BST Tuesday).\nBut the launch is also a moment of jeopardy for Boeing. Its airline business is under pressure because of a series of accidents. And the firm\u2019s space sector is also under scrutiny following difficulties in developing  Starliner itself.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really big day for Boeing\", commented Dr Simeon Barber, a space scientist at the Open University.\n\u201cThe company has been working on the spacecraft for so long, they have had a few problems with the test flights and there\u2019s a lot riding on this\u201d.\nStarliner was originally due to have its first uncrewed test flight in 2015 but this was delayed until 2019. When it did occur, software glitches led to an internal clock malfunction, resulting in thrusters over-firing. So much fuel was consumed that the capsule couldn't reach the space station.\nA second attempt was planned in August 2021 but delayed again until May 2022. An issue with the propulsion system was blamed. When Starliner did finally get off Earth, it managed to complete its full mission but concerns were then later raised about the performance of some thrusters and the craft's cooling system.\nCorrecting these faults and additional issues to do with the safety of wiring and parachutes pushed the first crewed demonstration back to where we are today.\nNasa and Boeing would not have given the go ahead for astronauts to fly the mission unless they were certain all the glitches had been sorted out. And the launch will be aborted if there is any sign of problems with the spacecraft.\nAt a pre-flight news conference, a reporter put it to the Navy-trained astronauts that the setbacks must make their flight \"scary\" for friends and family.\nBarry \"Butch\" Wilmore said it would be wrong to describe the various technical issues as \"setbacks\".\n\"We'd call them steps forward. We find an issue and rectify that and we have articulated that to our families so that they understand that,\" he added.\nAnd Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, who will pilot the spacecraft, commented: \"We are all here because we are all ready. Our friends and family have heard about it and we've talked about it and they are happy and proud that we are part of the process to fix it all.\"\nWhen Nasa announced that SpaceX and Boeing would take over from the old space shuttles, it gave them both a similar contract, one that would bring their capsules into service and then pay for six operational missions. The SpaceX contract was worth $2.6bn while Boeing got $4.2bn. SpaceX was able to fly its crew flight test in 2020. This means Boeing is four years behind. The company has also spent a lot of money to put things right.\nDr Barber said SpaceX and other start-ups had a new approach to technology development that led to greater innovation.\n\"You have a traditional space company (in Boeing) that has been around a long time and does things in a certain way and you have a new space company which has done things in a different way, by building, testing, crashing, learning and then building again and so their development cycle is very rapid,\" he told BBC News.\nBoeing\u2019s commercial crew programme manager Mark Nappi told reporters at a news conference that finding faults in test flights was a normal part of the process in developing a new spacecraft.\n\u201cDesign and development has constant ups and downs, but the overall slope is always up. So that is where we have got to today. We are basically at the top of that slope\u201d.\nThe arrival of Boeing's spacecraft into service will mean competition for SpaceX which should bring down costs, according to Libby Jackson, who is the head of space exploration for the UK Space Agency.\n\"That is really important not just for Nasa, but for other space agencies, such as the UK Space Agency, because we are spending the taxpayers' money getting our astronauts to the ISS and we want the best value for money,\" she said.\nStarliner is 5m tall and 4.6m wide (16.5ft by 15ft), when attached to its rear service module. It's wider than the capsule used in the Apollo missions. There's room for up to seven astronauts, although it will probably fly routinely with just four. It's intended to be reusable and fly up to 10 times.\nThe spacecraft launch at in the early hours of Tuesday morning should see it cross the southwest of the UK about 20 minutes after lift-off.\nDuring the journey to the ISS, the crew will test seats, assess onboard life-support and n",
    "Argentina\u2019s president Javier Milei says he accepts the Falkland Islands are currently \u201cin the hands of the UK\".\nIn an interview with the BBC, the right-wing politician vowed to get the islands back through diplomatic channels but said there was \u201cno instant solution\u201d.\nHis language on the status of the Falklands is different from past leaders who have historically maintained the islands are Argentine.\nPresident Milei admitted it could take decades to try to gain sovereignty of the Falkland Islands from the UK and said Argentina does not \"seek conflict\".\nIt comes after he promised a \u201croadmap\u201d for the islands to become Argentine, on the 42nd anniversary of the Falklands War in early April.\nHe had criticised politicians who \u201cbeat their chests demanding sovereignty of the islands, but without any result\u201d.\nThe UK and Argentina went to war over the British overseas territory - known as the Malvinas in Argentina - in 1982.\nThe invasion claimed the lives of 255 British servicemen, three islanders and 649 Argentinian personnel.  \nBut President Milei praised Margaret Thatcher who was the UK prime minister during the Falklands War.\nHe was speaking in his presidential palace office, in which there was some Margaret Thatcher memorabilia on a display table.\nElsewhere, sat a photograph of a former Argentine president with the Rolling Stones, a bust sculpture of himself, and a water bottle with his photograph on it.\nLady Thatcher ordered the torpedoing of the Argentine naval cruiser the General Belgrano during the war, resulting in the deaths of 323 people on board.\nAsked if he still admired her, President Milei said: \u201cCriticising someone because of their nationality or race is very intellectually precarious. I have heard lots of speeches by Margaret Thatcher. She was brilliant. So what's the problem?\u201d\nArgentina has long claimed sovereignty over the islands in the south-west Atlantic Ocean - 300 miles off its coast and 8,000 miles from the UK . There is a plaque of them displayed in a courtyard of the presidential palace in Buenos Aires.\nThe UK\u2019s Foreign Secretary, Lord Cameron, visited the islands in February and said their sovereignty was not up for discussion.\nPresident Milei said: \u201cIf that territory is now in the hands of the UK, he has a right to do that. I don\u2019t see that as a provocation.\u201d\nThat seems like a significant remark as past leaders and many Argentines have always refused to accept the islands were British. \nIn 2013, when Lord Cameron was prime minister, islanders voted in favour of remaining a UK overseas territory.\nPresident Milei said he wanted the islands to become Argentine \u201cwithin the framework of peace\u201d.\n\u201cWe are not going to relinquish our sovereignty, nor are we going to seek conflict with the United Kingdom,\u201d he said.\nHe refused to put a timeframe on this, saying \u201cit\u2019s going to take time\u201d and it would involve a \u201clong-term negotiation\u201d.\nWhen asked why the UK would agree to this, he told the BBC: \u201cThey might not want to negotiate today. At some later point they might want to. Many positions have changed over time.\u201d\nHe denied it was not a priority of his but, when pushed, admitted \u201cof course\u201d it could take decades - referencing the handover of Hong Kong from the UK to China in 1997.\nHis rhetoric is notably tamer than his left-wing predecessor Alberto Fernandez, who called the islands \u201cstolen land\u201d and the UK\u2019s claim on them \u201cdisgusting\u201d.\nUnder his leadership, Argentina broke a co-operation deal and pushed to reopen talks on the islands.\nPresident Milei\u2019s approach has surprised some, given his radical approach to other policies during his campaign - for example campaigning with a chainsaw to symbolise his desire to slash public spending and the state, which he also defended in the interview.",
    "The boss of Eurotunnel has insisted there will not be long queues of cars at its terminals when a new EU travel system starts in October.\nBrits heading to and from Europe will need to register fingerprints and a photo at the border, which has prompted warnings of delays.\nEurotunnel chief executive Yann Leriche said journeys would take five-to-seven minutes longer, but extra lanes and technology mean the process will go smoothly.\nThe BBC has had the first look at new machines people will need to use at Folkestone or Calais.\nAt the Port of Dover, Eurostar\u2019s St Pancras terminus and Eurotunnel in Folkestone, French border police check passports as people leave the UK.\nThe EU\u2019s much-delayed Entry Exit system, or EES, will replace manual passport stamping.\nCitizens of countries which are outside the bloc, including the UK, will need to register their biometric information.\nThere have been repeated warnings of queues as a result, and calls for the EES launch to be pushed back again. \nThere were hopes that an app being developed by the EU could enable some of the registration to be done from home, but it is not expected to be ready for use in October.\nAt Eurotunnel\u2019s Folkestone and Calais sites, we saw how the company which operates vehicle and freight shuttles across the Channel Tunnel has been preparing for the new system.\nThe equivalent of \u00a370m is being spent building processing zones, where people will queue in their cars to use automatic machines.\nYann Leriche, the chief executive of Eurotunnel operator Getlink, told the BBC that travellers \"will simply [get] out of their car, spend a few minutes on their kiosks, and go back to their car and continue their journey\u201d.\nHe said it would take \u201cfive to seven minutes extra to get through\u201d, but added \u201cas we have extended the number of lanes, there will be no delay on the highway, nothing. It will happen in a very smooth manner\u201d.\nThe company will recruit 140 new staff to assist passengers.\nI tried out one of the prototype machines which Eurotunnel will use at its terminals.\nFirst, it took a scan of my passport.\nNext, the machine then took a photo of my face.\nI was then asked to put my right hand on another scanning pad, which recorded my fingerprints.\nA series of questions about my journey followed on the touchscreen, to which I had to answer \"yes\" or \"no\". \nAt the Port of Dover, the plan is slightly different.\nPort staff will have iPads for car passengers to register their information.\nCoaches will be processed off-site at the Western Docks, with e-gates or kiosks.\nMonday marks 30 years since Queen Elizabeth II and President Mitterand took part in the Channel Tunnel's official opening event.  \nPaying passengers had to wait several months longer to take the journey on Eurostar trains.\nThe tunnel opened \u00a32bn over budget. The company operating it nearly went bust at one point, but it later became profitable and the services through the tunnel have endured.  \nWith the pandemic over and preparations under way for the introduction of EES, Getlink boss Mr Leriche wants to see an increasing number of trains going through the tunnel.\nEurostar, a separate company to Eurotunnel, runs passenger services from London St Pancras through the Channel Tunnel to Paris and beyond. Since the tunnel opened, it has been the only operator doing that. \nNow, there's talk of rival operators springing up. \nMr Leriche said: \"We are confident that within the next 10 years, there will be a doubling of the direct connection between London and Europe\".\n",

To help you prepare, here\u2019s a guide to all 37 songs in the contest \u2013 which I\u2019ve sorted into barely-coherent musical categories, because everyone needs a system.\nThe success of K\u00e4\u00e4rij\u00e4\u2019s mutant rave-rap anthem Cha Cha Cha at last year\u2019s contest has unlocked something potent.\nEverywhere you look in Malm\u00f6, there\u2019s a sense of musical experimentation and outr\u00e9 risqu\u00e9 performance.\nTop of the heap is Croatia\u2019s Baby Lasagna, whose ridiculously catchy Rim Tim Tagi Dim is currently the bookmakers' favourite to win.\nLoud and aggressive and memorable and fun, it blends elements of rock and techno to tell the story of a farm boy saying goodbye to his milking stool and setting out for the big city.\nAccording to singer Marko Puri\u0161i\u0107, the lyrics are a reference to the brain drain that\u2019s affecting Croatia\u2019s economy.\nAnother strong contender Switzerland\u2019s Nemo, whose song The Code is a hare-brained hybrid of pop, opera and electro.\nInspired by Nemo\u2019s childhood experience as an opera singer, it uses elements of Bizet\u2019s Carmen and Mozart\u2019s The Magic Flute to explain how they came to terms with their non-binary identity. It\u2019s surprisingly intense.\nFinland\u2019s Windows95Man, on the other hand, is trying too hard to stand out, emerging from a giant egg and dancing around in his underpants. But all the antics aren\u2019t enough to distract from the fatally generic Europop of his song, No Rules.\nI\u2019m much more enamoured by Joost Klein from the Netherlands who takes a whistle-stop, happy hardcore tour of Europe in the infectiously silly Europapa.\nPerformed in high-rise shoulderpads, while LED screens project images of currywurst and paella, the song is nonetheless rooted in tragedy.\nJoost lost his parents at a young age, and the song reflects that no matter how far he travels, he can\u2019t outrun his grief.\nPull on your dancing trousers, because Eurovision is ready to party.\nThere are a ton of uptempo dance-pop numbers this year, led (gasp) by the UK\u2019s entrant, Olly Alexander.\nFormerly of the pop band Years and Years, his bubbling synthpop anthem, Dizzy, recalls Gloria Gaynor\u2019s I Will Survive by way of The Pet Shop Boys.\nInstantly memorable, if a little undercooked, the song has risen to 10th place in the odds after rehearsal footage was released this week, showcasing some memorable choreography and a revamped ending to the song.\nBut he faces stiff competition, as pop fans are spoilt for choice this year.\nCypriot entrant Silia Kapsis, for example, channels Janet and Britney with her infectiously bombastic song, Liar. Her lyrics could do with some work (\u201cThe only problem in this room is about you\u201d) but the breath-taking dance routine will be popular with voters.\nNot to be outdone on the choreography, Malta\u2019s Sarah Bonnici does the splits and a somersault during her performance. But her song, Loop, is paper-thin, and languishes in last place with bookmakers.\nBy contrast, Spanish duo Nebulossa have already had a viral hit with their song, Zorra. The title translates as both \u201cvixen\u201d and \u201cbitch\u201d and the lyrics are a commentary on the double standards women face. It\u2019s a shimmering piece of 80s candy-pop that\u2019s good enough to eat.\nMeanwhile, five-time Eurovision winners Luxembourg are back in the competition for the first time in 31 years, represented by Tali Golergant.\nShe punches above her weight with Fighter, a vibey, syncopated pop slammer whose chorus sticks in your head like a sausage on a fork.\nLooming over the competition like a pop Godzilla is Albanian diva Besa. Her song, Titan, has an appropriately gargantuan hook and a thrilling tempo-switch at the end. \nHer bright blue bodysuit seems to have been inspired by Steps' video for Deeper Shade of Blue. And why not? It's a classic.\nRounding out the field are Iceland\u2019s Hera Bj\u00f6rk with Scared Of Heights and Polish singer Luna with The Tower. \nBoth songs are both perfectly accessible, radio-friendly pop \u2013 but I suspect they\u2019ll struggle to survive the semi-finals.\nEurovision wouldn\u2019t be Eurovision without a raven-haired diva over-emoting about her personal struggles, and this year is no exception.\nIsrael\u2019s Eden Golan has the best of the bunch \u2013 a stirringly emotional piano ballad called Hurricane, in which a ",

    "He famously sang about being Born In The USA, not life in Blaenau Gwent.\nAnd you'd be excused for thinking there wasn't anything to link legendary New Jersey rocker Bruce Springsteen to a south Wales town like Ebbw Vale.\nBut a connection does exist - albeit one which even The Boss's most ardent fans would struggle to guess.\nAnd, as devotees of the 74-year-old rock icon flood Cardiff to watch him perform this weekend, we are here to tell you what it is. \nBut first, a clue: it involves a bride and groom, a now defunct steel works and a famous photographer.\nStill stumped?\nWell, any fans from the South Wales Valleys who attended the singer's 1988 UK Tunnel of Love gigs in London and Birmingham might have had the answer under their noses all this time.\nEspecially if they had bought one of the glossy programmes for sale on the nearby merchandise stall.\nBecause if they had done they will have noticed something strangely familiar within.\nAcross two whole pages of that promotional booklet was a vintage black-and-white photo of a newlywed bride and groom.\nThe windswept couple were standing high on a hill above a backdrop of blast furnaces belching thick grey smoke.\nEagle-eyed fans will have recognised the scene as the lower end of Ebbw Vale's own former steel plant - or, at least, how it looked back in the 1960s when it was still owned by the firm Richard Thomas & Baldwins.\nThe shot had been captured in 1965 by a New York-based photographer called Bruce Davidson, who had been staying at the nearby Park Hotel. \nIt was part of a collection of poignant pics he had taken during a 10-day trip to South Wales to chronicle life in its towns and villages steeped in heavy industry.\nDescribed as \"probably the most distinctive photographic project on Wales in the post-war era\", Davidson has gone on record to say he fell in love with what he saw there.\nNow 90, he said in a previous interview: \"I was there to find something beautiful in the people and their work, and there was a certain beauty in all that darkness.\"\nIn addition, overlying Davidson's image in the Springsteen tour programme were the lyrics to a 1979 studio outtake by The Boss entitled Roulette.\n\"Mister, I've been cheated,\" read the words. \"I feel like I've been robbed/I'm the big expendable/My life just cancelled null and void.\"\nEerily, they would echo the feelings of many in south Wales as, over the years, they watched the heart of their industrial communities slowly being ripped out.     \nFor example, that Ebbw Vale plant photographed by Davidson would have provided employment for more than 10,000 tinplate workers back in its production heyday.\nHowever, having struggled to match the rise in cheap imports, that number had dwindled to barely 1,000 by the time its main gates shut for the final time in 2002.\nWhat had been a cornerstone for its employees, both economically and socially, had been dismantled and lost forever.\nBut, like the stateside working classes that Springsteen grew up amongst and documented throughout his career, they refused to give up, soldiering on unbowed.\nAnd, much like The Boss himself, they never lost sight of what made them who they are.",

    "He famously sang about being Born In The USA, not life in Blaenau Gwent.\nAnd you'd be excused for thinking there wasn't anything to link legendary New Jersey rocker Bruce Springsteen to a south Wales town like Ebbw Vale.\nBut a connection does exist - albeit one which even The Boss's most ardent fans would struggle to guess.\nAnd, as devotees of the 74-year-old rock icon flood Cardiff to watch him perform this weekend, we are here to tell you what it is. \nBut first, a clue: it involves a bride and groom, a now defunct steel works and a famous photographer.\nStill stumped?\nWell, any fans from the South Wales Valleys who attended the singer's 1988 UK Tunnel of Love gigs in London and Birmingham might have had the answer under their noses all this time.\nEspecially if they had bought one of the glossy programmes for sale on the nearby merchandise stall.\nBecause if they had done they will have noticed something strangely familiar within.\nAcross two whole pages of that promotional booklet was a vintage black-and-white photo of a newlywed bride and groom.\nThe windswept couple were standing high on a hill above a backdrop of blast furnaces belching thick grey smoke.\nEagle-eyed fans will have recognised the scene as the lower end of Ebbw Vale's own former steel plant - or, at least, how it looked back in the 1960s when it was still owned by the firm Richard Thomas & Baldwins.\nThe shot had been captured in 1965 by a New York-based photographer called Bruce Davidson, who had been staying at the nearby Park Hotel. \nIt was part of a collection of poignant pics he had taken during a 10-day trip to South Wales to chronicle life in its towns and villages steeped in heavy industry.\nDescribed as \"probably the most distinctive photographic project on Wales in the post-war era\", Davidson has gone on record to say he fell in love with what he saw there.\nNow 90, he said in a previous interview: \"I was there to find something beautiful in the people and their work, and there was a certain beauty in all that darkness.\"\nIn addition, overlying Davidson's image in the Springsteen tour programme were the lyrics to a 1979 studio outtake by The Boss entitled Roulette.\n\"Mister, I've been cheated,\" read the words. \"I feel like I've been robbed/I'm the big expendable/My life just cancelled null and void.\"\nEerily, they would echo the feelings of many in south Wales as, over the years, they watched the heart of their industrial communities slowly being ripped out.     \nFor example, that Ebbw Vale plant photographed by Davidson would have provided employment for more than 10,000 tinplate workers back in its production heyday.\nHowever, having struggled to match the rise in cheap imports, that number had dwindled to barely 1,000 by the time its main gates shut for the final time in 2002.\nWhat had been a cornerstone for its employees, both economically and socially, had been dismantled and lost forever.\nBut, like the stateside working classes that Springsteen grew up amongst and documented throughout his career, they refused to give up, soldiering on unbowed.\nAnd, much like The Boss himself, they never lost sight of what made them who they are.",
    "Peterborough\u2019s Regional Pool was commissioned to be demolished this year.\nIt came after reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac) was found in the building in September 2023.\nThe facility on Bishop\u2019s Road also previously struggled with other issues which included structural cracking, out-of-date mechanical installations and damaged asbestos.\nThere are plans for a new pool but an outline business case would need to be submitted.\nA Freedom of Information request (FOI) revealed Peterborough City Council spent \u00a3200,000 on repairs in the past financial year.\nIn 2023-24, part of that money saw \u00a3104,000 spent on asbestos works and fan motors while \u00a350,000 was also spent on inspections and testing.\nThis was the largest influx of capital investment the pool had received since 2015-16.\nAside from this, a \u00a31m temporary car park was also established at the site on Bishop\u2019s Road and \u00a3275,000 was also spent \u2060in response to Legionella bacteria outbreaks last year.\nIn the last decade, the figures showed \u00a3723,349 was invested into the pool.\nA further \u00a3355,430 was spent on maintenance and repairs and \u00a3328,434 on inspections and testing in this period.\nThe average annual cost of maintenance and repairs has doubled - from an average of \u00a326,000 a year in 2015  to an average of \u00a357,000 in the last three financial years.\nThe council said it would cost them \u00a326.3m to repair the facility which was built in the 1970s.\nHowever, it is estimated a new pool could cost \u00a330m with demolition costs expecting to reach up to \u00a32.5m\nThe council said this cost would be offset by how much the value of the land the pool\u2019s built on increases and how much it will save on security and monitoring.\nLeader of the council, Mohammed Farooq said demolition work might take \"a few months\" to get under way.\nThe authority has pledged a new \u00a330m pool for the city, scheduled to be completed by 2028.\nIt would include a teaching pool, splash pool, cafe, sports hall, gym, clip and climb facility and soft play area.\nIt is expected that the council will award a contract between September 2025 and January 2026, and then building work would begin.\nJohn Howard, deputy leader and cabinet member for corporate governance and finance, said council officers had \"taken the time to carefully consider the options available\".\nHe said the new facility would \"serve the city well for decades to come and will attract people from far and wide\".\n\"That must be our aspiration, rather than placing a sticking plaster on what we have already,\" he explained.\nMr Farooq added he believed the council had \"taken the right decision\" and residents would be updated on the pool's progress.\nIn the meantime, modular pools which require no excavating, have been considered as an alternative.\nNo date has been confirmed for these pools yet.\nOpening season for the Peterborough Lido has also been extended to compensate for the loss of the Regional Pool. The Lido was kept open for the first time in its history during the winter last year.\nPreviously, Ben Negus, of the City of Peterborough Swimming Club, who practiced at the facility until it closed said building a new pool was \"the right decision\u201d.\n\u201cThe pool lasted over 10 years after its sell-by-date,\" he said.\n\"It has not been improved over the years and we need a new modern facility.\u201d\nMorgan Stevenson, co-chair of the City of Peterborough Swimming Club, told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: \"2028 is a long wait and we've seen plans and promises made in the past.\n\"The need now is for decisive action and tangible progress to deliver a facility for the now and the future needs of our growing city.\"\nFollow Peterborough news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Suella Braverman has called on Rishi Sunak to \"own\" the poor results for the Tories in England's local elections.\n\"The plan is not working,\" the former home secretary said, urging the PM to \"change course\" and swing to the right.\nMs Braverman, an MP and previous Tory leadership candidate, said there was not enough time to change leader before a general election, so it was up to Mr Sunak to \"fix this\".\nBut Transport Secretary Mark Harper insisted the PM's plan \"is working\".\nThe Conservatives are licking their wounds after a string of local election defeats. After the final votes were counted on Sunday, the Tories had lost control of 10 councils and more than 470 council seats.\nThe party also lost 10 Police and Crime Commissioners to Labour, marking a potentially significant blow for the Conservatives if they aim to centre their next general election campaign on law and order.\nThe re-election of Ben Houchen as the Tees Valley mayor on Friday provided respite for the party, but the loss of the West Midlands mayor Andy Street on Saturday evening was a blow.\nThe Conservatives also lost the Blackpool South by-election - Mr Sunak's seventh by-election defeat since he took control of the party.  \n\"There is no disguising the fact these have been terrible election results for the Conservatives,\" Ms Braverman told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg. \n\"I'm urging the prime minister to change course, to - with humility - reflect on what the voters are telling us and change the plan and the way that he is communicating and leading us.\"\nMs Braverman said although she regretted backing Mr Sunak for the leadership it would now be \"impossible\" to change leader with a general election due within about six months and there was \"no superman or superwoman out there\".\nShe added: \"Rishi Sunak has been leading us for about 18 months, he has been making these decisions, these are the consequences of those decisions, he needs to own this and therefore he needs to fix it.\"\nSetting out a potential course of action, Ms Braverman said the problem was Tory voters were \"on strike\", saying they were telling her \"you're not a Conservative party any more\", and Mr Sunak needed to show \"he really cares\".\nShe said: \"He needs to actually lower taxes in a way that people will feel, not tweaking around the edges.\n\"If he's serious about migration, he needs to put a cap on legal migration, he needs to take us out of the European Convention on Human Rights - that's how you actually send the message that he's serious about stopping the boats.\"\nWhen challenged on evidence moving further to the right would buoy Tory prospects, Ms Braverman replied: \"The evidence is that people are not voting for what he's doing... They don't feel the benefits.\"\nShe added many Conservative MPs were privately \"demoralised\" and \"at this rate we'll be lucky to have any Conservative MPs at the next election\".\nDespite the poor results, there has been no move against Mr Sunak from rebels within his own ranks, with one former minister telling Laura Kuenssberg: \"There just isn't the impetus to roll the dice one more time.\"\nThere are no clear other options to replace Mr Sunak, in the view of many MPs; while some want Mr Sunak and his cabinet to soak up the blame, when the defeat they expect comes.\nOne former cabinet minister tells Laura Kuenssberg: \"Sunak isn't being challenged only because no-one wants to own the failure.\"\nLabour's campaigns chief Pat McFadden hailed the \"tremendous\" election results for the party, especially winning the West Midlands mayoral race which was \"beyond our expectations\".\n\"These were tremendous local election results, a tremendous by-election, and a set of mayoral results,\" he said, adding people can see \"a changed Labour Party from a few years ago, a Labour Party that is passing the essential tests of trust that the voters look for - can you be trusted with public money and can you be trusted with national security?\"\nBut Mr McFadden acknowledged Labour's position on the Middle East had cost the party at the local elections.\nDefending the Conservative's general election chances, Mr Harper said there was still \"all to play for\" in a general election and insisted the government's plan \"is working\".\nPointing to the Rwanda plan, he said: \"The plan is about delivering - the plan is working but we haven't got all the way through to the end of it yet.\n\"I think people want to see delivery, so they want to see inflation continue to come down, they want to see the boats stop, they want to see NHS waiting lists continue to fall.\"\nHe added the election outcome was closer than the polls had suggested it would be, pointing to a hung parliament, so \"the election isn't a foregone conclusion\".\nHealth Minister Maria Caulfield also said there was no need to change course but should deliver \"Conservative values\".\nShe said: \"I don't think we need to change, I think we need to deliver on what we promised in the 2019 election.\n\"People are frustrated that we've not done ",

    "Newly-elected West Midlands Mayor Richard Parker said he was committed to rebuilding the Labour Party's trust with Muslim communities.\nMr Parker defeated Tory incumbent Andy Street, who had held the office for seven years and was seeking a third term, by just 1,508 votes, in a shock loss for the Conservatives.\nHowever, independent candidate Akhmed Yakoob, who campaigned on a pro-Palestine ticket, won 69,621 votes, diminishing Labour's lead in some of its typical stronghold areas.\nBBC analysis has shown Labour's position on the Israel-Hamas war appears to have dented its support in Muslim areas in England's local elections this week.\nIn 58 local council wards analysed by the BBC, where more than one in five residents identify as Muslim, Labour's share of the vote was 21% down on 2021, the last time most seats were contested.\nSpeaking on BBC Politics Midlands after his electoral win, Richard Parker addressed voters' concerns about Gaza.\n\"It's a very important point and it matters to this region,\" he said.\n\"I've been out speaking and listening to many of our inner city communities, including the Muslim community.\n\"I understand their concerns, I understand how important this issue is to them and I'm committed to working with our council leaders, our councillors, our MPs in the region and with the Labour Party nationally to start to rebuild the trust we've lost with the Muslim community.\n\"I'm hoping if we do that and we demonstrate to them we do care and we understand their concerns, we can rebuild that trust and we can win them back to Labour.\"\nLabour called for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza conflict in February, after months of wrangling over its position.\nIts initial stance after the war began, in which it called for humanitarian pauses in the fighting, prompted Labour resignations in councils and from its frontbench last year.\nSpeaking in Birmingham after Mr Parker's win, Labour leader Keir Starmer addressed Labour voters who turned away from the party over its stance on Gaza.\n\"I say directly to those who may have voted Labour in the past, but felt on this occasion they couldn't, that across the West Midlands we are a proud and diverse community,\"  Mr Starmer said.\n\"I have heard you, I have listened, and I am determined to meet your concerns and to gain your respect and trust again in the future.\"\nLabour's campaign chief and Wolverhampton MP Pat McFadden told Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday: \"I understand why people have got strong feelings about this issue, thousands of people have been killed.\n\"There\u2019s a great impulse to help people that are in a terrible situation, that\u2019s something that we share.\n\"The better life that people want for the Palestinian people is something the Labour leadership shares. If we\u2019re fortunate enough to be elected at the general election, its a very high foreign policy priority for the Labour Party.\n\"Two things have guided us since 7 October last year, the first was defending Israel\u2019s right to defend itself after that atrocity and that remains part of our position and the second is working to get a better future for the Palestinian people, both of those things will guide our position going forward.\"\nWhen asked whether the party\u2019s stance on the issue will have an impact in a general election, he replied: \"I do acknowledge that in some parts of the country that was the case and there will be some people who may have voted Labour in the past that haven\u2019t in the local elections because of this issue and where that's the case we\u2019ll work to get people\u2019s support back.\n\"Overall I do have to stress, these were tremendous local election results, a tremendous by-election and a set of Mayoral elections that went beyond the expectations that we had.\"\nOn BBC Politics Midlands, Mr Parker also discussed the mayoral results and what it meant for Labour in the next general election.\n\"It was an emotional rollercoaster. I'd actually only written a losing speech,\" the new mayor said.\n\"I had a great platform for my campaign and that was provided by the great work the Labour Party have done under Keir Starmer's leadership. \n\"What I think my victory demonstrated is that if we continue to work hard, campaign on issues that are important to working people, the Labour Party is in a great place to win the next election.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Stigma surrounding the death of Aberdeen church elder John Strachan was so severe that it forced his widow to emigrate.\nHaving contracted HIV from one of his regular blood transfusions, the 44-year-old engineer died in October 1987.\nAlmost four decades on - and ahead of the UK infected blood inquiry findings being published - his only son continues to relive the day his \"world fell apart\".\nBob Strachan said: \"My father died - just two weeks before my ninth birthday - and that's when the rumours started.\"\nAcross the UK more than 3,000 people died after contracting HIV or hepatitis C through NHS transfusions and other treatments during the 1970s and 80s.\nHaemophiliac John Strachan regularly required blood transfusions at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.\nDespite his health problems, he had continued to lead an active and community-focused life, particularly around the church.\nBut following his death, word quickly spread through the congregation about the cause of his death.\nSon Bob explained: \"My mum protected me from what was all being said, but some years later I learned of all the additional heartache she went through.\n\"There was a lot of stigma surrounding HIV and Aids in the 1980s - and one member of the church made it her business to let everyone know how my father died without  adding any of the context.\n\"Back then you only had HIV if you were either gay or took drugs.\n\"My mother took me away from it all and we went first to New Zealand and then on to Canada to be with family members.\n\"We eventually moved back to Scotland and settled in the Stirling area where she started to rebuild our lives.\"\nMr Strachan also believes his father was not told of his positive HIV results for six months, putting both himself and his mother at risk of infection.\nHe also feels that his paternal grandfather's death a few years later was a direct consequence of the scandal.\nThe 45-year-old psychology graduate, who works as a pastor and counsellor in Jedburgh, admits the scars from his childhood have yet to fully heal.\nHe added: \"My world fell apart when my father died and that pain has never gone away.\n\"The more I found out about what had actually happened made everything even worse.\n\"My grandfather gave up on life after my father died - he died from a broken heart.\n\"This is the biggest health scandal we've had in the NHS and me and my family were all caught up in it.\"\nScotland's public inquiry into contaminated blood led to a support scheme being introduced in 2017.\nIt initially provided financial help and wider support for people infected with hepatitis C, HIV or both as a result of NHS treatment.\nThe scheme was expanded to also provide payments to partners of infected people who had died.\nA UK-wide inquiry began in 2018, with former judge Sir Brian Longstaff taking evidence from current and former parliamentary ministers from across all four nations, as well as survivors and bereaved family members.\nThe report of his findings will be published on 20 May.\nWhile much of the narrative surrounding the inquiry is about compensation for victims, Mr Strachan believes an acknowledgement and an apology will be just as welcome.\nHe added: \"All the politicians seem to be talking about is how much money should be paid out.\n\"This is about so much more than people looking for compensation payments.\n\"Yes, people should receive compensation as their loved ones died through no fault of their own, but I want to know that there is a realisation by the people involved that this had widespread impact on families and communities.\n\"I want them to acknowledge that my mum lost her husband, I lost my father and my children missed out on their grandfather.\n\"An apology will go a long way to bringing closure.\"",
    "A 16-year-old has his sights set on becoming the world\u2019s first deaf F1 driver.\nCaleb McDuff, from Newport, became deaf when he was two years old, after a number of severe ear infections.\nHis parents made the decision to have cochlear implants fitted which allow him to experience the sensation of hearing.\nHowever, they were told the impact of this would mean Caleb had to avoid contact sports.\nAfter learning this, his dad, Ian McDuff, quickly started researching activities that would be accessible.\n\u201cI came across a Canadian driver called Kris Martin who's a deaf driver trying to get in NASCAR and he sort of inspired me to look at motor sport,\u201d he said.\nHe bought four-year-old Caleb a go-kart for Christmas and he\u2019s been racing ever since.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I would be doing if I wasn\u2019t racing,\u201d Caleb said.\nUntil last year, Caleb wasn't able to use his cochlear implants comfortably under his helmet which meant taking them out and driving in complete silence.\nHowever, he said that this challenge has made him the driver he is today.\n\u201cI think it helped me focus more on what's ahead of me than what\u2019s surrounding with the sound.\n\u201cIt makes me a unique person, because people will be like, \u2018how do you race in silence?\u2019, and I'm like \u2018that\u2019s just me\u2019.\u201d\nIan said Caleb has learnt how to feel the car rather than listen to it.\n\u201cHe actually felt the car changing in different situations which was very impressive.\n\u2018\u201dHe could even feel the presence of another kart because the air vibration was different.\u201d\nBut, despite excelling as a silent driver, there were limitations to the level he could compete at without hearing.\nThat changed when Caleb signed for Team BRIT, the world\u2019s first competitive all-disabled team earlier this year.\nThe team has been working to design new ways of communicating with him.\nTeam BRIT's Lucy Sheehan explained: \u201cCaleb\u2019s cochlear implants have sound processors.\n\u201cThey listen and transmit signals through his skull into receivers which are connected to the nerve in his ears.\n\u201cWe've created a technology which means he can wear the processors outside of his helmet.\u2019\u2019\nIt means, for the first time, he can communicate with his engineer and team radio, but most significantly, he can also hear the car.\nDescribing the feeling of racing with sound, Caleb said \u201cwhen you exit the pits and just floor down the car and the best part of going from first, second to third and just hear that roar from the engine.\n\u201cJust to hear all that pops and bangs, that\u2019s the best part of racing I\u2019d say.\u201d\nThe team are now working with Caleb on other ways of communicating with deaf drivers, including those who don\u2019t use cochlear implants.\nCaleb hopes that with this new technology he will one day be able to compete in the same racing class as his idol, Sir Lewis Hamilton.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the top motorsport you could ever be in. If I was to make it to F1, I will be the first deaf F1 driver.

    "Peterborough\u2019s Regional Pool was commissioned to be demolished this year.\nIt came after reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac) was found in the building in September 2023.\nThe facility on Bishop\u2019s Road also previously struggled with other issues which included structural cracking, out-of-date mechanical installations and damaged asbestos.\nThere are plans for a new pool but an outline business case would need to be submitted.\nA Freedom of Information request (FOI) revealed Peterborough City Council spent \u00a3200,000 on repairs in the past financial year.\nIn 2023-24, part of that money saw \u00a3104,000 spent on asbestos works and fan motors while \u00a350,000 was also spent on inspections and testing.\nThis was the largest influx of capital investment the pool had received since 2015-16.\nAside from this, a \u00a31m temporary car park was also established at the site on Bishop\u2019s Road and \u00a3275,000 was also spent \u2060in response to Legionella bacteria outbreaks last year.\nIn the last decade, the figures showed \u00a3723,349 was invested into the pool.\nA further \u00a3355,430 was spent on maintenance and repairs and \u00a3328,434 on inspections and testing in this period.\nThe average annual cost of maintenance and repairs has doubled - from an average of \u00a326,000 a year in 2015  to an average of \u00a357,000 in the last three financial years.\nThe council said it would cost them \u00a326.3m to repair the facility which was built in the 1970s.\nHowever, it is estimated a new pool could cost \u00a330m with demolition costs expecting to reach up to \u00a32.5m\nThe council said this cost would be offset by how much the value of the land the pool\u2019s built on increases and how much it will save on security and monitoring.\nLeader of the council, Mohammed Farooq said demolition work might take \"a few months\" to get under way.\nThe authority has pledged a new \u00a330m pool for the city, scheduled to be completed by 2028.\nIt would include a teaching pool, splash pool, cafe, sports hall, gym, clip and climb facility and soft play area.\nIt is expected that the council will award a contract between September 2025 and January 2026, and then building work would begin.\nJohn Howard, deputy leader and cabinet member for corporate governance and finance, said council officers had \"taken the time to carefully consider the options available\".\nHe said the new facility would \"serve the city well for decades to come and will attract people from far and wide\".\n\"That must be our aspiration, rather than placing a sticking plaster on what we have already,\" he explained.\nMr Farooq added he believed the council had \"taken the right decision\" and residents would be updated on the pool's progress.\nIn the meantime, modular pools which require no excavating, have been considered as an alternative.\nNo date has been confirmed for these pools yet.\nOpening season for the Peterborough Lido has also been extended to compensate for the loss of the Regional Pool. The Lido was kept open for the first time in its history during the winter last year.\nPreviously, Ben Negus, of the City of Peterborough Swimming Club, who practiced at the facility until it closed said building a new pool was \"the right decision\u201d.\n\u201cThe pool lasted over 10 years after its sell-by-date,\" he said.\n\"It has not been improved over the years and we need a new modern facility.\u201d\nMorgan Stevenson, co-chair of the City of Peterborough Swimming Club, told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: \"2028 is a long wait and we've seen plans and promises made in the past.\n\"The need now is for decisive action and tangible progress to deliver a facility for the now and the future needs of our growing city.\"\nFollow Peterborough news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Community leaders in Peebles are proposing to knock down their town-centre hub rather than face a \u00a31.8m repairs bill.\nPeebles Community Trust (PCT) bought the former church and ex-servicemen's club premises in 2019  for \u00a3200,000.\nDespite re-roofing the building, upgrading the electrics and installing insulation, further problems, including asbestos, dry-rot and rising damp, have been discovered.\nMichael Ireland, chair of PCT, said: \"I'm not ashamed of our investment in the building, but it is sensible to draw a line in the sand.\"\nPeebles Ex-Servicemen's Club bought the Templars Hall on School Brae just after their formation in 1922.\nThe building was considerably expanded during the late 1960s to cater for its increasing membership, and throughout the 70s and 80s it was regarded as one of the busiest venues in the Scottish Borders.\nFollowing the club's closure, a buy-out by the PCT attracted support from several funding providers.\nToday the building is home to the Peebles Ex-Servicemen's Pipe Band, a Men's Shed, the PCT's re-use sales room, and several other community organisations.\nMr Ireland added: \"We have invested a lot of public money in the existing building and I know that us now wanting to demolish it may be a problem for some people.\n\"But without the investment we have made so far, this building would be derelict, and a real eye-sore.\n\"While a lot of people will have emotional ties with the building, it isn't in keeping with the area, and our proposals provide the opportunity to have a building that does befit this conservation area.\"\nIt was during last year when plans were taking shape for installing a new heating and ventilation system, that additional problems around the building were identified.\nAlong with the new heating costs of \u00a3400,000, bills for the additional work came to just over \u00a31.4m.\nAn indicative cost for demolition and rebuilding of \u00a31.86m was provided by a separate contractor.\nPCT director Andy Wright said: \"We have managed to keep the lights on over the past five years, but it has already required a lot of repair work.\n\"The directors have now stepped back to try to find a better solution.\n\"We are now proposing to demolish the building and develop a new School Brae hub that is fit for the community and will remain fit for the next 50 years.\"\n\nSeveral options have been considered since the repair bill landed last year; including the closing up and selling of the building, handing it over to Scottish Borders Council, or creating a green space following demolition.\nBut the need for a hub is leading the PCT down the road of rebuilding.\nIf the demolition and rebuild plans win public approval, the PCT directors hope to draw up a development brief and launch an architectural design competition later this year.\nMr Wright added: \"While it has its structural challenges and doesn't look attractive, this is still a building that has a place in the community's hearts, so we are aware how sensitive the demolition proposals will be.\n\"However, so far the reaction has been entirely positive.\"\n\nThe PCT will hold an extraordinary meeting before the summer to assess public feedback.\nThey will then explore funding options for the project at the same time as launch the design competition.",

    "St Giles' Cathedral sits at the heart of Edinburgh's Old Town, an architectural anchor at the centre of Scotland's capital city.\nAlso known as the High Kirk, it has played a major part in many of Scotland's big moments. \nCelebrating its 900th year in 2024, the church has been the focus of historic and notable events from the 12th Century through to the death of the Queen in 2022.\nWe look back at some of its most interesting stories.\nAbout 30,000 people queued along the Royal Mile to file past the coffin of the late Queen after that memorable journey down from Balmoral.\nHer four children formed a guard of honour during the vigil. \nReverend Dr George Whyte, interim moderator of St Giles' Cathedral, said: \"I think we played a good part in allowing people to pay their respects and for Scotland to say thank you to her for 70 years of service.\"\nThe church was again at the centre of royal celebrations several months later, when King Charles returned to be presented with the Honours of Scotland.\nAlong with Queen Camilla, and the Duke and Duchess of Rothesay, they attended the National Service of Thanksgiving and Dedication.\nRev Whyte said even outside of these big events, the cathedral is a big attraction.\nHe said: \"We have one and a half million visitors a year across our doorstep.\n\"It costs money to run it and we are always thinking of how to balance the books.\n\"Volunteers play a large part. It's hectic at times and there are pressure points.\n\"If we can be useful and fulfil our function as a Christian presence in the middle of Scotland's capital, then I think we'll be doing the job.\"\nMany famous films have been set in or around St Giles'. \nBut few are bigger than a Marvel Studios blockbuster.\nOne Hollywood filmmaker wanted to remove the metal support structure which holds up the old stone ribs of the famous crown spire.\nSarah Phemister, head of culture and heritage at St Giles', said: \"Maybe the most surprising was our involvement in the Marvel film.\n\"We were in Avengers Infinity War and that was a really unusual experience.\"\nShe added: \"The location managers came up to the crown spire and were very interested in filming a fight scene, but were a little concerned about the metal structure which is basically holding up the spire and did request maybe we could remove it, just for the scene, and then pop it back.\n\"We did, very politely, explain that that probably would lead to the collapse of one of the most iconic bits of Edinburgh's skyline.\n\"So we had a complete replica roof in a warehouse somewhere in Leith for one of their dramatic fight scenes.\n\"It was a bit 'blink and you miss it' but we definitely did appear.\"\nIn 1911 the Thistle Chapel became home to the Knights of the Thistle - Scotland's ancient order of chivalry and nobility which still meets at St Giles'. \nA year later Edinburgh city clock firm James Ritchie donated a new clock mechanism to St Giles'. \nStephen Preston, former tower tour guide at the cathedral, said: ''Ritchie's came along and said we'd love to give you a new clock mechanism however we hate the clock faces so we'll do you a deal.\n\"We'll give you the clock mechanism for free if you take those ugly clock faces down.\n\"There have been no clock faces on St Giles' since but the bells chime every quarter hour.\nHe added: \"It tells you a bit early.\n\"It's almost, get ready for the time, and then, here's the time, on the last chime.\"\nIn the 19th Century, St Giles' Cathedral was restored under the guidance of William Chambers - the dictionaries publisher - who'd dreamt it should become 'Scotland's Westminster'. \nQueen Victoria sent a donation of \u00a3200 to the appeal fund but it took 16 years to demolish and rebuild and Chambers died in 1883 just three days before the grand re-opening service.\nGargoyles and grotesques were designed to scare off evil and protect those inside.\nIn 1798, a local newspaper recorded two golfers chipping balls up and over the cathedral. \nStephen Preston said: ''They claim they started in Parliament Square just behind us in the High Street and they found the golf balls in front in Advocates Close. \n\"Up and over - 50 metres, \" he said.\nIn 1637 - after the Union of the Crowns - King Charles I tried to unify the Scottish and English faiths and made St Giles\u2019 a cathedral. \nWhen he tried to impose a new prayer book in St Giles\u2019 it's said a local woman, Jenny Geddes, threw her stool at the preacher, starting a riot.\nThe church started out in the Catholic faith.\nJohn Knox converted St Giles's to Protestantism in 1559-60 after 400 years as a Catholic church - despite Scotland still having a Catholic monarch, Mary Queen of Scots.\nThe history of St Giles' dates all the way back in 1124 when King David I founded the church.\nThe Romanesque-designed building was constructed before most of the Old Town - before there was even an Abbey at Holyrood let alone a palace.\nIn the 14th Century, after the Scots signed the Declaration of Arbroath - a letter to the Pope affirming Scotland\u2019s independen",

    "Labour's deputy campaign coordinator says her party needs to rebuild trust with Muslim voters, amid an apparent backlash over its stance on Gaza.\nThe party's position on the Israel-Hamas war appears to have dented its support in Muslim areas in England's local elections.\nLabour's Ellie Reeves admitted it had \"a lot of work to do\" to rebuild support before the general election.\nShe added this included ensuring voters \"understand our position\".\nIn 58 local council wards analysed by the BBC, where more than one-in-five residents identify as Muslim, Labour's share of the vote was 21% down on 2021, the last time most seats were contested.\nIt was a downside to an otherwise positive performance for Labour, which saw it gain more than 170 councillors to take control of eight councils.\nThe potential impact on a general election is unclear, however, with some evidence the biggest drops in support are largely confined to areas where the party's support was already very strong.\nAnd there are signs that any adverse reaction was less prominent in London, where incumbent Labour mayor Sadiq Khan called for a ceasefire before the party leadership did.\nLabour's vote is up by three points on average in parts of London where more than 15% identify as Muslim, compared with 4.5% where the proportion is less than this.\nLabour called for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza conflict in February, after months of wrangling over its position.\nIts initial stance after the war began, in which it called for humanitarian pauses in the fighting, prompted Labour resignations in councils and from its frontbench last year.\nThe decline in its vote share in areas with a big Muslim population appears to have been largely to the benefit of independent candidates standing in those areas.\nAli Milani, chair of Labour Muslim Network, said Labour's positioning on Gaza \"is going to have a serious electoral consequence\".\n\"If I was a Labour MP in Bradford or Birmingham or Leicester or parts of London or Manchester I would be seriously concerned,\" he added.\nThe Greens, who called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" just over a week after the war began, have also increased their share of the vote from 2021.\nCo-leader Carla Denyer said Labour's stance on the conflict had been the \"final straw\" for some Labour supporters who were already disappointed by policy U-turns in other areas.\n\"I have met many voters on doorsteps who brought it up proactively as an issue,\" she added.\nShe also said \"part of the Muslim community switching their votes\" was also a factor in Newcastle, where the Greens gained their first-ever seats on the city council.\nOn Sunday, recently re-elected Worthing Councillor and Momentum co-chair Hilary Schan resigned from Labour in order to support pro-Palestinian candidates from other parties - and she has joined journalist Owen Jones's We Deserve Better campaign.\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast on Saturday, Ellie Reeves said: \"We know that we've got a great deal of work to do to rebuild trust with Muslim communities.\n\"I understand people's concerns about what's happening in Gaza. The loss of life there has been intolerable - that's why we have called an immediate ceasefire\".\nShe added that \"a lot of listening needs to be done,\" and the party also needed to make sure voters \"understand our position\".\nLabour's national election co-ordinator Pat McFadden echoed her, telling the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the situation in the Middle East was a \"high foreign policy priority\" for Labour, if it was elected.\n\"The better lives that people want for the Palestinian people is something the Labour leadership shares,\" he said.\nHe acknowledged that in some parts of the country, the conflict was proving a problem for Labour and said: \"There will be some people who maybe voted Labour in the past who haven't in the local elections because of this issue and where that's the case we'll work to get people's support back.\"\nIn the West Midlands mayoral race, independent candidate Akhmed Yakoob, who campaigned on Gaza, won over 69,000 votes.\nIn Blackburn with Darwen, Labour lost council seats to independent candidates who quit the party over the leadership's Gaza stance.\nIt also faced a surge from pro-Palestinian independents in Bradford, where the Labour council leader said Gaza had been a \"big issue\". \nThe local party leader in Oldham said the conflict was a factor there, where Labour lost overall control of the council, but also blamed a wider unhappiness with \"mainstream parties\".\nGeorge Galloway's strongly pro-Palestinian Workers Party of Britain won four seats - two in Rochdale, one in Calderdale and one in Manchester, where they ousted the Labour deputy leader of the council Luthfur Rahman.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 253 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 34,500 people have been killed in Gaza since th",

    "Lincolnshire Police's former Assistant Chief Constable, Kerrin Wilson, said misogynistic male cliques within the force must be dismantled, to stop claims from female victims being covered up. \nIt comes as figures obtained by the BBC show Lincolnshire Police has investigated its own officers and staff 52 times for sexual offences and violence against women, since 2018. \nOnly six cases resulted in a charge or court summons. \nLincolnshire Police said it would investigate all allegations against its officers, regardless of what rank or position they hold. \nKerrin Wilson retired after 30 years in policing in 2022, spending her last four in one of the most senior roles at Lincolnshire Police. \nShe claimed allegations about male officers would sometimes be ignored: \"Internally, domestic abuse has gone on, and quite often you'll get an old boys' network, which will try to cover it up, and sweep it under the carpet,\" she said.\nMrs Wilson added: \"I've been subjected to those sorts of networks, trying to silence things that I've wanted to raise previously.\"\nShe said the culture often makes it difficult for victims to come forward.\n\"If people are telling you that it's not a serious issue, if it's a one-off, that he's such a good guy, and that he's got a strong network, then you will, certainly as a female officer, feel very intimidated by all that, because it's not spoken about.\n\"I think a lot more people need to talk about it, and that male, misogynistic culture that exists in some cliques within Lincolnshire police, need to be dismantled.\u201d\nOne woman has spoken exclusively to the BBC about her controlling relationship with a Lincolnshire police officer.\nChloe (not her real name) said she had no idea what was to come.\n\"At first he just seemed to say all the right things, and was really attentive, calling me, making me laugh, he was really charismatic,\" she said.\n\"Things started to change when our relationship developed more. \n\"He became very short tempered with me and [would] snap at me for very insignificant things, sometimes for the way I ate, and he would accuse me of saying or doing things that I hadn't done.\"\n\nChloe said she faced increasing levels of aggression.\n\"In the end I couldn't go a day without him having some kind of outburst and screaming at me,\" she said.\n\"He used to stand in my space, shout in my face, and I was always in fear that he was going to physically hurt me.\n\"He would convince me that it was my behaviour that had made him that way. So, I became very meek and mild.\"\nThe officer warned Chloe not to go to Lincolnshire Police about him, saying her  complaint would go nowhere. She did eventually report him, but her case was not investigated. \nShe said she is still dealing with what happened to her.\n\"I found the whole experience quite traumatic. \n\"I think like many victims, you sometimes feel like, if you haven't got the physical scars, you sometimes feel like you might have imagined it, or that actually your experience isn't that bad.\"\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this story, information and support is available via the BBC Action Line.\nUsing a Freedom of Information request, the BBC discovered that between 2018 and 2023, Lincolnshire Police investigated its own officers and staff 52 times for sexual offence allegations and violence against women and girls.\nFive cases resulted in a charge, and one in a court summons.\nOne officer was investigated nine times for offences including attempted murder and rape, yet no criminal action was taken.  \nHe was barred from policing following a misconduct hearing. \nDet Ch Insp Paul Coleman, from Lincolnshire Police's professional standards department said while an officer may be disciplined through internal misconduct proceedings, it is more difficult to bring criminal charges for offences such as coercive control.  \n\"Very often the charging thresholds for such offences is actually high,\" he said\n\"So while it's right we look into these matters, very often, controlling and coercive isn't charged, because actually, the evidence isn't there.\"\nMr Coleman claimed that the force is taking positive steps to change its culture.\n\"I'm personally appalled at some of the behaviours and examples that I've seen of how women have been treated, and I think it's up to me and every other man in the organisation to make sure that doesn't happen,\" he said.\n\"In regards to male cliques, I agree that they shouldn't be existing and actually, if they are, then it's my job and the job of my team and others actually, to make sure that doesn't.\n\"I think everybody would agree that we haven't always got it right in the past and I don't think we should hide away from that.  \n\"We need to admit there's a problem before we can change it, and we are are moving in the right direction.\"\nSarah Everard was abducted, raped and murdered by Met officer, Wayne Couzens, in March 2021. \nAn independent inquiry lead by Lady Elish Angiolini found that a radical overhaul of police vetting a",

    "Andy Street has said he is not putting the blame elsewhere for losing the West Midlands mayoral election.\nThe Tory incumbent, who had held the role for seven years, lost by just 1,508 votes to Labour's Richard Parker on Saturday.\nThe Conservatives lost more than 450 council seats in England this week. When asked if he believed the blame for him losing the mayoral election lay with the Conservative party, Mr Street told the BBC: \"I can't have it both ways\". \nHe added: \"We ran this election very much as my campaign. So ultimately what one has to say is I didn't persuade enough people to have confidence in our plans for the future.\"\nThe former mayor said he was \"gutted\" to have lost the election and that he was now going to take time to reflect.\n\"I'm the type of person who's given everything to this job, I think everyone would acknowledge that,\" he said.\n\"Now it's no longer, there it's an obvious time in life to pause, reflect, decide.\"\nHe added: \"I love the job but also I genuinely thought that the mayoralty [and] the combined authority were doing good things for the region and the region was coming stronger through it. \n\"It was my privilege to lead this region, an honour, you might say. I do feel gutted that that is not to continue.\"\nWhen asked if he could perceive the electoral results as a \"very near victory\", Mr Street replied: \"I feel very, very proud of what we've done over the last seven years...but also I feel incredibly proud of the Conservative team across the West Midlands.\n\"To get within 1,500 votes of the Labour Party when Labour is ascendant across the national polls in an area that many would say is their backyard, I think is an incredible achievement by my team so I do feel very, very proud of them.\"\nWhen asked if the campaign had relied too much on \"Brand Andy\", Craig Tracey, the Conservative MP for North Warwickshire, told BBC Politics Midlands he had not got that impression.\nMr Tracey said: \"I don't think there was any complacency at any point and we put in a big shift for him, from the parliamentary party but also the voluntary party and councillors.\n\"If you look at Andy Burnham's win in Manchester, he said it's about places not politics, so I think for a mayoral election, you can go on that one person.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The owners of a fiberglass puffin that has stood outside a bookshop for more than 50 years have launched a campaign to get him restored.\nThe Book House in Thame, Oxfordshire, has appealed for pictures taken of the puffin over the years.\nThey hope the beloved bird, known as Fat Puffin, could get a makeover on BBC programme The Repair Shop.\nLuise Pattinson said previously unseen photos could show how \"fundamental\" it had been to the town.\nMrs Pattinson, who runs the shop with brother-in-law Brian Pattinson, said: \"He is so special, he's quite embedded in the history of Puffin Books and the history of the town, so he's a very special gentleman indeed.\"\nFat Puffin, who measures more than 1m high (3.2ft), was gifted to the shop by Puffin Books in 1972, as it was one of the few children's bookstores in the country.\nBut his condition has deteriorated over the years through wear and tear, being knocked over and a kidnapping by students in 1984, which left him dangling from the town hall by a rope. \n\"They presented us with a demand for \u00a33m which we promptly paid and he was returned,\" Mr Pattinson joked.\nHe no longer has his wooden plinth, part of his foot has broken off and his head is prone to toppling, despite attempts to mend him with car repair kits.\n\"He's had too many bumps,\" Mrs Pattinson explained.\n\"His head cracked open once and he had a big split which we tried to repair ourselves.\n\"When we shook out all the ballast we found a load of money so people obviously thought he was an RSPB collecting box when he had the split in his head.\n\"So he's all chipped and all his joints are now creaking and splitting, so he needs a really good makeover because he's just breaking apart bless him.\"\nFat Puffin used to be sighted outside the shop with a fellow puffin called Muffin, who he \"married\" in 2004. \nMrs Pattinson said: \"They're celebrating their 20th wedding anniversary this year. \n\"Poor old Muffin is not quite as heavy and portly, so she abandoned her place by the front door quite a while ago because she had a tendency to fly off down the High Street with every puff of wind, and wasn't quite so stable.\n\"Fat Puffin needs very clever reconstruction, which we just can't do, so we think The Repair Shop team might be able to repair him, and hopefully Muffin too so they can be reunited.\"\nIn order to make an application to the programme she is \"really hoping for pictures people have taken over the years - the older the better really - to prove how much a part of everyone's lives he's been\". \nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

    "Yeovil Hospital's existing stroke services in Somerset will not be reduced until their replacements over the border in Dorset are ready, health bosses have confirmed.\nPlans were approved in January to remove the hyper-acute stroke unit (HASU), meaning the most urgent stroke patients would be transported to either Dorchester or Taunton for treatment.\nResidents on either side of the border were concerned the new unit at Dorset County Hospital would not be ready before Yeovil's existing HASU had shut down.\nHealth bosses have now provided assurances that none of Yeovil's existing provision would be closed until the new unit in Dorchester was ready to go.\nNHS Somerset's Integrated Care Board (ICB) voted to have a single emergency stroke unit for the county at Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton.\nUnder the ICB plans, Yeovil District Hospital will keep 12 acute stroke beds where people can be cared for from 72 hours after a stroke, but it will lose its four hyper-acute beds.\nThe ICB said the change would lead to \"better outcomes for patients\".\nWest Dorset MP Chris Loder, whose constituency includes Dorset County Hospital, met NHS Somerset bosses last week after writing a letter setting out his \"significant reservations\" about the proposals.\nFollowing the discussions, a spokesman for NHS Somerset told the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS): \"The changes agreed will take 18 months to implement.\n\"The process will make sure that the services needed (at Dorset County Hospital) will be ready to go, before emergency stroke services at Yeovil move.\"\nCouncillor Adam Dance, who is standing to be the next MP of Yeovil, said he shared Mr Loder's concerns and would keep up the pressure on the Department of Health and Social Care to re-examine the changes.\nHe said: \"I would prefer that he was demanding, as I am, an answer to why relocate the HASU to Dorchester, when we could just reinvest at Yeovil?\"\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and, X.

    "An initiative to train homeless shelter residents in barbering skills in Devon has recruited its first trainees.\nSisters Abi and Anna, tenants of St Petrock's, a homeless charity in Exeter, said they were the first sign-ups to an initiative by Hair at the Academy (HATA), a hairdressing school.\nThe siblings said they were both keen to \"thrive and make something of themselves\".\nHATA said it has been working with homeless people offering free haircuts.\nHairdresser Rhi Belcher, who is leading the training, said she and HATA founder Mary Pugsley MBE were approached by community interest firm Hair in the Community with the idea. \nMs Belcher said the six-month programme meant trainees could go \"from education to employment\", alongside gaining a mental health awareness certificate. \nTrainee Anna, 21, said she had spent her life \"in the care system\", while she had experienced homelessness twice in the last two years, staying in hotels and moving around each time. \nShe said her dream job would be to \"own a van and make coffee, travelling around the world\" - but the training could turn her vision into one of \"coffee and cuts\".\nReferring to periods of separation from her sister, Anna added: \"I'm glad that we got back together and we live together because we both want to thrive in our lives and make something of ourselves.\"\nAbi said she was \"really grateful\" for the opportunity to work alongside each other. \nOrganisers said the scheme was a \"beacon of hope\" for individuals seeking to rebuild their lives.\nMs Belcher said: \"A lot of the people who find themselves living on the streets, when they look in the mirror, don't recognise the person looking back.\n\"So when you can take them back to maybe the bricklayer that used to have a skin fade, and that's who they can see in the mirror again, it gives them that extra little lease of life and hope again.\"\nShe said chatting to clients could be \"eye-opening\", including tales of trouble, hardship, but also of \"real achievement and hope and strength\".\n\"I think it's nice just to be seen and heard at the same time by a complete stranger,\" she added.\nFollow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "A tangle of bramble thickets and a barbed wire fence now surround the crumbling walls of Viewhill House.\nIt has sat as a ruin in the heart of Inverness since a devastating fire 17 years ago, but it was not always such a forlorn sight.\nIt was once an elegant villa, built by local engineer Joseph Mitchell in 1835, with a stunning outlook over the River Ness.\nMany people have happy memories of staying there when it was a youth hostel in the second half of the 20th Century and there are still hopes that it could be restored.\nDonnie Aird was a teenager when his parents became hostel wardens in the 1950s.\nHe said it was a big change living at Viewhill House, which he remembers as a \u201cbuzzing place\u201d with a friendly atmosphere.\n\u201cIt was a hive of activity in the summertime with people from all over the world,\" he said.\n\"There would often be a queue at the office, sometimes even all the way down the steps leading to the main street with people waiting patiently to book in and hoping they\u2019d get a bed.\u201d\nFacilities were basic, with segregated male and female dormitories, and guests were allocated a chore to do in the morning.\nAnd like other hostels there was a strict curfew.\nDonnie said: \u201cYou had to be in by 10 o'clock. Almost everyone kept to the curfew but there was the odd occasion when people were found trying to get in through windows.\"\nPets were not allowed but Donnie says people smuggled them in - and did not always take them home with them.\nHe says: \u201cI remember at least three dogs being left behind. \n\"There was one dog that was just a tiny puppy and my parents kept him for years. He was named Dormie because he was found in the dormitory.\u201d\nMany people visited the hostel while hitchhiking or cycling round Scotland.\nMaggie Roger stayed there in 1968 and 1969 while on summer cycling tours with her Dutch friend Ebba.\nThe teenagers set off from Bridge of Weir getting as far afield as Ullapool, Skye and Aberdeen on their trips.\nMaggie, who is still a keen cyclist, vividly remembers a sense of freedom.\nShe said: \u201cWe left my parents\u2019 house with nobody else watching us.\n\"We had hooters on the front of our bikes rather than bells and we used to hoot at everybody. \n\"Cars would go past us and they\u2019d toot their horns and we hoot back at them and we\u2019d see them again three or four days later. It was so much fun.\u201d\nOn their second trip to the hostel they got a warm welcome from the warden.\n\u201cShe remembered us and she let us stay even though she hadn\u2019t really enough room. I just remember her being so friendly,\u201d said Maggie.\nMaggie said it is sad to see the site since the fire, which hit when the property was vacant.\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s just weeds and trees and a fallen down house. \n\"It is a shame it has been left for so many years and yes, it might be nice to preserve it but who is going to preserve it and how long is that going to take \u2013 another 17 years?\u201d\nJoseph Mitchell, who built Viewhill House in the 1830s, started his working life as an apprentice of renowned engineer Thomas Telford.\nDespite humble origins Mitchell achieved great things, including designing the first railway connection between Inverness and Perth, which sceptics had said was impossible.\nConservation architect Calum MacLean believes it is still possible to save the engineer's former home, which is owned by Magnus Properties. \nHe would like to see a small museum in part of the restored B-listed building dedicated to Mitchell who he describes as one of the \"founding fathers of Inverness.\"\nHe said: \u201cHe has an enormous legacy and it's a story we really should be celebrating.\" \nCalum added: \u201cIt is a testament to Joseph Mitchell\u2019s engineering skills that it is still standing. \n\"But every year that it is left without a roof it is going to become a bigger and bigger technical challenge to conserve and restore the building.\u201d\nThe weather is already taking its toll.\nStorms during the winter of 2021-22 blew down part of a wall and Calum fears there could be further uncontrolled collapses.\nHe said: \u201cThat would be the worst outcome of all and we would lose a lot of the original material. \n\"Ideally we want to start to record all these stones, store them safely, so that when the opportunity comes to rebuild we have all the material there to do it.\u201d\nHighland Council said its building standards team continued to monitor the site.\nA spokesperson said: \"The building is in private ownership, and while the council has supported the Highland Historic Buildings Trust and others to look at various options, the site is extremely challenging to develop and with limited public funding available, the council cannot develop this site.\n\u201cThe council would, however, welcome discussion with the owners and others to consider options.\u201d\nBBC Scotland has attempted to contact Magnus Properties.",
    "Bunkers are a visible reminder of the Channel Islands' Nazi Occupation and, at one coastal fortification, footprints of a small child set into the concrete are an islander's lasting link back to that time.\nTony Hobbs was three-and-a-half years old when German forces landed in Guernsey in June 1940. \nNow 87, his memories of that time are still clear.\nDuring the building of a coastal bunker, built on the island as part of Hitler's Atlantic Wall, he was taken to the top and left his footprints in the drying concrete.\nTwo days before the start of five years of occupation, three German planes bombed St Peter Port Harbour as trucks were lined up on the quayside - the majority were carrying tomatoes for export.\nThirty-four people were killed and 33 were injured in the attack on 28 June 1940, which saw 49 vehicles damaged or destroyed.\nMr Hobbs remembers watching from his home at Salerie Corner, as the planes came in and bombed the trucks lined up at the White Rock and as horses fled without their riders, dragging their carts behind them.\n\nThe next day he said what was to be his final goodbye to his father as he went off on the lifeboat.\nHarold Hobbs was part of the Guernsey lifeboat crew that was tasked with collecting up the Jersey lifeboat to take it to England, because the authorities did not want it to fall into enemy hands.\nAs the lifeboat had been approaching Jersey, it was attacked by a German plane and Mr Hobbs senior was killed. \nAfter his father's death, Tony Hobbs, his mother and grandfather moved to take over an empty family house at L\u2019Islet for the duration of the occupation.\nThe family had decided life might be safer in the countryside than in the main town of St Peter Port.\nHis mother took on the job of washing clothes for some of the German officers in return for food and his grandfather befriended some of the German soldiers.\nMr Hobbs said: \"My grandfather had a bit of a laugh because they were speaking in a Yorkshire accent, and they told my grandfather that during the First World War they were captured in one of the first battles and spent the best part of four years up in Yorkshire.\n\"One day, they asked me if I\u2019d like to go on top of the bunker. So, I climbed the ladder, and the bunker was just finished so I stood right on the very edge of it.\"\nWith the concrete still drying, his feet left imprints.\nMr Hobbs said: \"I remember going up on the ladder. My grandfather told me that they found a ladder from somewhere and they went up and stood beside me. I was only three inches from falling over the top.\"\nIt was some time before he went back up to see them again: \"I kept saying for 60 years I\u2019m going up there one day.\n\"And then one day I bought an old van and it had a roof rack and my wife said 'put your ladder on top'.\n\"So that\u2019s what I did. I put the ladder on top and I went up and that was 20 years ago.\"\nThe bunker is currently owned by the Liberation Group and sits on the land alongside the Puffin and Oyster restaurant, overlooking Grand Havre Bay.\nBy BBC Guernsey communities reporter Isla Blatchford\nI got permission from the bunker's owners to see if the footprints had survived the past 80-plus years. Tony joined the search from the ground via a video call.\nI certainly didn\u2019t have the confidence of a young Tony as I climbed up the ladder. \nMy knees were knocking as I stepped on to the roof. I was OK once I was up and the view certainly helped. There can\u2019t be many people who have looked at Grand Havre from that vantage point.\nMy nerves - and the workplace risk assessment - didn\u2019t let me get too close to the edge but I could see that the footprints Tony had said should be there, no longer were. The concrete had worn smooth.\nBut, further in, I spotted a little footprint, highlighted by the small amount of dirt filling it. Alongside it, there was another. Small enough to be a child\u2019s. I was happy and relieved to show them to Tony again.\nI\u2019m privileged to have seen the mark he made on history and to have heard his stories of life during the occupation.\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "The US has opened a new inquiry into troubled jet firm Boeing, after the company told air safety regulators that it might not have properly inspected its 787 Dreamliner planes. \nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it would look into whether staff had falsified records.\nIt said Boeing was re-inspecting all 787 jets on the manufacturing line.\nBoeing will be forced to develop an \"action plan\" to address concerns about planes already in service, it added. \nBoeing did not comment.\nInternally, the company told staff last week that the \"misconduct\" had not created an \"immediate safety of flight issue\", according to a message seen by BBC News.\n\"We quickly reviewed the matter and learned that several people had been violating company policies by not performing a required test, but recording the work as having been completed,\" Scott Stocker, head of the Boeing 787 program, said in the email to staff.\nThe FAA said that Boeing had come forward \"voluntarily\" last month to warn that it \"may not have completed\" inspections required to confirm adequate electrical safeguards where the wings join the main body of certain of its 787 Dreamliners, a large jet often used on international flights.\n\"The FAA is investigating whether Boeing completed the inspections and whether company employees may have falsified aircraft records,\" it said.\n\"As the investigation continues, the FAA will take any necessary action - as always - to ensure the safety of the flying public.\" \nIt is the latest problem to erupt at Boeing in recent years. In January, an unused emergency exit door blew off a new 737 Max 9 plane shortly after take-off, thrusting its manufacturing and safety processes into the spotlight.\nThe incident prompted the temporary grounding of dozens of planes and has forced the firm to drastically slow production, while sparking increased regulatory oversight, criminal investigation and other legal and financial troubles.\nIn March, chief executive Dave Calhoun said he would be stepping down by the end of the year, becoming the most high-profile person to exit the company in the wake of the incident.  \nBoeing's reputation had been damaged a few years ago, when two of its 737 Max planes crashed within five months of each other, claiming the lives of 346 passengers and crew. A 737 Max flown by Ethiopian Airlines aircraft crashed shortly after take-off in March, 2019, following a Lion Air crash in October 2018. That led to the then chief executive Dennis Muilenburg being fired. \nLast month, Congress hosted a hearing featuring whistleblowers, including Sam Salehpour who testified that his concerns about the 787 had been dismissed. \nBoeing has said it is working to reform its corporate culture to encourage people who see problems to speak out, with a \"more than 500% increase\" in reports from employees since January.",
    "Hamas says it has informed Qatari and Egyptian mediators that it has accepted their proposal for a new Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal with Israel.\n\"The ball is now in Israel's court,\" an official in the Palestinian group said.\nIsraeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said the proposal accepted by Hamas was \"far from Israel's basic requirements\" but negotiations would continue.\nEarlier Israel carried out air strikes on Rafah after warning Palestinians to evacuate parts of the city.\nIt has long threatened an offensive against Hamas hold-outs in the southern city. \nTens of thousands of residents are believed to be affected by the operation and many were seen cramming into vehicles or on to donkey carts on Monday.\nA Hamas official called the evacuation order for eastern parts of Rafah, which was followed by Israeli air strikes, a \"dangerous escalation\".\nThe basis of the ceasefire deal is a weeks-long pause in fighting and the release of several dozen hostages held by Hamas.\nOn Monday evening, Hamas put out a statement saying its political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, had informed Qatar's prime minister and Egypt's intelligence chief of its \"approval of their proposal regarding a ceasefire agreement\".\nA senior Palestinian official familiar with the proposal told the BBC that Hamas had agreed to end \"hostile activity forever\" if the conditions were met. \nThat phrase hinted that Hamas might be contemplating the end of its armed struggle, although no further details were provided. It would come at the conclusion of a two-phase ceasefire deal, with each phase lasting 42 days.\nThe first phase would include the release of the female Israeli soldiers being held hostage, each in exchange for 50 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, including some who are serving life sentences.\nDuring this period, Israeli troops would remain within Gaza. But within 11 days of the ceasefire coming into force, Israel would begin dismantling its military facilities in the centre of the territory and would withdraw from Salah al-Din Road, which is the main north-south route, and the coastal road.\nAfter 11 days, displaced Palestinians would be allowed to return to the north.\nThe second phase would conclude with a \"sustainable long period of calm\" and the complete lifting of the blockade of Gaza, according to the official.\n\"The ball is now in the court of [Israel], whether it will agree to the ceasefire agreement or obstruct it,\" a senior Hamas official told AFP news agency.\nThe were celebrations in Gaza as news of the Hamas statement spread.\nBut an unnamed Israeli official swiftly told Reuters news agency that the proposal Hamas had accepted was a \"softened\" version of an Egyptian proposal which included \"far-reaching\" conclusions that Israel could not accept. \n\"This would appear to be a ruse intended to make Israel look like the side refusing a deal,\" the official said.\nLater, Prime Minister Netanyahu's office said in a statement: \"Even though the Hamas proposal is far from Israel's basic requirements, Israel will send a delegation of mediators to exhaust the possibility of reaching an agreement under conditions acceptable to Israel.\"\nAt the same time, Israel's war cabinet had decided to continue the Rafah operation \"to exert military pressure on Hamas to advance our war aims: the release of our hostages, destroy Hamas's military and governing capabilities and ensure that Gaza does not pose a threat to Israel in the future\", it added.\nThe statement came at the same time as the Israeli military announced it was striking Hamas targets in eastern Rafah.\nUS state department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters that the US - which is attempting to broker a deal along with Qatar and Egypt - was reviewing Hamas's response and \"discussing it with our partners\".\n\"We continue to believe that a hostage deal is in the best interests of the Israeli people. It's in the best interests of the Palestinian people,\" he added. \n\"It would bring an immediate ceasefire. It would allow increased movement of humanitarian assistance and so we're going to continue to work to try to reach one.\"\nThe war began when Hamas gunmen stormed into southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages. \nMore than 34,700 people have been killed in Gaza during the ensuing Israeli military campaign, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nA deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. \nIsrael says 128 hostages remain unaccounted for in Gaza, at least 34 of whom are presumed dead.",
    "When Karan Shah, 32, goes to vote in the western state of Gujarat, he and his 59-year-old mother will be armed with water bottles and fruit to beat the heat. To escape long queues, they plan to reach the polling station early in the morning.\nMr Shah and his mother are among millions of Indians who will cast their ballots in the third phase of the general election on Tuesday, when 94 constituencies across 12 states go to the polls.\nIndia's general election is usually held every five years in April and May, and voters and polling officials are used to dealing with the harsh summer heat. But this year, India - along with other parts of Asia - is experiencing one of its hottest summers on record, in line with recent years. Last month, at least nine people died due to heat-related issues as searing temperatures hit the country.\nIn April, federal minister Nitin Gadkari fainted while addressing a campaign rally in the western state of Maharashtra, later explaining that the crowded venue and high temperature had made him feel uneasy. Days before that, in the eastern city of Kolkata where temperatures soared above 43C, a television anchor passed out while presenting weather updates. She later said that the studio had become extremely hot as its cooling systems had failed.\nAnd there is no respite in sight - India's weather department has predicted longer and more intense heatwaves in May.\nElection authorities are taking steps to address this by supplying drinking water in polling booths and extending voting timings. \nBut some experts have speculated that the extreme temperatures may be impacting voter turnout. \nIn an interview last week with India Today news channel, N Gopalaswami, a former chief election commissioner, said that the heat \"may have had a role\" to play in lower voter numbers this year. Compared with the 2019 election, the first two phases of polling held on 19 April and 26 April saw at least a 3% dip each in voter turnout. \nMr Gopalaswami also suggested that a tweak to polling schedules in the long term - holding elections between the cooler months of February and March - might encourage more people to vote.\nPolitical parties, too, have been tweaking their campaign schedules this year due to the heat. Last week, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker Rajeshwar Singh told local media that party workers were visiting voters' homes only in the mornings and evenings, while afternoon meetings were being held indoors.\nDr Amit P Gawnde, a pulmonologist, says that spending long hours in the heat can lead to an electrolyte imbalance, which in turn can cause fatigue, dizziness and blackouts.\n\"Patients with comorbidities, like heart ailments or high blood pressure, face a higher risk of experiencing heat-related problems,\" he says.\nVoters say they are apprehensive about the heat but will take precautions.\nSukhada Khandge, who lives in Pune district in Maharashtra state, says that she will cover her face and body when she steps out to vote on Tuesday. \nPune is one of the hottest regions in Maharashtra, which will vote in two more phases on 13 and 20 May. For the past week, Pune has been experiencing temperatures between 39C and 42C and weather officials say this is likely to continue in the coming days.\nMs Khandge says she will vote early in the morning to avoid crowds and the heat.\nIn the western state of Gujarat - where polling will be held in 26 constituencies on Tuesday - Dipakumar Hasmukhbhai Patel says he aims to travel to his polling booth in Surat city on his motorbike in the morning.\n\"Towards the afternoon, it gets so hot that you have to travel by car,\" he says, adding that he is aware that one can get a heatstroke or suffer from dehydration if not careful.\nDeepika Jigar Tumdawala, 31, who is also from Surat, says that she finds voting during this time of the year uncomfortable, especially since she lives in an industrial area and the fumes from factories add to the heat.\n\"But voting is my democratic right so I'll brave the heat and go and vote,\" she adds.\nApprehension about the heat are likely to persist among voters in the coming weeks as well.\nIn the southern state of Telangana, which is set to vote on 13 May in the fourth phase, the scorching heat has already become a topic of conversation.\nPratibha, 40, who uses only one name, told BBC Telugu that she suffered a heatstroke just days ago and was experiencing severe headaches.\n\"It is difficult to come out to vote in these temperatures. It is going to be challenging to take elderly people to the polling stations. Polling should start earlier for them,\" she said, adding that she plans to take her 70-year-old mother to vote early in the morning. \nFor the first time this year, the Election Commission - which oversees elections in the country - has allowed people older than 85 years and those with disabilities to vote from their homes. The commission also issued guidelines in March to minimise the impact of heat on the elections.\nIt instructed electoral off",
    "Three tourists found dead in Mexico were shot in the head and their bodies dumped in a well, authorities have confirmed.\nOfficials believe the men were attacked trying to stop the theft of their pickup truck.\nAustralian brothers Jake and Callum Robinson, 30 and 33, and their American friend Jack Carter Rhoad, 30, disappeared on 27 April while on a surfing trip in Ensenada.\nRelatives of the three men identified their bodies on Sunday after travelling to Mexico to assist authorities, a state prosecutor said.\nThe attackers wanted the vehicle for its tyres and shot the tourists when they resisted, Baja California state prosecutor Maria Andrade suggested.\nTheir bodies were found in a 4m (15ft) deep well about 6km (4 miles) from the site of the attack in the town of Santo Tom\u00e1s on Friday.\nAbandoned tents, a burnt white pickup truck and a phone linked to the missing surfers were found nearby.\nA fourth body was found in the well, but had been there longer and was unconnected to the case, officials said.\nTwo men and a woman have been detained on suspicion of direct or indirect involvement in the attack. One man with a previous criminal record has been charged with \"forced disappearance\".\nEarlier, the FBI said it was looking into the case and was in touch with international partners. \nBaja California is one of Mexico\u2019s most violent states, as local drug gangs fight turf wars.\nIn 2023, it had the country's second highest murder rate, after the state of Guanajuato, according to official figures. \nNational Defence Secretary Luis Cresencio Sandoval said earlier this year that 85-90% of murders committed in Baja California were linked to drug trafficking and organised crime. \nBut the Ensenada area, about 120km (75 miles) south of the US-Mexico border and known for its surfing conditions, is considered safer and has long attracted tourists from California.\nThe brothers' parents - Deborah and Martin Robinson - said Callum had been living in the US, chasing his dream of becoming a professional lacrosse player.\nJake was on \"the trip of lifetime\" to visit him before starting a new job in Victoria as a doctor, they said on Friday.\n\u201cCallum and Jake are beautiful human beings. We love them so much and this breaks our heart.\u201d\nFriends of the brothers have also flooded social media with tributes.\nCallum's teammates at Stevenson University Lacrosse club said the athlete was a larger-than-life personality.\n\"With his beautiful long hair and charming smile, he truly embodied the nickname \u2018big koala\u2019 - warm, friendly, and always there to lend a helping hand,\" a statement from the club said.\nHis girlfriend, Emily Horwath, said her heart was \"shattered into a million pieces\". \n\"I don\u2019t have the words right now... I will love you forever,\" she wrote in a post on Instagram, alongside pictures of the couple.\nCarter Rhoad's social media accounts showed happy snaps of him proposing to his partner less than a year ago.\nA fundraiser set up by friends of his family said he and the Robinson brothers had \"brought immeasurable joy, love, and kindness\" to the world.\nAustralian Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the country was thinking of the Robinson family.\n\"It has been an absolutely horrendous, absolutely horrific ordeal and our thoughts are with all of them today,\u201d he said at a news conference on Monday.\nThe killings have sparked fear and anger in the Ensenada region.\nScores of protesters marched through the city on Sunday, carrying surfboards plastered with slogans written in Spanish.\n\u201cThey only wanted to surf - we demand safe beaches,\" one said. \"Australia we are with you,\" another said.\nA group of surfers later performed a \u201cpaddle-out\u201d ceremony, an ocean vigil to honour the trio.\nIt is not the first time that Australian surfers have been killed while holidaying in Mexico. \nIn 2016, Dean Lucas and Adam Coleman were murdered in north-western Sinaloa state when they fought back during an attempted robbery. \nTheir bodies were found in their burnt-out camper van weeks later.\nOn X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, Mexico\u2019s foreign ministry said that Mexico\u2019s ambassador to Australia had traveled to Baja California to work with Australian consular officials and help the families of the victims.\nState Department figures show that at least 1.6 million US citizens live in Mexico, which is also the top destination for US tourists globally, with more than 30 million visitors in 2022.\nIn 2022 - the last year for which State Department data is fully available - 192 Americans died in Mexico, of which 46 were ruled as homicides.",
    "High visitor numbers are turning one of Britain's most scenic lakes green, researchers say.\nA report funded by the UK space agency suggests a link between peak tourist periods and algal blooming at Windermere in the Lake District.\nAlgal blooming is caused by warm temperatures and nutrients, and can make the water green and toxic.\nCampaigners are linking the blooms to discharges of sewage, which although mostly treated, are nutrient-rich. \nUnited Utilities, the local water company, insists its wastewater plants can cope with peak tourist periods. \nWindermere is England's largest lake and one of the country's most popular natural attractions. \nBut in recent years, the normally clear water has been turning green due to algal blooming, particularly during the summer. Blooming is the rapid growth of algae and can lead to reduced oxygen levels in the water, killing fish and aquatic life. \nRichard Flemmings from the environmental data company Map Impact, has been trying to work out why. He wanted to study whether the blooms are just the inevitable consequence of climate change and hotter, drier summers, or whether human discharges are also playing a role. \nBoth treated and untreated sewage discharges contain heightened levels of the key blooming nutrient phosphorus, from both human excrement and detergents.  \n\"There is a significant correlation between visitor numbers and chlorophyll content,\" Mr Flemmings says. \nChlorophyll is the compound present in plants that gives them their green colour and so an indicator of algal concentration. With funding from the UK space agency, Map Impact used infrared analysis of satellite images to measure chlorophyll levels over the last five years in Lake Windermere.\nWhat makes Map Impact's work interesting is that it combined the chlorophyll analysis with mobile phone data.  \nThis allowed it to estimate the number of people in the Windermere catchment area at any given time. This can vary widely from just 40,000 to 50,000 people when it's just residents, or up to 300,000 when you add tourists on a busy summer weekend.\n\"So what you see is typically you get a high spike in the number of people and then three to five days later you get a spike in chlorophyll in the lake,\" said Mr Flemmings. \nHeat is one of the main drivers of algal blooming and though hot summer days are also likely to boost visitor numbers, Mr Flemmings says it has been possible to separate out the two factors.\n\"What we know is that algal blooms are in part caused by an increase in nutrients in the water and one of the contributors to nutrients is phosphorus which can come from human waste,\" he says. \nThe Environment Agency has done research suggesting that more than half of the phosphorus in Windermere comes from sewage. That includes sewage from overflows, United Utilities works, private sewage treatment facilities and septic tanks. \nIn November 2023, just 3% of the water samples collected from the lake's shoreline met minimum standards under UK legislation.\nMatt Staniek from the Save Windermere campaign, says treated sewage from places like the Langdale Wastewater Treatment Plant are part of the problem. It has a permit to emit more than 1m litres a day of treated effluent into the River Brathay, which feeds into Windermere. There are other similar outflows around the catchment area, and while the wastewater treatment plants can remove some of the phosphorus, some of it is also flows out into the river. \n\"In the press there's a lot about untreated sewage,\" Mr Staniek says. \"But in relation to Windermere and the ecological damage that's being inflicted upon our lake, the treated sewage is as much of a problem,\" he said.\nMr Staniek believes that when there are higher numbers of visitors, more treated sewage contributes to the algal blooming. He wants to see all sewage discharges diverted away from the Lake. \n\"Studies from all over the world demonstrate the exact same issues we're facing with Windermere,\" he said.  \"There is one solution that protects the lake forever, and that is to stop putting sewage in it.\"\nUnited Utilities, the local water company, has carried out a feasibility study for what it calls a \"discharge free\" solution. But the miles of new sewage network that would be needed come with a hefty price tag. \nThe company denied its treated effluent might be behind the blooming. \n\"Our wastewater treatment works are sized to treat the sewage from maximum population numbers at peak times, and use the highest treatment standards including phosphorus removal and UV treatment to kill bacteria,\" a United Utilities spokesperson said. \nSo what's going to give? \nBarney Cunliffe runs the Michelin starred Gilpin Hotel near the lake and has joined with others in the hospitality industry to raise money for the Save Windermere campaign. \nMr Cunliffe says he's worried that if nothing changes there might be what he calls \"a catastrophic event\" on the horizon - a massive algal bloom that effectively kills the lake and dea",

This is the time to push Trinity College Dublin to divest from all Israeli companies in the endowment fund as well as suppliers and exchanges.\"\nThe students have also welcomed the university's decision to treat the encampment as an internal matter, rather than a police one.\nLast Thursday student newspaper Trinity News first reported that TCD students' union had been fined \u20ac214,000 (\u00a3183,000) over campus protests.\nThe demonstrations had focused on the university's response to the war in Gaza, as well as proposed course fee hikes and increased accommodation costs.\nTCD cited a loss of income as a result of recent protests at the Book of Kells tourist attraction, which is located on the university campus, but said it supported the right to protest.\nStudents' Union President L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moln\u00e1rfi told BBC News NI that TCD had \"essentially declared war\" and the student body intended to \"escalate\" its campaign.\nOn Friday night students set up an \"encampment for Palestine\" on the TCD campus.\nStudents also used benches to block access to the Book of Kells attraction.\nTCD said it did not support the \"unauthorised BDS encampment\".\nOn Saturday afternoon, the university said access to its campus has been restricted to students and staff with valid college ID cards.\nIt said it had done so to ensure that \"those protesting on campus are members of the college community\".\nLast week, Mr Moln\u00e1rfi said he believed the real reason why the students' union was being fined was because TCD authorities \"are terrified of the wave\" of anti-war protests across university campuses.\n\"Student movements in the US have been absolutely inspiring and we believe that we need to take further action,\" he added.\nPolice in the US have detained more than 2,000 people nationwide in the past fortnight at college rallies and protest camps.\nPro-Palestinian protesters have also disrupted US graduation ceremonies in recent days.\nDemonstrators, who have been calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza war, are also demanding academic institutions financially divest from Israel and companies that stand to make money from the conflict.\nStudents have also occupied UK campuses in protest against the conflict in Gaza with pro-Palestinian protesters in cities including London, Manchester, Newcastle and Leeds setting up tents outside university buildings.\nIsrael began bombing Gaza after Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 200 others.\nThe Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said more than 34,000 people had been killed in the Strip since 7 October.",

    "Growing up on a farm in Australia, Liam Hall was a mechanic \"getting greasy, scraped knuckles\", but in recent years his career has taken a more technical turn.\nHe's now the head of quantum biotechnology at CSIRO, Australia's national science agency.\n\"I've got a bit of a weird background. I always wanted to be a diesel mechanic. Doing that for a while led to wanting to do engineering at university. That introduced me to the physics, and then to the quantum physics. A rollercoaster ride is a good way to describe it,\" he says.\nHis team has been developing diagnostic technologies, experimenting with micro sensors crafted from tiny slivers of diamonds about 50 nanometers in size (about 1,000 times finer than human hair) to test patients' iron levels.\nCurrent methods monitor a protein known as ferritin, the body's iron storage mechanism. While monitoring ferritin is a good way to measure iron, it would be more accurate to measure the actual iron levels inside the protein. \nOne way to do that would be to measure the tiny magnetic fields generated by the iron. But there's one big problem with that approach. \n\"[The magnetic field] is completely tiny and outside the measurement of any traditional magnetometers or microscopes,\" explains Dr Hall.\nHowever, Dr Hall's nano-scale quantum sensors can detect those tiny fields and measure them. \nHe says in the future, the technology could develop an early flag for any particular disease, including the surveillance of certain hormones or proteins that might indicate cancer.  \n\"The advantage for quantum systems has always been that you can achieve much, much better sensitivity and easier identification of chemicals at a much lower cost,\" Dr Hall says.  \nDr Hall is part of a global push to develop quantum technologies. Britain, China, the US and countries elsewhere, are all trying to exploit the weird properties of quantum mechanics.\n\"Quantum is one of Australia's most promising growth opportunities - a chance to create new markets, new applications,\" said CSIRO's chief scientist, Prof Bronwyn Fox.  \nQuantum mechanics emerged in the early 20th Century from studies of nature's smallest objects. Scientists believe it has the potential to expand our understanding of the universe and solve complex problems at lightning speeds.\nThe range of applications appears vast; from advances in environmental science and decarbonisation, to cyber-security and new medicines.  There could be molecules that \"eat up carbon\" and remove it from the atmosphere, quantum batteries to power cars, aircraft that are designed to lower their emissions and transport logistics to reduce road congestion.\nOne ambition of quantum research is to harness the power of sub-atomic particles to store and process data.\nWhile conventional computing generally uses bits (zeroes and ones), quantum computers use qubits, which can exist as zeroes, ones, or combinations of both at once.\nThis is where things can get a bit strange, where particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously (this is called superposition), and also be intertwined (or entangled) with each other.\n\"Using that principle of quantum superposition together with another quantum phenomenon known as entanglement, it enables you to perform calculations that are simply impossible using conventional computers. It opens up the possibility of doing some quite amazing calculations that can be world changing,\" explains Prof Andrew Dzurak from the University of New South Wales.\nMore technology of business\n\"Imagine a new branch of Covid or another horrible pandemic. Once you understand the molecular structure of that, which can be done using standard experimental techniques, you then go to the quantum computer and you calculate how to make a molecule that specifically attacks that virus.\n\"You solve that problem in a day rather than in the six or nine months that it took all of the greatest biological and pharmaceutical minds on the planet to come up with the vaccines for Covid.\"  \nThe power driving quantum computing comes from entanglement, a natural phenomena, according to Dr Muhammed Usman, a team leader at Data 61, a business within CSIRO.\nIt's complex and not easy to grasp. Special particles, often photons, or flecks of light, can be in two places at the same time, but remain strongly connected even though they are not physically linked.\n\"I would say that nobody in the world fully understands the basics of entanglement,\" is Dr Usman's honest assessment.\nCould there be a quantum internet? Quite possibly. Data might be despatched through optical fibres using particles of light making it almost impossible to be eavesdropped or hacked.\nIn the US, the University of Chicago has built one of the country's longest quantum networks. It is almost 200km (124 miles) long and growing.  \nDavid Awschalom is the Liew Family Professor of Molecular Engineering and Physics at the University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering.

    "Argentina's President Javier Milei has denied that it is ordinary Argentines who are paying for his radical austerity measures.\nIn a BBC interview, Mr Milei, who campaigned with a chainsaw to symbolise his desire to slash public spending, insisted that the political class were paying for his huge cuts, not the people.  \nThe right-wing economist was voted in after years of high government spending and high debt.\nInflation is now starting to fall after it initially soared when he took office in December, but it remains the highest in the world annually.\nThe president's critics argue millions of Argentines are paying the price for his austerity programme. \nIn the five months since he was sworn in, he has slashed public sector jobs, energy and transport subsidies, and the value of the currency so people's money is worth less than it was.\nMeeting him for the interview in his presidential office, there were clues to his unconventional political background as a celebrity TV economics pundit: a photo of the Rolling Stones (he was in a tribute band), a bust of himself on the desk, a toy model with a chainsaw, and a water bottle with a photo of himself on it.  \nGifts from his fans, his team said. \nHis face lit up with glee when he told me his favourite Rolling Stones song is Rip This Joint, which he said was off an album with \"libertarian components\". \nSince he became president, he has maintained his radical rhetoric about the economy, but has toned it down on other issues. \nHe refused to repeat his past criticism of China, one of Argentina's biggest trading partners, a nation which he labelled an \"assassin\" during his presidential campaign.\nAs far as economics is concerned, he has made cutting inflation, which stands at 287% annually, his clear priority, arguing that \"the most regressive tax that most afflicts people is inflation\".\nBut many of his policies have caused prices to rise in the short term, at a time when salaries and pensions are not keeping up with inflation. \nJulia is one of those who can no longer make ends meet on her monthly pension of about US$190 (\u00a3150).  \nThe 72-year-old retired chef travels two hours every day to supplement her meagre pension by singing in Buenos Aires. \nIt is the common people who are suffering, she told me, in tears. \nConfronted with her statement, President Milei said this was \"false\". \nHe insisted that the brunt of the burden was being borne by what he called the political corporation, claiming that 90% of the cuts were falling on the political class and only 10% were achieved through cutting government spending on pensions.\nIndependent analysts say spending on pensions has been cut by 30-40% in real terms - with some saying this makes it one of the biggest government spending cuts.\nIn his interview with the BBC, President Milei celebrated the fact that his administration had managed to lower spending to a level below tax income for the first time since 2008.\nWhen repeatedly asked what he would say to pensioners like Julia who are struggling, he said: \"You can't make a macroeconomic evaluation based on the situation of an individual.\" \nHe argued people were being influenced by information spread by the \"rotten\" mass media and journalists, whom he described as \"serial liars\". \nWhen it was put to him that the information that people had access to were prices on shelves, such as the price of milk, which has doubled since he took office, he said: \"You don't do economics based on the price of an individual asset.\" \nHe defended his policies to the BBC, saying that \"there is no magic, real life needs time\". \n\"What would have been the alternative? To continue to print money like the previous administration that generates inflation and ends up affecting the most vulnerable?\" \nMr Milei insisted his economic programme was helping the most vulnerable - for example, by increasing some welfare benefits such as support for unemployed people with children to buy food.  \nHe said economic indicators were \"improving\" and that \"in the last month, salaries beat inflation\".\nBut many Argentines say they are not convinced by his argument. \nVanessa L\u00f3pez, who works at a soup kitchen in a poor neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, said demand for their service had increased.\n\"It's not only people who are homeless, there are entire families that come looking for a plate of food.\"\nSome of the president's fans are willing to give him time. Nicol\u00e1s Vargas said he and his partner Ornella struggled to make enough to cover the basics.\nBut he said Argentina's economic crisis was something that \"has been going on for a long time, even decades, and it cannot be fixed in two, three, four months, even a year\".\n\"I have that faith. I estimate it will take two years. In other words, this year is the year of recovery.\"\nThis sentiment is shared by President Milei, who insisted in the interview that he did not care how many people criticised him, because of his \"conviction\" that \"a better future is getting closer\". \nThe full",
    "The untold story of Sir Christopher Lee is set to be revealed in an upcoming documentary film. \nThe Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee features interviews with friends, family members and famous directors.\nJon Spira, from Headington, Oxford, had access to Lee's scrapbooks and 100 interviews from the British Film Institute's library.\nThe filmmaker tells the BBC the actor's life was an \"incredible story\" waiting to be told.\nLee starred in more than 250 films across eight decades, including the Hammer Horror, James Bond, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars franchises.\nBut as Spira's film explains, he had a military career during World War Two still shrouded in mystery, and helped track down Nazi war criminals.\n\"Because he could speak fluently a range of different languages he got pulled into the secret service doing missions of which the facts have never fully come out,\" Spira explains. \n\"His cousin was Ian Fleming and a lot of people think the character of James Bond was based on him.\n\"He certainly didn't do anything to disavow people of that.\n\"You could almost do this as two films. That's why we called it The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee, because his life is one story and his career is another.\" \nOn-screen he worked with esteemed directors such as Powell and Pressburger, Orson Welles, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and Tim Burton.\nThe documentary features interviews with three more - John Landis, Joe Dante, and Peter Jackson - as well as actress Harriet Walter, who is also Lee's niece.\n\"Peter Jackson was very prepared to talk about the emotional side,\" Spira recalls.\n\"About how amazed he was as a film fan, in awe of Christopher Lee, and couldn't believe he got to work with him. He discovered his unique insecurities, like many actors have.\n\"He was a really complex person who was very emotional, and had this austere image. He had a lot of frustrations in his life - we explore that.\"\nThe documentary also takes some flights of fantasy. \nIt is narrated by a string puppet of Christopher Lee made by the team behind Wes Anderson's animated movies, and voiced by Peter Serafinowicz.\nA stop-motion sequence is directed by Sandman illustrator Dave McKean.\nSpira is crowdfunding for its Blu-ray release because he believes less effort has been made with physical media of late.\nHe said: \"There's a whole market of people who are being forgotten that really love film, want to own it, and maybe don't trust that these things will always be streaming.\"\nHe has launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise \u00a340,000 \"to do something really special\" for collectors.\nLee named The Wicker Man and Jinnah as among the best films he was in, but when Spira is asked, he opts for cult 1983 Australian musical The Return of Captain Invincible.\n\"If you do one wonderful thing with your day, I suggest you watch Christopher Lee sing Name Your Poison,\" he says.\n\"He wanted to be an opera singer all his life\u2026.

    "Columbia University has cancelled its main graduation after weeks of protests on campus over the Israel-Gaza war.\nThe Ivy League school said it was ditching the 15 May commencement in favour of smaller celebrations to focus on \"keeping them safe\".\nThe New York City university said it had arrived at the decision after consultations with student leaders. \nColleges across the US are bracing for disruptions at graduations amid pro-Palestinian protests.\nColumbia University said in a statement on Monday: \"Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families. \n\"They are eager to cross the stage to applause and family pride and hear from their school's invited guest speakers. \n\"As a result, we will focus our resources on those school ceremonies and on keeping them safe, respectful, and running smoothly.\"\nThere have been demonstrations at nearly 140 colleges across 45 states and Washington DC since the protests started at Columbia University in mid-April, according to a BBC tally.\nAbout 2,500 people have been arrested at campuses nationwide, according to an Associated Press count.\nLast week, Columbia called in the police to clear pro-Palestinian protesters from its campus in Upper Manhattan, leading to more than 100 arrests.\nDemonstrators had occupied Hamilton Hall, renaming it Hind's Hall, after a six-year-old Palestinian girl who was killed in Gaza.\nThe college also sent in officers on 18 April to arrest more than 100 demonstrators who had pitched dozens of tents at the Morningside neighbourhood campus.\nThe protesters have been calling for the college to divest from companies they say are profiting from the Israel-Gaza war, but a number of incidents of antisemitism have been reported during the unrest.\nColumbia has asked that New York police remain on campus until at least 17 May.\nAlso on Monday, Harvard University's President Alan Garber warned protesters must end the encampments on campus or face suspension. \nPolice in riot gear, meanwhile, arrested dozens of protesters while clearing a pro-Palestinian encampment at the University of California San Diego. \nMonday's raid came a day after police in Los Angeles cleared out a similar encampment at the University of Southern California (USC). No arrests were reported.\nIn a statement on Sunday, USC President Carol Folt said action had to be taken because the situation was \"spiralling in a dangerous direction\".\nAlso on Sunday, Northeastern University's graduation ceremony in Boston passed largely peacefully at the city's Fenway Park, with police on site.\nMembers of the graduating class held Palestinian flags and chanted pro-Palestinian phrases. Other students waved Israeli flags.\nSimilar demonstrations unfolded at the University of Michigan's commencement in Ann Arbor on Saturday.\nThe University of Mississippi, meanwhile, is investigating a student accused of apparently making monkey sounds towards a black woman during protests on campus last week. The student's membership of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity has been revoked. \nSocial media videos showed pro-Palestinian demonstrators shouted down by a larger group of counter-protesters last Thursday.\nThe college said it had opened an inquiry into \"actions that conveyed hostility and racist overtones\".\nAt Princeton University, at least 17 students said on Friday they would go on hunger strike until campus officials meet them to discuss divestment and a \"cultural boycott of Israel\".\nThey are also demanding the New Jersey college reverse punishment of students after police last week arrested 13 individuals for trespassing during an attempted sit-in. \nThe students were barred from campus and face disciplinary action including possible suspension or expulsion.\nAlso on Friday, faculty members from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) condemned the handling of student protests. \nHistory department faculty members posted two letters condemning the administration after police last week swarmed the campus to clear an encampment.\nUniversity of Virginia history professors, meanwhile, released an open letter condemning that institution after police arrested 25 people on Saturday on campus, where pro-Palestinian protesters had refused to remove an encampment.

    "A host of Wales' most famous artists have criticised cuts to the Welsh National Opera (WNO).\nA protest letter, signed by the likes of Sir Bryn Terfel, Katherine Jenkins, Michael Sheen and Ruth Jones, has been sent to First Minister Vaughan Gething.\nIt says funding cuts from Arts Council of Wales and Arts Council England (ACE) would be \"devastating\".\nACE said it had \"unwavering\" commitment to WNO and the Welsh government said it had \u00a3700m less to spend than in 2021.\nArts Council Wales has also been asked to comment.\nWNO announced in April that it is cutting back its spring tour in 2025 and will not be performing in Llandudno or Bristol.\nThe funding received from ACE was cut by 35%, while Arts Council of Wales reduced its funding to WNO by 11.8% following its investment review announced in September 2023.\nThe letter has been organised by Elizabeth Atherton, herself a singer and member of the Senedd's Cross Party Working Group for Music.\nOther names included on it are actor Luke Evans, harpist Catrin Finch and singer Aled Jones.\nIt warns that WNO is \"being forced to make its orchestra and chorus part-time\".\nIt also calls the \"potential dismantling of one of Wales' finest national institutions devastating for the nation\".\nMs Atherton said: \"Without emergency financial assistance Wales stands to lose its flagship arts organisation, a brand that represents Wales globally and attracts international talent to our shores.\"\nShe called on the Welsh government to \"enter into talks with both representatives of WNO and the UK Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer to discuss how WNO's cross-border agreement for funding can be honoured.\"\nMs Atherton added that \"an emergency package be put in place by both administrations to secure the future of the company\".\nThe Welsh government said: \"We have been clear our budget is up to \u00a3700m less in real terms than when it was set in 2021 and we have had to take extremely difficult decisions.\"\nACE said its commitment to opera and classical music is \"unwavering\" and is investing over \u00a315.3m in the WNO over the next three years for its work in England.\n\"We know that funded organisations are currently faced with a challenging operating environment and we are working closely with them and being as flexible as we can,\" they said.",
    "Former US President Donald Trump has been held in contempt of court for violating a gag order for the 10th time in his hush-money trial in New York.\nJustice Juan Merchan issued his most serious warning yet to Mr Trump, saying further violations could mean jail.\n\"At the end of the day, I have a job to do and that job is to protect the dignity of the judicial system,\" the judge said.\nThis is the second gag order ruling of the trial. \nEarlier in the hush-money proceedings, Judge Merchan sided with the prosecution and fined Mr Trump $1,000 (\u00a3796) each for nine violations.\nMr Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a payment to a porn actress to hide an alleged sexual encounter. He has denied all wrongdoing.\nOn Monday, the third week of testimony in the first-ever criminal trial of a former president, Justice Merchan said it appeared the $9,000 gag-order fine from the previous infractions had not served as a deterrent. \n\"Therefore going forward this court will have to consider a jail sanction,\" he said.  \"It is important that you understand that the last thing I want to do is put you in jail.\"\nProsecutors said last week they were \"not yet seeking jail\" for Mr Trump's alleged gag order violations.\nJustice Merchan acknowledged that incarcerating Mr Trump would be very disruptive to the proceedings. But he called the gag order violations \"a direct attack on the rule of law\" that he cannot abide.\nSitting with a stern expression at the defence table, Mr Trump showed little reaction to the threat of jail.\nAfter court adjourned for the day, Mr Trump called the gag order \"disgraceful\" and seemed defiant in the face of the warning. \"Our Constitution is much more important than jail. It's not even close. I'll do that sacrifice any day,'' he said later outside the courtroom.\nProsecutors argued last week that Mr Trump's social media posts, where he suggested the jury is unfair because the area is \"95% Democrat\", violated the order. \nThe former president, a Republican, has repeatedly argued he cannot get a fair trial in overwhelmingly Democratic Manhattan.\nBBC News reporters are in the Manhattan courtroom covering the historic first criminal trial of a former US president. You'll find their updates and analysis on the BBC news website and app, and across TV, radio and podcasts.\nIn Justice Merchan's written ruling, he said Mr Trump was held in contempt because he made public statements about the jury and how it was selected.\nHe wrote: \"In doing so, the defendant not only called into question the integrity, and therefore the legitimacy of these proceedings, but again raised the specter of fear for the safety of the jurors and of their loved ones.\"\nJustice Merchan added: \"Defendant is hereby put on notice that if appropriate and warranted, future violations of its lawful orders will be punishable by incarceration.\"\nIn addition to the threat of jail time, Mr Trump was ordered to pay a $1,000 fine by the end of the day on Friday. He also has to take down the offending social media post by 14:15 ET (18:15 GMT) on Monday.\nDefence lawyer Todd Blanche had defended Mr Trump, arguing last Thursday that the gag order was unfair.\n\"Everybody can say whatever they want\" about the trial, except for his client, Mr Blanche said.\n\"They're not defendants in this case,\" Justice Merchan responded. \"They're not subjected to the gag order.\"\nHe pointed out that Mr Trump is allowed to speak. However, as a defendant \"there are some things you can't talk about\", added the judge.\nMr Blanche said Mr Trump should be able to respond to digs about the trial from President Joe Biden, his Democratic opponent in November's White House election.  \nThe judge countered that there was nothing in the gag order that would prevent Mr Trump from doing so.\nIf Mr Trump spent time in jail, it would be a historic first for a former US president, and it could pose quite a security problem. \nFormer presidents are entitled to lifelong Secret Service protection. In a statement, the Secret Service said Monday it provides protections \"for all settings around the world\" using complex and high-tech methods, but would not comment on any specific operations.  \nThe New York Department of Corrections told the BBC it would find \"appropriate housing\" for Mr Trump if necessary, but keeping him safe in jail would be a complex issue for New York officials. \nJustin Paperny, director of the prison consulting firm White Collar Advice, said Mr Trump's presence would be expensive and pose a \"massive\" security risk, meaning a warden would likely hold the former president in solitary confinement. \n\"Then there's the risk of: do you isolate a 78-year-old man in segregation, and risk all that accompanies putting a first-time nonviolent offender in the hole?\" he said. \"It would be a total nightmare.\"\nThe rest of the testimony in court - while lacking many bombshell moments on the stand - took jurors through several documents that prosecutors consider cruci",
    "The untold story of Sir Christopher Lee is set to be revealed in an upcoming documentary film. \nThe Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee features interviews with friends, family members and famous directors.\nJon Spira, from Headington, Oxford, had access to Lee's scrapbooks and 100 interviews from the British Film Institute's library.\nThe filmmaker tells the BBC the actor's life was an \"incredible story\" waiting to be told.\nLee starred in more than 250 films across eight decades, including the Hammer Horror, James Bond, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars franchises.\nBut as Spira's film explains, he had a military career during World War Two still shrouded in mystery, and helped track down Nazi war criminals.\n\"Because he could speak fluently a range of different languages he got pulled into the secret service doing missions of which the facts have never fully come out,\" Spira explains. \n\"His cousin was Ian Fleming and a lot of people think the character of James Bond was based on him.\n\"He certainly didn't do anything to disavow people of that.\n\"You could almost do this as two films. That's why we called it The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee, because his life is one story and his career is another.\" \nOn-screen he worked with esteemed directors such as Powell and Pressburger, Orson Welles, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and Tim Burton.\nThe documentary features interviews with three more - John Landis, Joe Dante, and Peter Jackson - as well as actress Harriet Walter, who is also Lee's niece.\n\"Peter Jackson was very prepared to talk about the emotional side,\" Spira recalls.\n\"About how amazed he was as a film fan, in awe of Christopher Lee, and couldn't believe he got to work with him. He discovered his unique insecurities, like many actors have.\n\"He was a really complex person who was very emotional, and had this austere image. He had a lot of frustrations in his life - we explore that.\"\nThe documentary also takes some flights of fantasy. \nIt is narrated by a string puppet of Christopher Lee made by the team behind Wes Anderson's animated movies, and voiced by Peter Serafinowicz.\nA stop-motion sequence is directed by Sandman illustrator Dave McKean.\nSpira is crowdfunding for its Blu-ray release because he believes less effort has been made with physical media of late.\nHe said: \"There's a whole market of people who are being forgotten that really love film, want to own it, and maybe don't trust that these things will always be streaming.\"\nHe has launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise \u00a340,000 \"to do something really special\" for collectors.\nLee named The Wicker Man and Jinnah as among the best films he was in, but when Spira is asked, he opts for cult 1983 Australian musical The Return of Captain Invincible.\n\"If you do one wonderful thing with your day, I suggest you watch Christopher Lee sing Name Your Poison,\" he says.\n\"He wanted to be an opera singer all his life\u2026. This was his one stunning moment to perform on film, and eating the scenery doesn't do it justice. You can see how much fun he's having.\"\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

    "Police in Los Angeles have cleared out a pro-Palestinian encampment at the University of Southern California (USC).\nOfficers in riot gear moved into the site early on Sunday, as USC warned those who did not leave that they could be arrested, according to CBS, the BBC's US partner.\nNo arrests have been reported, and USC President Carol Folt thanked the police and campus security for clearing the camp \"as peacefully and safely as possible\".\nRocked by weeks of pro-Palestinian protests, US universities are preparing for possible disruptions at upcoming graduation ceremonies.\nNortheastern University\u2019s ceremony in Boston on Sunday passed largely peacefully at the city\u2019s Fenway Park where police were in attendance.\nMembers of the graduating class held Palestinian flags and chanted pro-Palestinian phrases. Other students waved Israeli flags.\nThe protest at USC in California ended after officers formed a perimeter around the camp.\nZain Khan, a USC student journalist, told CBS that the encampment had around 100 people and was cleared out by \"dozens\" of police officers and members of the university's Department of Public Safety (DPS).\n\"Most of them peacefully left, some of them were chanting,\" he said.\nUSC later posted on social media that the campus was open to students, faculty, and staff with valid identification, but warned that \"tents and related equipment\" were not allowed and could be confiscated.\nIn a statement on Sunday, Dr Folt said action had to be taken because the encampment was disrupting exams and preparations for commencement ceremonies, and the situation was \"spiralling in a dangerous direction\".\n\"My goals were to prioritise safety and return our campus and our surrounding community to normalcy,\" she said.\n\"We were determined to ensure our students could finish their exams without further disruption and that USC could host the commencement celebrations our graduates have worked hard to earn.\"\nDr Folt confirmed earlier this week that USC had started disciplinary investigations into an unspecified number of individuals who \"violated our policies and the law\", according to CBS. \nThe proceedings follow the arrests of 93 people at USC last month after police and protesters clashed on campus.\nThe clear out of the USC camp comes just days after riot police removed a similar encampment at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).\nEarlier this week, police in New York arrested 112 protesters after Columbia University sought help clearing the Manhattan campus. Police later confirmed that an officer accidentally fired his gun during the clear out.\nThere was also campus tension at USC in mid-April when it announced it would cancel a graduation speech by a valedictorian Muslim student, citing unspecified security concerns.\nThe move came after complaints that her social media presence was antisemitic.\nThe university then cancelled the main graduation ceremony, which was set to take place on 10 May. Other commencement events are still set to take place on campus this week.\nUS universities have been rocked by weeks of protests, with demonstrators calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza war, and for academic institutions to financially divest from Israel and companies who stand to make money from the conflict.\nThere have been demonstrations at nearly 140 institutions across 45 states and Washington DC since the protests started at Columbia University last month, according to a BBC tally.\nPolice have detained more than 2,000 people nationwide in the past fortnight at college rallies and protest camps.",

    "Trinity College Dublin (TCD) has met with student protesters and outlined a range of measures which it hopes will end an encampment on its campus.\nHowever, students have said they will continue their protest until all of their demands have been met.\nOn Friday, dozens of students erected tents, calling on the university to end all business and academic links to Israel due to the war in Gaza.\nIn a statement on Monday evening, TCD said it was in \"solidarity with the students in our horror at what is happening in Gaza\".\nThe university said it has \"initiated a process to divest from investments in companies that have activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and appear on the UN Blacklist\".\nTrinity is setting up a task force, including student representatives, it added, to discuss preserving academic freedom \"while understanding better how we engage - or not - with states that are in contravention of human rights\".\nThe university also condemned \"the ferocious and disproportionate onslaught in Gaza\" and welcomed the International Court of Justice's  interim ruling in South Africa's genocide case against Israel.\nThose involved in the protest called Monday's developments \"a partial victory\" but said they intend on continuing their encampment.\nIn a statement, BDS representatives confirmed they met with TCD to discuss their demands and \"negotiate future actions\".\nBDS stands for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, a non-violent movement that promotes cultural, academic and economic sanctions against Israel in protest at its treatment of Palestinians and Israeli-Arabs.\nOn the university's decision to divest from UN blacklisted companies, a BDS spokesperson said: \"While we appreciate these steps are being taken, we note there are more Israeli companies in the endowment fund as well as suppliers and exchanges that the university has ties to.\"\nThe group added: \"We cannot stop yet. This is the time to push Trinity College Dublin to divest from all Israeli companies in the endowment fund as well as suppliers and exchanges.\"\nThe students have also welcomed the university's decision to treat the encampment as an internal matter, rather than a police one.\nLast Thursday student newspaper Trinity News first reported that TCD students' union had been fined \u20ac214,000 (\u00a3183,000) over campus protests.\nThe demonstrations had focused on the university's response to the war in Gaza, as well as proposed course fee hikes and increased accommodation costs.\nTCD cited a loss of income as a result of recent protests at the Book of Kells tourist attraction, which is located on the university campus, but said it supported the right to protest.\nStudents' Union President L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moln\u00e1rfi told BBC News NI that TCD had \"essentially declared war\" and the student body intended to \"escalate\" its campaign.\nOn Friday night students set up an \"encampment for Palestine\" on the TCD campus.\nStudents also used benches to block access to the Book of Kells attraction.\nTCD said it did not support the \"unauthorised BDS encampment\".\nOn Saturday afternoon, the university said access to its campus has been restricted to students and staff with valid college ID cards.\nIt said it had done so to ensure that \"those protesting on campus are members of the college community\".\nLast week, Mr Moln\u00e1rfi said he believed the real reason why the students' union was being fined was because TCD authorities \"are terrified of the wave\" of anti-war protests across university campuses.\n\"Student movements in the US have been absolutely inspiring and we believe that we need to take further action,\" he added.\nPolice in the US have detained more than 2,000 people nationwide in the past fortnight at college rallies and protest camps.\nPro-Palestinian protesters have also disrupted US graduation ceremonies in recent days.\nDemonstrators, who have been calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza war, are also demanding academic institutions financially divest from Israel and companies that stand to make money from the conflict.\nStudents have also occupied UK campuses in protest against the conflict in Gaza with pro-Palestinian protesters in cities including London, Manchester, Newcastle and Leeds setting up tents outside university buildings.\nIsrael began bombing Gaza after Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 200 others.\nThe Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said more than 34,000 people had been killed in the Strip since 7 October.",
    "Rishi Sunak has dismissed calls to change course after poor local election results, arguing he can make \"progress\" with voters before a general election. \nSpeaking for the first time since the full scale of Tory losses was revealed, the prime minister called losing 470 councillors \"bitterly disappointing\".\nTory critics have called on Mr Sunak to shift the party to the right.\nBut Mr Sunak told The Times newspaper he was \"determined that we will come together as a party\". \nThe Conservatives are licking their wounds after a string of local election defeats. After the final votes were counted on Sunday, the Tories had lost control of 10 councils, more than 470 council seats and a totemic loss of West Midlands mayor Andy Street.\nThe party also lost 10 Police and Crime Commissioners to Labour, marking a potentially significant blow for the Conservatives if they aim to centre their next general election campaign on law and order.\nAppearing to concede for the first time that his party could be on course to lose its majority, Mr Sunak said the local election results \"suggest we are heading for a hung parliament with Labour as the largest party\".\nThe prime minister told The Times: \"Keir Starmer propped up in Downing Street by the SNP, Liberal Democrats and the Greens would be a disaster for Britain.\n\"The country does not need more political horse trading, but action.\"\nHe added: \"There is work to do and more progress to be made and I am determined that we will come together as a party and show the British people we are delivering for them.\"\nHis comments reflect analysis by leading psephologist Prof Michael Thrasher for Sky News - which suggested Labour would win 294 seats at a general election.\nThe projection, which has been dismissed by some polling experts, used the local election results to project a nationwide estimate of vote share at a general election.\nIt assumes everyone would vote in the same way at a general election as they did in last week's local elections, when smaller parties and independent candidates tend to do better in local elections. \nIt also does not take account of what could happen in Scotland, instead using the results of the 2019 general election, while Labour are expected to do much better there this year. \nPolling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said winning more seats in Scotland on its own probably would not be enough to secure a majority for Labour. \nHowever, he told the BBC the impact of Reform UK was \"diminished\" in the local elections as they only stood in one in six wards. \nWhere they did stand, the Conservative vote fell significantly, suggesting the party could have a greater impact in a general election, where they have pledged to field candidates in every seat across England, Scotland and Wales. \nHealth Minister Maria Caulfield acknowledged there were \"caveats\" around the projection. \nHowever, she claimed last week's results showed former Conservative voters were staying at home, rather than switching to Labour, and \"they want a reason to vote for us\". \nLabour has denied it is planning alliances with other parties in order to form a government at the next general election, expected in the second half of this year.\nSpeaking on BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Labour's election co-ordination Pat McFadden said there was now a \"sense of belief\" that his party could win.\nHe hailed the \"tremendous\" election results for the party, especially winning the West Midlands mayoral race which he said was \"beyond our expectations\".\nSpeaking on Sunday, former Home Secretary Suella Braverman said Mr Sunak's plan was \"not working\".\n\"There is no disguising the fact these have been terrible election results for the Conservatives,\" Mrs Braverman told the BBC.\nMr Sunak must \"change course\" towards more right-wing policies in order to win back Tory voters who are \"on strike\", she added.\nAlthough a frequent critic of the prime minister, Mrs Braverman did not call for Mr Sunak's replacement, arguing it would be \"impossible\" to change leaders so close to a general election.\nMrs Braverman is among several conservative voices who have come out to advocate for a rightward policy shift in light of the bleak local election results.\nMiriam Cates, co-chair of the New Conservatives group mostly made up of \"red wall\" MPs, from the party's 2019 intake, said her party must offer \"patriotism and national security\" to avoid falling into the \"abyss\".\nWriting in the Telegraph, Ms Cates called on Mr Sunak to ignore policies that \"serve an international elite\" and instead focus on drastically reducing immigration and reforming planning laws to boost house-building.\nFormer lead Brexit negotiator Lord David Frost said he believed it was \"too late\" to save the Conservative Party from \"electoral defeat at the next general election\". \nTo save the party Mr Sunak must produce \"more tax cuts, more spending cuts\" and a \"serious assault on the burden of net zero\", Lord Frost argued.\nHowever, Damian Green, chairman of the centrist O",
    "Boeing's first crewed space flight was postponed just two hours before launch for a safety check, Nasa officials say.\nAstronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were already in position inside the Starliner when the decision to halt was made because of a potential issue with an oxygen relief valve in the Atlas rocket run by the United Launch Alliance. \nThere was no issue with Boeing's Starliner Spacecraft which sits on top of the rocket.\nFlight engineers discovered that the valve had been rapidly opening and closing in the period before launch and so the countdown was aborted. \nThe flight team are currently examining the data to see how much energy was expended by the valve. If it has exceeded its operational life it will need to be replaced, which ULA say its engineers can do in a few days.\nThe spacecraft had been expected to blast off from Cape Canaveral in Florida and make its way to the International Space Station (ISS).\nThe soonest a new launch attempt may be made is on Friday, Boeing said in a post on social media. \nThe mission has already been delayed for several years because of setbacks in the spacecraft's development.\n\"Standing down on tonight's attempt to launch,\" tweeted Nasa chief Bill Nelson. \"As I've said before, @NASA's first priority is safety. We go when we're ready.\"\nBoeing is hoping to become the second private firm able to provide crew transport to and from the ISS, alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX.\nMr Musk's company was the first to achieve this in 2020 with its Dragon capsule, in a flight that ended close to a decade of US reliance on Russian space rockets.\nThe Starliner's first uncrewed test flight was originally scheduled to take place in 2015 but ended up being delayed until 2019. When it did occur, software glitches led to an internal clock malfunction, resulting in thrusters over-firing. So much fuel was consumed that the capsule was unable to reach the ISS.\nA second attempt was planned in August 2021 but delayed again until May 2022. An issue with the propulsion system was blamed. When Starliner finally did leave Earth, it managed to complete its full mission but concerns were raised about the performance of some thrusters and the craft's cooling system.",
    "A work of art hidden in a dark corner of a National Trust manor house for 150 years has been revealed as a rare surviving print by the inventor of colour printing.\nThe copy of a portrait by Dutch artist Sir Anthony van Dyke was assumed to be oil-on-paper until curators at Oxburgh Hall, Norfolk, sent it away for conservation. \nIt was discovered the reproduction of the Three Eldest Children of Charles I was in fact a print by Jacob Christoff Le Blon, who first created the three-colour printing process.\n\"Only three Le Blon prints of it are known to survive, so to have discovered a fourth is really exciting,\" said National Trust curator Jane Eade.\nThe discovery at the home of the Bedingfield family, who were devout Catholics, suggested they were secret Jacobites - supporters of the Catholic Stuart royal family in exile instead of George I. \nThe Protestant king inherited the British throne in 1714.\nThe portrait includes the future James II, the last Catholic monarch of Britain, whose son James Francis Edward Stuart attempted to take back the throne in a failed uprising in 1715.\n\"Copies of this painting are known to have been popular with those sympathetic to the Jacobite cause, and it would have been quite feasible that the print has spent its whole life at Oxburgh - although we lack enough evidence to prove it,\" said Oxburgh collections and house manager, Ilana van Dort.\nThe original portrait is part of the Royal Collection, to which Le Blon was given access by George I, and his print dates to 1721-22.\nHe was the first to create a three-colour printing process \u2013 the forerunner of the CMYK colour printing used today.\nThe revolutionary method used mezzotint, a monochrome printmaking process, with separate plates inked in blue, yellow and red, and superimposed on one another in order to create variable depth of hue. \nUntil Le Blon, artists had inked colours one beside the other on a single printing plate.\nA specialist paper conservator at the trust's Royal Oak Conservation Studio at Knole, Kent, carried out conservation treatment. \nAnalysis helped identify colours Le Blon was known to have used such as indigo, carmine or red lake.\n\"A thick layer of 19th Century varnish was particularly challenging,\" said Ms Eade.\nThe story of its conservation will feature in the new BBC Two series of Hidden Treasures of the National Trust, which starts on Friday.\nFollow Norfolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

It's been really fun.\"\nThe 26-year-old had been playing at a hotel bar nearby when he was asked to step in for support act Murs, who could not make it due to transport issues.\nTake That's frontman Gary Barlow later thanked him on Instagram.\nRooney, from Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire, said he had been playing in his regular slot at the Radisson Red hotel when the presenter Ross King spotted him.\nHe was then whisked to the Ovo Hydro, where he found himself playing in front of 14,000 fans. \"I usually play to around 40 people,\" he laughed. \"It's madness.\"\nRooney said he did not have time to feel nervous as it all happened so fast.\n\"I was more just focusing on what songs to sing,\" he said. \"I was more excited than anything else.\"\nRooney said Take That were \"brilliant\" and gave him some advice on what to play. When the gig finished, he also got some positive feedback from them.\nBarlow also showed his appreciation on social media, writing: \"This young man saved the day, thank you.\"\nHe added a picture of Rooney and three love heart emojis.\nRooney said his friends and family didn't believe him when he first told them what had happened.\n\"They thought it was a wind-up,\" he said. \"It was only when they started seeing the news reports that they knew I wasn't joking.\"\nHe said he wants to enjoy his newfound fame and will spend the coming weeks recording some music.\n\"I just want to keep it going, and and see where it all goes,\" he said.\nRoss King told BBC Good Morning Scotland that he had been having a meal in the hotel when he saw the news that Murs could not make the gig.\n\"Gary Barlow is one of my best mates. We suddenly got in contact,\" he said.\nKing said he told Barlow there was a \"young guy\" playing in the hotel, adding: \"He's a great player, he's a great singer and he's got a great personality, I'd love to bring him over.\"\nHe said Barlow responded, telling him to bring Rooney over.\n\"We literally ran from the Radisson Red, there were no soundchecks and Daniel went on and just absolutely slayed the audience. He was just sensational,\" he said.\nOn social media, fans praised Rooney's performance at the Ovo Hydro, with one saying he'd smashed it.\nMurs, who has been supporting the world famous boy band on their This Life tour, was unable to make the gig on Friday night after his flight from London was cancelled.\nHe had been updating fans over the day on his Instagram story on his efforts to get to Glasgow. He posted a video from inside the plane before exiting and attempting to board another flight.\nEventually, he posted on social media that it was not going to happen.\nAfter their gigs in Glasgow, Take That are due to perform in Manchester this week.\nBut their five dates will now be held at the AO Arena, after they were forced to move from the troubled Co-op Live arena due to \"ongoing technical issues\".",
    "A charity has offered vulnerable people free dental care, after poor access to dentists had left patients with life-threatening problems.\nAccording to homeless charity Lifeline, based in Harrogate, one resident \"would have probably died\" if he had not had 12 teeth swiftly removed.\nLifeline has teamed up with charity Dentaid, which offered free dental treatment at pop-up centres.\nLast week, Dentaid took its mobile unit to Starbeck in Harrogate. \nFormerly homeless people were able to have dental check-ups, extractions and fillings at the pop-up, which for some  was the first time they had accessed this service in years.  \nRob, who used to be a drug addict, said that being on the methadone programme for 14 to 15 years had rotted his teeth.\n\"I've always had problems with my teeth,\" he said. \n\"The last couple of years, I've actually looked after them but on Saturday one of my fillings fell out, so I needed to go in and get it fixed. \n\"I've been paranoid about eating over the weekend in case I did any more damage.\"\nRob added that he was \"blessed\" to have the opportunity to visit the mobile unit, as he had known people who had been waiting for \"up to two years\" for an appointment.\nAnother patient, who preferred not to be named, said this was the first time he had seen a dentist since he was 12 years old. \n\"It's nice to be looked after and cared for, and to feel appreciated,\" he said.\nThe patients were treated by retired dentist Geoff Baggaley, who had practised in Yorkshire for 42 years but now volunteered at Dentaid. \nMr Baggaley believed access to dental care had worsened over the years, which had caused knock-on issues.\n\"Going back to when we first started all those years ago, there was never really an access problem. Now there is an access problem,\" he said.\n\"We know from the evidence that this is leading to more dental decay and I think more dental anxiety because it has become a real struggle to find a dentist. \n\"I know from reports that there has probably been an increase in oral cancer diagnosis and late oral cancer diagnosis because patients can't get the care that they need.\"\nCarl Good, CEO of Lifeline, said that a man using the charity nearly lost his life due to oral problems. \nHe said: \"One of our first ever residents ended up having 12 teeth out and they said that had that not been treated immediately, then he would have probably died.\"\nHowever, the Department of Health and Social Care said its dental recovery plan would create 2.5m extra appointments this year and nearly 500 more dental practices had already opened to new patients in England.\n\"Our plan includes offering dentists \u00a320,000 'golden hellos' to work in under-served areas and rolling out mobile dental vans to our most isolated communities,\" a spokesperson said.\n \"The NHS has also seen and treated record numbers of cancer patients over the past two years, with survival rates improving across almost all types of cancer, including mouth cancer.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "A new exhibition celebrates women who were determined to paint in an era when art was  dominated by men.\nAnother View: Landscapes by Women Artists at the Lady Lever Art Gallery in Port Sunlight, Wirral, highlights their place in the history of British landscape art.\nIt tells the story of women artists' growing ambition and how they got more of a foothold in the art world.\nAbout 40 works from the early 1800s through to the 1980s feature.\nThe exhibition interrogates the term \"lady amateur\", which was often used in contrast to the \u201cprofessional\u201d artist title usually reserved for males. \nMelissa Gustin, curator of British Art, said the exhibition champions work by female artists determined to fulfil their creativity but who were often mocked by the establishment. \nShe said: \"They've come from being laughed at at every tea table, as Thomas Gainsborough said, to being some of the most recognised women and artists in the world.\"\nShe said: \"This exhibition shows how women landscape painters used their art to express their individual gazes, representing multiple viewpoints along the way.\n\u201cThey explored and interrogated the landscape around them, developing important networks and experimenting with new mediums and techniques in the process.\"\nElizabeth Campbell, whose watercolours recording her tour through the Alps were painted between 1818 and 1827, is among the relatively unknown artists featured in the exhibition. \nMs Gustin said the artist, from Yorkshire, was radical for her time.\n\"She married a Scottish soldier, and after he died in the Napoleonic Wars... she took her young daughter, Thomasina, off to the Continent and spent the next 20 or 30 years essentially having adventures,\" she said.\nMs Gustin said she did everything from \"mountain climbing to speaking new languages and meeting new people and painting everything along her way\".\n\"They include a document of her trip over Mont Blanc,\" she said.\n\"They were the first women to do this and they did it in corsets and hoop skirts, painting the whole way.\" \nWork from decorated artist Dame Ethel Walker (1861-1951) is also included in the display.\nShe exhibited at the Venice Biennale several times, was elected to the Royal Academy, and was given a damehood for her services to the arts in 1943.\nShe wanted to be known as an artist, not a female artist, Ms Gustin said.\n\"She felt the discussion around women artists from male artists was counter-productive, and that what really mattered was the quality of someone's painting or sculpture,\" she said.\nShe said she felt \"that they should not be focused on the person's gender but on how well they actually painted and if they had originality and talent\". \nWork from Sheila Fell (1931-1979) is also on show.\nThe Cumbria artist preferred the local views to anywhere else even though she travelled in Europe, Ms Gustin said.\n\"She loved the place she came from in Cumbria and painted that rather than anything else. \n\"She visited Greece, she visited France and she found them uninspiring compared to Aspatria and the land that she'd grown up in,\" she added. \nThe exhibition runs until 18 August.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram?

    "Growing up on a farm in Australia, Liam Hall was a mechanic \"getting greasy, scraped knuckles\", but in recent years his career has taken a more technical turn.\nHe's now the head of quantum biotechnology at CSIRO, Australia's national science agency.\n\"I've got a bit of a weird background. I always wanted to be a diesel mechanic. Doing that for a while led to wanting to do engineering at university. That introduced me to the physics, and then to the quantum physics. A rollercoaster ride is a good way to describe it,\" he says.\nHis team has been developing diagnostic technologies, experimenting with micro sensors crafted from tiny slivers of diamonds about 50 nanometers in size (about 1,000 times finer than human hair) to test patients' iron levels.\nCurrent methods monitor a protein known as ferritin, the body's iron storage mechanism. While monitoring ferritin is a good way to measure iron, it would be more accurate to measure the actual iron levels inside the protein. \nOne way to do that would be to measure the tiny magnetic fields generated by the iron. But there's one big problem with that approach. \n\"[The magnetic field] is completely tiny and outside the measurement of any traditional magnetometers or microscopes,\" explains Dr Hall.\nHowever, Dr Hall's nano-scale quantum sensors can detect those tiny fields and measure them. \nHe says in the future, the technology could develop an early flag for any particular disease, including the surveillance of certain hormones or proteins that might indicate cancer.  \n\"The advantage for quantum systems has always been that you can achieve much, much better sensitivity and easier identification of chemicals at a much lower cost,\" Dr Hall says.  \nDr Hall is part of a global push to develop quantum technologies. Britain, China, the US and countries elsewhere, are all trying to exploit the weird properties of quantum mechanics.\n\"Quantum is one of Australia's most promising growth opportunities - a chance to create new markets, new applications,\" said CSIRO's chief scientist, Prof Bronwyn Fox.  \nQuantum mechanics emerged in the early 20th Century from studies of nature's smallest objects. Scientists believe it has the potential to expand our understanding of the universe and solve complex problems at lightning speeds.\nThe range of applications appears vast; from advances in environmental science and decarbonisation, to cyber-security and new medicines.  There could be molecules that \"eat up carbon\" and remove it from the atmosphere, quantum batteries to power cars, aircraft that are designed to lower their emissions and transport logistics to reduce road congestion.\nOne ambition of quantum research is to harness the power of sub-atomic particles to store and process data.\nWhile conventional computing generally uses bits (zeroes and ones), quantum computers use qubits, which can exist as zeroes, ones, or combinations of both at once.\nThis is where things can get a bit strange, where particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously (this is called superposition), and also be intertwined (or entangled) with each other.\n\"Using that principle of quantum superposition together with another quantum phenomenon known as entanglement, it enables you to perform calculations that are simply impossible using conventional computers. It opens up the possibility of doing some quite amazing calculations that can be world changing,\" explains Prof Andrew Dzurak from the University of New South Wales.\nMore technology of business\n\"Imagine a new branch of Covid or another horrible pandemic. Once you understand the molecular structure of that, which can be done using standard experimental techniques, you then go to the quantum computer and you calculate how to make a molecule that specifically attacks that virus.\n\"You solve that problem in a day rather than in the six or nine months that it took all of the greatest biological and pharmaceutical minds on the planet to come up with the vaccines for Covid.\"  \nThe power driving quantum computing comes from entanglement, a natural phenomena, according to Dr Muhammed Usman, a team leader at Data 61, a business within CSIRO.\nIt's complex and not easy to grasp. Special particles, often photons, or flecks of light, can be in two places at the same time, but remain strongly connected even though they are not physically linked.\n\"I would say that nobody in the world fully understands the basics of entanglement,\" is Dr Usman's honest assessment.\nCould there be a quantum internet? Quite possibly. Data might be despatched through optical fibres using particles of light making it almost impossible to be eavesdropped or hacked.\nIn the US, the University of Chicago has built one of the country's longest quantum networks. It is almost 200km (124 miles) long and growing.  \nDavid Awschalom is the Liew Family Professor of Molecular Engineering and Physics at the University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering.

    "The tight-knit and peaceful surfing community in the Mexican port of Ensenada is in shock.\nThree foreign surfers - two Australian brothers, Callum and Jake Robinson, and their American friend, Jack Carter Rhoad - had been in the town just a few days earlier, enjoying some of the finest surfing spots in North America at the start of what was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime.\nNow, their bodies are being repatriated to their families after they were brutally murdered at a camping site.\nThey were planning to take a well-worn route, setting out from Ensenada, surfing and camping along the Pacific coast, and arriving in Rosarito further north. Unfortunately, they never made it to their accommodation.\nInstead, several days later, their bodies were found down a well several kilometres from the camping site, their burnt-out pick-up truck found nearby. Each man had been killed by a gunshot to the head, the authorities said, sending a chill through the local surfing community.\nThe implications of the violence are still reverberating through the quiet beach-town.\n\"It's difficult. In truth, I've always felt safe here,\" said Jessica, an American from San Diego now living near Ensenada, her wetsuit still dripping from a morning surf.\nAt various times in its 500-year history, Ensenada has teemed with visitors from the United States. During the years of Prohibition in the early 20th Century, the city's economy received a particular boost from Americans coming south in search of legal liquor.  \nToday, it's the third biggest city in the state with both a booming tourist industry and a thriving ex-pat community. Thousands of foreigners - from silver-haired retirees to digital nomads - have settled in the city to enjoy its beachfront properties, warm climate and relaxed atmosphere amid the rising cost of living in the US.\nAnd, of course, it attracts huge numbers of surfers every year. \nThe region of the Bay of All Saints (Bahia de Todos Santos in Spanish) as a whole is a surfer's paradise. Spots like San Miguel Beach and Todos Santos Island are renowned among the surfing community with a major competition, the Billabong XXL, having been held in the latter.\nSo, the chances are that the three murdered men had little or no trepidation about embarking on their trip. And few among their fellow-surfers will have necessarily warned them against it beyond urging them to be careful.\nJessica, the American from San Diego, said that she had come to the beach town to surf with her husband. They run programmes for young people in the \"really cool, really friendly\" local surfing community.\n\"Obviously, we take precautions and investigate carefully where we're going before we go. But it's so beautiful here and the people here are so kind, we intend to surf the whole coast while we live here,\" she said.\nSome Mexican surfers put the murders into the context of the region's constant violence.\nWhile the young men never expected to meet such a grisly fate simply by pursuing the thing they loved, their murders are a stark reminder of the degree of criminality in Mexico's northern states.\n\"This is the struggle, and it is important that it's not a silent one. We have to continue to draw attention to these problems, continue to protest and march, keep raising our voices and call for an end to the impunity,\" Paulina Rodriguez, a surfer and resident of Ensenada, told the BBC.\nPowerful drug cartels are engaged in a territorial war over \"plazas\" - the drug-smuggling and people-trafficking routes north, with illegal guns also being moved southwards. It is all a multi-billion industry for the cartels which operate along the border, and foreigners have run afoul of organised crime in Mexico on numerous occasions.\nFrancisca Acosta, a younger Mexican surfer, echoed the concern that impunity for violent crime is rife in Mexico.\n\"(The killings) speak to a greater problem in Baja California and across Mexico,\" she said with a sigh. \"There's a huge problem with impunity. The disappearances and violent crimes are getting ever closer to home.\"\nThe country's poorest are the most vulnerable, she said.\n\"If this can happen to tourists, it can happen to anyone,\" she added. \"As organised crime is on the rise in society, you can feel the fear on the streets.\"\nThere has been some swift action by local authorities after the surfers' deaths. \nThree people have been arrested in connection with their murders, including a woman who was in possession of one of the men's mobile phones.\nThe working theory of the state authorities in Baja California is that the detainees had tried to steal the group's vehicle, possibly for its tyres. But, on meeting resistance, the attackers killed them before burning their tents and trying to hide the bodies.\nThe state attorney general, Maria Elena Andrade Ramirez, said that her office would carry out an exhaustive investigation of \"these unfortunate events until those responsible feel the full weight of the law\".\nIn some respects, the violent e",
    "A group of women are warning others to do background checks on partners met through dating apps after loans worth thousands of pounds were taken out in their names by the same conman. \nPeter Gray, 35, who met the women on Tinder, was jailed after defrauding four women out of about \u00a380,000.\nOne victim said Gray, from West Yorkshire, \"totally ruined my life\" and left her with significant trust issues.\nTinder said it had \"implemented various ways to warn users of potential scams\".\nGray, of Mirfield, was sentenced to 56 months in prison in February and given restraining orders in relation to the victims. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Clare McDonnell, Jessica - not her real name - described how she met Gray on the app in 2018 after coming out of a six-year relationship.\nAlthough he wasn't her usual type, he was \"a good listener and everything I needed at the time\", she recalled.\nOn their third date, Jessica was at his apartment and got up to use the bathroom.\n\"I left my bag on his dining table, he went in my bag and took pictures of my driving licence and both my bank cards,\" she said.  \nShe later discovered loans up to the value of \u00a39,000 were taken out in her name.\nDespite Gray offering to pay back the money over time, Jessica went to the police.\n\"I didn't want to be tied to this guy for five years because I barely even knew him,\" she said.  \nHannah, another woman who met Gray on Tinder, described him as being initially \"calming and reassuring,\" but something \"didn't sit right\".\nA week later, after Hannah decided to call the relationship off, she received an acceptance letter for a loan of \u00a320,000 in her name.  \nThe pair rekindled their relationship a few months later after Gray showered her with gifts and declarations of love, however she later ended it once again. \n\"I think the alarm bells and red flags were just waving high,\" she said. \nSources: Action Fraud/Victim Support/Stop Scams UK\nAcross all of the relationships, Gray developed close connections that would help him commit offences for his own personal financial gain.   \nWhen Hannah found out she was pregnant, her sister looked into Gray's past and tracked down one of his ex-partners, who warned her of his hidden past.\n\"There's no way that I'm going to let a child be brought up anywhere near such a vile human,\" Hannah said. \n\"My world had just literally broken apart in front of my eyes in that half an hour conversation.\" \nGray repeated the pattern once again when he matched with Elizabeth - not\u00a0her\u00a0real name - in 2020.\nHe sent flowers to her home, despite Elizabeth never revealing where she lived.  \nElizabeth said: \"Red flags popped up, but I just kept thinking, stop being silly, you need to be going for a guy that treats you nice.\" \nTwo days before moving into her new house, Elizabeth's mortgage was pulled after Gray used her driving licence to secure a loan of about \u00a310,000 in her name. \nJessica said Gray's actions had \"totally ruined my life\" and said she's stopped taking ID and bank cards out on dates.\n\"I don't trust anybody I meet,\" she said. \nElizabeth said: \"You're constantly thinking, is this person who they say they are or are they not?\"   \nTwo of the women individually used the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme, also known as Clare's Law, which gives people the right to ask police for a background check on their partner.\nIn a statement, Tinder said it \"acts to help prevent and warn users of potential scams or fraud by using AI tools to detect words and phrases and proactively intervene\".  \n\"We have implemented various ways to warn users of potential scams or fraud, from in-app features to pop-up messages and education,\" a spokesperson said.  \n\"All users can request that their match be photo-verified prior to messaging.

    "Former prison inmates said their lives were \"transformed\" by a new project which offered them a job after release.\nHMP Highpoint near Haverhill, Suffolk, in partnership with City and Guilds, launched the programme to teach inmates how to maintain railway infrastructure back in August 2022. \nOnce inmates are released, they then have a job lined up working in the industry that hopefully deters them from re-offending.  \nRyan Hull and Othman, former inmates, said the programme has given them a sense of relief. \nMr Hull, 31, initially didn't apply for the programme after thinking he wouldn't be accepted.\n\"It was quite a nice feeling because it guaranteed me a job,\" he explained.\n\"There was the anxiety of going to go back to the same lifestyle [once out of prison]\n\"When you live a certain lifestyle for so long it's hard to break the cycle.\n\"It offered me a different route away from that.\"\nMr Hull has already had great success in his employment.\nHe worked on the tracks for about six weeks before he was then promoted to a labour manager looking after 250 men.\n\"The railway has so much progression and so many different routes,\" Mr Hull added.\nLife is \"completely different\" he said from how it was before he went into prison.\n\"The money you earn is yours and you don't have to worry about a single thing because everything is above board and you are doing the right thing.\"\nOthman, 39, joined the programme in September 2022 just after it launched but experienced tough competition.\n\"It was very popular as it was new at the time,\" he said.\n\"I thought this was a step for me to go down the straight route and not come back to prison.\"\nOthman said he had \"a lot of anxiety\" about leaving prison but the course left him \"relieved\".\n\"I was able to meet employers and I studied the course, learnt the skills so upon release it was all up hill,\" he added. \nOthman now works on the Euston railway line and said life was \"peaceful\".\n\"It's the best thing ever, I wouldn't change it and I can't see myself ever going back to my old lifestyle,\" he said.\n\"The peace that you get when you know that you're doing right and my family is proud and happy for me.\" \nAlex Pond is the executive director of training at City and Guilds that offers vocational education and apprenticeships.\nMr Pond said City and Guilds had noticed a space in the rehabilitation industry that could improve the UK's skill shortage.\n\"At first it was quite difficult because there was no funding and the industry wasn't really engaged,\" he explained. \n\"But through breaking down doors and communication we quickly realised there was an appetite both in society and the industry.\"\nSince August 2022, 107 inmates have completed the programme and 87 of those are still in employment. \nMr Pond said the success in the rail industry has prompted them to consider other industries including construction and electrical.\n\"Three weeks ago I was coming out of a classroom in this very prison and a prisoner stopped me to say he had been in for 18 years,\" Mr Pond continued. \n\"He said this was the first time in 18 years that he had been given hope and he completed his course and he's now working on the railway.\n\"I am very proud.\"\nLisa Wheeler is the land-based activities manager at HMP Highpoint and the staff member who interviews the inmates for the programme.\nShe said when the inmates know they are getting employment on the outside \"they take it more seriously\".\n\"They know when getting out it is security for them,\" she said. \n\"It gives them a sense of pride - they're proud they've done the course, they're going out to work and they are providing for their family.\"\nMs Wheeler said the programme was so popular, inmates from other prisons have visited to take part. \n\"It's about someone believing in them and saying, actually, you can do this,\" she continued.\n\"A lot of the men at the end of the course say thank you, but I didn't do anything.\n\"I just gave them the tools to use and to better themselves and get a job.\"\nFollow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Police in Los Angeles have cleared out a pro-Palestinian encampment at the University of Southern California (USC).\nOfficers in riot gear moved into the site early on Sunday, as USC warned those who did not leave that they could be arrested, according to CBS, the BBC's US partner.\nNo arrests have been reported, and USC President Carol Folt thanked the police and campus security for clearing the camp \"as peacefully and safely as possible\".\nRocked by weeks of pro-Palestinian protests, US universities are preparing for possible disruptions at upcoming graduation ceremonies.\nNortheastern University\u2019s ceremony in Boston on Sunday passed largely peacefully at the city\u2019s Fenway Park where police were in attendance.\nMembers of the graduating class held Palestinian flags and chanted pro-Palestinian phrases. Other students waved Israeli flags.\nThe protest at USC in California ended after officers formed a perimeter around the camp.\nZain Khan, a USC student journalist, told CBS that the encampment had around 100 people and was cleared out by \"dozens\" of police officers and members of the university's Department of Public Safety (DPS).\n\"Most of them peacefully left, some of them were chanting,\" he said.\nUSC later posted on social media that the campus was open to students, faculty, and staff with valid identification, but warned that \"tents and related equipment\" were not allowed and could be confiscated.\nIn a statement on Sunday, Dr Folt said action had to be taken because the encampment was disrupting exams and preparations for commencement ceremonies, and the situation was \"spiralling in a dangerous direction\".\n\"My goals were to prioritise safety and return our campus and our surrounding community to normalcy,\" she said.\n\"We were determined to ensure our students could finish their exams without further disruption and that USC could host the commencement celebrations our graduates have worked hard to earn.\"\nDr Folt confirmed earlier this week that USC had started disciplinary investigations into an unspecified number of individuals who \"violated our policies and the law\", according to CBS. \nThe proceedings follow the arrests of 93 people at USC last month after police and protesters clashed on campus.\nThe clear out of the USC camp comes just days after riot police removed a similar encampment at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).\nEarlier this week, police in New York arrested 112 protesters after Columbia University sought help clearing the Manhattan campus. Police later confirmed that an officer accidentally fired his gun during the clear out.\nThere was also campus tension at USC in mid-April when it announced it would cancel a graduation speech by a valedictorian Muslim student, citing unspecified security concerns.\nThe move came after complaints that her social media presence was antisemitic.\nThe university then cancelled the main graduation ceremony, which was set to take place on 10 May. Other commencement events are still set to take place on campus this week.\nUS universities have been rocked by weeks of protests, with demonstrators calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza war, and for academic institutions to financially divest from Israel and companies who stand to make money from the conflict.\nThere have been demonstrations at nearly 140 institutions across 45 states and Washington DC since the protests started at Columbia University last month, according to a BBC tally.\nPolice have detained more than 2,000 people nationwide in the past fortnight at college rallies and protest camps.",
    "People in Bushmills have been \"left in shock\" following a serious assault in which a man was left nailed to a fence, an assembly member has said.\nA man was taken to hospital following the incident in a car park in the County Antrim town in the early hours of Sunday.\nThe man in his 20s was found with a nail through each hand at a fence.\nUUP leader Doug Beattie said the attack had \"all the hallmarks\" of being carried out by loyalist paramilitaries. \nPolice said paramilitary involvement was one key line of inquiry.\nTwo vans, one belonging to the injured man, were found on fire in the car park near Dundarave Park.\nGraffiti on nearby public toilets has been linked to the assault and arson.\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said the man was left with potentially life-changing but not life-threatening injuries.\nAssistant Chief Constable Bobby Singleton told BBC News NI it was a \"really shocking incident with levels of, almost, ultra violence\".\nSpeaking to BBC's Evening Extra programme, Mr Beattie described it as \"appalling and absolutely barbaric\".\nHe called for a stronger, multi-agency response to so-called paramilitary attacks. \n\"They are criminals and they need to be treated as such and I think we give them a little bit too much credibility because we don't have a better way of explaining them,\" the UUP leader said.\nSuch attacks are \"designed to instil fear into communities\", making it difficult for people to challenge those responsible, he added.\n\"[The] only way to challenge that is to use everything available to us - MI5, NCA, PSNI, HMRC - everything working together to dismantle these people\u2026 to make sure that we put them away and we put them away for a long time,\" he said.\nMr Beattie said agencies \"need to really look at this from top to bottom\" and criticised the use of segregated prison regimes in Northern Ireland.\n\"They go into prison and they come out with their title of brigadier and some sort of kudos within communities - that all has to end,\" he added.\nAlliance MLA Sian Mullholland described the attack as \"absolutely uncalled for and unjustifiable\".\nShe said that there was \"no place for vigilantism\", adding this was \"something that shouldn't be happening in 2024 in our society\".\n\"If people do have concerns, the police and the justice system as the only route that we have to follow - otherwise we're in the wild west,\" Ms Mulholland told BBC News NI.\nShe added the \"ripple effects\" of the \"barbaric\" attack would be felt beyond the victim, by the community in Bushmills, the emergency services who responded to the incident, and tourists staying in campervans in the car park during the attack. \nDUP MLA Paul Frew said: \"This criminal and violent behaviour cannot be tolerated in a peaceful community and has to be condemned.\"\nTUV leader Jim Allister expressed his \"dismay at the gruesome and cruel attack\".",
    "Drivers could incur penalty charges under London's ultra low emission zone (Ulez) rules if they stray off official diversion routes during this weekend's M25 closure.\nNational Highways said anyone ignoring the diversion signs while trying to find shorter routes could be subject to the \u00a312.50 daily fee if their vehicle does not meet emissions standards.\nThis can increase to a \u00a3180 fine if there is a failure to pay, reduced to \u00a390 if paid within 14 days.\nThe M25 will be closed in both directions between junctions nine and 10 in Surrey from 21:00 BST on Friday until 06:00 on Monday, 13 May.\nDrivers are being advised to avoid the area if possible.\nDiversion routes will take cars on a 19-mile journey on A roads, crossing from Surrey into London's Ulez area.\nNational Highways senior project manager Jonathan Wade said: \"Although the [Ulez] cameras will be active, no enforcement action will be taken.\n\"However, if you ignore the diversion signs and do your own thing, then if your vehicle's not compliant, you do run the risk of getting caught.\"\nThe RAC has advised drivers not to rely on sat navs as they may direct people onto roads where the Ulez is being enforced.\nThis weekend will see the second of five planned closures of the M25 on sections connecting with junction 10 as part of a \u00a3317m improvement project.\nThis phase will see concrete beams for a new bridge and a gantry lifted into place.\nTraffic on diversion routes during the last weekend closure in March \"weren't near as dire as you might expect\", Mr Wade said at the time.\nThis weekend, he said there was a \"very real\" risk the previous lack of disruption meant some motorists would not heed warnings to replan journeys.\nOther stretches of the M25 will also be disrupted this weekend due to ongoing work to retrofit additional emergency stopping areas on smart motorway sections.\nMr Wade said the work on junction 10 could be halted if it runs behind schedule, as \"we wouldn't jeopardise opening the M25 on Monday morning\".\nThree more weekend closures will take place between August and the end of the year. The project, due to be completed in summer 2025, will increase the number of lanes and make it easier to enter and exit the M25 at junction 10.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Former prison inmates said their lives were \"transformed\" by a new project which offered them a job after release.\nHMP Highpoint near Haverhill, Suffolk, in partnership with City and Guilds, launched the programme to teach inmates how to maintain railway infrastructure back in August 2022. \nOnce inmates are released, they then have a job lined up working in the industry that hopefully deters them from re-offending.  \nRyan Hull and Othman, former inmates, said the programme has given them a sense of relief. \nMr Hull, 31, initially didn't apply for the programme after thinking he wouldn't be accepted.\n\"It was quite a nice feeling because it guaranteed me a job,\" he explained.\n\"There was the anxiety of going to go back to the same lifestyle [once out of prison]\n\"When you live a certain lifestyle for so long it's hard to break the cycle.\n\"It offered me a different route away from that.\"\nMr Hull has already had great success in his employment.\nHe worked on the tracks for about six weeks before he was then promoted to a labour manager looking after 250 men.\n\"The railway has so much progression and so many different routes,\" Mr Hull added.\nLife is \"completely different\" he said from how it was before he went into prison.\n\"The money you earn is yours and you don't have to worry about a single thing because everything is above board and you are doing the right thing.\"\nOthman, 39, joined the programme in September 2022 just after it launched but experienced tough competition.\n\"It was very popular as it was new at the time,\" he said.\n\"I thought this was a step for me to go down the straight route and not come back to prison.\"\nOthman said he had \"a lot of anxiety\" about leaving prison but the course left him \"relieved\".\n\"I was able to meet employers and I studied the course, learnt the skills so upon release it was all up hill,\" he added. \nOthman now works on the Euston railway line and said life was \"peaceful\".\n\"It's the best thing ever, I wouldn't change it and I can't see myself ever going back to my old lifestyle,\" he said.\n\"The peace that you get when you know that you're doing right and my family is proud and happy for me.\" \nAlex Pond is the executive director of training at City and Guilds that offers vocational education and apprenticeships.\nMr Pond said City and Guilds had noticed a space in the rehabilitation industry that could improve the UK's skill shortage.\n\"At first it was quite difficult because there was no funding and the industry wasn't really engaged,\" he explained. \n\"But through breaking down doors and communication we quickly realised there was an appetite both in society and the industry.\"\nSince August 2022, 107 inmates have completed the programme and 87 of those are still in employment. \nMr Pond said the success in the rail industry has prompted them to consider other industries including construction and electrical.\n\"Three weeks ago I was coming out of a classroom in this very prison and a prisoner stopped me to say he had been in for 18 years,\" Mr Pond continued. \n\"He said this was the first time in 18 years that he had been given hope and he completed his course and he's now working on the railway.\n\"I am very proud.\"\nLisa Wheeler is the land-based activities manager at HMP Highpoint and the staff member who interviews the inmates for the programme.\nShe said when the inmates know they are getting employment on the outside \"they take it more seriously\".\n\"They know when getting out it is security for them,\" she said. \n\"It gives them a sense of pride - they're proud they've done the course, they're going out to work and they are providing for their family.\"\nMs Wheeler said the programme was so popular, inmates from other prisons have visited to take part. \n\"It's about someone believing in them and saying, actually, you can do this,\" she continued.\n\"A lot of the men at the end of the course say thank you, but I didn't do anything.\n\"I just gave them the tools to use and to better themselves and get a job.\"\nFollow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "\"I just thought it was normal,\" says Peter looking back at how volatile he used to be with his partner, Amy. \nThe 25-year-old admits he was \"quite controlling\", bombarding her with texts and phone calls demanding to know her movements. \nAnd if Amy didn't keep up with his communications, he says he would get \"quite angry\". He now feels ashamed of his behaviour. \nThe couple, whose names have been changed and identities protected, have been helped by charity For Baby's Sake.\nIt's one of the organisations being evaluated for a project aiming to identify the best way to support children and families experiencing domestic abuse.\nMore than 800,000 children in England and Wales have spent the past 12 months living in an abusive home, according to new research estimates.\nThis is more than the number of children who will start primary school this year - says Foundations, a leading research centre examining family support services.\nOverall, one child in every five has experienced some form of abuse at home, it says.  \nThe research centre is leading the \u00a32.6m study which aims to produce better evidence to ensure public money is spent on the most effective schemes.\n\"We're currently operating in the dark,\" says Dr Jo Casebourne, Foundations' chief executive. \n\"We just don't know what works to support children affected by domestic abuse, which feels completely unacceptable given the scale of children affected.\"\nAmy and Peter were referred to For Baby's Sake by social workers when they were expecting their first child.\nAt first, Amy, 23, admits she struggled to accept they had a problem, but she says \"looking back, it was really difficult\". \n\"I would always be waiting by the phone,\" she explains. \"And I'd be worried about doing certain things just in case I didn't answer the phone, in case it would upset him.\"\nPregnant mothers can be referred to the programme by GPs, midwives and other professionals when there are concerns about domestic abuse. For Baby's Sake will then work with both parents and support them for two years. \nAmy and Peter saw separate counsellors each week, which they say allowed them to start working through their problems before their daughter, Rosie, was born.\nPeter says it helped him understand the impact of witnessing domestic abuse and coercive control during his own childhood. \n\"I was thinking, 'there's no problems here,'\" he says. \"'This is how I've grown up, I've seen relationships handled. It's no one else's business'. But then upon some deeper reflection, I noticed the impact I was having on her, I realised things need to change.\"\nDomestic violence is a major reason for referrals to children's social care. And the police recorded more than 1.4 million domestic abuse-related incidents and crimes in England and Wales in the year to March 2023. \nIt can include physical, sexual or emotional abuse, including controlling behaviour. The Home Office calculates the social and economic cost of the damage it causes in England and Wales at about \u00a374bn a year.\nBut the impact on the lives of families and children is incalculable.\nAmy says the counselling made the couple realise the effect their relationship would have on their daughter, and that potentially it could \"result in the same things happening to her when she grows up\".\nWhen Rosie arrived, the For Baby's Sake team also worked with them as a family.\nTwo years on, she is a chatty, happy toddler and the couple are expecting a second child.\nWithout the help, Amy doesn't think their daughter would be \"thriving like she is now - and as happy as she is\".\n\"Now I know what's expected of me,\" says Peter. \"I know how to regulate my emotions. I know how to be the best dad and partner possible.\"\nJudith Rees, director of operations at For Baby's Sake, says they start seeing families when the mother is pregnant because research shows stress levels can have an impact on babies in the womb.\nThey work with \"the person causing harm and the person experiencing domestic abuse\" in a non-judgmental way, she says.\nAnother parent supported by For Baby's Sake is father-of-two Andrew. The charity helped him separate from his wife.\n\"I was getting abused mentally, not physically, and this is when I fled,\" he says.\nAs a man experiencing abuse, he says he found it particularly difficult to ask for help.  \n\"You feel worthless,\" he says. \"You try to disguise it and pretend that everything's fine and try to keep going. But it doesn't work that way. It destroys you.\"\nFor Baby's Sake says it recognises many couples don't stay together and it is important that they separate safely and in the best way for the children.\nIts own results show most of the families involved have babies born at full-term and a good birth weight, which gives those children a healthy start.\nJudith explains: \"We've also seen that in 75% of babies that are reaching [the age of] one in the last six months, there has not been a police call out to that home. So, there is a reduction in domestic abuse within home as w",
    "Many of Scotland's beaches are still bearing the scars of a series of severe storms that have blasted the country in the past eight months.\nSome have suffered a severe loss of sand and damage to adjacent structures such as paths and harbours.\nCoastal experts are warning that they may not have enough time to recover before the next bad weather comes along.\nLaura Douglas is a senior countryside ranger with the East Lothian Council Ranger service. \nShe said in her twenty-plus years of experience she had never seen this amount of damage along the coastline because of the weather, which has affected the area's famous sand dunes.\nLaura says: \"In some areas, particularly here at Gullane, we've had more than 10m depth of dune that's gone. \n\"We've been able to estimate that, particularly at Yellowcraig, that's probably 80 years' worth of dune development just because of the amount of material that's coming out.  \n\"Within that we've also lost a lot of the sea buckthorn that grows here on the dunes. A lot of that has been pulled out which holds the dunes together so it's having a massive impact on the dunes system here. \"\nThe loss of so much sand has exposed some remnants from World War Two, and the remains of an old military ship dating back to about 1881.\n Laura fears the frequency of storms has made the coastline particularly vulnerable.\n\"There isn't a lot of time in between storms for the sand dunes to redevelop. If the dunes system can't redevelop, the height won't be the same. There's a real change all the way along the coast.\"\nA few miles to the west at Edinburgh's Portobello beach, some locals are shocked by the amount of sand that has been washed away.\nColin Cornwall has lived here all his life, and regularly does a litter pick on the beach.  He says it is the worst he has seen.\n\"We've lost a lot of sand - six or seven feet in places. There's a 10ft drop at part of the defence wall and that was about three foot from the wall to the sand. \n\"My granddaughters used to jump down on to the sand - but now it's about a nine or 10ft drop. The sand hasn't just shifted along the beach - it's gone back out to sea.\n\"That's just not going to be washed back in by the tides.\"\nHe added: \"It's been bad before but and it's corrected itself without anyone being called in to do it - the beach has sorted itself out. I know there are people saying that it happens all the time - but not to this extent.  I'm very worried. It can't go on like this. \n\"Sand moves, I understand that, but here's no way that six or seven foot of sand is going to be miraculously washed back in.\"\nNamed storms such as Babet and Ciaran have battered Scotland over the past eight months, particularly on the East coast. \nThere have been eleven of them since September. The Scottish government's Dynamic Coast project is looking into the impact of the weather on our beaches.\nDr Alistair Rennie is the project manager. He says beaches have the capacity to repair to some extent, but the number of storms we've seen is making that recovery more difficult.\n\"That frequency really hurts because it doesn't give the natural systems quite enough time to recover and repair themselves.\n\"It is a concern and as we look at climate change we should expert more of these sorts of impacts. \n\"We need to invest in all forms of resilience, whether that's repairing sea walls or replenishing our beaches.  \n\"But also adapting - trying to get used to these sorts of storms and making ourselves more resilient as communities, as businesses and infrastructure owners.\"\nCouncils are now putting together coastal change adaption plans, to deal with the impact of rising tides and stormier seasons.\nIan Chalmers from East Lothian's structures and flooding team says they need a strategy for future severe weather.\n\"Some of the coastal erosion that we're experiencing is relatively unknown,\" he said.\n\"So we need to understand which areas are going to be worst affected and from that we can look at adaptations.\nBut what we are seeing is that we're losing sand on all of our beaches so where do we actually bring that sand in from? \n\"It's looking at that kind of longer term plan as to whether there's anything else we can do.\"\nHe also said that it would be essential to monitor and understand key risks along our coastlines, what kind of infrastructure is going to be affected, before putting measures in place.\nMany councils are keeping a close eye on how key beaches recover, and using Scottish government funding to plan ahead and prepare for the expected  storms of the future.\nBut there is a worry that beaches will not have enough time to repair before the next series of extreme weather events.",
    "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has carried out a reshuffle of ministers in cabinet positions, two months after winning the general election.\nThere was speculation ahead of the reshuffle about how diverse the new Cabinet would be, particularly considering women and people from ethnic minority backgrounds.\nWho's in what job? Here's a guide to the people that make up Mr Johnson's cabinet, with the latest new faces and who's changed places. \nNote: BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) is a term widely used in the UK to describe people of non-white descent, as defined by the Institute of Race Relations.\nThis is the second reshuffle for Mr Johnson, who became prime minister last July after winning a Conservative leadership election.\nBig names to have left cabinet on Thursday included Chancellor Sajid Javid, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom.\nThe make-up of the cabinet has also changed. The proportion of women in it has increased - but the actual number has fallen from eight to seven because some positions were closed.\nMembers of the cabinet are more than 10 times more likely to have gone to a private school than members of the public. \nUnder Mr Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, 70% of cabinet had not been privately educated, whereas almost 70% of Mr Johnson's new cabinet have.\nAccording to the Sutton Trust social mobility charity, every prime minister since 1937 who attended university was educated at Oxford - except for Gordon Brown.  Half of Mr Johnson's cabinet went to Oxford or Cambridge universities.\nThis compares with 27% of all Conservative MPs and 18% of Labour MPs.\nSir Peter Lampl, founder and chairman of the Sutton Trust, said December's election led to a seismic shift in the political landscape and Conservative MPs now represent a more diverse range of constituencies than before.\n\"Yet in terms of educational background, the make-up of Johnson's cabinet is still over 60% from independent schools,\" he said. \"Today's findings underline how unevenly spread the opportunities are to enter the elites and this is something Boris Johnson must address.\"\nMichael Gove is by far the most experienced of Mr Johnson's new top team.

The circumstances and death of our mother, Glenda Hoskins, will haunt us for the rest of our lives.\n\"His death, though, does bring to a close a very painful chapter for us all.\n\"We, and the public at large, should certainly feel safer that this repeat-offender psychopath will not strike again.\"\nEarlier this year, Mrs Hoskins' family said they had been contacted by officials who said Farrant was being considered for compassionate leave as he had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and could have months to live.\nA Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (Mappa) meeting in April looked at the case and the family said it had been passed to the prison governor to decide whether to make a formal application for his release.\nFarrant was jailed in November 1988 for 12 years for rape and other offences, but just weeks after he was released on 7 November 1995, he beat Ms Fidler at her home in Eastleigh, Hampshire.\nSix weeks later, he murdered accountant Mrs Hoskins at her luxury waterside home in Portsmouth by pushing her under the water in the bath.\nHe left her body in the attic, where it was found by her 15-year-old daughter Katie.\nAfter killing Mrs Hoskins, Farrant went on the run and was eventually found in the south of France.\nA Prison Service spokesman said: \"Victor Farrant died on 3 May at HMP Wakefield.\n\"As with all deaths in custody, the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman has been informed.\" \nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "The impact made by Ken Loach's 1969 South Yorkshire-based film Kes on British and world cinema is examined in a new book.\nKes tells the story of Billy, a working class boy from Barnsley who finds meaning in life when he takes a fledgling kestrel from its nest. \nBased on Barnsley author Barry Hines' novel A Kestrel for a Knave, the film won two Bafta awards and was nominated for a further three.\nDave Forrest, the new book's writer, said the film showed while places like Barnsley often went unseen in the media, they were still \"sites of beauty and potential\".\nProf Forrest, professor of film and TV studies at the University of Sheffield, is an expert in British film and the life and works of Barry Hines, who was born in Hoyland, Barnsley.\nHe said his new book, Kes, celebrated the film for \"its lasting legacy and its enduring cultural presence\".\nFar from being pessimistic, Kes pointed to a hopeful way of imagining Britain formed from the unique cultural contributions of its regions, towns and cities, Prof Forrest said.\nKen Loach's film \"shows us that places like Barnsley - often overlooked and maligned in mainstream culture - are sites of humour, creativity, beauty and potential\".\nAs part of his research when writing the book, Prof Forrest said he studied the Hines Archive - a collection of papers from Barry Hines, who died in 2016, which was donated to the University of Sheffield\u2019s library. \nThe collection included manuscripts of Hines' major works, including A Kestrel for a Knave, the basis for the film.\nProf Forrest said that papers in the collection revealed how Hines and Loach, collaborated to bring the story to the screen, as well proving to be an insight into how it was funded and produced.\n\u201cThe book explains the conditions that allowed the creativity at the heart of Kes to thrive,\" he said.\n\"It traces how working class artists, such as Barry Hines and the film\u2019s producer Tony Garnett, were able to draw on their own backgrounds to challenge the dominant ways of representing British society through film and television.\"\nThe book is part of the British Film Institute's Film Classics Series, which also includes books on other classic films such as The Searchers, starring John Wayne, and Raging Bull, directed by Martin Scorsese.\nProf Forrest said: \"It's hugely exciting that a film from our region, from South Yorkshire, is taking its place amongst the pantheon of established - and now recognised - film classics.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "No serving leader in the European Union has led their country for as long as Viktor Orban. \nSince 2010, he has transformed Hungary into what the European Parliament has denounced as a \"hybrid regime of electoral autocracy\". He appears uncertain how to describe his own invention, trying both \"illiberal democracy\" and \"Christian liberty\".\nEither way, he has learned to maintain and constantly strengthen his grip on power, but has found himself at the centre of the most difficult moment of his 14 years at the top.\nTwo close allies, the president and former justice minister, resigned over a pardon given to a man in a paedophile case.\nHe has repeatedly clashed with European Union colleagues on migration and the war in Ukraine.\nHungary also finds itself the only Nato member country not to have approved Swedish membership, even though its prime minister claims to be in favour. \nAndras Kosa entitled his biography of Viktor Orban, Man of Chaos, suggesting he has a way of presenting himself as the only solution to a mess created by others. \nWhen toxic red sludge from a bauxite mine engulfed a Hungarian valley and threatened the Danube shore in 2010, he rolled up his sleeves and stacked sandbags alongside firemen and volunteers.\nAfter 14 years of uninterrupted rule, Viktor Orban's personal charisma is an unquestionable ingredient of his success, alongside an ability to \"think on the ball\", as his ex-football trainer once remarked. \nFormer political adviser George Birnbaum remembers \"a very intellectually smart individual\" with a \"well educated, intellectually deep knowledge of things, which is very rare,\" he told the BBC.\nViktor Orban first made his mark on Hungary in the late 1980s, as the Soviet Union began to fall apart, setting up a political movement called Fidesz, or Alliance of Young Democrats.\nHe was still a law student at Bibo College in the capital, Budapest, when in 1989 he delivered an audacious, seven-minute speech calling on the Soviet Red Army to go home.\n\"If we believe in our own power, we are able to finish the communist dictatorship,\" he declared to an estimated quarter of a million Hungarians gathered in the city's Heroes' Square for the reburial of the man behind Hungary's failed uprising in 1956, Imre Nagy.\nReflecting on his words 10 years later, he said he had \"exposed everyone's silent desire for free elections, and an independent and democratic Hungary\".\nBut the democracy that replaced authoritarian rule has changed dramatically in recent years, with widespread complaints of backsliding. \nVeteran Hungarian-born journalist Paul Lendvai sees a staggering reversal in Viktor Orban - \"from one of the most promising defenders of Hungarian democracy into the chief author of its demise\".\nProf Andras Bozoki, a former culture minister, describes Hungary since 2010 as being \"the only one former consolidated liberal democracy in the EU that has reached the level of a non-democratic system as a hybrid regime\".\nFor a Central European leader whose political infancy was rooted in the fall of Russia's hegemony, it seems odd he has become the closest ally in the EU of a Russian president who views the Soviet collapse as the \"greatest geopolitical catastrophe\" of the 20th Century, and one who began the biggest war on European soil since World War Two.\nViktor Orban was born in 1963 an hour to the west of Budapest, the eldest of three sons whose father was an agricultural engineer and Communist Party member and whose mother was a special needs teacher. \nThey had no running water at the family home in Felcsut, a village of fewer than 2,000 people where he still owns a house.\nIn an 1989 interview, he recalls being beaten twice a year by his father, Gyozo, whom he describes as a violent man: \"When he beat me, he also shouted. I remember all this as a bad experience.\"\nNothing about his childhood suggested that he would go on to challenge the communist regime. He attended a grammar school and was involved in the Young Communist League.\nHis main interest was football, playing for his local club, FC Felcsut, and he remains highly enthusiastic about his childhood sport. Ten years ago, he inaugurated a controversial new stadium there called the Pancho Arena, where top-flight team Puskas Akademia play to audiences of a few hundred.\nIn the months before he went to university, he carried out his military service, where he says he turned down an approach from the communist secret services to become an informer. \nHe was 23 when he married fellow student Aniko Levai, whom he met at university. They have five children, four daughters and a son, Gaspar, who was trained by the British Army at Sandhurst and serves as an officer in the Hungarian army in Chad.\nAfter his 1989 speech to a large crowd in Heroes' Square, he went on to study liberal political philosophy briefly at Oxford. His scholarship was funded by Hungarian-born billionaire philanthropist George Soros, a benefactor he would turn against years later.\nWithin months he had ",

    "When Beth Harron told friends and teachers she wanted to be a funeral director, she was met with discouragement and told it was \"not a proper job\".\nHowever, at 21 years old, Beth has followed her dream and qualified as York's youngest female funeral director.\nShe is responsible for arranging and conducting funerals, alongside her mentor Hayley Owen. \nAlthough finding it to be a daunting job at first, Beth was happy to follow in the footsteps of her dad Frank, who was a trained embalmer.\nUnlike other families, Beth's household would openly discuss death and the thought of it had never been anything to be frightened of.\n\"I really got into it because of my dad,\" Beth said. \n\"Death was never a taboo subject in my house. It wasn't a big secret. \n\"I would always ask my dad what he had done at work that day and he took me along to the British Institute of Embalmers dinner dances when I was quite young.\"\nBeth spent her childhood attending funeral exhibitions and the older she got, the more interested she became in the industry. \nHowever, she faced some criticism from people at her school for wanting to become a funeral director. \n\"People out there need funeral directors so I didn't see the problem in wanting to do it,\" Beth said. \n\"But my teachers just looked at my grades and tried to steer me to do art instead. \n\"There was pressure put on me to go to university and people at school thought it was a bit weird.\n\"I just tried my hardest to get where I wanted to be and proved them all wrong.\"\nNow Beth has qualified, she said her friends thought it was \"amazing\" that she had accomplished what she wanted, but the details of her job were still too taboo to bring up in conversation. \n\"The biggest challenge for me was the academic side of getting a diploma,\" Beth said. \n\"Also, at the start, I was scared of letting people down because a family is trusting me to give their loved one a send off, which can only happen once. \n\"I was lucky because for my first ever funeral, I arranged it for the most lovely family and I was just honest with them that it was my first. \n\"When people are grieving, they just want the truth and for realistic expectations to be set.\"\nIn Beth's day-to-day duties she would meet with families to discuss their wishes and stay in touch with them until after the funeral. \n\"Sometimes it is tricky because a family might not know what they want and you have to figure out what will work for them,\" she said. \n\"People sometimes don't talk about funerals and their wishes because it's sad to think about but really, it takes a lot of the pressure off the loved ones left behind if you talk about it openly.\"\nBeth said small aspects, such as the funeral music, could mean the most to families on the day and was something they were conscious to get right.\n\"But it really is the most rewarding job,\" she added.\n\"Once a family said to me 'you have done everything my mum would have wanted' and it made me so proud.\n\"It can be hard to switch off from work sometimes, especially when you hear of what some families have been through, but it helps to know that I'm providing them with closure.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "Rishi Sunak has said the general election result is \"not a foregone conclusion\", despite \"a disappointing\" set of local elections for the Tories.\nSpeaking to broadcasters for the first time since the extent of Tory losses were clear, the PM said he was \"determined to fight\" on.\nThe party lost 470 council seats, as well as all but one mayoral contests. \nThe BBC has spoken to a number of Tory MPs who reflected an increasing pessimism in the party. \nOne senior figure in the party described the next months as \"managed decline\", and talked of the Conservatives waiting for their fate.\nBut there appears to be no prospect of a move against Rishi Sunak in the coming days.\nChallenged over his suggestion there could be a hung Parliament, Mr Sunak said: \"The independent analysis shows that whilst of course this was a disappointing weekend for us, that the result of the next general election isn't a foregone conclusion and indeed actually is closer than, or the situation is closer than, many people are saying - or indeed some of the opinion polls are predicting.\n\"And that's why I'm absolutely determined to fight incredibly hard for what I believe and for the future country that I want to build, and that's what I'm going to do.\"\nOne MP argued talk of hung Parliament was \"delusional\" and said the Tories would be lucky to win more than 200 seats out of 650 at the general election. \nJeremy Corbyn won 202 seats in Labour's drubbing in 2019. \nOthers are more pessimistic and think the number of Tory MPs could be similar to 1997, when John Major returned just 165. \nEven among those who think a hung parliament is possible, few are arguing the Conservatives have much chance of being the biggest party.\nOne former cabinet minister, themselves facing a challenge to keep their seat, said the case to voters would be they should vote Conservative to stop a Labour landslide. \nThe prime minister's job in the next few days will be to try and rally his party and persuade them all is not lost.\nBut as has been the case for some time now, there is still an active debate about what the party should do next.\nFormer prime minister Liz Truss is among those arguing privately that changing the leader would be mad but that the Conservatives need to offer \"fundamental reform\" - policy, not personnel.\nThere are figures on the right of the party agitating, and calls for the Conservatives to back leaving the European Convention on Human Rights. \nSome want a radical reshuffle or more moves to cut taxes.\nSome have suggested finding more wedge issues to highlight differences with Labour on cultural issues. \nFormer home secretary Suella Braverman is among those urging the prime minister to change course and adopt more right-wing policies, although she argued it would be \"impossible\" to change leaders so close to a general election. \nBut those in the centrist One Nation group agree with Andy Street, who lost the West Midlands mayoral contest by just 1,508 votes, that the party should focus on \"moderate, inclusive, tolerant Conservatism\". \nTalk of tacking to the right is \"barmy\", said one MP. \n\"They are in a minority.\"",
    "More than 1,400 people have signed a petition against a seasonal ban on dogs on an East Sussex beach.\nHastings Borough Council has introduced a Public Space Protection Order which bans dogs from two parts of Stade beach between 1 April and 30 September.\nPetition organiser Anne Pottle said the decision had \"left many of us without a beach to walk our beloved pets during these months\".\nThe council said many of the responses to a public consultation were in favour of the ban.\nThe exclusion areas are from the east side of Rock-a-Nore to the east side of Hastings Pier, and from the west end of Bottle Alley to opposite the Royal Victoria Hotel. \nAnyone in breach of the restrictions could face an on-the-spot fine of \u00a3100, or prosecution in court with a fine of up to \u00a31,000.\nThe petition, which is nearing its goal of 1,500 signatures, stated: \"This is not just about dog walking; it's about preserving our community spirit and ensuring inclusivity for all residents.\"\nSignatories are calling on the council to reconsider its decision and allow dogs access to the beach all year round.\nThey also want \"reasonable rules\" that respect both dog owners and non-dog owners.\nThe council said dogs were allowed on the beach at any time from the west of Hastings Pier to the west end of Bottle Alley, and from opposite the Royal Victoria Hotel to the border with Rother.\nA council spokesperson said: \u201cWe understand the need for spaces where dogs can be exercised and carried out a consultation to gather views on the new dog [order] before it came into effect.\n\"Many of the public responses concluded the original dog controls, which were in effect from 2008 to 2020, were fair.\n\"After reviewing the responses and report, the council\u2019s cabinet did not implement the winter restrictions but did extend the exclusion date to begin on 1 April when the town becomes busier with Easter holiday visitors.\"\nThe authority said from 1 October to 31 March dogs were allowed on all parts of the beach either on or off-lead.\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "The family of a grandfather whose body was left in a mortuary for 18 days have said they were traumatised by the experience.\nArthur Farrell, 89, died peacefully at Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham on 27 January, but his death was potentially asbestos-related and his body had to be examined. \nRelatives told the BBC a shortage of pathologists led to a two-and-a-half-week wait to get his body back and a delay in burying him. \nThe government said it was determined to reduce any delays grieving families may face when laying loved ones to rest. \nArthur's daughter Teresa Farrell, a community worker who runs a social enterprise in Chelmsley Wood, Solihull, urged government action. \nShe said the situation was especially upsetting as her Irish family's tradition was to lay relatives to rest as soon as possible. \n\"No one is taught to grieve but when you have to wait for your loved one's body it shouldn't be like that,\" Ms Farrell said. \n\"We shouldn't be suffering like this. No family should.\" \nThe grieving daughter said Mr Farrell, a former factory worker, was a pillar of the community and well known in his area. \nThe father, who left behind eight children, 16 grandchildren and 24 great grandchildren, was a founder member of Chelmsley Wood's grassroots Catholic Community Centre Football Club. \nAccording to the NHS, a post-mortem should be carried out as soon as possible, and usually within two to three days. \nThey are conducted privately, with councils and coroners hiring pathologists on a freelance basis. \nBut pathologists complete a wide range of medical tasks and Covid pandemic cancer backlogs mean many have so much NHS work that they don't have the time to do private work on top. \nMs Farrell said she was saddened ministers had not identified the issue years after the pandemic. \nShe urged the government to call up retired pathologists to help with backlogs. \n\"It was a horrendous time,\" she said. \"It was worse than having him pass.\n\"God knows how many bodies and families are waiting. We need closure straight away so we can move on with life.\" \nThe family still don't know Mr Farrell's exact cause of death three months after his passing. \nProfessor Mike Osborn, the former president of the Royal College of Pathologists, agreed 18 days was a long time to wait. \nBut he said he had heard of families waiting even longer, including parents who were waiting to bury children. \n\u201cThe College has raised concerns for many years about the unacceptable delays bereaved families face,\" he said. \n\"These delays often leave families experiencing a very poor service that is fragmented and disjointed.\" \nA government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are determined to ease the burden on grieving families and reduce any delays they may face when laying loved ones to rest.\n\u201cThis includes changing the law to make it faster and easier to establish a death is from natural causes without the need for a post-mortem, and reviewing pathologists\u2019 pay.\u201d\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X, and Instagram, Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk",

She was finally operated on in October but the hospital said she had no grounds for complaint because there had been no damage or deterioration in her health as a result of the delay. \n\u201cWhile most gallbladder operations are straightforward, there are factors that can turn them into a potentially complex procedure, so we have a duty of care to review an MRI prior to surgery,\" the spokesperson for the Practice Plus Group added.\n\"It is very rare that an operation wouldn\u2019t go ahead at this stage.\"\nThey also apologised for the inconvenience caused to Ms Kelsey.\nIn 2022, Ms Kelsey was due to undergo keyhole surgery to remove her gallbladder. \nDue to long waiting lists at Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton, she said she was referred to Shepton Mallet Hospital in February of that year. \nHer operation was initially delayed due to \"abnormal blood tests\" - something her GP assured her was common following a gallbladder attack, she added. \nIt comes after another patient, Abbie Hicks, from Axbridge in Somerset, was left in \"unbearable\" pain when her gallbladder surgery was repeatedly cancelled.\nThe 29-year-old was referred from Shepton Mallet Hospital when her condition became \"too serious\" for them to deal with. \nShe was originally due to be operated on in December 2023 but her surgery was not performed until 1 May. \nAfter spending months going back and forth with \"very little communication\", Ms Kelsey underwent a pre-operation MRI scan. \nShe said doctors told her the results were \"all fine\".\nTwo weeks later, Ms Kelsey was at Shepton Mallet Hospital and waiting to go into to surgery. \nDespite being prepared, the surgeon cancelled the procedure, citing \"serious abnormalities\" on the MRI scan as a concern. \nHe told her he had \u201cnever seen anything like it in his entire career\u201d, and warned that a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer could not be ruled out - which is what Ms Kelsey's  father died of. \nAt the time of the surgery, Covid restrictions were in place and family and friends were prohibited to be on the ward. \n\u201cAt this point, I had this meltdown,\" Ms Kelsey said. \n\"I was told this information when I was in a very vulnerable position being already prepped for surgery, suffering from nerves and with no support from my family available to process important and potentially life changing information.\"\nIn the following weeks, Ms Kelsey was referred back to Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton, where a multi-disciplinary team met to discuss her MRI scan. \nThey concluded that there was nothing abnormal in the results. \nMs Kelsey underwent the surgery in October. \nShe said the procedure went \"smoothly\" and the only issue was an inflamed gallbladder. \nAn investigation into her experience at Shepton Mallet Hospital was carried out following Ms Kelsey's complaints. \nThe hospital concluded that no mistake had been made, and there were no grounds for a legal case as no further damage or deterioration to her health had been caused. \n\u201cWe complained to the hospital and it went on for months,\" she said.\n\"They came back with various responses and they didn\u2019t really answer our questions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s left me furious and frustrated, but we realised there\u2019s nothing we can do and we had to let it go,\" Ms Kelsey said. \nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

Please tell me the truth.'\"\n\"And so they confirmed it over the telephone in November 1983, to say 'yes', it was HIV.\n\"I remember my teeth shaking and I hadn't smoked for ages and I rushed out the garage and said to my husband give me a [cigarette].\"\nMs Woodridge remembers coming home from school and finding her \"Mum was just sat on the floor crying\".\n\"We were told that we couldn't talk to anybody about it.

    "Eighty years ago, in the shadows of World War Two, Parliament held a debate on the chronic shortage of housing.\nHundreds of thousands of homes had been destroyed. High explosives and incendiary devices blew apart large areas.\nFires finished off what the bombs hadn't flattened.\nMany Londoners were made homeless in the Blitz, the eight months of intensive bombardment in 1940 and 1941.\nSome of the displaced went to camp in Epping Forest - and more than 180,000 slept on the underground platforms of the Tube each night.\nThese were barely even short-term solutions. Britain needed something more.  \nAnd so, with the Housing (Temporary Accommodation) Act 1944, the prefab was born.\nPrime Minister Winston Churchill announced a 12-year plan for the building industry when peace came. \nThe Ministry of Works had come up with Emergency Factory Made Houses, or EFMs.\nThey devised an ideal floor plan of a one-storey bungalow with two bedrooms, inside toilets, a fitted kitchen, a bathroom and a living room.\nThe homes would be detached and surrounded by a garden to encourage householders to grow fruit and vegetables, and would have a coal shed.\nSoon better known as prefabs than EFMs, the homes were cheap to produce and, for many, an improvement on their previous living conditions.\nIn May 1944, an exhibition was held at the Tate Gallery to display prefab designs, including the American (designed by the US Federal Housing Administration), the Uni-Seco (a kit that could be assembled in various combinations) and the Airoh (to be produced by aircraft manufacturers immediately after the war).\nArchitect Sam Webb was six when he went to the Tate show after his home was bombed.\nHe told the Prefab Museum: \"It was all so clean and bright. This house was warm. Ours was so cold that in winter you didn't want to put your feet down the bottom of the bed unless you had a warmed-up brick wrapped in a towel. \n\"There were huge queues to enter each house. People just waited patiently in line. The war had trained them for that, queuing for buses, queuing for trains, or coal, or food. We stood in line for everything.\"\nIn the first decade after the war, nearly 500,000 homes were built using some form of prefabrication.\nOriginally intended as an interim solution until the country could return to building permanent homes with traditional materials, 156,623 prefab bungalows were built between 1945 and 1949.\nEach was expected to last for a decade. About 8,000 remain today. A few dozen are listed by Historic England, and eight decades after they were produced, people still live in them.\nWartime and post-war shortages and austerity meant designers and builders had to develop innovative solutions - materials for prefabs included precast concrete, aluminium, asbestos cement, timber and steel.\nIn 1943 the Ministry of Works established an experimental demonstration site in Northolt, west London, where 13 houses were built to show various types of materials, plans and construction.\nThese little houses with all the mod cons, full of light and with heating systems (the kitchen and the bathroom came in one part with a wall in between, which contained the piping for both rooms) formed thought-out estates, with footpaths and greens.\nPriority was given to families with young children, and those of servicemen. And everybody was starting afresh with the same sort of home.\nOf course, when homes were destroyed in bombing raids, not just the bricks and mortar were lost - furniture was too.\nIn 1940, a Timber Supplies Committee ended the unrestricted supply of wood for civilian use and considered the problem of replacing fixtures, fittings and furnishings.\nBy October 1941, only a sixth of the total supply of timber was available to the civilian sector - and by September 1942 the manufacture of civilian furniture was prohibited, except under licence. \nThe Board of Trade selected the firms to receive the wood and imposed production programmes.\nA small allocation of wood - and only of the poorest quality - was given to the making of civilian furniture, with the Utility Furniture Scheme being introduced at the end of 1942. \nPeople could only buy the furniture if they had a permit, which were issued to newly married couples, expectant couples, bombed-out householders and those with children who had outgrown their cots. \nIn 2009, six prefabs were listed in south-east London - they are part of the largest surviving post-war prefab estate in England.\nBuilt between 1945 and 1946, the bungalows on Persant Road in the Excalibur Estate, Catford, are a mixture of types and were constructed by Italian and German prisoners of war.\nHistoric England cites them as a \"unique example of prefab estate planning on a large scale\" in what was one of the most heavily bombed boroughs in the capital. \nAnd architecturally, the Uni-Secos are of interest as structures built using the innovative system of prefabrication displaying \"modernist influences in their wrap-around corner windows and appearance o",

    "Kim Farthing grew up as a deaf child in hearing world.\nAfter working as a cleaner at Northgate High School in Ipswich, a state comprehensive, she realised she could use her own experience of struggling in mainstream education to help others.\nShe is now the school's interventions co-ordinator. Here, in her own words, she describes that journey:\nI was born in Ipswich in 1991.\nHearing loss is genetic following my maternal line - my mum is also hearing impaired as is my nine-year-old daughter.\nI've had my hearing aids since I was three. I was never given the opportunity to learn [sign language at school] when I was diagnosed. \nAnyone with a hearing impairment went to a specialist school, but my parents said \"no\".\nI went through the mainstream system which I found very difficult, as there was no support, so I was left to manage as best as I could. \nI passed all my GCSEs and A Levels, but it was really hard.\nI always say I'm deaf, but I was raised in a hearing world.\nLooking back now, I think it was a lack of knowledge. I would be put in a class with hearing children and always taught in exactly the same way as them. \nAttitudes have changed a lot, I think. Back then it was something they wanted to hide, along with a lot of other SEN [Special Educational Needs] things.\nIt was something to be put aside and not to think about it.\nI started working at Northgate in 2010, aged 19, on the cleaning team.\nDuring the Covid pandemic I worked on site during the school day.\nThis was very difficult with everyone wearing masks (life in general was very hard during this time!).\nFollowing Covid I wanted a change, so I took a job as a teaching assistant with the Learning Support team.\nI loved this role, and it taught me more about SEN needs, but also allowed me to talk about my needs with the pupils, who were very helpful.\nI noticed a gap in staff knowledge surrounding hearing impairment and was given permission to address it.\nI've provided training sessions for new and current staff, given talks at department and management meetings, and ran a British Sign Language (BSL) and awareness session at the school's Community Day last year.\nI've made posters, displays and leaflets, updated resources for staff, assisted with a BSL group and created assembly packages for students.\nI now manage interventions at Northgate, providing support in maths and English as well as running the Accelerated Reader programme.\nHearing impairment work is still very much ongoing. \nI am now looking into visiting local primary schools to offer staff training. \nI want to use my platform to help provide for others the things that I didn\u2019t have in school.\nAs told to BBC reporter Jon Wright.\nFollow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Concerns have been raised the Government of Jersey will not be able to meet its pledge to provide free nursery care for two and three years old.\nIt was one of the government's top pledges announced last month, although it acknowledged there would be challenges to meet, including increasing the number of nursery spaces on the island and recruiting more staff.\nSusana Rowles, a political commentator, said the plans would be \u201cvery difficult to achieve\u201d in the time that the government had in office.\nDeputy Rob Ward said the government was looking at a range of solutions including increasing the hours its primary school nurseries open.\nFiona Vacher, executive director of the Jersey Child Care Trust, said she understood why the government was being cautious in giving timelines.\nHowever, she added: \"I think we are a way off achieving universal access for all two to three years olds to go nursery.\"\nThe trust funds nursery places for two to three year olds who are living in poverty or have developmental delays.\nMs Vacher said she felt there needed to be \"investment in our workforce, to make sure our two to three years old are having a really good experience if they are going to nursery\".\nAt the Tiny Tots Playgroup in St Helier, parents and grandparents welcomed the announcement.\nParent Leanne Ozard said: \"Currently parents are having to choose between having a mortgage or give up their career to stay at home to look after children and that shouldn\u2019t be something we have to choose between.\"\nCharmaine O\u2019Neill, who was attending the playgroup with her granddaughter, said: \"Definitely there just isn\u2019t enough over here, and everyone is left to the grannies to look after the children and there is no space.\n\"It's very difficult to find a space and very expensive.\"\nCurrently the government funds 30 hours of nursery provision for children in their pre-school year.\nIt has not been able to offer a timeline of when its plan could be put into place.\nMrs Rowles said: \"Without clarity of when they would start to offer universal nursery care for two-three years it will be hard for nurseries and parents to plan.\"\nShe said: \"If we are talking about a government that is going to be here for two years and if the initial provision hasn\u2019t been announced in terms of what the deadline for that is, then it will be difficult for nurseries to increase their provision in 18 months.\"\nMr Ward, Minister for Education and Lifelong learning, said the plans did not go into the Common Strategic Policy without a great deal of thought.\nHe said: \"This is a realistic approach, it\u2019s saying let\u2019s get the provision developed as quickly as we can before we make any universal offer which isn\u2019t realistic at the moment, so that\u2019s what we want to do.\"\nThe minister said he was exploring how to expand the offer at primary school nurseries.\nCurrently there are 188 pre-school spaces not being used in government primary school nurseries, which finish mid-afternoon and close in the school holidays.\nThe government hopes by increasing the hours these nurseries open then more parents will use them.\nMr Ward said: \"If we can get a mix of provision in those places to extend those hours, then we can fill them and use them effectively and that\u2019s how you free up other places, so that\u2019s the kind of project we will be developing in the coming months and years.\"\nFollow BBC Jersey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "Plans for 82 homes in a Leicestershire village have been unveiled after being approved by a government inspector.\nDevelopers won an appeal for the new estate on the 4.86-acre site, off Lychgate Lane, in Burbage, last year.\nHinckley and Bosworth Borough Council rejected the application on the grounds of high levels of housing development in the village.\nThe government planning inspector said the benefits for new housing in the borough outweighed the adverse effects.\nThe new estate, named Chestnut Acres, would consist of two, three and four-bed properties, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS).\nDevelopers Avant Homes East Midlands, which said 17 of the houses were classed as \"affordable\", has now submitted more detailed plans to the borough council.\nThe authority's planning committee had refused the planning application, with a councillor arguing the village had become the \"go-to place\" for developers.\nGovernment planning inspector Benjamin Clarke, who approved the development, said: \"The proposed development would result in a notable increase in the overall level of built form at the expense of the site's existing open and verdant character.\" \nHe also recognised concerns about the amount of development taking place in Burbage.\nHowever, Mr Clarke said the impact of the new estate could be offset by legal and financial agreements with the developer. \nAvant has now confirmed it would contribute about \u00a3900,000 towards local facilities and services, including education and healthcare.\nManaging director Ben Felton said: \"With easy access to local amenities, Leicester and the wider East Midlands region, we think Burbage is an excellent place for us to build.\n\"We now look forward to Hinckley and Bosworth Borough Council considering our plans.\"\nWork is due to start in early 2025, with the first new residents expected to move in later that year.\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "We perhaps should not be surprised that the prime minister has seized upon an extrapolation of Thursday's local election results that pointed to the prospect that the general election could result in a hung parliament in which Labour would be the largest party. \nSuch a scenario, he argued, would mean that Sir Keir Starmer would be \"propped up in Downing Street\" by the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens.\nMany Conservative MPs (and indeed Labour ones too) believe that a poster their party ran in the 2015 election, when the polls were pointing to a hung parliament, showing the then Labour leader, Ed Miliband, in the pocket of the former SNP leader, Alex Salmond, played a key role in delivering the Conservatives a surprise overall majority.\nWhether or not that is what happened is not easy for analysts to say. However, British Election Study data collected at the time did not show any marked swing away from Labour among those who came to believe that Mr Miliband would be willing to do a deal with the SNP.\nBut, in any event, how realistic is it to use the share of the vote won by the parties in local elections to anticipate what might happen in an immediate general election? There are certainly two potential difficulties.\nAlthough the ups and downs in party performance in local elections often run in parallel with the rises and falls in party support in the polls, some people (around one in five) vote differently in local elections than they would in a general election. \nAs a result the divergence between the level of support parties win in a local election and how well they would perform in a general election has become more marked.\nNowadays the Liberal Democrats consistently outperform their national standing in the local ballot boxes. The same has also come to be true of the Greens, while independent candidates have also enjoyed some notable success in recent years. Labour, in contrast, often do less well in local elections.\nMeanwhile, the party political battle in Scotland is now very different from that in England - and the outcome of the current battle north of the border between Labour and the SNP could be crucial to the result of the next election. English local elections do not tell us much about what will happen north of the border.\nThese developments have made discerning the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election more difficult. \nAt the same time, there are two particular features of the results of this year's local elections that make it especially difficult.\nFirst, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have now switched to Reform than to Labour. But Reform were only on the ballot paper in one in six council wards. So, it may well be the case that people who would vote Reform if there had been a Reform candidate locally stuck with the Tories instead.\nCertainly, Conservative support fell more heavily where Reform did stand. In the BBC's sample of key wards the party's support fell by 19 points in these wards - compared with 11 points in wards where Reform did not stand. Labour, in contrast, did rather better where Reform stood.\nThat 19-point drop matches the 19-point fall in the average level of Conservative support in the polls since May 2021. That figure may represent a better guide to the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election.\nSecond, the local election results confirm the message from last year's contests that the geography of party support has changed to the Conservatives' disadvantage.\nThe party's support fell more heavily in wards it was trying to defend. \nAt the same time, some voters seemingly voted for whichever party was best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. Labour's support increased most (at the expense of the Liberal Democrats) in wards where they started off second to the Conservatives, while the Liberal Democrats advanced most (and Labour did less well) in wards where were the principal challengers locally.\nIndeed, it is these two patterns that help explain why the Conservative Party lost nearly one in two of the council seats it was trying to defend. Conservative MPs would be unwise to assume that the same fate could not also befall them.\nSir John Curtice is Professor of Politics, University of Strathclyde, and Senior Fellow, National Centre for Social Research and 'The UK in a Changing Europe'.

    "Florals? For spring? Groundbreaking.\nThis year's Met Gala theme would not have impressed The Devil Wears Prada's demon magazine editor Miranda Priestly, but it hasn't stopped a string of stars from walking the green carpet in their garden-inspired garments. \nA-listers were invited to be imaginative with the 2024 dress code, The Garden of Time, which was inspired by a short story of the same name by JG Ballard. \nMost stars took it literally, taking inspiration from flowers, petals, branches and leaves, while others played around with the short story's themes of time and history. \nHere are 26 of the most eye-catching outfits: \nNormally when stars talk about wearing ice, they're referring to diamonds. In Camila Cabello's case, however, she's referring to actual frozen water.\n\"My hands are really cold,\" the singer said, explaining she was planning to pass the ice on to someone else after she reached the top of the stairs. \"I can't feel my hands.\"\nThe large block of ice featured a rose in the centre and accessorised her Ludovic de Saint Sernin gown, which reportedly featured 250,000 crystals and took more than 450 hours to make. \nThe Bear star Ayo Edebiri and Schitt's Creek actor and writer Dan Levy both opted to keep their floral designs on the down low, with outfits that looked traditional from the top but bloomed from the waist down. \nEdebiri wore a backless column dress by Loewe with a hand-embroidered floral pattern intended to create the illusion of gradual blossoming.\nSimilarly, Levy wore what looked like a classic suit from the top half, but which faded a into a bright floral motif lower down.\nWe've got to hand it to her, Demi Moore had one of the best looks of the night, even if she forgot to bring a bow to go with her arrows.\nThe actress's velvet dress, designed by Harris Reed, was adorned with huge pink peonies made from vintage archival wallpaper.\nReed said the dress took more than 5,000 hours to make, adding that it was designed so the flowers would appear to decay as the design flowed further down the dress. \nSinger Lana Del Rey had not attended the Met Gala since 2018, so decided she needed to give her fashion sense a root-and-branch overhaul. \nShe wore a corseted dress in silk, double georgette and tulle. The dress referenced an Alexander McQueen piece from nearly two decades ago, brought up to date by the fashion house's current creative director Se\u00e1n McGirr.\nBut the highlight was the special headpiece, which made use of natural hawthorn branches. \nA glowing Lea Michele walked the carpet wearing a Rodarte turqoise gown with a tulle cape, two months after announcing she was pregnant for the second time.\nThe Glee star and her husband Zandy Reich, who have a three-year-old son, Ever Leo, said they were \"overjoyed\" to be expecting again.\nIf you ever need someone to bring you flowers in the pouring rain, Nicki Minaj has got you covered. \nThe singer's yellow Marni mini-dress was adorned with 3D metal flowers in varying shapes and sizes - one of the most colourful and committed looks of the night.\nHer look was completed by a bob hairstyle with an arched bubble ponytail. \nDid Bad Bunny look as if he had yanked his suit jacket out of the sewing machine before the tailor had actually finished making it? Yes. But he still looked great.\nThe rapper and singer wore a Renaissance-inspired custom Maison Margiela suit in navy blue with white threading which resembled pinstripes.\nHe carried a floral bouquet made from the same material as his jacket, reportedly intended to resemble a mixture of roses, Flor de Maga (the national flower of Puerto Rico), and the flax plant, which Sleeping Beauty pricked her finger on in the fairy tale. \nThe latter is a reference to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's new exhibition Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion, which explores seminal pieces spanning four centuries. \nA large roll of non-stick tinfoil couldn't hold a candle to Mamma Mia actress Amanda Seyfried, who wore a shiny metallic gown featuring flower appliques.\nBut as eye-catching as the Elizabeth Stewart dress was, all eyes were on Seyfried's matching platinum hair and Chaumet gemstone headpiece by M\u00e9lodie Nacr\u00e9e, which resembled leaves on a vine.\nThe singer and rapper wore a white suit by Luar, which featured asymmetrical panels of sparkly silver sequined fabric, and curved lines of buttons.\nIn terms of adherence to the dress code, we think the outfit could have done with a few more marigolds, but we'll settle for the single white rose which decorated his collar. \nSpeaking on the green carpet, Lil Nas X told the BBC's Brandon Drenon he had reconsidered his attendance earlier in the day, but had ultimately decided: \"You know what, I wanna go, this is always a really nice opportunity to be a part of the cool kids club.\" \nWhy dress to look like flowers and trees, when you could pay tribute to the birds who fly among them? \nWhen actress Rebecca Ferguson first appeared at Monday's Met Gala, she was draped in a plain black c",

    "With his signature bombast, former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte told a crowd of cheering supporters in January that his successor was a drug addict. The man who replaced him, Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr, shot back, saying the former leader must have hurled the insult in an opioid-fuelled haze. \nThat was the strongest sign yet of a crack in the alliance that catapulted Mr Marcos to a historic win in 2022. His ally: Vice-President Sara Duterte, the former president's daughter. \nFrom the start, analysts had predicted a divorce between the two most powerful Philippine political dynasties. The likelihood only increased amid public spats and growing differences over political agendas. \nAnd yet splitting up might not be an option for Mr Marcos and Ms Duterte, who sold themselves to voters as the \"UniTeam\". \nCracks in the alliance \nSara Duterte had been leading opinion polls as a possible presidential candidate when she announced in 2021 that she was running for the vice-presidency. \nHer father made his displeasure clear. She was seen as his political heir - she was the mayor of Davao City, a post Mr Duterte held for many years before he became president in 2016. \nBut her alliance with Mr Marcos, the son of the disgraced former Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, did not surprise analysts. They said both candidates risked defeat by splitting their support - hers in the south, his in the north - if they ran against each other. Together, they united their respective strongholds and won a clear majority.\nMany expect Ms Duterte to run for president in 2028. The constitution bars Mr Marcos from seeking a second six-year term - a restriction that he is trying to remove, the Dutertes allege. \nMr Marcos says he supports reforms that will ease rules for foreign businesses, drawing more investment and jobs to the South East Asian nation of 100 million people. But his critics say it is a \"sinister\" ploy to usher in political changes that will allow him to run for the top job again. The fact that the term-limit was imposed in 1986, after his father was ousted from power by a popular revolt, has only added to the chorus of protest. \nBut this is not the only source of contention. Mr Marcos has made comments that appeared to be critical of Mr Duterte's violent war on drugs that claimed thousands of lives and turned him into an international pariah. Rights groups say killings have continued, but police say there have been fewer of them under the new president. \nMr Marcos has also embraced the US, reversing his predecessor's pivot to Beijing. He has granted American troops wider access to military bases, scaled up annual military drills and has used the Philippines' strategic position in the Pacific to shore up support not just from Washington, but also Japan. And he hasn't backed down from a deadly cat-and-mouse game with the Chinese in disputed waters. \nMr Duterte, on the other hand, had refused to even invoke the Philippines' victory in an international tribunal against Beijing's South China Sea claims during his term. He sought closer ties with China, partly in response to the condemnation from the West over his drug war. \nThere were smaller spats too. Ms Duterte was appointed the education minister in the Marcos government, despite publicly saying she wanted to be the secretary of defence. She said she accepted it to avoid any talk of a rift. She was heavily scrutinised by parliament last year over her request for millions of pesos in \"confidential funds\" - discretionary spending that government agencies are allowed. Then Mr Marcos' allies cut her discretionary budget, a move that was both embarrassing and infuriating. \nThrough all this, the two have avoided attacking each other directly - perhaps signalling a united front for now. But others on either side clearly want the upper hand in the court of public opinion, says political scientist Cleve Arguelles, president of polling firm WR Numero. \nIn April, after the two leaders accused each other of being drug addicts, First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos sat down for a candid interview on YouTube. \nShe said she was \"hurt\" that Sara Duterte did not intervene when her father called the president a \"junkie\". In a swift video reply, Ms Duterte said the first lady's \"personal feelings\" were not part of her job.\nMrs Marcos has never discussed politics publicly. This surprising interview was an attempt to \"beat the Dutertes at their own game\", Mr Arguelles says. \nShe cannot match Mr Duterte's shocking comments - he's notorious for sexist remarks, cursing at Pope Francis and former US president Barack Obama. But she can and did invoke a soap opera character that is reviled yet watched by millions of Filipinos - the traitor.\n\"The first lady is trying to use emotions rather than framing it in other ways. We have notions of treachery, the family being hurt,\" Mr Arguelles said. \"It's like a soap opera.\"\nHe says it's very different to the Dutertes, who are \"masters of... very public ",
    "Humza Yousaf has signed a letter to the King tendering his resignation as Scotland's first minister after John Swinney was elected as the SNP's new leader.\nMr Swinney, 60, is expected to become first minister later.\nThe former deputy first minister has pledged to write a \"new chapter\" in the party's history.\nMr Yousaf last week said he \"paid the price\" for the way he ended the power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens.\nIn his letter to King Charles, the Glasgow Pollok MSP said his resignation would take effect from the start of parliamentary business on Tuesday.\nMr Yousaf said it had been a pleasure to serve the King and the people of Scotland as first minister.\n\"Throughout my time as first minister, I have been most grateful for your counsel and the kindness you have shown to both Nadia and I,\" he added in his letter to the King.\nMr Yousaf will make a final speech to MSPs later before they vote to choose Scotland's seventh first minister in 25 years.\nAfter tendering his resignation he described the role of first minister as a \"phenomenal honour\".\nMr Yousaf said: \"As a young Muslim boy, born and raised in Scotland, I could never have dreamt that one day I would have the privilege of leading my country - people who looked like me, were not in positions of political influence, let alone leading governments when I was younger.\"\nThe former SNP leader added he was proud of achievements such as the council tax freeze and the removal of peak rail fares.\nMr Yousaf concluded: \"From the backbenches of the Scottish parliament, I will continue to champion the rights and the voices of those who are often not heard, be they at home or abroad.\"   \nMr Yousaf was sworn in as Nicola Sturgeon's successor last March after a narrow win over ex-finance secretary Kate Forbes in the SNP leadership contest.\nDuring his first year in the post and he faced challenges ranging from the police investigation into SNP finances to ex-health secretary Michael Matheson's \u00a311,000 data bill.\nThe Green-led deposit return scheme and the highly protected marine areas scheme were both ditched. The Scottish government also lost a court battle with the UK government over its flagship gender recognition reforms, which led to the legislation being shelved.\nMr Yousaf's leadership came to an end after he scrapped the power-sharing Bute House Agreement with the Scottish Greens, which left the SNP with a minority in parliament.\nFacing motions of no confidence in him and his government, Mr Yousaf confirmed he was standing down last Monday.\nIn his resignation speech, he said he had \"clearly underestimated\" the hurt he had caused the Greens by ending the agreement.\nJohn Swinney was the only candidate to replace Mr Yousaf as new SNP leader.\nThe Perthshire North MSP, who previously led the SNP between 2000 and 2004, told supporters on Monday that the party In a had been through a \"rough time\".\nHe said he did not intend to reinstate the power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens and would aim to lead a \"moderate centre-left\" minority government.\nMr Swinney is expected to be chosen as Scotland's new first minister later on Tuesday. \nHe will need to be sworn in at the Court of Session in Edinburgh before officially taking up the post.\nAfter the formalities Mr Swinney can then get on with the business of appointing his cabinet, before going on to to take First Minister's Questions on Thursday.",
    "The red flags start at Belgrade\u2019s Nikola Tesla Airport and run all the way along the motorway into the centre of Serbia\u2019s capital.\nThis is Serbia\u2019s way of showing that it is proud of its \u201cironclad friendship\u201d with China \u2013 and welcoming Xi Jinping to Belgrade.\nAt the Western City Gate, more commonly known as the Genex Tower, one entire tower is draped in China\u2019s national colours.\nJust for good measure, there is a billboard for Hisense, the Chinese home appliances manufacturer which opened a refrigerator factory in Valjevo, western Serbia, last year.\nIn some parts of Europe, the Chinese president\u2019s itinerary might have raised eyebrows. After all, it is not often that Serbia finds itself as part of a three-stop tour by an international leader of such stature.\nBut Serbia has been deepening its relationship with China in recent years, even as it continues with negotiations to join the European Union.\nMr Xi is likely to use his trip to highlight his criticisms of Nato. His visit coincides with the 25th anniversary of the US airstrikes on China\u2019s embassy in Belgrade. And in an editorial for the Serbian newspaper, Politika, the president made it clear that feelings over that incident still run high.\n\u201cWe should never forget,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such tragic history to repeat itself.\u201d\nThat kind of rhetoric resonates in Serbia, where the vast majority of people oppose Nato membership. That is a key factor in why this stop on Mr Xi\u2019s European tour makes perfect sense.\nCommercial connections are also a factor. The two countries signed a free trade agreement last year, building on a \u201ccomprehensive strategic partnership\u201d in 2016 \u2013 the year of Mr Xi\u2019s previous visit to Serbia.\nChina now claims to be the largest source of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Serbia. Its ambassador, Li Ming, says that Hisense, along with mining company Zijin and tyre manufacturer Linglong, provide 20,000 jobs.\nUN trade figures actually put China in fifth place on the foreign direct investment list, behind Germany, Italy, the US and Russia.\nNonetheless, the Chinese investments are eye-catching \u2013 and only likely to increase. Serbia has just taken delivery of its first Chinese electric high-speed trains. They will eventually run alongside Swiss-made rolling stock on the Belgrade-Budapest railway, which is being reconstructed with Chinese expertise and finance.\nAnd that is just the start. Serbia\u2019s infrastructure minister, Goran Vesic, says Chinese partners will work on other infrastructure, including roads, bridges, tunnels and sewage. \u201cThere is really a lot of room for co-operation with Chinese companies,\u201d he told Serbia\u2019s national broadcaster, RTS.\nNo wonder Serbia\u2019s president, Aleksandar Vucic, is planning to personally serve the finest wines his country has to offer to his Chinese counterpart during a banquet in Mr Xi\u2019s honour.\nNoting that within five years Serbian wine will face no import tariffs in China, Mr Vucic told China Central Television that Serbian wines were \u201cnot as expensive as [those] in France\u201d and that he believed Mr Xi was \u201cgoing to like\u201d his selections.\nThis was perhaps a gentle dig at Emmanuel Macron, who hosted Mr Xi for the first stop on his European trip. The French president\u2019s offering was a bottle of R\u00e9my Martin Louis XIII cognac, which would cost the best part of \u20ac5,000 in Belgrade.\nA trip to the Pyrenees was also included in the charm offensive \u2013 to sweeten pleas by Mr Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for Mr Xi to ensure more balanced trade with Europe and influence Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine.\nAfter Belgrade, the next stop for China\u2019s president will be Budapest, where he will meet his strongest ally among the leaders of EU member states, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.\nChinese investments are also a strong factor there \u2013 with a factory for electric car giant BYD among the projects that buttress Mr Orban\u2019s resistance to the EU consensus on everything from migration to providing arms to Ukraine.",
    "After months of stalemate, the search for peace in Gaza has reached a critical stage. UN chief Antonio Guterres says it is a \"decisive moment for the Palestinian and Israeli people and for the fate of the entire region\". \nThere seems to be common ground between most sides about the principles: a ceasefire should take place alongside the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. Various draft agreements have been drawn up, setting out a complex process of how it would all work. \nThere is some disagreement over the detail of what should happen to whom and when and in what order. Israeli officials say, for example, that its female soldiers should be released earlier than envisaged. \nThey also say the texts should be clearer that the first 33 hostages to be released must be alive and are worried about not having a veto over which Palestinian prisoners would be released. \nThese are issues that could potentially be surmounted through negotiation. \nBut there is a more fundamental sticking point about a core principle that may be harder to get past and that is when the war should end. \nThe opening words of the draft agreement - supported by Hamas - declares that there should be a \"temporary cessation of military operations between the two parties\". This is largely unproblematic. Six weeks would pass while people are released, Israeli forces withdraw from some areas, displaced Gazans would be able to return to what if anything is left of their homes. \nBut then stage two would begin. The draft agreement then talks about a \"return to sustainable calm\", which it defines as \"a permanent cessation of military and hostile operations\". \nIt is this that seems to be unacceptable to Israel's government. In a statement, the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: \"Israel will not allow Hamas to restore its evil rule in the Gaza Strip, Israel will not allow it to restore its military capabilities to continue striving for our destruction. Israel cannot accept a proposal that endangers the security of our citizens and the future of our country.\" \nIn other words, Israel's government wants the right to continue taking the fight to Hamas in the long run. By contrast, Hamas wants a permanent ceasefire. \nWhat is not clear is whether there is a way for Qatari, Egyptian and American negotiators to find a middle path through this. \nIt may be that all of this is part of the negotiation. Public statements are frequently used in negotiations to put pressure on the other side. \nThe announcement by Hamas that it supports a particular draft could be an attempt to push Israel into making concessions and divide it from its allies. Israel's warnings about an imminent military operation in Rafah could be an attempt to extract better terms from Hamas. \nBut the question of whether any ceasefire is permanent or not looks hard to square with clever diplomatic language. \nIsrael has agreed to send a delegation to Cairo but with modest ambitions - not to hammer out a deal but \"to exhaust the possibility of reaching an agreement under conditions acceptable to Israel\".\nMuch will depend on what the US government decides. \nSo far, US spokespeople have fallen over themselves to avoid making any comment on the deal Hamas has signed up to. They have limited themselves to asserting that an agreement is still \"achievable\" and to warning firmly against a military operation in Rafah. \nThat is because if the US were to throw its weight behind the current text, then Mr Netanyahu might be forced to choose between his main ally and the ultra-nationalist hardliners propping up his government who oppose any compromise. \nMr Netanyahu has survived many crises in his political career by postponing difficult decisions. \nBut President Biden has it in his gift to force Israel's leader to make a choice that he might rather avoid. ",
    "After months of on-off hard talking between belligerents and mediators, the time has come for hard decisions. \nHamas has agreed to a draft ceasefire deal, which is \"far from meeting Israel's demands\", according to Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He has still felt it necessary to dispatch a delegation to discuss it. \nIsrael agreed to a ceasefire offer at the end of April. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it was \"exceptionally generous\". \nA big challenge for the negotiators in Cairo is closing the gap between Israel's version and the one accepted by Hamas. Diplomatic sources in Qatar, which is part of the mediation effort with Egypt and the United States, told me \"it is broadly the same as Israel's proposal. Just minor wordings changed and details\".\nIsrael may decide that the differences are not minor. One major sticking point has been that Hamas wants a ceasefire to be permanent, not temporary, and to be followed by an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. \nIf the US delegation, led by the CIA chief William Burns, believes the gaps can be bridged, Mr Netanyahu can expect pressure from Washington to agree. \nUntil Monday evening, Israel's working assumption was that Hamas would not accept a ceasefire proposal. Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, like most foreign observers, were blindsided when Hamas announced its decision.\nThere are two ways of looking at the Hamas gambit. It can be seen as a desperate move by an organisation badly bloodied and almost broken by Israel's long offensive. \nOr it was an adroit political move, which has turned the pressure back on Mr Netanyahu. That explanation is more credible, as Israel's plans and assumptions were upended by the offer. \nWe know that Israel was basing its moves in the next phase of the war on an assumption that Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas chief in Gaza who has been in hiding since 7 October, would never accept a ceasefire. \nIsrael used the absence of a ceasefire offer from Hamas as an explanation for its decision to launch a military operation in Gaza. The US is very clear that it is against any ground operation in Rafah that could threaten the lives of more Palestinian civilians. \nAs Israel warned around 100,000 Palestinians to leave their homes at first light on Monday, its defence minister Yoav Gallant told his US counterpart that there was no alternative to a Rafah assault. \nThat, he said, was because Hamas had rejected every proposal for a temporary ceasefire and a release of hostages. Only a few hours later, Hamas made its announcement, calling Israel's bluff.\nMr Netanyahu is in a political bind. His governing style over more than 16 years as Israel's leader has been characterised by a habit of putting off difficult choices. \nBut now he is under severe pressure, from all sides, and however tempting it might be to play for time, this is a moment for decisions. \nThe most intense pressure comes from two ultranationalist Jewish extremists in his cabinet - finance minister Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, minister for national security. \nMr Netanyahu needs their votes to keep his coalition in power. They want Israel to occupy Rafah and have threatened to topple the government if he does not make it happen. For them, a ceasefire equals surrender. \nAt the same time, families and supporters of Israeli hostages have been demonstrating, blocking major roads to demand that Israel makes a deal to get them back home. \nThe hostage families have support in the war cabinet from Benny Gantz and Gabi Eisenkot, two opposition leaders who joined the cabinet after the 7 October attacks. They might leave the government if, in the absence of a ceasefire, the hostages stay put. \nThe Americans also want a deal. President Biden's support for Israel, even as its army killed huge numbers of Palestinian civilians, is costing him political support. \nIf Mr Biden decides that there is an acceptable version of a ceasefire to be had, he will push Benjamin Netanyahu to support it. \nThe Israeli leader would have to choose between his government's survival and the vital support the US president has given him in recent months. \nIt is widely believed in Israel that Mr Netanyahu wants to prolong the war to put off the moment of reckoning for his own part in the mistakes that gave Hamas its opportunity on 7 October to kill around 1200 people, mostly Israelis and take 240 hostages into Gaza. \nA ceasefire would also mean that Benjamin Netanyahu has not achieved \"total victory\" over Hamas - one of his two main war aims. The other is freeing the hostages, which he has not achieved either. \nThis war is showing, once again, how hard it is for powerful countries like Israel to defeat much weaker organisations like Hamas. For Hamas, survival means victory, and Benjamin Netanyahu knows that, for him, would be a defeat. ",
    "Shamima Begum has lost a series of legal challenges aimed at overturning the government's decision to remove her British citizenship. \nMs Begum, now 24, left the country as a teenager to join the Islamic State group in Syria and is barred from returning to the UK.\nMs Begum is one of three east London schoolgirls who travelled to Syria in 2015 to support the IS group.\nShe was born in the UK to parents of Bangladeshi heritage and was 15 when she left.\nShe married an Islamic State fighter soon after arriving and went on to have three children, none of whom survived.\nHer UK citizenship was stripped on national security grounds in 2019.\nMs Begum remains in a camp controlled by armed guards in northern Syria.\nCitizenship is a legal status. \nIf someone is a UK citizen they have the legal right to live in the country and to access services such as welfare, education and healthcare. They can also vote.\nCitizenship is also an identity, and often forms part of a person's sense of self and belonging. \nSome people who are not citizens have the right to live in the UK permanently with many of the same rights. They are said to have \"settled status\" or \"leave to remain\".\nThe government has the power to remove someone's UK citizenship in certain circumstances:\nThe power has been used against members of banned organisations such as al-Qaeda or the Islamic State group, and those who obtained British citizenship fraudulently.\nThe person must also be eligible to apply for citizenship in another country. The UK has responsibilities under international law to avoid leaving people stateless. \nThe Nationality and Borders Act made it easier for the home secretary, in certain circumstances, to remove citizenship without telling the person in question. \nIn February 2020, a tribunal ruled that removing Ms Begum's citizenship was lawful because she was \"a citizen of Bangladesh by descent\". It said removing her British nationality would not make her stateless. \nHowever, Bangladesh said that was not the case and that she would not be allowed into the country. \nIn 2021, the Supreme Court decided that Ms Begum could not return to the UK to appeal against the decision to remove her citizenship.\nIn 2023, lawyers for Ms Begum challenged the removal of her citizenship at the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC). \nThey argued the decision was unlawful, as it did not consider whether she had been a child victim of trafficking.\nHowever, SIAC ruled that while there was a credible suspicion that Ms Begum was a victim of trafficking and sexual exploitation, that did not stand in the way of the home secretary stripping her of British citizenship, as she had become a threat. \nThat decision was upheld at the Court of Appeal in February 2024.\nThe judges said Ms Begum \"may well have been influenced and manipulated by others but still have made a calculated decision to travel to Syria and align with Islamic State\".\nOn 25 March, she lost an initial bid to take the case to the Supreme Court.\nAccording to the Home Office, 220 people were stripped of their British citizenship for the public good between 2010 and 2022. That was almost always due to national security concerns. \nThe highest year on record was 2017, when 104 people lost their citizenship. In comparison, three people lost their citizenship in 2022, the latest year for which data is available.\nUS-born citizens cannot have their status revoked because citizenship is a birth right guaranteed in the US constitution. \nHowever, naturalised US citizens - people who have immigrated to the US - can be stripped of their nationality for reasons including being members of a proscribed group, and obtaining citizenship through fraud.\nIn Australia, a person can have their citizenship removed on national security grounds if they are a dual citizen of another nation. \nCitizenship can be removed for treason, disloyalty and other national security reasons in 14 EU states, including Greece, France and Romania. It can also be removed without notice in the Netherlands.",

    "The collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge has left multiple families in the US city of Baltimore and across Latin America grieving lost loved ones. \nSix men - all construction workers fixing potholes on the bridge - died when they were plunged into the water after a container ship hit the bridge, causing its collapse on 26 March.\nTwo bodies were recovered a few days after the disaster, but then divers had to suspend their search due to the dangers posed by the bridge debris. A third body was recovered more than a week later.\nA fourth body was identified in mid-April and a fifth and sixth were recovered in May.\nThe men worked for an independent, Maryland-based contracting company called Brawner Builders. All were from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras or Mexico.\nJohn Huntzberry, who used to work with the firm, told the Baltimore Sun: \"These guys were friends and brothers and uncles and grandsons and nephews.\" \nHere is what we know about them:\nSuazo, 38, was confirmed to be among those missing by the Honduran Consulate in the US.\nHe had lived in the US for the past 18 years and was married with two children, a five-year-old daughter and an 18-year-old son, his brother told US media.\nCarlos Suazo Sandoval described his brother as a very hard working man who had moved to the US from Honduras in search of a better life for his family.\nHe said he had dreamed of owning a small business and often donated money to a children's football league in Honduras.\nSome of Suazo's family members paid tribute to him on social media.\n\"I can't believe this Maynor, that Friday would be the last time I saw you,\" one woman wrote in Spanish on Facebook. \"I will always remember you.\" \nSuazo's body was recovered by a team of divers on 5 April, more than a week after the bridge had collapsed.\nLuna, originally from El Salvador, was identified as missing by the non-profit organisation CASA, which assists immigrant communities across the US.\n\"He is a husband, a father of three, and has called Maryland his home for over 19 years,\" CASA executive director Gustavo Torres said in a statement.\nMarvin Luna, his son, told the Washington Post that he knew his father was on the bridge overnight but did not know it had collapsed until friends called him and said: \"The bridge is gone.\"\nA former co-worker, Moises Diaz, told the BBC's US partner CBS that Luna was a kind person and a hard worker. He remembered him always sharing his food with his co-workers and friends.\nMr Diaz said Luna was like a brother to him.\nHis body was recovered in early May.\nMynor Lopez's family confirmed that he is one of the men missing in an interview with CBS News in Baltimore.\nHis wife Isabel Franco said the 35-year-old, originally from Guatemala, moved to the US almost two decades ago. She said he was a loving father to their child and three stepchildren.\n\"He had a good heart. He was a hard worker. He was always worried about his family too. He died but he was fighting for us always,\" Ms Franco said.\nHernandez, 35, originally from Mexico, was a father of four, according to the Baltimore Sun newspaper. \nPeople who knew him described him as a \"selfless man, devoted to his family and active in his church\". \nHe was also described as a \"fireball\" with a big personality. \nSpeaking about her son's death to NBC News, Obdulia Fuentes Ortiz said: \"I have a deep pain in my heart; I don't know how to describe it.\"\nShe had said goodbye to him the day of the incident and asked him to be careful before he headed out to work, unaware that it would be the last time they would speak.\nHis body was one of two recovered from the Patapsco River. \nOfficials named Castillo Cabrera, 26, as one of the six victims after his body was recovered alongside Hernandez's from a submerged pickup truck. \nHis relatives told CNN that he moved to the US from Guatemala to pursue his dreams and help his mother. \nCastillo had worked at Brawner Builders for at least three years and loved his job.\n\"Unfortunately, he was in a place where no one imagined what was going to happen,\" his cousin, Marlon Castillo, said.\nThe sixth victim was identified by Mexican consulate officials as Carlos Daniel Hernandez. \nOn 14 April, he became the fourth victim recovered from the Patapsco river. \nMexican Foreign Minister Alicia B\u00e1rcena said on X, formerly Twitter, that Hernandez \"represents our Mexican workers in the US.\" \nA third Mexican national, later identified as Julio Cervantes, was one of two men who were rescued after the bridge collapsed in the early hours of Tuesday morning. \nAt a news conference on 15 April, Mr Cervantes' lawyer told reporters that his client - who is unable to swim - was able to survive after escaping through the window of a work vehicle and clinging to debris. \n\"He fought for his life, and he survived,\" attorney Justin Miller said. \nAnother lawyer, L Chris Stewart, said that the experience had left Mr Cervantes \"with severe mental and emotional pain and suffering\". \nAre you affected by the issues rai",

    "The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is standing by its decision to convict two carers of benefit fraud, despite the cases leading to a public outcry.\nVivienne Groom from Cheshire and George Henderson from Lancashire were separately ordered to repay thousands of pounds worth of Carer's Allowance, claimed over several years.\nMr Henderson said he had \"ticked a box mistakenly\" when applying for the benefit, while Ms Groom said she had been told her income was too low to be declared.\nThe CPS had been urged to review the prosecutions but senior district crown prosecutor Emily Lloyd said it \"did not believe\" the errors on the forms were an \"honest mistake\".\nMs Groom's \u00a316,800 inheritance was seized after she had failed to declare her part-time minimum wage job at her local Co-op in Tarvin, near Chester, while she was caring for her mother between 2014 and 2019.\nWithout legal aid to pay for representation in court, she pleaded guilty to benefit fraud last year, and agreed a payment plan with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).\nBut after her mother died, the department referred the case to the CPS when it learned she was due to inherit \u00a316,000 from the sale of her mother's house.\nMs Groom said a social worker had told her that her pay was too low to be declared, which was why she had not included it. \n\n Mr Henderson was convicted after a trial in 2018 and forced to sell his house in Leyland to repay \u00a319,500 plus interest and costs because he had failed to declare his work as a taxi driver while claiming Carer's Allowance for six years.\nHe was also handed a suspended prison sentence with requirements to wear an electronic tag.\nMr Henderson said that a DWP adviser did not tell him he had to declare the fact he was working as a taxi driver, adding: \"I've ticked a box mistakenly and honestly incorrectly.\"\nA DWP appeal by Mr Henderson in 2018 - separate to his conviction earlier that year - concluded his misrepresentation \u201cwas not done with fraudulent intent\u201d, adding \u201cit was more probable than not that you were telling the truth and the false declaration was an innocent mistake\u201d.\nMs Groom\u2019s prosecution prompted widespread national media coverage last month and concerns were raised in Parliament, including by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey.\nA former senior DWP carer\u2019s allowance manager said prosecutions should be quashed \u201cat the very least\u201d in cases where officials failed to notice recipients were being wrongly paid the benefit over a number of years.\nAlex Scahill, who managed DWP teams that administered Carer\u2019s Allowance and Universal Credit until 2019, spoke to the BBC after seeing coverage of Ms Groom's case because he said it was \"heartless\" and made him \u201cupset and outraged\u201d.\n\u201cThese people are vulnerable. It\u2019s affected their health, it\u2019s affected their lives,\u201d he said, adding \u201cthat\u2019s not what the DWP is about\u201d.\nHe said the DWP was \u201ccomplicit in perpetuating\u201d overpayments where it had not acted on automatic alerts warning when Carer\u2019s Allowance recipients may no longer be eligible for the benefit.\nAs of February 2023, the DWP said it was seeking to recover 145,567 overpayments of carer's allowance, including almost 12,000 cases concerning overpayments of between \u00a35,001 and \u00a320,000.\nLabour MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth Debbie Abrahams is a member of the Work and Pensions select committee which questioned senior officials about Carer's Allowance overpayments last month.\nShe said \u201cif (an overpayment is) over a period of time going back several years I personally think it should be written-off\u201d.\nEmily Lloyd, from the CPS in Merseyside and Cheshire, said the form that Ms Groom and Mr Henderson would have used to claim Carer\u2019s Allowance as \u201cquite clear\u201d because it asks: \"Have you been employed at any time since six months before the date you want to claim?\u201d\nMs Lloyd said: \u201cThe dishonesty test for the CPS is quite clear \u2013 would a reasonable person make this error? \n\"In both cases, the prosecutors did not believe so.\"\nOther pages of the claim form also refer to employment, Ms Lloyd said, meaning \u201ceven if ticking \u2018no\u2019 was a mistake, these pages would have prompted the claimants\u201d.\n\u201cA prosecution will not be brought where a complainant has made an honest mistake,\u201d she added.\nA DWP spokesperson said it was \u201ccommitted to fairness in the welfare system, with safeguards in place for managing repayments, while protecting the public purse\u201d.\n\u201cClaimants have a responsibility to inform DWP of any changes in their circumstances that could impact their award, and it is right that we recover taxpayers\u2019 money when this has not occurred\u201d, they added.\n\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram?

    "Vaughan Gething told ministers during the pandemic that he was deleting messages from a group chat, it has emerged.\nThe now-first minister and then-health minister warned colleagues in 2020 that the messages could be captured by the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act.\nDespite admitting sending the message, Mr Gething told BBC Wales he never deleted any texts from his own phone, because he would not have the time or inclination.\nOpposition parties accused Mr Gething of potentially misleading the Covid inquiry over how the Welsh government retained information.\nIn a ministerial group chat on August 17 2020 Mr Gething wrote: \"I'm deleting the messages in this group.\n\"They can be captured in an FOI [Freedom of Information request] and I think we are all in the right place on the choice being made.\"\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies told the Welsh Parliament the messages were sent on iMessage - the Apple iPhone text messaging system. \nBBC Wales was told that the message, first reported by Nation.Cymru, was sent on a phone provided by the Senedd to Mr Gething.\nIn an interview on Tuesday he told the BBC he had \"not deleted messages that relate to decision making, and in fact I never deleted any text message from my phone, because I never had the time or inclination\".\nIn the Senedd chamber, Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth asked whether Mr Gething had perjured himself in his inquiry evidence.\nMr Gething asked Mr ap Iorwerth to withdraw the accusation, which he called \"obnoxious\".\nThe first minister suggested the message sought to avoid embarrassing comments between ministers coming to light.\nMeanwhile the Covid inquiry said it would be considering whether to take more evidence from Mr Gething.\nBoth opposition parties have written to the inquiry asking it to recall Mr Gething.\nIn First Minister\u2019s Questions Mr Gething told the Welsh Parliament that the message had been published \"without the context of the discussion\".\nMr Davies accused Mr Gething of trying to \"circumnavigate\" the FOI act and being in breach of the law and any commitments to public inquiries.\nMr Gething said Mr Davies was misreading the act, and said the messages related to a conversation between ministers about a Labour group meeting in August 2020.\n\"It is not about decision making to do with the pandemic. It's about comments that colleagues make to and about each other.\n\"It's about ensuring that we don't provide things that are potentially embarrassing,\" he said.\nMr ap Iorwerth quoted Mr Gething\u2019s evidence at the Covid inquiry where he said: \"I understood that we'd kept and maintained all the information that we should do\".\nPlaid Cymru's leader continued: \u201cDoes the first minister understand why people are asking today whether he committed perjury in giving that evidence under oath?\u201d\nMr Gething said the message related \"to a discussion within the Labour group, and about how people do and don't talk to each other\u201d.\n\u201cI reject completely the suggestion that I have not been honest with the Covid inquiry.\u201d\nLater he said he was \u201centirely relaxed\u201d about a screenshot of the message being seen by the inquiry, and said a unredacted version would be shared with the inquiry.\nMr ap Iorwerth, referring to the scandal surrounding Mr Gething\u2019s leadership donations, said: \u201cSadly the Senedd on all benches is losing faith in this first minister's ability to lead without distractions. Seven weeks in and his leadership is about survival.\u201d\nMr Gething said later: \u201cI hope that when the member has a fuller picture of events, he will withdraw the obnoxious accusation he has made.\u201d\nHe added: \"I say again: I have provided all of the information available to me. I have not deleted information by text or WhatsApp to try to avoid scrutiny.\"\nAt the Covid inquiry, on 11 March this year, Mr Gething said: \"I understood that we'd kept and maintained all the information that we should do, and it would be made available to this inquiry.\"\nIn a statement he had told the inquiry he had two Senedd phones. The first he had stopped using in July 2021 and which had its data transferred to a second phone.\nThe phone was returned for maintenance, he said in a witness statement, in June 2022, and was wiped.\nThe contents of the phone was backed up with the exception of text messages. \"I did not realise that at the time,\" he said.\nA spokesperson for the UK Covid-19 Inquiry said: \"These reports have been brought to the attention of the inquiry this morning. \n\"The inquiry is considering the information available and whether it is necessary to seek further evidence from Mr Gething.\"",
    "A Ukrainian family living in the UK say they cannot return home after the theft of their passports on holiday.\nThe Buchko family, who have lived in Britain for two years, were in the Canary Islands last month but now do not have visas to get back to the UK.\nBohdan, who is about to sit his GCSEs, and siblings Daryna and Orest have been in Ukraine waiting for documents to gain entry and return via Poland.\nThe Home Office said it did not routinely comment on individual cases.\nWithout travel documents, Bohdan, 16, Daryna, 15, and Orest, nine were forced to return to Ukraine on emergency Ukrainian passports. Mum Mariana Buchko did not lose her passport and so was able to return to the UK. \nThey have since been issued new Ukrainian passports but Mariana says the Home Office has told her that issuing them with new visas to return to the UK could take up to eight weeks. \nShe is asking the UK government to speed up the process so that Bohdan can sit his GCSE exams, which begin this Friday.\nThe children need to get a new BRP visa, which lets you re-enter the UK once only, from Warsaw - a process handled by the Home Office - and then apply for the replacement visas once they are back in the UK.\nThe children's father, Vasyl Buchko, lives in Ukraine while his wife and children moved to Hertfordshire in April 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nVasyl has fought in the war. After sustaining an injury, he was given leave from the army and decided to surprise his children by taking them on holiday to Tenerife - their first in years. \nBut the holiday turned into a nightmare following the theft on 11 April.\n\"My children's passports and residency permits were stolen,\" Mariana Buchko told the BBC. \n\"This has caused havoc [for] our family as there is no procedure for quickly reissuing children's visas.\" \nShe said the nearest Ukrainian consulate was in Malaga - on the Spanish mainland - which they managed to get to after several days.\nThe consul could only issue them with emergency white passports for return to Ukraine. This meant her husband and children flying to Poland and catching three trains to Ukraine on 19 April. Vasyl has remained in Ukraine to fight.\nShe says she has been trying for weeks to get her children back to the UK. After being issued with new Ukrainian passports, they are now waiting to be issued new UK visas. But Mariana says she has been told the process could take weeks, meaning Bohdan will miss many of his GCSE exams, including Biology this Friday. \nIn the meantime, the children are staying with relatives in the capital, Kyiv, which Mariana says is causing them stress and anxiety. \n\"My children are currently in a war zone without their mother and isolated from their friends.\"\nAccording to Mariana, in Kyiv they hear air raid sirens up to five times a day and regularly spend time in shelters. \nRussia regularly targets the capital with cruise missiles and drones.\nDaryna Buchko recently spent her 15th birthday in Kyiv without her parents. \n\"My children feel sad and anxious without me,\" Mariana said. \nMonk's Walk school in Hertfordshire confirmed the two older children, who would usually be in attendance at the school, are believed to be in Ukraine.\nBeverley Piggott, of Welwyn, Hertfordshire, hosted the Buchko family for six months when they first moved to the UK. She says the process of sponsoring them to move to the UK in 2022 was much quicker.\nShe said she had spent the past three weeks attempting to get the family back to the UK. \n\"I have made hundreds of phone calls and sent hundreds of emails to our local MP, the Ukrainian embassy, British embassy, Home Office, Foreign Office and so-on.\n\"I am desperate to get these children back to the UK with their mother.\n\"It is absolutely heartbreaking.\"",
    "With his signature bombast, former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte told a crowd of cheering supporters in January that his successor was a drug addict. The man who replaced him, Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr, shot back, saying the former leader must have hurled the insult in an opioid-fuelled haze. \nThat was the strongest sign yet of a crack in the alliance that catapulted Mr Marcos to a historic win in 2022. His ally: Vice-President Sara Duterte, the former president's daughter. \nFrom the start, analysts had predicted a divorce between the two most powerful Philippine political dynasties. The likelihood only increased amid public spats and growing differences over political agendas. \nAnd yet splitting up might not be an option for Mr Marcos and Ms Duterte, who sold themselves to voters as the \"UniTeam\". \nCracks in the alliance \nSara Duterte had been leading opinion polls as a possible presidential candidate when she announced in 2021 that she was running for the vice-presidency. \nHer father made his displeasure clear. She was seen as his political heir - she was the mayor of Davao City, a post Mr Duterte held for many years before he became president in 2016. \nBut her alliance with Mr Marcos, the son of the disgraced former Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, did not surprise analysts. They said both candidates risked defeat by splitting their support - hers in the south, his in the north - if they ran against each other. Together, they united their respective strongholds and won a clear majority.\nMany expect Ms Duterte to run for president in 2028. The constitution bars Mr Marcos from seeking a second six-year term - a restriction that he is trying to remove, the Dutertes allege. \nMr Marcos says he supports reforms that will ease rules for foreign businesses, drawing more investment and jobs to the South East Asian nation of 100 million people. But his critics say it is a \"sinister\" ploy to usher in political changes that will allow him to run for the top job again. The fact that the term-limit was imposed in 1986, after his father was ousted from power by a popular revolt, has only added to the chorus of protest. \nBut this is not the only source of contention. Mr Marcos has made comments that appeared to be critical of Mr Duterte's violent war on drugs that claimed thousands of lives and turned him into an international pariah. Rights groups say killings have continued, but police say there have been fewer of them under the new president. \nMr Marcos has also embraced the US, reversing his predecessor's pivot to Beijing. He has granted American troops wider access to military bases, scaled up annual military drills and has used the Philippines' strategic position in the Pacific to shore up support not just from Washington, but also Japan. And he hasn't backed down from a deadly cat-and-mouse game with the Chinese in disputed waters. \nMr Duterte, on the other hand, had refused to even invoke the Philippines' victory in an international tribunal against Beijing's South China Sea claims during his term. He sought closer ties with China, partly in response to the condemnation from the West over his drug war. \nThere were smaller spats too. Ms Duterte was appointed the education minister in the Marcos government, despite publicly saying she wanted to be the secretary of defence. She said she accepted it to avoid any talk of a rift. She was heavily scrutinised by parliament last year over her request for millions of pesos in \"confidential funds\" - discretionary spending that government agencies are allowed. Then Mr Marcos' allies cut her discretionary budget, a move that was both embarrassing and infuriating. \nThrough all this, the two have avoided attacking each other directly - perhaps signalling a united front for now. But others on either side clearly want the upper hand in the court of public opinion, says political scientist Cleve Arguelles, president of polling firm WR Numero. \nIn April, after the two leaders accused each other of being drug addicts, First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos sat down for a candid interview on YouTube. \nShe said she was \"hurt\" that Sara Duterte did not intervene when her father called the president a \"junkie\". In a swift video reply, Ms Duterte said the first lady's \"personal feelings\" were not part of her job.\nMrs Marcos has never discussed politics publicly. This surprising interview was an attempt to \"beat the Dutertes at their own game\", Mr Arguelles says. \nShe cannot match Mr Duterte's shocking comments - he's notorious for sexist remarks, cursing at Pope Francis and former US president Barack Obama. But she can and did invoke a soap opera character that is reviled yet watched by millions of Filipinos - the traitor.\n\"The first lady is trying to use emotions rather than framing it in other ways. We have notions of treachery, the family being hurt,\" Mr Arguelles said. \"It's like a soap opera.\"\nHe says it's very different to the Dutertes, who are \"masters of... very public ",

    "North Korea's former propaganda master Kim Ki Nam has died at the age of 94, said state media. \nHe died due to old age and \"multiple organ dysfunction\" for which he had been receiving treatment since 2022, said KCNA.\nHe had spent decades leading propaganda efforts in the totalitarian state, including building a personality cult around the ruling Kim dynasty.\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un attended his funeral early on Wednesday and paid tribute to the \"veteran revolutionary who had remained boundlessly loyal\" to the regime, the report added.\nSouth Korea's Yonhap news agency likened him to Nazi Germany's propaganda boss Joseph Goebbels, widely known for his mantra \"repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth\".\nKim Ki Nam had no blood relations with the ruling patriarchy despite sharing the family name that is among the most common in North and South Korea.\nHe was appointed deputy director of Pyongyang's Propaganda and Agitation Department in 1966, where he worked closely with Kim Jong Il, the predecessor and father of current leader Kim Jong Un. \nKim Ki Nam later rose to lead the department, playing a crucial role in shaping the country's messaging, as he served what has now become the world\u2019s longest-running family dynasty. \nHe reportedly had a close relationship with Kim Jong Il, with several media reports describing them as \"drinking buddies\".\nIn the 1970s, he was put in charge of the state mouthpiece, Rodong Sinmun newspaper.\nHe later led initiatives to establish the role of Kim Il Sung - widely seen as North Korea's founding father - in the country's history, and to support Kim Jong Il's succession of the leadership, according to North Korea Leadership Watch, a site on Pyongyang's political culture.\nThe propaganda department Kim Ki Nam oversaw maintained a stranglehold over communication and information flows in an out of the state. \nSouth Korean and Western entertainment, including music and movies, are banned. \nRare footage obtained by BBC Korean early this year showed the public sentencing of two teenage boys to 12 years of hard labour for watching K-dramas. \nState television had also blurred the trousers of British presenter Alan Titchmarsh in a BBC gardening programme because jeans are seen as a symbol of Western - and specifically American - imperialism in the country.\nKim Ki Nam is one of few North Korean officials to have visited the South, leading a delegation to attend the funeral of former South Korean president Kim Dae-jung in 2009.\nOne example of how the propaganda machine kicked into action was after the sudden death of Kim Jong Il in 2011. This hastened the ascent of his son, Kim Jong Un, as the country's leader. The young Kim was believed to be just in his 20s at that time.\n\"No force on earth can check the revolutionary advance of our party, army and people under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Un,\" read one of the first KCNA reports after Kim Jong Il's death.\n\"Under the leadership of Kim Jong Un we should turn our sorrow into strength and courage and overcome the present difficulties,\" the report said.\nIn 2015, images on state media showed the tall, bespectacled Kim Ki Nam - in his 80s at that time - standing among a group of military officials and taking notes while Kim Jong Un spoke.\nHe had retired in the late 2010s, passing on his role to Kim Jong Un's sister Kim Yo Jong, but continued to appear at public events - a sign that he remained on good terms with the regime.\n\"Kim Jong Un kept Kim Ki Nam in key propaganda positions for years, indicating that he, like his father, trusted and relied on him,\" said Rachel Lee, a Senior Fellow at the US-based think tank 38 North Program.\nMs Lee added that the Rodong Sinmun dedicated its entire frontpage on Wednesday to Kim Ki Nam's death and details of his funeral and this \"speaks to the respect accorded to him\".\nLeif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said Kim Ki Nam's death marks \"the end of an era\" for North Korean propaganda. \n\"This is someone who sought to glorify the Pyongyang regime in a way to appeal across and beyond the Korean Peninsula,\" he said.\nThe state's propaganda machine has since departed from the previous generation\u2019s spin on pan-Korean nationalism, Prof Easley said. \n\"Now, Kim Jong Un demonises South Koreans and heavily relies on nuclear weapons for political legitimacy,\" he said.",
    "Florals? For spring? Groundbreaking.\nThis year's Met Gala theme would not have impressed The Devil Wears Prada's demon magazine editor Miranda Priestly, but it hasn't stopped a string of stars from walking the green carpet in their garden-inspired garments. \nA-listers were invited to be imaginative with the 2024 dress code, The Garden of Time, which was inspired by a short story of the same name by JG Ballard. \nMost stars took it literally, taking inspiration from flowers, petals, branches and leaves, while others played around with the short story's themes of time and history. \nHere are 26 of the most eye-catching outfits: \nNormally when stars talk about wearing ice, they're referring to diamonds. In Camila Cabello's case, however, she's referring to actual frozen water.\n\"My hands are really cold,\" the singer said, explaining she was planning to pass the ice on to someone else after she reached the top of the stairs. \"I can't feel my hands.\"\nThe large block of ice featured a rose in the centre and accessorised her Ludovic de Saint Sernin gown, which reportedly featured 250,000 crystals and took more than 450 hours to make. \nThe Bear star Ayo Edebiri and Schitt's Creek actor and writer Dan Levy both opted to keep their floral designs on the down low, with outfits that looked traditional from the top but bloomed from the waist down. \nEdebiri wore a backless column dress by Loewe with a hand-embroidered floral pattern intended to create the illusion of gradual blossoming.\nSimilarly, Levy wore what looked like a classic suit from the top half, but which faded a into a bright floral motif lower down.\nWe've got to hand it to her, Demi Moore had one of the best looks of the night, even if she forgot to bring a bow to go with her arrows.\nThe actress's velvet dress, designed by Harris Reed, was adorned with huge pink peonies made from vintage archival wallpaper.\nReed said the dress took more than 5,000 hours to make, adding that it was designed so the flowers would appear to decay as the design flowed further down the dress. \nSinger Lana Del Rey had not attended the Met Gala since 2018, so decided she needed to give her fashion sense a root-and-branch overhaul. \nShe wore a corseted dress in silk, double georgette and tulle. The dress referenced an Alexander McQueen piece from nearly two decades ago, brought up to date by the fashion house's current creative director Se\u00e1n McGirr.\nBut the highlight was the special headpiece, which made use of natural hawthorn branches. \nA glowing Lea Michele walked the carpet wearing a Rodarte turqoise gown with a tulle cape, two months after announcing she was pregnant for the second time.\nThe Glee star and her husband Zandy Reich, who have a three-year-old son, Ever Leo, said they were \"overjoyed\" to be expecting again.\nIf you ever need someone to bring you flowers in the pouring rain, Nicki Minaj has got you covered. \nThe singer's yellow Marni mini-dress was adorned with 3D metal flowers in varying shapes and sizes - one of the most colourful and committed looks of the night.\nHer look was completed by a bob hairstyle with an arched bubble ponytail. \nDid Bad Bunny look as if he had yanked his suit jacket out of the sewing machine before the tailor had actually finished making it? Yes. But he still looked great.\nThe rapper and singer wore a Renaissance-inspired custom Maison Margiela suit in navy blue with white threading which resembled pinstripes.\nHe carried a floral bouquet made from the same material as his jacket, reportedly intended to resemble a mixture of roses, Flor de Maga (the national flower of Puerto Rico), and the flax plant, which Sleeping Beauty pricked her finger on in the fairy tale. \nThe latter is a reference to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's new exhibition Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion, which explores seminal pieces spanning four centuries. \nA large roll of non-stick tinfoil couldn't hold a candle to Mamma Mia actress Amanda Seyfried, who wore a shiny metallic gown featuring flower appliques.\nBut as eye-catching as the Elizabeth Stewart dress was, all eyes were on Seyfried's matching platinum hair and Chaumet gemstone headpiece by M\u00e9lodie Nacr\u00e9e, which resembled leaves on a vine.\nThe singer and rapper wore a white suit by Luar, which featured asymmetrical panels of sparkly silver sequined fabric, and curved lines of buttons.\nIn terms of adherence to the dress code, we think the outfit could have done with a few more marigolds, but we'll settle for the single white rose which decorated his collar. \nSpeaking on the green carpet, Lil Nas X told the BBC's Brandon Drenon he had reconsidered his attendance earlier in the day, but had ultimately decided: \"You know what, I wanna go, this is always a really nice opportunity to be a part of the cool kids club.\" \nWhy dress to look like flowers and trees, when you could pay tribute to the birds who fly among them? \nWhen actress Rebecca Ferguson first appeared at Monday's Met Gala, she was draped in a plain black c",

    "Children given everyday foods to treat milk and peanut allergies are showing dramatic signs of improvement, according to early trial results.\nFive NHS hospitals have joined a \u00a32.5m trial, thanks to funding from the Natasha Allergy Research Foundation.\nNatasha Ednan-Laperouse, from Fulham, west London, died in 2016 after suffering a severe allergic reaction to sesame baked into a Pret baguette.\nHer parents set up the foundation hoping to cure allergies with research.\nNadim and Tanya Ednan-Laperouse have also campaigned for a change in food laws.\nThe new clinical oral immunotherapy (OIT) trial is using everyday foods to build up an allergy patient's tolerance over time.\nFoods are given under medical supervision and the trial is also training NHS staff to offer OIT treatment.\nSibel Sonmez-Ajtai, paediatric allergy consultant and principal investigator at Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust, said: \"This study is enabling us to do something we would never have dreamed of doing before - giving patients the foods we know they are allergic to.\n\"This treatment is not a cure for a food allergy, but what it achieves is life-transforming.\n\"To have a patient who has had anaphylaxis to 4mls of milk to then tolerate 90mls within six to eight months is nothing less than a miracle.\"\nThomas Farmer, 11, was diagnosed with a severe peanut allergy when he was one. He can now eat six peanuts a day after joining the trial in Southampton.\nHis mother Lauren said joining the trial has \"taken away so much anxiety around food\".\n\"For Thomas to be able to achieve all this with no medicine, just off-the-shelf foods, is amazing,\" she said.\nSince joining the trial in Newcastle, Grace Fisher, five, who has a milk allergy, is now drinking 120ml milk a day. \nHer mother Emma said: \"Grace is over six months into this journey and is doing amazing.\n\"She is currently on 120ml of milk and loves her daily hot chocolates.\"\nTo date, 139 people aged two to 23 with allergies to peanuts or cow's milk have started treatment.\nThe trial is being run at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust.\nIt will shortly start in Scotland, with plans for Bristol and Leeds to also join.\nIf successful, the three-year trial could provide more evidence for everyday foods treatment to be made available on the NHS.\nAt the moment, one treatment paid for by the NHS is Palforzia - peanut powder capsules which build tolerance to peanuts.\nMrs Ednan-Laperouse said: \"If Natasha were alive today, this is exactly the type of research she would have loved to be part of.\n\"This is a major first step in our mission to make food allergies history. We look forward to seeing the final results.\"\nProfessor Arshad, head of the asthma, allergy and clinical immunology service at University Hospital of Southampton, said: \"The Natasha trial aims to do better for people living with food allergies.\n\"Our ultimate aim is a life without the risk of allergic reactions - reactions which for some can be severe and life-threatening.\"\nThe Natasha Allergy Research Foundation is funding the trial through donations made to the charity from firms including Pret, Lidl, Leon, Uber Eats, Greggs, Tesco, Just Eat, Co-op, Morrisons, KFC, Sainsbury's, Costa, Burger King, Domino's, Kellogg's, M&S, Muller and Waitrose.\nThe full results are expected in 2027.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A Ukrainian family living in the UK say they cannot return home after the theft of their passports on holiday.\nThe Buchko family, who have lived in Britain for two years, were in the Canary Islands last month but now do not have visas to get back to the UK.\nBohdan, who is about to sit his GCSEs, and siblings Daryna and Orest have been in Ukraine waiting for documents to gain entry and return via Poland.\nThe Home Office said it did not routinely comment on individual cases.\nWithout travel documents, Bohdan, 16, Daryna, 15, and Orest, nine were forced to return to Ukraine on emergency Ukrainian passports. Mum Mariana Buchko did not lose her passport and so was able to return to the UK. \nThey have since been issued new Ukrainian passports but Mariana says the Home Office has told her that issuing them with new visas to return to the UK could take up to eight weeks. \nShe is asking the UK government to speed up the process so that Bohdan can sit his GCSE exams, which begin this Friday.\nThe children need to get a new BRP visa, which lets you re-enter the UK once only, from Warsaw - a process handled by the Home Office - and then apply for the replacement visas once they are back in the UK.\nThe children's father, Vasyl Buchko, lives in Ukraine while his wife and children moved to Hertfordshire in April 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nVasyl has fought in the war. After sustaining an injury, he was given leave from the army and decided to surprise his children by taking them on holiday to Tenerife - their first in years. \nBut the holiday turned into a nightmare following the theft on 11 April.\n\"My children's passports and residency permits were stolen,\" Mariana Buchko told the BBC. \n\"This has caused havoc [for] our family as there is no procedure for quickly reissuing children's visas.\" \nShe said the nearest Ukrainian consulate was in Malaga - on the Spanish mainland - which they managed to get to after several days.\nThe consul could only issue them with emergency white passports for return to Ukraine. This meant her husband and children flying to Poland and catching three trains to Ukraine on 19 April. Vasyl has remained in Ukraine to fight.\nShe says she has been trying for weeks to get her children back to the UK. After being issued with new Ukrainian passports, they are now waiting to be issued new UK visas. But Mariana says she has been told the process could take weeks, meaning Bohdan will miss many of his GCSE exams, including Biology this Friday. \nIn the meantime, the children are staying with relatives in the capital, Kyiv, which Mariana says is causing them stress and anxiety. \n\"My children are currently in a war zone without their mother and isolated from their friends.\"\nAccording to Mariana, in Kyiv they hear air raid sirens up to five times a day and regularly spend time in shelters. \nRussia regularly targets the capital with cruise missiles and drones.\nDaryna Buchko recently spent her 15th birthday in Kyiv without her parents. \n\"My children feel sad and anxious without me,\" Mariana said. \nMonk's Walk school in Hertfordshire confirmed the two older children, who would usually be in attendance at the school, are believed to be in Ukraine.\nBeverley Piggott, of Welwyn, Hertfordshire, hosted the Buchko family for six months when they first moved to the UK. She says the process of sponsoring them to move to the UK in 2022 was much quicker.\nShe said she had spent the past three weeks attempting to get the family back to the UK. \n\"I have made hundreds of phone calls and sent hundreds of emails to our local MP, the Ukrainian embassy, British embassy, Home Office, Foreign Office and so-on.\n\"I am desperate to get these children back to the UK with their mother.\n\"It is absolutely heartbreaking.\"",
    "Vaughan Gething told ministers during the pandemic that he was deleting messages from a group chat, it has emerged.\nThe now-first minister and then-health minister warned colleagues in 2020 that the messages could be captured by the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act.\nDespite admitting sending the message, Mr Gething told BBC Wales he never deleted any texts from his own phone, because he would not have the time or inclination.\nOpposition parties accused Mr Gething of potentially misleading the Covid inquiry over how the Welsh government retained information.\nIn a ministerial group chat on August 17 2020 Mr Gething wrote: \"I'm deleting the messages in this group.\n\"They can be captured in an FOI [Freedom of Information request] and I think we are all in the right place on the choice being made.\"\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies told the Welsh Parliament the messages were sent on iMessage - the Apple iPhone text messaging system. \nBBC Wales was told that the message, first reported by Nation.Cymru, was sent on a phone provided by the Senedd to Mr Gething.\nIn an interview on Tuesday he told the BBC he had \"not deleted messages that relate to decision making, and in fact I never deleted any text message from my phone, because I never had the time or inclination\".\nIn the Senedd chamber, Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth asked whether Mr Gething had perjured himself in his inquiry evidence.\nMr Gething asked Mr ap Iorwerth to withdraw the accusation, which he called \"obnoxious\".\nThe first minister suggested the message sought to avoid embarrassing comments between ministers coming to light.\nMeanwhile the Covid inquiry said it would be considering whether to take more evidence from Mr Gething.\nBoth opposition parties have written to the inquiry asking it to recall Mr Gething.\nIn First Minister\u2019s Questions Mr Gething told the Welsh Parliament that the message had been published \"without the context of the discussion\".\nMr Davies accused Mr Gething of trying to \"circumnavigate\" the FOI act and being in breach of the law and any commitments to public inquiries.\nMr Gething said Mr Davies was misreading the act, and said the messages related to a conversation between ministers about a Labour group meeting in August 2020.\n\"It is not about decision making to do with the pandemic. It's about comments that colleagues make to and about each other.\n\"It's about ensuring that we don't provide things that are potentially embarrassing,\" he said.\nMr ap Iorwerth quoted Mr Gething\u2019s evidence at the Covid inquiry where he said: \"I understood that we'd kept and maintained all the information that we should do\".\nPlaid Cymru's leader continued: \u201cDoes the first minister understand why people are asking today whether he committed perjury in giving that evidence under oath?\u201d\nMr Gething said the message related \"to a discussion within the Labour group, and about how people do and don't talk to each other\u201d.\n\u201cI reject completely the suggestion that I have not been honest with the Covid inquiry.\u201d\nLater he said he was \u201centirely relaxed\u201d about a screenshot of the message being seen by the inquiry, and said a unredacted version would be shared with the inquiry.\nMr ap Iorwerth, referring to the scandal surrounding Mr Gething\u2019s leadership donations, said: \u201cSadly the Senedd on all benches is losing faith in this first minister's ability to lead without distractions. Seven weeks in and his leadership is about survival.\u201d\nMr Gething said later: \u201cI hope that when the member has a fuller picture of events, he will withdraw the obnoxious accusation he has made.\u201d\nHe added: \"I say again: I have provided all of the information available to me. I have not deleted information by text or WhatsApp to try to avoid scrutiny.\"\nAt the Covid inquiry, on 11 March this year, Mr Gething said: \"I understood that we'd kept and maintained all the information that we should do, and it would be made available to this inquiry.\"\nIn a statement he had told the inquiry he had two Senedd phones. The first he had stopped using in July 2021 and which had its data transferred to a second phone.\nThe phone was returned for maintenance, he said in a witness statement, in June 2022, and was wiped.\nThe contents of the phone was backed up with the exception of text messages. \"I did not realise that at the time,\" he said.\nA spokesperson for the UK Covid-19 Inquiry said: \"These reports have been brought to the attention of the inquiry this morning. \n\"The inquiry is considering the information available and whether it is necessary to seek further evidence from Mr Gething.\"",
    "State involvement cannot be ruled out in a hack of an armed forces payroll system, the defence secretary has said. \nGrant Shapps told MPs the government had reason to believe the hack \"was the suspected work of a malign actor\" - and the BBC understands that ministers suspect China was responsible.\nThe system used by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) includes names and bank details of armed forces personnel.\nChina described the suggestion as a \"fabricated and malicious slander\".\nLabour's shadow defence secretary John Healey has alleged that the external contractor in charge of the hacked system was Shared Services Connected Ltd (SSCL).\nThe payroll system holds \"personal HMRC-style information\" for current regular, reservist and former members of the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force over a period of several years. In a very small number of cases, the data may include personal addresses.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak, while stopping short of naming the country responsible, said a \"malign actor\" had compromised the payroll system.  \nDowning Street said it was reviewing the security of the unnamed contractor's operations.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Mr Shapps criticised the contractor-operated system, saying there was \"evidence of failings\" by them and that it was totally separate to the core MoD network. \nMr Shapps apologised to the servicemen and women affected by the data breach and detailed an eight-point plan which included a specialist support helpline.\nHe told MPs the incident was \"further proof that the UK is facing rising and evolving threats\".\n\"For reasons of national security, we can't release further details of the suspected cyber-activity behind this incident\", Mr Shapps said.\n\"However, I can confirm to the House that we do have indications that this was the suspected work of a malign actor and we cannot rule out state involvement.\"\nThe government became aware of the data breach in recent days, and has not found evidence hackers removed data but is continuing to investigate. \nSources have told BBC News the investigation into who was behind the breach, which will be seen as embarrassing for the MoD, is at an early stage. \nIt can take months, sometimes years, to gather enough evidence to publicly accuse - so China is unlikely to be officially named today.\nHowever, that does seem to be where suspicions are pointing towards, especially in light of Beijing's track record of targeting these kind of data sets.\nWhen pressed on why the government is not naming China as responsible, the prime minister pointed to \"very robust\" government policy that means the UK can protect itself against the risk from China, and that defence spending had increased. \nService people affected by the hack will receive further information from the government about the breach and will be told any concerns are more about fraud risks rather than personal safety. \nIn an email sent to people affected on Tuesday, personnel were told they were confident May salaries will not be affected, but there may be slight delays to payments of routine expenses. \nIn response to the breach, Conservative MPs have raised concerns about the threat from China. \nTobias Ellwood, former chairman of the Commons Defence Committee, told BBC Radio's 4 Today programme: \"Targeting the names of the payroll system and service personnel's bank details, this does point to China because it can be as part of a plan, a strategy to see who might be coerced.\"\nHe pointed to China previously trying to gain information from ex-RAF pilots. \nIain Duncan Smith said the government must admit China poses a threat to the UK. \n\"No more pretence, China is a malign actor, supporting Russia with money and military equipment, working with Iran and North Korea in a new axis of totalitarian states,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, Labour's Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey said there were \"serious questions\" for Mr Shapps and \"any such hostile action is utterly unacceptable\".  \nIn a statement, the Chinese embassy in the UK said it strongly opposed the suggestion China was responsible and it had no need to \"meddle in the internal affairs of the UK\".\n\"We urge the relevant parties in the UK to stop spreading false information, stop fabricating so-called China threat narratives, and stop their anti-China political farce,\" a spokesman said. \nLast year, the government published an updated version of its long-term defence strategy which said the use of \"commercial spyware, ransomware and offensive cyber capabilities by state and non-state actors has proliferated\".\nIn March, the government publicly accused China of being behind an August 2021 hack targeting the details of millions of voters held by the Electoral Commission. \nIn December 2023, the National Cyber Security Centre said Russian intelligence was behind a \"malicious cyber activity attempting to interfere in UK politics and democratic processes\".\nPublic institutions and private firms have also been targeted by hackers demanding ran",
    "Lewis Hamilton has revealed the inspiration for his Met Gala look is one of the UK's first black gardeners. \nJohn Ystumllyn was abducted as a child in western Africa in the 18th Century and raised in Gwynedd, north Wales.\n\"Through adversity, he really triumphed,\" said the F1 star, who was appearing at his fifth Met. \nOne of fashion's biggest nights, the gala is a fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, held annually in New York. \nEach year, attendees at the star-studded event - organised by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour - are given a theme to dress to, with this year's being \"The Garden of Time\".\n\"What I love about the Met, and what Anna (Wintour) does with the Met, is that I\u2019m able to really deep dive into the theme,\" Hamilton told Vogue on the red carpet.\n\"I did a lot of research and I came across this 18th Century gardener who, through slavery times, came across from Africa to Wales and became the first black gardener in Wales.\n\"Through adversity, he really triumphed, so that\u2019s where the inspiration really came from.\"\nThat gardener, John Ystumllyn, was snatched from his home when he was about eight years old and likely brought to Wales to become a servant for society aristocrats.\nAccording to a biography written in 1888, a century after his death, John Ystumllyn told how \"white men arrived and caught him and took him away\".\nHamilton highlighted the thorns on his outfit representing the pain caused by the slavery trade. \nDr Marian Gwyn, of Race Council Cymru, previously told BBC Wales Ystumllyn's abduction would have been \"a very traumatic experience\".\n\"Yet despite the trauma of that, he came and he settled in Wales - he made it his home,\" she said. \nHe married a local woman, Margaret Gruffydd, who had been a maid at the Ystumllyn estate, and had seven children, five of whom survived into adulthood.\nJohn was not himself enslaved. Dr Gwyn said he was \"very much a free man\" and was able to move from job to job. \nHis natural ability in horticulture meant he was never short of work.\nIn 2021, a new rose, believed to be the first of its kind, was named in Ystumllyn's memory. \nHamilton also revealed that a poem has been stitched into the inside of his Burberry jacket by Children's Laureate Wales poet Alex Wharton.\nThe poem, titled The Gardener, is inspired by Ystumllyn's life after arriving in Wales. \n\"I hope the sun pours light upon our skin. And we melt into each other, into everything. Maybe the trees will speak, as they sometimes do. Whispers from the shade - Run, run away,\" read the excerpt in Hamilton's jacket. \nOn Hamilton's social media, he said he was \"inspired by the legacy of John Ystumllym and the beauty of his work\".",

    "A museum in Australia is fighting to keep its exhibit women-only after a court ordered that men should be allowed entry under anti-discrimination laws.\nTasmania's Museum of Old and New Art appealed on Tuesday to reverse the ruling, arguing it took \"too narrow a view on women's historical and ongoing societal disadvantage\" and how the Ladies Lounge can \"promote equal opportunity\". \nThe court issued its order in April following a gender discrimination lawsuit filed by New South Wales resident Jason Lau, who was denied entry into the lounge.\nKirsha Kaechele, the artist behind the lounge, has said she will challenge the ruling by making the space \"compliant\" with regulations.\nThe lounge, which contains some of the museum's most-acclaimed works - from Picasso to Sidney Nolan - has been closed to the public since the court's order.\nMs Kaechele's plans involve transforming the velvet-clad lounge into a women's toilet and a church - which she claims will allow it to continue operating as a women-only space under legal exemptions.\n\u201cThere is a fabulous toilet coming to the Ladies Lounge, and so in that sense the Ladies Lounge will operate as a ladies\u2019 room. \n\"It\u2019s a toilet that is celebrated the world round. It is the greatest toilet, and men won\u2019t be allowed to see it,\"  Ms Kaechele said in Australian media reports.\n\nSome of the key artworks, like the ones by Picasso, will be moved into the museum's existing ladies toilet to ensure \"uninterrupted viewing\" while she applies for other exemptions.\nAnd only on Sundays, men would be allowed into the space - to learn ironing and laundry folding. \n\"Women can bring in all their clean laundry and the men can go through a series of graceful movements (designed by a Rinpoche and refined by tai chi masters) to fold them,\" she said, in an interview published by the museum on Tuesday.\nMr Lau's lawsuit has been a \"blessing in disguise\", she said.\n\"Thanks to the ruling, we have no choice but to open ourselves to a whole range of enriching experiences - spiritual, educational... to discover fascinating new possibilities, and to become better,\" she said.\nMs Kaechele previously told the BBC the high-stakes case had made it feel like her artwork was coming to life, and signalled that she would fight it all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary.",
    "Two men who stole more than \u00a35.7m worth of cryptocurrency from victims all over the world have been jailed. \nJake Lee, 38, from Charlcombe in Bath and James Heppel, 42, from Staverton in Wiltshire, both pleaded guilty to three counts of conspiracy to commit fraud. \nThe South West Regional Organised Crime Unit (SWROCU) identified 55 victims in 26 countries, including 11 from the UK, who had been targeted by the the pair.\nLee was handed four years' imprisonment and Heppel was sentenced to 15 months at Bristol Crown Court on 3 May. \nThe cash included \u00a3551,000 in a suitcase, which was voluntarily handed over by Lee in January. \nThe pair carried out the fraud by replicating the website of cryptocurrency exchange Blockchain.com to access victims\u2019 Bitcoin wallets, allowing them to steal their funds and login details.\nA print of the 2003 Banksy work Bomb Love worth \u00a360,000, alongside cash totalling \u00a3835,000, \u00a364,000 worth of cryptocurrency and three cars were all confiscated by police.\nA confiscation order for nearly \u00a31million was made against Lee, which will be used to compensate the victims. \nProceedings related to a similar order - which force criminals to hand over available money and assets, or have time added to their prison sentence - for Heppel are underway. \nDet Supt Matt Brain from SWROCU\u2019s Regional Cyber Crime Unit said the investigation into the pair began when Avon and Somerset Police arrested Lee on suspicion of money laundering. \nOfficers recovered \u00a324,000 in cash and three digital devices, including three laminated Bitcoin wallet recovery seeds - a collection of words that helps the owner restore a Bitcoin wallet that has been lost.\nAt the same time as the investigation into Lee, SWROCU had also started a probe into a cryptocurrency scam reported by a Wiltshire victim who had \u00a311,000 worth of Bitcoin taken from his Blockchain wallet. \nMr Brain added: \u201cWe took on the investigation into Lee and when we analysed his devices, we established he was a central figure involved in a sophisticated domain spoofing fraud and worked to identify numerous victims.\n\u201cMapping out Lee and Heppel\u2019s offending and links to other suspects and cryptocurrency exchanges all over the world was complex work, but the fact they both pleaded guilty to all counts, negating the need for a six-week trial, shows the strength of evidence we secured against them.\u201d\nPamela Jain, a specialist prosecutor with the Serious Economic Organised Crime International Directorate of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \u201cThis was a complex and time-consuming prosecution which involved enquiries with numerous victims and prosecuting authorities all over the world.\"\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "For years, Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump have been locked in a public battle over an alleged sexual encounter, a hush-money deal paid by the former president's fixer, and their respective efforts to own the very public narrative.\nThose tensions - and the salacious details that surround them - spilled out in court on Tuesday when Ms Daniels took the stand in Mr Trump's criminal trial to face him in court for the first time. \nThe former adult-film star, wearing loose-fitting black clothes and her hair pinned back, did not look at the former president for most of the day, except when she noted his dark blue suit after she was asked to point him out. \nShe spent much of her time on the stand recounting the sexual encounter that she claims to have had with the defendant - an act that sparked the allegations at the heart of the case - and pushing back at his legal team's scathing questions.\nMr Trump, meanwhile, spent parts of her evidence cursing and shaking his head. That prompted a warning from the judge, according to court transcripts published at the end of the day. \nThe former president faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. The charges stem from an alleged attempt to conceal a $130,000 payment to Ms Daniels aimed to keep her quiet about the purported tryst. \nHe has pleaded not guilty and denies any sexual encounter with her, though he has acknowledged that his ex-lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid her a sum to keep quiet about her claims.\nAs the woman who received the money, Ms Daniels was expected to appear in court at some point. But her testimony on Tuesday brought the most dramatic day of the trial yet.\nShe provided such lurid details about her encounter with Mr Trump that his lawyers called for a mistrial. Justice Juan Merchan acknowledged \"there were some things that would have been better left unsaid\" and warned prosecutors not to ask for specifics of such a personal nature. \nThe details, which she has previously shared, included her claim that they did not use a condom, that she spanked Mr Trump with a magazine, and the answers she allegedly elicited from the former president about his wife. \nThe trial has already dredged up an underworld of tabloid publishers and Hollywood lawyers, one of whom was employed by Ms Daniels to broker the hush payment. Her testimony on Tuesday appeared to be a step too far for the judge as well as Mr Trump's defence team, however. \nEarly in the day, Mr Trump's lawyers sought to have Justice Merchan limit what prosecutors could ask Ms Daniels about their alleged sexual encounter in 2006, and the pair's two subsequent meetings. \nThe prosecution argued that they needed to ask Ms Daniels about it to establish intent for the pay-out. Despite tighter parameters, her scandalous details still spilled out in unusually long answers. \nThis is not the first time Stormy Daniels has shared the details of her alleged sexual encounter with Mr Trump. Since the deal came to light, she has told her story on national television, in a self-titled documentary, to America's most famous broadcast journalist and in her book, Full Disclosure.\nBut this was the first time she shared it while the man she claims to have had sex with sat just a few feet away.  \nIn the morning session, Ms Daniels appeared nervous, speaking at such a brisk pace that both the prosecutor, Susan Hoffinger, and Justice Merchan asked her to slow down. \nAt times, it also appeared that her evidence got away from Ms Hoffinger, who received a stern warning from the judge to better control her witness.\nThe adult-film star kept her eyes on the jury while taking the court back to 2006, when she first encountered Mr Trump decked out in golf attire at a celebrity tournament. He asked her to join him for a meal, she recalled. \nMs Daniels told the court that she initially did not want to have dinner with him, but her publicist encouraged her, saying \"'What could possibly go wrong?'\" The line drew laughs from some in the courtroom.\nBBC News reporters are in the Manhattan courtroom covering the historic first criminal trial of a former US president. You'll find their updates and analysis on the BBC news website and app, and across TV, radio and podcasts.\nShe then described arriving at Mr Trump's suite later for dinner, where she said he met her at the door wearing silk pyjamas. \nMs Daniels told the court that she later went to the bathroom and, after coming back out, found Mr Trump lying in bed wearing only boxer shorts and a t-shirt.\nThey had sex, she said, and maintained that there was consent. Still, she told the court, the encounter had left her disoriented.\nMr Trump's lawyers objected multiple times to the prosecutors' line of questioning before they cross-examined Ms Daniels. \nProsecutors had ensured that guardrails the court had imposed on Ms Daniels' testimony had flown off, attorney Todd Blanche said. Her details about Mr Trump were \"unduly prejudicial\" to the point that they did not believe they could be fixed during",

    "Police in India have opened a case against senior leaders of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over a social media post that opposition leaders say \"demonises Muslims\".\nThe animated video depicts senior Congress party leaders granting benefits to Muslims at the expense of marginalised castes and tribespeople.\nHours after the police case opened, the Election Commission asked X (formerly Twitter) to remove the video.\nIt said the post violated Indian law.\nThere was no immediate response from X or the BJP.\nIn its order, the Election Commission says its chief electoral officer in Karnataka (the video was posted by the BJP's Karnataka state unit) had \"already directed\" X to take down the post on Sunday, but that this hadn't been done yet. Voting in Karnataka was held on Tuesday and ended in the early evening local time.\nThis is the second such video the BJP has posted online in the past two weeks. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also made similar claims about the opposition favouring the Muslim minority over other social groups at election rallies.\nIndia is several weeks into a general election that ends in June, and according to the model code of conduct, parties and leaders are barred from using religious issues to seek votes.\nBut opposition leaders and political commentators say PM Modi, who's seeking a rare third term in a row, and other leaders from his Hindu nationalist party are resorting to blatant Islamophobia. They have also criticised the Election Commission (EC) for not taking timely action against them.\nIndia's 200 million Muslims are the largest minority group in the country. Anti-Muslim hate speech has surged in the country since the BJP came to power in 2014.\nThe video, posted on the BJP's social media page in Karnataka on 4 May, is captioned \"Beware... Beware... Beware...!\" in Kannada language which is spoken in the southern state. It has been viewed more than nine million times on X.\nIt shows caricatures of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Karnataka Chief Minister K Siddaramaiah, who belongs to the same party, placing an egg marked \"Muslims\" in a nest next to three eggs marked \"SC\" and \"OBC\" (referring to marginalised castes) and  \"ST\" (referring to marginalised tribes).\nWhen the eggs hatch, Mr Gandhi is seen feeding \"funds\" to the chick which is wearing a skullcap and has a menacing expression. The chick then grows bigger and edges out the others from the nest.\nThe Congress lodged a complaint against the video with the EC on Sunday, following which the Karnataka police registered a case against BJP President JP Nadda, its party chief in Karnataka, BY Vijayendra and the party's IT department head, Amit Malviya.\nIn a post on X, Congress party MP Manickam Tagore criticised the video, saying that the \"blatant demonisation of minorities by BJP is unacceptable\". \n\"The Election Commission must wake up to its responsibility and address the divisive tactics of the BJP. Unity, not division, should be the goal for a thriving democracy,\" he wrote.\nProfessor Nitasha Kaul, a British academic of Indian origin who teaches politics at the University of Westminster, described the video on X as \"a straightforward 1930s Germany-style cartoon\" and called it a violation of election rules.\nSeveral opposition leaders and civil society groups have flagged campaign videos and speeches by BJP leaders, particularly the prime minister, as \"unacceptable\" and \"divisive\".\n\"Shame is an understatement. This election officially has no rules left anymore for BJP or Modi,\" Saket Gokhale, an MP from the Trinamool Congress party, wrote on X.\nCongress leader Salman Anees Soz said the BJP's \"hatred of us Muslims has never been more blatant\".\nLast week, an animated video posted by the BJP on Instagram falsely accused the Congress of wanting to take wealth from non-Muslim Indians to distribute it to the Muslim community.\nIt garnered over a million views and remained online for at least 48 hours before it was taken down. Several users who reported the video later shared a notification from Instagram saying it had been removed.\nThe video was released just a week after opposition parties accused Mr Modi of making Islamophobic remarks for referring to Muslims as \"infiltrators\" and \"those who have many children\" in a campaign speech.\nBeginning and ending with a call to support Mr Modi, the video showed an animated version of Rahul Gandhi holding a copy of the Congress manifesto, which then morphs into Pakistan's national flag.\n\"The Congress manifesto is nothing but the Muslim League's ideology in disguise,\" an accompanying voiceover says, adding that Mr Modi alone can stop this from happening.\nThe video also refers to a 2006 speech by former prime minister Manmohan Singh - of the Congress party - in which he speaks about empowering minority communities in the country.\nMr Modi had referred to the speech during his election campaign in Rajasthan state last month. \"Their earlier [Congress] government had said that Muslims have the fir",

In an editorial, the Times questions how effective the policy will be but it congratulates the government and the regulator for putting in place what it describes as the most thorough and balanced regime anywhere, to tackle the issue.\nThe i reports that the firm at the centre of a cyber attack on the Ministry of Defence has contracts with several other government departments, as well as the Metropolitan Police. The Times says the company provides both the Home Office and the Cabinet Office with payroll and HR functions. According to the paper, Whitehall sources say there's no evidence to suggest that the suspected Chinese hackers have data from other departments.\nThe Sun is one of several papers to highlight a report from a think tank, which claims that migration is to blame for almost 90% of housing shortfalls. The paper asks if politicians will ever \"wake up\" to the pressure caused by mass immigration, but also says too many MPs whine about property prices and then block all development. The Daily Express describes the report - by former minister Robert Jenrick - as \"hard-hitting\". It quotes him as saying the government must undo what he calls \"the disastrous post-Brexit liberalisations that betrayed the wishes of the British public for lower immigration\". \nThe Daily Telegraph reports that the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is being withdrawn worldwide.

    "Mayhem. Madness. Performing mammals. \nIn 1950s Dungannon, the day the circus hit town was a day to remember. And the day it really hit town exactly 70 years ago is no exception.\nPhilip Dynes was 19, sitting in his family home, when he heard a thunderous crash - followed by the sound of animals.\nWhat followed has become the stuff of folk legend.\nJust before 15:00 BST on 7 May 1954, a convoy from Buff Bill's Circus, carrying animals including lions and horses, came crashing through the streets of Dungannon.\nA five-ton vehicle hauling animal carriages lost control in the town centre and hurtled down Irish Street, one of County Tyrone town's narrowest streets.\nA wagon carrying three lions crashed into the shop windows of a hardware merchant and a hair salon.\nAnother wagon carrying eight performing horses, a performing donkey and four Shetland ponies, overturned into the shopfront of a local drapers.\nBuff Bill's Circus was due to perform in Ballygawley that evening - instead, the alarmed people of Dungannon got a different kind of spectacle. \nPhilip Dynes's family home was only a few doors up from the crash.\n\"Like everybody else I heard the racket and I rushed out to see what was going on,\" he recalled.\n\"You could hear the horses tramping their feet, but the fear was then about the second carriage - you could hear the lions inside.\"\nNow aged 89, he added: \"When I saw what was going on, my first instinct was to go and get my camera.\"\nPhilip took a number of pictures that day with his family's old box camera and several other images were captured by the local paper's photographer.\nThey show mangled carriages, which contained animals, as well as the large crowd that had gathered in the aftermath.\nOne face that stands out from the crowd is a man wearing a shirt and tie, smoking a cigarette and facing away from the crowd.\nAfter the photograph was shared with a local historical group, he was identified as Eddie Hughes.\nMr Hughes passed away a number of years ago, but his son Kevin still lives in Dungannon.\n\"My father would have been coming from his work that day, and I remember him talking about the horses being trapped in the overturned carriages,\" he said.\n\"He and a couple of the other local men were trying to free the horses but thankfully the lions remained in their carriage.\"\nAs word of the crash spread throughout the town, rumours even began to swirl that monkeys had escaped, although local newspaper reports from the time make no mention of this.\nKevin added: \"My father spoke about it many times down the years to friends and I remember listening to it and just thinking this was amazing.\"\nFor those from an older generation the Great Dungannon Circus Crash is something that lives long in the memory.\nBut Mary MacGinity, from the Donaghmore Historical Society, said the passage of time meant it had been forgotten by many.\n\"My late husband had always told me about the circus crash that happened in Irish Street and I always thought he was winding me up,\" she said.\n\"But once I saw the photographic evidence, I soon came to realise that it did actually happen and it's something that deserves to be remembered and marked in folk memory.\"\nBelfast's newspaper library archive holds a collection dating back as far as the 18th Century - included is a copy of the Tyrone Courier from 13 May 1954, six days after the circus crash.\nThe headline reads \"Amazing Dungannon Accident\".\nThe article's unnamed author writes: \"Friday afternoon of last week will be long remembered by the residents of Dungannon. It was then that perhaps the worst motor crash ever witnessed in the town occurred.\"\nIt continues: \"The frenzied roaring of the petrified lions and the terrified trampling and thrashing of the trapped horses and ponies soon attracted attention and the solitude of quite an ordinary Friday afternoon was turned into utter chaos as teeming masses of people rushed to the scene.\"\nIt goes on to describe the heroics of one local 21-year-old hairdresser, who saved a 19-month-old baby and his mother from being knocked down by the runaway circus truck. \nThe article finishes by saying that, \"miraculously\" the only casualties were a performing donkey, a horse and the driver of the truck, who was taken to South Tyrone Hospital suffering from internal injuries.\nAn article from the Dungannon Observer in the same week carries an interview with the driver from his hospital bed.\nWhen asked what would have happened if the lions escaped, he told the paper: \"The lions would have been more scared of the people than the people would have been scared of the lions.\n\"Of course there was the possibility that someone could have panicked and done something to provoke the animals - then anything could have happened.\"\nThe Observer article concludes that it was \"one of the most exciting incidents there ever took place in the history of Dungannon\".\nFor Philip Dynes, it is something he will never forget.\n\"People who were on that street that day were lucky to walk away wit",
    "The Israeli military says its troops have taken \"operational control\" of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt.\nRafah has been a key entry point for aid and the only exit for people able to flee since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in October.\nA tank brigade moved in to the crossing area after a night of intense strikes.\nWith Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing also closed, the UN warned Gaza's two main aid arteries were now choked off.\nOn Tuesday, the White House said it had been told Kerem Shalom would reopen on Wednesday. \nOn Monday, the Israeli military ordered tens of thousands of civilians to begin evacuating nearby eastern parts of Rafah city, ahead of what it called a \"limited\" operation to eliminate Hamas fighters and dismantle infrastructure.\nHamas said Israel's incursion and seizure of the Rafah crossing was aimed at undermining attempts by regional mediators to secure a new ceasefire deal.\nThe Palestinian armed group said on Monday that it had accepted a proposal from Egypt and Qatar, the basis of which is a weeks-long pause in the fighting and the release of several dozen hostages still held in Gaza. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that Hamas's announcement was \"very far from Israel's necessary requirements\" and that it was a failed attempt to \"disrupt the entry of our forces into Rafah\" .\nHe said he had instructed the mid-level Israeli delegation sent to Cairo on Tuesday to \"stand firm\" on the conditions required for the return of the hostages and on \"vital requirements for ensuring Israel's security\".\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told troops on the Gaza border: \"We will not cease operating in Rafah until Hamas is destroyed, or until the first hostage returns home.\"\nUN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said a deal between Israel and Hamas was \"essential to stop the unbearable suffering of Palestinians in Gaza and of the hostages and their families\".\n\"I reiterate my appeal for both parties to show the political courage and spare no effort to secure an agreement now,\" he added.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 34,780 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. \nA deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel says 128 hostages are unaccounted for, 34 of whom are presumed dead.\nIsrael has long insisted that it must eliminate the remaining Hamas battalions in Rafah to achieve victory in the war. \nBut with more than a million displaced Palestinians sheltering there, the UN and Western powers have warned that a major ground offensive could have devastating humanitarian consequences.\nOn Monday night, flares lit up the skies over the city and witnesses said there was continuous Israeli bombardment.\nPalestinian news agency Wafa cited medical sources at the local Kuwait Specialised Hospital as saying that 20 people were killed and dozens injured.\nRaed al-Derby said his wife and children were killed in an strike that levelled their family home in the western Tal al-Sultan neighbourhood.\n\"We're patient and we will remain steadfast on this land... We are waiting for liberation and this battle will be for liberation, God willing,\" he told Reuters news agency.\nSeven bodies were reportedly recovered from the rubble of the homes of two families in al-Jneineh. \nIt is one of the eastern neighbourhoods whose estimated 100,000 residents were ordered by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Monday to evacuate and head towards an \"expanded humanitarian area\", which stretches north from al-Mawasi to the city of Khan Younis and central town of Deir al-Balah.\nOn Tuesday morning, an IDF statement announced that Israeli troops had begun a \"precise\" operation to \"eliminate Hamas terrorists and dismantle Hamas terrorist infrastructure within specific areas of eastern Rafah\". \nFighter jets and ground forces had also struck military structures, underground infrastructure and other sites from which Hamas operated in the Rafah area, killing approximately 20 \"terrorists\" and destroying three operational tunnel shafts, it added.\nThe IDF also announced that troops had \"managed to establish operational control\" of the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing, following intelligence that it was \"being used for terrorist purposes\".\nIt did not provide any details but said mortars fired from the area on Sunday had killed four Israeli soldiers and injured others at the nearby Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing. \nThe IDF released drone footage showing an armoured vehicle flying a large Israeli flag at the crossing as well as a number of tanks in the square outside the Palestinian migration centre. \nAn",
    "Actor Kevin Spacey has won a bid to fight a civil trial over an allegation that he sexually assaulted a man.\nThe man claims he was assaulted in 2008 and, as a result, has \"suffered psychiatric damage and financial loss\".\nThe civil claim was paused after Mr Spacey was charged - and later acquitted - in criminal proceedings of a number of sexual offences.\nThe hearing comes after the star denied allegations of inappropriate behaviour aired in a documentary on Channel 4.\nSpacey Unmasked, which was broadcast on Monday, featured testimony from several men.\nLast year Spacey was found not guilty of all charges of sexual assault against four men between 2001 and 2013.\nOne of those four complainants, who has been granted anonymity by the court, separately sued Spacey in a civil lawsuit at London's High Court in July 2022 but the lawsuit was paused until the outcome of the criminal trial. \nEarlier this year, a judge granted the unknown man a \"judgement in default\" - a ruling in his favour without a trial - after Spacey's lawyers failed to serve a defence to the lawsuit in time.\nIn court on Tuesday, Adam Speker KC, Spacey's lawyer, said this was a \"genuine error\" by his legal team and argued that it would unfair for the claimant to effectively win his lawsuit against Spacey without a trial when he had been \"disbelieved on oath by a jury\".\nJudge Jeremy Cook overturned the judgement in default against the actor.\nHe said: \"The defendant's solicitors have made an error.\n\"In my view, that error should not be visited upon the defendant.\"\nSpacey was not in attendance and a date for the trial is yet to be confirmed. \nSpacey spoke to former GB News presenter Dan Wootton ahead of the documentary and said he would not allow himself to be \"baselessly attacked without defending himself\".\nMr Spacey told Mr Wootton: \"I take full responsibility for my past behaviour and my actions but I cannot and will not take responsibility or apologise to anyone who has made up stuff about me or exaggerated stories about me.\"",
    "The drama started on Friday morning, before a single vote had been counted. It didn\u2019t stop until late in the night on Saturday.\nIt\u2019s normal for party campaign teams and supporters to brief journalists on how they think the vote has gone once the polls are closed and the ballot papers are verified.\nAt that point, they can have a good idea about the result and even the side that thinks they have won may talk down their chances, hoping to make that victory appear even more spectacular when it is finally confirmed.\nBut as it became clear the Conservatives were heading for a disastrous set of local election results, a Labour contact went further than what\u2019s usually described as \"expectation management\".\nA quote, swiftly condemned as racist by the party itself, not only predicted an Andy Street victory in the Mayoral election, but bluntly pinned the blame for defeat on how the Labour Party has dealt with the issue of the War in Gaza.\nThe source said: \"It\u2019s the Middle East, not West Midlands, that will have won Andy Street the mayoralty. Once again Hamas are the real villains.\"\nThe language used was shocking to many, but it got directly to the heart of an issue which MPs and activists had been warning about in the Midlands for many months.\nIn communities where the Middle East conflict is the number one political issue of the day, voters who Labour have relied on, in some cases for decades, have fallen out with the party.\nIt\u2019s even persuaded some politicians to quit the front bench. \nThe fact this vote was to elect a mayor with limited local powers over things including transport and housing rather than international relations, could have been irrelevant.\nTwenty-four hours later, the ICC in Birmingham was filled with the noise of hundreds of people counting thousands of pieces of paper. \nIt\u2019s an unmistakeable sound to anyone who\u2019s ever been to watch an election result come in.\nAs the votes piled up, it started to look like that prediction of defeat the previous morning, illustrated with such raw language, might have been on the money.\nOne by one, the candidates started to arrive, delivered to the waiting photographers and film crews by an escalator, giving the whole event a bizarre Saturday night TV gameshow vibe.\nThe predicted result time of mid-afternoon came and went.\nIndependent candidate Akhmed Yakoob, who stood on a pro-Palestine ticket, was doing very well in Birmingham.\nNews and rumour filtered in from the six other count centres. The Conservatives doing well in Dudley, Labour up in Wolverhampton, a confirmed result in Tory stronghold Solihull.\n\"It\u2019s too close to call\" was the repeated message from campaign teams as we scanned their faces for any hint of joy or disappointment.\nThen the news that bundles of votes were being re-checked.\nConfirmation of a full recount in Coventry came just before 17:00 BST, meaning a two-hour delay.\nIn between updating our viewers on Midlands Today and the BBC News channel, I roamed the corridors outside the hall.\nLabour\u2019s Richard Parker, who later revealed he had only written a losing speech, looked overcome by the tension. His supporters offered hugs and reassuring words.\nConservative Andy Street was locked away with his inner circle of advisers.\nThe two rival camps mixed and sworn political enemies shared stories and jokes from the campaign trail to pass the time.\nSome supporters gave up and went for a drink, watching our coverage on pub TVs for clues on when to come back for the result.\nSuddenly, at around 19:30, the mood changed. Smiles appeared on the faces of those wearing red rosettes.\nNothing was official, but news had obviously filtered through from Coventry.\nRichard Parker didn\u2019t seem willing to believe the victory was real until the paperwork was signed and refused my request for a photo with a smile simply saying \"not yet\".\nThe Conservative camp, who moments earlier had been full of hope, were deflated.\nIt was another 90 minutes before the returning officer finally gave Richard Parker permission to smile.\nIt had been so close, just 1,508 votes, a difference of 0.3%.\nThe usual media scramble began. We are always dashing to get the loser first - they\u2019ve just lost their job in a very public way and are often keen to disappear. The winner will talk all night.\nAndy Street fronted up, telling us he was \"gutted\" to have lost but that it had been a privilege to lead the region. \nOff-camera I offered a handshake and commiserations - I\u2019ve been interviewing this man for the best part of a decade and just like that, for him, it\u2019s over.\nParker was whisked in front of live TV cameras, before his team stage-managed the arrival of a triumphant Sir Keir Starmer.\nAbout 150 people crammed into a tiny space somewhere high up in the ICC to watch the Labour leader celebrate with the new mayor.\nThe tension of the day was released in deafening cheers, the atmosphere electric - it felt like a huge moment in British politics.\nFourteen hours after arriving at the venue, I found myself sprin",

    "A US Army soldier stationed in South Korea has been detained in Russia, the US military says.\nThe Russian foreign ministry said the charges were not related to \"politics or espionage\", but to a \"purely domestic crime\".\nStaff Sgt Gordon Black is accused of stealing personal property. \nThe 34-year-old was not on official travel when he was held on 2 May in the city of Vladivostok, in Russia's Far East.  \nSgt Black had been in the process of changing duty stations from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in the US state of Texas, according to a statement from the US Army. \nBut instead of returning to the US, he travelled through China to Vladivostok for personal reasons, US Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith said in a statement. \nAccording to Russian media, he was visiting a woman with whom he had a romantic relationship.\nThe soldier's mother, Melody Jones, confirmed to CBS that he was in Russia visiting his girlfriend.\n\"Please do not torture him [or] hurt him,\" Melody Jones said when asked about her message to the Russians. \nSgt Black enlisted as an infantryman in 2008 and was deployed to Iraq in 2009 and Afghanistan in 2013. He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea.\nHe did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia, the US Army said. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property. \nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing. \n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday. \nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details. \nRussia is holding two other Americans.

    "The mother of woman whose work to raise awareness of brain cancer inspired people across the world hopes her book about her will \"keep her memory alive\".  \nNicola Nuttall's daughter Laura, of Barrowford, Lancashire, was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer in 2018 and died, aged 23, in May 2023.\nDespite being given an initial prognosis of 12 months, she defied the odds and worked her way through a bucket list of goals including meeting Michelle Obama. \nNicola's book, The Stars Will Still Be There: A memoir of what my daughter taught me about love, life and loss is published on Thursday.\nLaura was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, the most aggressive form of brain cancer, following a routine eye test.\nNicola said as well as telling her family's story, she also hoped her memoir could help others going through a similar situation, or a health issue that \"puts pressure on the whole family\".\nThe family has continued Laura's campaign work since her death, and her legacy, the Be More Laura Foundation, has already made grants and donations of \u00a385,000 to research projects, Nicola said.\n\"She hated it every time we had another person diagnosed, another small child dealing with this awful diagnosis.\n\"That was the only time she really got upset... so in her memory we want to help try and move towards, if not a cure, then certainly kinder and more effective treatment.\"\nNicola reveals in the book the family had endured tragedy before. \nShe said Laura was named after her own sister, who died when she was very young. \nNicola said she wanted to make her parents happy by naming her Laura after their late daughter, but in a cruel twist of fate it ended up breaking their hearts again.\n\"I made them relive it for a second time, which was really hard because they had to go through the loss of their granddaughter, but also seeing us going through the devastation that they went through.\n\"I named her Laura with the best will in the world. \n\"I would never have imagined in a million years we'd be grieving a second Laura.\"\nThe book also documents Laura's bucket list and her inspirational campaigning, which endeared her to people all over the world.\nHer exploits would see her command a Royal Navy ship and graduate from the University of Manchester.\nNicola said the family had been \"so lucky\" to have had such support for Laura's adventures. \n\"Those memories were so precious because when things were tough and she was poorly, we had this amazing mental album to look back on,\" she said. \nNicola still keeps in touch with people from across the world who were inspired by her daughter, such as a man in America who sent $41 a month towards Laura's treatment, and a teacher in Brazil who talks about her in her classes and has a Laura \"Be kind\" print on the classroom wall.\n\"A life that has touched so many other lives isn't a life wasted, even if it was so short,\" Nicola said.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds\u00a0and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram?

    "After months of on-off hard talking between belligerents and mediators, the time has come for hard decisions. \nHamas has agreed to a draft ceasefire deal, which is \"far from meeting Israel's demands\", according to Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He has still felt it necessary to dispatch a delegation to discuss it. \nIsrael agreed to a ceasefire offer at the end of April. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it was \"exceptionally generous\". \nA big challenge for the negotiators in Cairo is closing the gap between Israel's version and the one accepted by Hamas. Diplomatic sources in Qatar, which is part of the mediation effort with Egypt and the United States, told me \"it is broadly the same as Israel's proposal. Just minor wordings changed and details\".\nIsrael may decide that the differences are not minor. One major sticking point has been that Hamas wants a ceasefire to be permanent, not temporary, and to be followed by an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. \nIf the US delegation, led by the CIA chief William Burns, believes the gaps can be bridged, Mr Netanyahu can expect pressure from Washington to agree. \nUntil Monday evening, Israel's working assumption was that Hamas would not accept a ceasefire proposal. Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, like most foreign observers, were blindsided when Hamas announced its decision.\nThere are two ways of looking at the Hamas gambit. It can be seen as a desperate move by an organisation badly bloodied and almost broken by Israel's long offensive. \nOr it was an adroit political move, which has turned the pressure back on Mr Netanyahu. That explanation is more credible, as Israel's plans and assumptions were upended by the offer. \nWe know that Israel was basing its moves in the next phase of the war on an assumption that Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas chief in Gaza who has been in hiding since 7 October, would never accept a ceasefire. \nIsrael used the absence of a ceasefire offer from Hamas as an explanation for its decision to launch a military operation in Gaza. The US is very clear that it is against any ground operation in Rafah that could threaten the lives of more Palestinian civilians. \nAs Israel warned around 100,000 Palestinians to leave their homes at first light on Monday, its defence minister Yoav Gallant told his US counterpart that there was no alternative to a Rafah assault. \nThat, he said, was because Hamas had rejected every proposal for a temporary ceasefire and a release of hostages. Only a few hours later, Hamas made its announcement, calling Israel's bluff.\nMr Netanyahu is in a political bind. His governing style over more than 16 years as Israel's leader has been characterised by a habit of putting off difficult choices. \nBut now he is under severe pressure, from all sides, and however tempting it might be to play for time, this is a moment for decisions. \nThe most intense pressure comes from two ultranationalist Jewish extremists in his cabinet - finance minister Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, minister for national security. \nMr Netanyahu needs their votes to keep his coalition in power. They want Israel to occupy Rafah and have threatened to topple the government if he does not make it happen. For them, a ceasefire equals surrender. \nAt the same time, families and supporters of Israeli hostages have been demonstrating, blocking major roads to demand that Israel makes a deal to get them back home. \nThe hostage families have support in the war cabinet from Benny Gantz and Gabi Eisenkot, two opposition leaders who joined the cabinet after the 7 October attacks. They might leave the government if, in the absence of a ceasefire, the hostages stay put. \nThe Americans also want a deal. President Biden's support for Israel, even as its army killed huge numbers of Palestinian civilians, is costing him political support. \nIf Mr Biden decides that there is an acceptable version of a ceasefire to be had, he will push Benjamin Netanyahu to support it. \nThe Israeli leader would have to choose between his government's survival and the vital support the US president has given him in recent months. \nIt is widely believed in Israel that Mr Netanyahu wants to prolong the war to put off the moment of reckoning for his own part in the mistakes that gave Hamas its opportunity on 7 October to kill around 1200 people, mostly Israelis and take 240 hostages into Gaza. \nA ceasefire would also mean that Benjamin Netanyahu has not achieved \"total victory\" over Hamas - one of his two main war aims. The other is freeing the hostages, which he has not achieved either. \nThis war is showing, once again, how hard it is for powerful countries like Israel to defeat much weaker organisations like Hamas. For Hamas, survival means victory, and Benjamin Netanyahu knows that, for him, would be a defeat. ",

We will cherish every memory made with them and love and miss them forever.\"\nThe family said there were not enough words to describe the pain and hurt that is in their hearts.\n\"We miss everything about them, hearing their voices, their laughs, the conversations we would have, the games we would play as a family, the hugs and kisses that we won't ever get from them again,\" they wrote.\n\"We are no longer the people we were when they were alive as we died with them that day. We do not know how to live in this world without them. \n\"It's a struggle we live with every day.\"\n\n",
    "Batley and Spen MP Kim Leadbeater is calling for tighter legislation around new drivers to help cut down the number of deaths on the roads. \nOn Tuesday she introduced a new law in Parliament proposing graduated driving licences.\nIt is the latest stage in the road safety campaign she launched shortly after being elected in July 2021.\nUnder the proposed legislation, newly-qualified drivers would face certain restrictions for the first six months after passing a driving test, including a zero-alcohol limit.\nMs Leadbeater introduced her Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) (New Drivers) Bill under the so-called Ten Minute Rule.\nThe proposal for graduated driving licences has cross-party support in the House of Commons.\nThe licences are backed by many road safety and motoring organisations including the AA, the RAC and Brake. Their introduction also has the support of the Association of British Insurers.\nThe bill would impose restrictions on all newly-qualified drivers during their initial six months as a licence-holder, with exemptions for work, medical and emergency reasons.\nThe restrictions would also include controls over the number of young passengers they are allowed to carry.\nFigures from the Department of Transport, cited by Ms Leadbeater, show that in 2022, 29,742 people were killed or seriously injured on UK roads. \nAround a fifth of all those killed or seriously injured were as a result of collisions involving cars driven by a young driver.\n\"We must never forget that behind that statistic there are thousands of lives, right across the country, grieving or going through unimaginable pain,\" said Ms Leadbetter.\n\"Lives changed forever and families torn apart by tragic and often avoidable collisions.\"\nYoung male car drivers aged 17-24 are four times as likely to be killed or seriously injured compared with all car drivers aged 25 or over.\nThe Batley and Spen MP took up the issue of graduated driving licences after meeting Dr Ian Greenwood at Westminster.  \nDr Greenwood, from Halifax, lost his 12-year-old daughter, Alice, when the car her mother was driving was hit by another car in 2008. The 18-year-old driver of the other car, and his 16-year-old passenger, were also killed in the accident.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Leeds, Dr Greenwood described his daughter as \"forever 12\", stressing that the consequences of drivers \"misbehaving on our roads\" can be \"devastating\". \nDr Greenwood has praised the \"amazing\" work being done by Ms Leadbeater to highlight the issue, adding \"politicians haven't really been interested in road death - it's not something people want to talk about\". \nMs Leadbeater's bill will receive its second reading on 17 May.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter)\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

    "Police in Slovakia are trying to find out who sent more than 1,000 bomb threats to schools and other institutions on Tuesday.\nPolice teams with sniffer dogs and bomb disposal experts were called out repeatedly across the country. \nThe alerts prompted mass evacuations. \nOfficials said they were treating the threats \"as a particularly serious crime of terrorist attack\".\nEmails from an anonymous sender reportedly began arriving at 05:00, alleging that explosives were stored in hundreds of schools spanning the country's eight regions.\nThe number of confirmed threats issued has reportedly been growing.\nOfficials have not specified what is in the threats. But according to TV reports, they were written in Slovak, sent from a Russian email address and targeted what the author described as enemies of Islam.\nClasses were suspended as specialist teams investigated the alerts. The vast majority were sent to schools, but Slovakia's national police announced on social media that at least 110 banks and 40 electrical stores also received the bomb threats.\nPolice say they are working intensively, co-operating with security services to identify those behind the threats.\nAuthorities said the threats had caused psychological stress across the country, adding that the disruption to educational services could have \"far-reaching consequences\".\nIt comes after similar emails were reportedly sent to more than 120 schools in the Bratislava region last week, according to police.\nIf caught, the perpetrator faces life imprisonment.\nThe incidents come at a time of heightened tensions over the war in neighbouring Ukraine.\nIn April, Slovakia's newly elected populist-nationalist leader, Robert Fico, pledged not to send \"one more round of ammunition\" to Ukraine.\nFor months, Ukrainian forces have struggled to defend their front lines from the Russian advance because of a shortage of shells, rockets and air defences.\nBut Mr Fico has refused to join about 20 countries that have signed up to a Czech-led operation to procure large quantities of artillery ammunition on the global arms market.\n",
    "A nursery worker accused of causing the death of a baby girl admitted she appeared \"impatient\" on CCTV footage played at her trial.\nKate Roughley is accused of the manslaughter by ill treatment of nine-month-old Genevieve Meehan, who she cared for at the Tiny Toes Nursery in Stockport.\nThe baby died after being strapped face down to a bean bag for 90 minutes.\nRoughley, 37, on trial at Manchester Crown Court, denies manslaughter and an alternative child cruelty charge.\nThe baby was found unresponsive and blue on the afternoon of 9 May 2022 at the nursery in Cheadle Hulme.\nStaff and paramedics attempted to revive her but she was pronounced dead later that day in hospital.\nThe court was shown CCTV footage of the baby room at the nursery and how the staff interacted with the children.\nThe prosecution has claimed Ms Roughley, of Heaton Norris, Stockport, felt \"hostility\" towards baby Genevieve. \nThe jury was told that she sang: \u201cGenevieve, Genevieve, stop your whingeing, Genevieve\u201d on one occasion.\nAnd on another, Genevieve rolled over on her side and Ms Roughley picked her up, saying, \u201cSit up properly, stress head\".\nGiving evidence under examination by her own barrister, Sarah Elliott KC,  Ms Roughley admitted she appeared \"impatient\" in the CCTV footage.\nShe told the court that she sang songs or made up rhymes about some babies, and Genevieve in particular, to \u201centertain them\u201d.\nThe nurse said and there was \"no malice in it\" and a comment about Genevieve being a stress head was \"just a throwaway comment\u201d. \nAsked about staffing levels at the nursery, Ms Roughley told the court that \"two or three times a week\" Tiny Toes was \"over ratio\".\nShe said that \"did affect quality\", and meant \"you couldn\u2019t give some care\".\nThere was also a requirement on staff to take numerous photos and videos of each child every day to send to parents, she said. \nMs Roughley was questioned about sleeping arrangements and the use of the \"bean bag bed\" in which Genevieve was placed for her nap. \nShe said it was regularly used for babies when the six cots were full. \nAsked about its safety, she said staff \"had to improvise\", and that the straps stopping babies from falling off the bean bags were not tight. \nQuestioned about swaddling, she said it was used it on the children to comfort them, \"like a cuddle\". \nThe trial continues.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "A 12-year-old schoolboy could have tripped and been hit by a truck as he ran across a road with other youngsters, an inquest has been told.\nHarrison Palmer, from Camborne, Cornwall, was pronounced dead at the scene after being hit by a van in Pool in March 2023.\nThe coroner recorded a conclusion of death after a road traffic collision.\nHarrison's mother Natalie Buckland said the death had \"hugely impacted the lives of everyone who knew and loved him\".\nThe hearing in Truro was told the boys had gone into town after school because a football practice had been cancelled.\nThe boys ran to the central reservation island on the A3047 Agar Road, but Harrison did not stop and continued running and was struck by a truck in the opposite lane.\nDriver Kelvin Fulcher was arrested at the scene but no further action was taken against him. \nHe was recorded as driving at 26mph (42 km/h) along the 30mph (48 km/h) road, the inquest heard.\nMr Fulcher said he was aware of four children crossing to the central reservation and that he \"heard a thud\" when he drove past and stopped.\n\"It was not a very nice feeling - I don't know if he had fallen or tripped. I presume he must have tripped,\" he said.\nMr Fulcher gave negative results to drink and drugs tests, and had not been using his mobile phone at the time of the collision.\nThe inquest heard his truck had some minor defects, but they did not cause or contribute to the accident.\nWitnesses said they believed the boys had been sprinting at the time.\nSenior Cornwall Coroner Andrew Cox said Harrison did not stop on the traffic island and continued without looking, or because he was going too quickly to stop half-way across the road.\nMs Buckland said Harrison was \"always so cautious crossing roads, stopping and checking multiple times, not crossing if a vehicle was in sight even in the distance\".\nShe said: \"I guess that makes it harder to comprehend.\n\"Every aspect of our lives have been impacted and upturned. our hearts will always be broken and we are all so very lost without him.\"\nHarrison's family said his death had affected his school, his friends, the truck driver, the emergency services and those who helped at the scene.\nHis family praised the \"incredible work that our emergency services do\".\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "The Israeli military says its troops have taken \"operational control\" of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt.\nRafah has been a key entry point for aid and the only exit for people able to flee since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in October.\nA tank brigade moved in to the crossing area after a night of intense strikes.\nWith Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing also closed, the UN warned Gaza's two main aid arteries were now choked off.\nOn Tuesday, the White House said it had been told Kerem Shalom would reopen on Wednesday. \nOn Monday, the Israeli military ordered tens of thousands of civilians to begin evacuating nearby eastern parts of Rafah city, ahead of what it called a \"limited\" operation to eliminate Hamas fighters and dismantle infrastructure.\nHamas said Israel's incursion and seizure of the Rafah crossing was aimed at undermining attempts by regional mediators to secure a new ceasefire deal.\nThe Palestinian armed group said on Monday that it had accepted a proposal from Egypt and Qatar, the basis of which is a weeks-long pause in the fighting and the release of several dozen hostages still held in Gaza. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that Hamas's announcement was \"very far from Israel's necessary requirements\" and that it was a failed attempt to \"disrupt the entry of our forces into Rafah\" .\nHe said he had instructed the mid-level Israeli delegation sent to Cairo on Tuesday to \"stand firm\" on the conditions required for the return of the hostages and on \"vital requirements for ensuring Israel's security\".\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told troops on the Gaza border: \"We will not cease operating in Rafah until Hamas is destroyed, or until the first hostage returns home.\"\nUN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said a deal between Israel and Hamas was \"essential to stop the unbearable suffering of Palestinians in Gaza and of the hostages and their families\".\n\"I reiterate my appeal for both parties to show the political courage and spare no effort to secure an agreement now,\" he added.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 34,780 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. \nA deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel says 128 hostages are unaccounted for, 34 of whom are presumed dead.\nIsrael has long insisted that it must eliminate the remaining Hamas battalions in Rafah to achieve victory in the war. \nBut with more than a million displaced Palestinians sheltering there, the UN and Western powers have warned that a major ground offensive could have devastating humanitarian consequences.\nOn Monday night, flares lit up the skies over the city and witnesses said there was continuous Israeli bombardment.\nPalestinian news agency Wafa cited medical sources at the local Kuwait Specialised Hospital as saying that 20 people were killed and dozens injured.\nRaed al-Derby said his wife and children were killed in an strike that levelled their family home in the western Tal al-Sultan neighbourhood.\n\"We're patient and we will remain steadfast on this land... We are waiting for liberation and this battle will be for liberation, God willing,\" he told Reuters news agency.\nSeven bodies were reportedly recovered from the rubble of the homes of two families in al-Jneineh. \nIt is one of the eastern neighbourhoods whose estimated 100,000 residents were ordered by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Monday to evacuate and head towards an \"expanded humanitarian area\", which stretches north from al-Mawasi to the city of Khan Younis and central town of Deir al-Balah.\nOn Tuesday morning, an IDF statement announced that Israeli troops had begun a \"precise\" operation to \"eliminate Hamas terrorists and dismantle Hamas terrorist infrastructure within specific areas of eastern Rafah\". \nFighter jets and ground forces had also struck military structures, underground infrastructure and other sites from which Hamas operated in the Rafah area, killing approximately 20 \"terrorists\" and destroying three operational tunnel shafts, it added.\nThe IDF also announced that troops had \"managed to establish operational control\" of the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing, following intelligence that it was \"being used for terrorist purposes\".\nIt did not provide any details but said mortars fired from the area on Sunday had killed four Israeli soldiers and injured others at the nearby Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing. \nThe IDF released drone footage showing an armoured vehicle flying a large Israeli flag at the crossing as well as a number of tanks in the square outside the Palestinian migration centre. \nAn",
    "The drama started on Friday morning, before a single vote had been counted. It didn\u2019t stop until late in the night on Saturday.\nIt\u2019s normal for party campaign teams and supporters to brief journalists on how they think the vote has gone once the polls are closed and the ballot papers are verified.\nAt that point, they can have a good idea about the result and even the side that thinks they have won may talk down their chances, hoping to make that victory appear even more spectacular when it is finally confirmed.\nBut as it became clear the Conservatives were heading for a disastrous set of local election results, a Labour contact went further than what\u2019s usually described as \"expectation management\".\nA quote, swiftly condemned as racist by the party itself, not only predicted an Andy Street victory in the Mayoral election, but bluntly pinned the blame for defeat on how the Labour Party has dealt with the issue of the War in Gaza.\nThe source said: \"It\u2019s the Middle East, not West Midlands, that will have won Andy Street the mayoralty. Once again Hamas are the real villains.\"\nThe language used was shocking to many, but it got directly to the heart of an issue which MPs and activists had been warning about in the Midlands for many months.\nIn communities where the Middle East conflict is the number one political issue of the day, voters who Labour have relied on, in some cases for decades, have fallen out with the party.\nIt\u2019s even persuaded some politicians to quit the front bench. \nThe fact this vote was to elect a mayor with limited local powers over things including transport and housing rather than international relations, could have been irrelevant.\nTwenty-four hours later, the ICC in Birmingham was filled with the noise of hundreds of people counting thousands of pieces of paper. \nIt\u2019s an unmistakeable sound to anyone who\u2019s ever been to watch an election result come in.\nAs the votes piled up, it started to look like that prediction of defeat the previous morning, illustrated with such raw language, might have been on the money.\nOne by one, the candidates started to arrive, delivered to the waiting photographers and film crews by an escalator, giving the whole event a bizarre Saturday night TV gameshow vibe.\nThe predicted result time of mid-afternoon came and went.\nIndependent candidate Akhmed Yakoob, who stood on a pro-Palestine ticket, was doing very well in Birmingham.\nNews and rumour filtered in from the six other count centres. The Conservatives doing well in Dudley, Labour up in Wolverhampton, a confirmed result in Tory stronghold Solihull.\n\"It\u2019s too close to call\" was the repeated message from campaign teams as we scanned their faces for any hint of joy or disappointment.\nThen the news that bundles of votes were being re-checked.\nConfirmation of a full recount in Coventry came just before 17:00 BST, meaning a two-hour delay.\nIn between updating our viewers on Midlands Today and the BBC News channel, I roamed the corridors outside the hall.\nLabour\u2019s Richard Parker, who later revealed he had only written a losing speech, looked overcome by the tension. His supporters offered hugs and reassuring words.\nConservative Andy Street was locked away with his inner circle of advisers.\nThe two rival camps mixed and sworn political enemies shared stories and jokes from the campaign trail to pass the time.\nSome supporters gave up and went for a drink, watching our coverage on pub TVs for clues on when to come back for the result.\nSuddenly, at around 19:30, the mood changed. Smiles appeared on the faces of those wearing red rosettes.\nNothing was official, but news had obviously filtered through from Coventry.\nRichard Parker didn\u2019t seem willing to believe the victory was real until the paperwork was signed and refused my request for a photo with a smile simply saying \"not yet\".\nThe Conservative camp, who moments earlier had been full of hope, were deflated.\nIt was another 90 minutes before the returning officer finally gave Richard Parker permission to smile.\nIt had been so close, just 1,508 votes, a difference of 0.3%.\nThe usual media scramble began. We are always dashing to get the loser first - they\u2019ve just lost their job in a very public way and are often keen to disappear. The winner will talk all night.\nAndy Street fronted up, telling us he was \"gutted\" to have lost but that it had been a privilege to lead the region. \nOff-camera I offered a handshake and commiserations - I\u2019ve been interviewing this man for the best part of a decade and just like that, for him, it\u2019s over.\nParker was whisked in front of live TV cameras, before his team stage-managed the arrival of a triumphant Sir Keir Starmer.\nAbout 150 people crammed into a tiny space somewhere high up in the ICC to watch the Labour leader celebrate with the new mayor.\nThe tension of the day was released in deafening cheers, the atmosphere electric - it felt like a huge moment in British politics.\nFourteen hours after arriving at the venue, I found myself sprin",

How was it linked to changing patterns of immigration? \nHow much was it about different perceptions of anti-social behaviour? \nAnd, how was fear fuelled by misinformation that spread like wildfire online?\nThe panel also wants to hear suggestions about how to prevent future unrest in Leicester and across the country.\nIts recommendations will be for both the city and national government.\nSince the review launched, Lord Austin said the panellists had visited Leicester 15 times and had also held about 15 meetings online.\nThe call for evidence will be open until 4 June, and evidence can be submitted on the government website.\nAll responses to the appeal will be treated confidentially unless respondents state otherwise, the panel said.\nThe panel will also be speaking to local authorities and police forces in other parts of the country, and is speaking to experts about the role social media played. \nLord Austin added: \"In the end, if we're producing the report, it obviously makes sense for everybody to have their voice heard and this is going to make recommendations to the government, so why would you not want to?\"\nThe final report will share recommendations, with the aim of preventing the events in Leicester from happening again, in the city and elsewhere across the country. \nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A US Army soldier stationed in South Korea has been detained in Russia, the US military says.\nThe Russian foreign ministry said the charges were not related to \"politics or espionage\", but to a \"purely domestic crime\".\nStaff Sgt Gordon Black is accused of stealing personal property. \nThe 34-year-old was not on official travel when he was held on 2 May in the city of Vladivostok, in Russia's Far East.  \nSgt Black had been in the process of changing duty stations from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in the US state of Texas, according to a statement from the US Army. \nBut instead of returning to the US, he travelled through China to Vladivostok for personal reasons, US Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith said in a statement. \nAccording to Russian media, he was visiting a woman with whom he had a romantic relationship.\nThe soldier's mother, Melody Jones, confirmed to CBS that he was in Russia visiting his girlfriend.\n\"Please do not torture him [or] hurt him,\" Melody Jones said when asked about her message to the Russians. \nSgt Black enlisted as an infantryman in 2008 and was deployed to Iraq in 2009 and Afghanistan in 2013.

    "South African opposition leader John Steenhuisen believes he has what it takes to eventually become president.\nThat is despite coming up against the thorny issue of race and the African National Congress's 30-year grip on power.\nFor decades he has argued that his party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), is the key to South Africa's progress.\nThe centre-right movement emerged from the liberal white benches of the old apartheid parliament, positing itself as a liberal alternative to the ANC.\nMr Steenhuisen joined the DA as an activist in the 1990s, when he was roughly 19 years old. \n\"I decided to go into politics because of my frustration with the status quo in our country, where South Africa's immense potential was being squandered at the hands of an inept government,\" he said in a 2020 interview.\nA young Mr Steenhuisen enrolled on a course in politics and law at university but never graduated - something he was later mocked for by social media users and other politicians.\nIn a defiant speech to parliament, Mr Steenhuisen, then chief whip of the DA, said \"financial and work pressures\" had forced him to drop out. \n\"I'm not ashamed of this because I knew from an early age that I wanted to be a public representative,\" he said.\nMr Steenhuisen certainly showed ambition as a budding politician - he was elected as a councillor for his home city of Durban aged 22 and is thought to be one of the youngest to have ever held this post.\nFrom there, the future leader scaled the ranks of regional politics - that is until 2010, when he was forced to resign as the DA's leader for the KwaZulu-Natal region after it emerged that he was having an affair.\nAt the time, Mr Steenhuisen was married but also romantically involved with a DA spokeswoman, Terry Kass Beaumont. Ms Beaumont also had a spouse - DA KwaZulu-Natal official Michael Beaumont.\nMr Steenhuisen's infidelity did \"no significant damage\" to his career, Paddy Harper, a journalist with South Africa's Mail & Guardian newspaper, tells the BBC.\nMr Harper notes that Mr Steenhuisen eventually married Ms Beaumont, which may have prevented the affair becoming a stain on the opposition leader's legacy.\nIn 2011, shortly after his resignation, Mr Steenhuisen was elected to national parliament. Three years later, he became the DA's chief whip.\nAt this point, the party was preparing to make a major change. The DA has long been perceived as a party that promotes the interests of white, Asian and coloured (as people of mixed race are known in South Africa) people, in a country where they make up just 7%, 3% and 8% of the population respectively.\n So, partly in an attempt to diversify its appeal, the DA appointed its first black leader.\nThe charismatic Mmusi Maimane was viewed as the party's best shot at the presidency, but he quit just four years later. \nAs the DA reeled from his exit, Mr Maimane said the party was the wrong \"vehicle\" for uniting a South Africa that remains divided along racial lines 30 years after the end of white-minority rule.\nMr Steenhuisen was appointed as interim leader the following month - but what should have been an unquestionable triumph for this dedicated DA member was not without contention. \nSocial media users pointed out that the DA leadership was now all white, while DA officials who had quit alongside Mr Maimane warned the party was lurching back to the right.\nWhen asked last year whether the DA's image as a \"fundamentally white party\" was a structural issue, Mr Steenhuisen told the BBC: \"People are looking beyond race towards competence, [the] ability to get things done and being able to deliver - that's the game in town and that's going to be the game in the next election.\"\nHe opposes race quotas in the workplace - introduced by the ANC in a bid to close South Africa's racial economic gap - calling them \"crude\" and unsuccessful.\nOn Mr Steenhuisen's approach to racial issues, South African political analyst Richard Calland says: \"He comes across as someone who is privileged, but unconscious, unaware of the context, unaware of the lived reality for most South Africans.\"\nThis makes it hard for him to extend his appeal to black voters, who are still far more likely to be living in poverty than the white population.\nSouth Africa was the world's most unequal country in 2022, a situation partly driven by race, according to the World Bank.\nNevertheless, Mr Steenhuisen is clearly popular within the DA. He has been re-elected twice as party leader, receiving 80% or more of the vote each time.\nSome analysts believe a portion of Mr Steenhuisen's clout comes from Helen Zille, the DA's former leader and still a major political figure within South Africa.\n\"Zille has continued to be the power behind the throne. Her attitude is that her presence is essential, not just for the DA, but for the future of democracy in South Africa,\" Mr Calland says.\n\"Steenhuisen, I think, is to a large extent beholden to her. Her support was essential for him to become leader.\"\nA poll taken ",
    "Special services in Poland have discovered and removed bugging devices in a room where cabinet ministers were due to meet.\nThe weekly cabinet meeting normally takes place in the prime minister\u2019s office in Warsaw.\nBut Tuesday's session was relocated to the southern city of Katowice because several ministers, including Prime Minister Donald Tusk, were due to attend a major economic conference there.\nPoland has seen increased spying activity since it became an international hub for military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine following Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion.\nIn a separate case this week a judge has sought asylum in neighbouring Belarus, and Mr Tusk said on Tuesday he had access to confidential documents.\n\u201cThe State Protection Service, in co-operation with the Internal Security Agency, detected and dismantled devices that could be used for eavesdropping,\" wrote security services spokesman Jacek Dobrzynski on X. \"The services are carrying out further activities in this matter.\"\nMr Dobrzynski told the TVN24 broadcaster the devices were found during a routine security sweep of the room. Poland\u2019s Internal Security Agency is now investigating what the devices were, and who could possibly have installed them.\nFollowing the security check, the cabinet meeting went ahead in the building as planned.\nA spokeswoman for the Silesia regional authorities, Alicja Waliszewska, told state news agency PAP that the device may have been part of the room\u2019s old communication system that was no longer operational.\nThe discovery follows news on Monday that a Polish judge is seeking asylum in neighbouring Belarus.\nTomasz Szmydt, a judge at the Voivodship Administrative Court in Warsaw, told a news conference in Minsk his actions were in protest against Poland\u2019s \u201charmful\u201d policy towards Belarus and Russia that could result in armed conflict between the countries.\nInvestigators are checking whether the judge had been spying. He was reportedly due to rule next month on cases concerning security clearance for confidential information on Nato, of which Poland is a member.\nCommenting on the affair, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski wrote on X: \u201cA traitor. The only question is since when.\u201d\nMr Szmydt gained notoriety in Poland for his involvement in an online smear campaign that was allegedly run from the justice ministry against judges who opposed the judicial reform introduced by the previous Law and Justice-led government.\nDonald Tusk has convened a meeting of the Secret Services College for Wednesday to discuss potential Russian and Belarusian influence in Polish politics in recent years.\n\u201cWe must be aware that services, in this case Belarusian ones, worked with a person who had direct access to the minister of justice\u2026 who had access to various classified documents to which no intelligence service should have had access,\u201d the prime minister told a news conference.\nFormer Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro has denied ever meeting the judge.\nMr Tusk added that \"the fact that judge Szmydt\u2019s relationship with the Belarusians has a long history... must raise our greatest concern\".\nLast year, the Polish authorities charged several members of an alleged Russian spy network who were tasked with preparing sabotage acts to paralyse the supply of weapons and aid to Ukraine.\nCameras were discovered near the Rzeszow-Jasionka airport near the Ukrainian border that serves as a logistics hub and is protected by American troops and Patriot missile batteries.\n",
    "Two Australian brothers were on the \"trip of a lifetime\" with an American friend when they were murdered in a suspected carjacking in Mexico. \nThe brothers, Jake and Callum Robinson, were near the town of Ensenada when they disappeared on 27 April. \nThe third victim has been identified as Jack Carter Rhoad from San Diego, California. He was due to get married.\nTheir bodies were found with gunshot wounds to the head and at the bottom of a deep well. \nA fourth set of human remains discovered in the well were believed to be unrelated to the incident in the northern Mexican state of Baja California, a popular tourist destination that is also plagued by cartel violence. \nRelatives of the three men identified their bodies on Sunday after travelling to Mexico. \nOn X, formerly Twitter, Australian ambassador to Mexico Rachel Moseley said Australian diplomats and federal police were \"giving all possible support\" to the Robinson family. \nA GoFundMe page set up by a US-based friend of the family estimated the total cost of repatriating their remains - along with flights, funeral costs and attorneys - was expected to top $130,000 (\u00a3103,000). So far, nearly $300,000 has been raised in both the US and Australia. \nThree people have been detained in connection with their deaths. Mexican authorities believe they attacked the victims after they resisted the theft of their pickup truck. \nHere's what we know about the victims. \nThe eldest of the victims, Callum Robinson was a member of Australia's national lacrosse team and a resident of San Diego, just across the US-Mexico border from Baja California. \nHe graduated from Stevenson University in Maryland in 2015.  \nCallum was also diabetic, noted his mother, Debra Robinson, while appealing on Facebook for help to find her missing sons.\nHis girlfriend, Emily Horwath, posted several images of the couple on Instagram after his death was announced. \n\"My heart is shattered into a million pieces,\" she wrote. \"I don't have the words right now.\" \nIn a statement posted online, Stevenson University athletics director Brett Adams wrote that Callum was \"a stellar student, a stellar athlete and an even better friend\". \n\"We are all so thankful that he was a part of our lives,\" his former coach, Paul Cantabene, said in the statement. \"He lived an extraordinary life, but what is most impressive about Callum is what a loyal friend he was. Once you were his friend, you were friends for life.\" \nA friend of Callum, Hayley Jacobs, told Australia's Nine News that he \"lit up a room\", adding that he eventually hoped to return to Australia. \n\"I asked him what his goals were in life and he just said that he wanted to go back to Australia and raise a family and grow,\" she added. \nMs Jacobs said she grew concerned after not hearing from Callum once his Mexico trip began. She saw him the day he left. \n\"I don't know what's going on but I think he's mad at me,\" she remembered thinking. \"Like something doesn't seem right.\" \nCallum's younger brother, Jake, left Australia about two weeks before the incident. He was an avid traveller who documented his trips - including a two-month visit to Indonesia last year - on Instagram.\nTogether, the pair attended the Coachella music festival in California before crossing the state's border into Mexico. \nAfter the trip, Jake planned to take a position working at a hospital in Geelong, a port city in the state of Victoria, about 40 miles (65km) from Melbourne.\nHe had previously worked at various regional hospitals in Australia, according to reports. \nA friend of Jake, Jenny Nguy, paid tribute to him on social media, saying she \"can't stop thinking about you, your smile, your laugh, your kindness\". \n\"I can't stop crying thinking about how your parents must be feeling,\" she wrote. \nMr Carter Rhoad, a friend of Callum, was a resident of San Diego and had been employed at a technology services company in the city since December 2019.\nIn 2012, he founded a clothes company, Loma Apparel. \nBetween 2014-15, he played professional football at Deportivo Mixto in Guatemala's top-tier national league. \nHe had previously volunteered on humanitarian trips to South Africa, Guatemala and Mexico. \nMr Rhoad had been due to marry his fiancee, Natalie Wiertz, in Columbus, Ohio, on 17 August. The pair had announced their engagement in July last year, with Ms Wiertz celebrating her hen do only last month. \nOn a GoFundMe page, a friend of the Rhoad family, Aubrey Byers, wrote that Mr Rhoad's relatives and Ms Wiertz were going through \"an unimaginably difficult time\".\n\"Their presence brought immeasurable joy, love, and kindness to those around them, leaving a mark on our lives,\" Mr Penland wrote of the three men. \nSo far, nearly $58,000 has been raised, some of which will go to \"scholarships and donations he felt passionate about.\" ",
    "A woman who relies on PIP payments so she can afford to travel to work is worried proposed benefit changes will limit her independence.\nMinisters are considering major changes to personal independence payments (PIP). These include stopping regular cash payments and instead offering claimants one-off grants for things such as home adaptations.\nSally McTiffin, from Stonehouse, who uses a wheelchair, said she wouldn't be able to go work or live in her own home without the benefit. She added she \"wouldn't be able\" to do her job or go shopping.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said the current \"disability benefits system isn\u2019t working in the way it was intended\" and reform was needed to ensure it is \"supporting those who genuinely need it most\".\nMs McTiffin's health issues started in 2010 when a back operation \"went wrong\" and sparked an infection that \"ate away\" at her spine. \nThe 52-year-old's ankle collapsed months later and she now requires a wheelchair full-time. \nPart of her PIP money is spent on her specially-adapted car, which she uses to travel to work.\n\"Without the PIP, I wouldn't be able to go to work, I wouldn't be able to do my job, I wouldn't be able to go shopping - everything has a bit of a knock-on.\"\nCommunity response lead, Jo Cole, works at G11 Community Hub helping people complete PIP forms.\nShe says around 40% of people are turned down when they first apply and 70% are approved on appeal. \nBut, she says the process is long and \"mentally draining\", which means lots of people do not appeal.\n\"PIP isn't easy to get and I think that the government has this misconception that anyone who feels a little upset sits at home one day a week is now claiming PIP - that is not it at all,\" said Mrs Cole. \n\"PIP is difficult, it can take six months for a claim to go through. I don't think people in government know what real people are going through.\"\nThe government has launched a consultation on proposals to move away from fixed cash benefit system towards tailored support.\nMinisters said it is needed after more than 2.6m people of working age are now receiving PIP - with monthly new claims almost doubling since 2019.\nGovernment spending on PIP - a benefit for those who work as well as those who do not - is expected to grow by 52% from 2023-24, to \u00a332.8bn by 2027-28, driven in part by a rise in claimants with mental-health conditions.\nMr Sunak continued: \"It is part of our plan to make the benefits system fairer to the taxpayer, better targeted to individual needs and harder to exploit by those who are trying to game the system.\n\"We\u2019re inviting views from across society to ensure everyone has a chance to make their voices heard and shape our welfare reforms.\"\nUnder the proposals, PIP claimants may no longer require a formal diagnosis by a medical expert. It is claimed this make it \"easier and quicker\" for people with severe or terminal conditions to receive support.\nThe plans are subject to a 12-week consultation, ending on 23 July.\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A British woman has pleaded guilty to being part of a global monkey torture network. \nHolly LeGresley, 37, from Kidderminster, was a participant in a private online group that was paying people in Indonesia to kill and torture baby monkeys on video. \nThe convictions follow a year-long investigation by the BBC Eye team.\nThey went undercover in the groups to expose the existence of the sadistic global network.\nWarning - this story contains distressing content\nLeGresley, of Baldwin Road, pleaded guilty at Worcester Magistrates' Court to charges of consuming, causing and facilitating the torture of baby monkeys over the internet.\nShe admitted to uploading 22 images and 132 videos of monkeys being tortured to online chat groups.\nThe prosecution said LeGresley showed a desire to harm vulnerable creatures and that she also had a hatred towards pregnant women and children.\nThe 37-year-old was part of a group on the messaging app Telegram that brainstormed, crowdfunded and then commissioned videos of monkeys being tortured by people in Indonesia.   \nThe group was used to share ideas for custom-made torture videos such as setting live monkeys on fire, injuring them with tools and even putting one in a blender.\nThe ideas were then sent, along with payments, to video-makers in Indonesia who carried them out, sometimes killing the baby long-tailed macaque monkeys in the process.\nUnder the username \"The Immolator\" LeGresley once ran a poll for members of the group on which method of torture should be inflicted upon an infant monkey.\nLeGresley will be sentenced at crown court on 7 June.\nBBC Eye identified her as a participant in a group run by a US man called Mike Macartney, a former motorcycle gang member who served time in prison and went by the screen name \"Torture King\". \nLeGresley, who at the time was living with her parents in the Midlands, was among the most active participants in the group and was made a group moderator by Macartney. \nShe would often message privately with Macartney, who pleaded guilty this month to animal abuse charges in the US and is facing up to five years in prison. \nKevin Lacks-Kelly, the head of the UK National Wildlife Crime Unit, said LeGresley played a key and active role in the global torture network. \nHe said she was much more than a spectator, that she raised funds, archived videos to share between groups and acted as an admin in the groups welcoming new members.\n\"I've been investigating wild crime for 22 years and it sickens me to say that this is unequivocally the worst case I have ever investigated or overseen,\" he said.\nSarah Kite, a co-founder of the animal charity Action for Primates who investigated the groups, said LeGresley \"unquestionably derived enjoyment from watching helpless infant monkeys in terror and pain fighting for their lives\".\n\"The depth of the depravity and perversion... in facilitating the horrific and gratuitous torture and killing of vulnerable baby monkeys was sickening, something I had never seen previously,\" she said.\nAnother woman, Adriana Orme, of The Beeches in Ryall, near Upton-upon Severn, also appeared at the magistrates' court on Tuesday in connection with the network.\nThe 55-year-old chose not to enter a plea at this stage to charges of publishing an obscene article and for causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal. \nOrme is alleged to have published an obscene article by uploading one image and 26 videos of monkey torture between 14 April and 16 June 2022.\nShe is also alleged to have encouraged or assisted the commission of unnecessary suffering by making a \u00a310 payment to a PayPal account on April 26 2022.\nHer next appearance in court will be 5 June.\nLeGresley, who left court without comment, admitted uploading images of monkey torture between 25 March and 8 May 2022, and making a payment of \u00a317.24 to a PayPal account to encourage cruelty on 25 April 2022.\nBoth defendants have been granted conditional bail and ordered not to have unsupervised contact with any animal or child.\nAt least 20 people were placed under investigation globally last year following the BBC's investigation. \nThree participants have already been charged in the US, including the ringleader of the group, Macartney. \nDavid Christopher Noble, 48, a former US Air Force officer who was previously court-martialled and dismissed from the military, and Nicole Devilbiss, 35, faced the same charges as Macartney and are both facing up to five years in prison.\nAlong with Macartney, the BBC identified two other ringleaders in the monkey torture network -

    "Complaints about doctors subjecting Jewish colleagues to antisemitic abuse have surged in the months following the 7 October attacks and the subsequent Israel-Gaza war, according to General Medical Council records.\nOne doctor, a senior Jewish physician in London, told the BBC he had been subjected to a vicious antisemitic outburst by a colleague a few days after the deadly attacks.\nThe rise in antisemitic complaints, as well as Islamophobic complaints, mirrors a broader trend of increased religious hate crimes in the UK since the recent conflict, according to figures obtained by the BBC.\nThe GMC, which regulates doctors in the UK, said it was investigating serious concerns and would take action where necessary.\nThe doctor at the London hospital, who requested to remain anonymous,  described the \"appalling\" verbal attack from a co-worker. \n\"This doctor knew I was Jewish, and just days after October 7th he started expressing support for Hamas, repeatedly shouting, 'You're a baby-killer', in my face.\" \nThe doctor said he was left \"extremely upset, horrified and shaken\" by the harassment at work. \n\"I've never before had it in such a blatant way inside a hospital - a place which is supposed to be the ultimate safe space.\"\nThe BBC understands that the hospital concerned is investigating all aspects of the case, including the antisemitism allegations.\nFrom the start of 2023, the GMC received eight complaints about antisemitism by doctors.\nHowever, in the four months after the Hamas attacks, 60 medical professionals were reported for alleged antisemitic conduct or remarks against their colleagues across the UK. \nOf these 60 complaints, 22 are currently undergoing \"triage\", a process where the GMC determines whether a complaint should proceed to a full investigation. \nAccording to the GMC, 1,903 doctors identified as Jewish in 2023, the most recent data available. This is roughly 1% of licensed doctors in the UK.\nThe GMC figures, obtained via a freedom of information request by the BBC, also show an uptick in complaints about Islamophobia by doctors since 7 October, with 16 cases from October through to January compared to three in the preceding nine months. \nThere are 53,359 doctors in the UK who identify as Muslim - 17% of doctors - according to the latest figures from the regulator.\nOf the 16 complaints made after 7 October, 12 are in triage and four have been closed.\nDr Salman Waqar, of the British Islamic Medical Association, said while the figures showed an increase in Islamophobic incidents, it was difficult to give an accurate representation of the problem within the NHS.\n\"People tend not to report it because of fear. In the medical profession, most Muslim colleagues aren't senior yet. We aren't hearing about the worst cases as much as we should,\" Dr Waqar said.\nHe said there were many who worried if they were to complain, they would lose their visas.\nHe described examples of Muslim doctors facing exclusion, such as being left out of important email chains or meetings and other cases, where Muslim doctors reported feeling abandoned by colleagues who failed to speak up when patients made Islamophobic remarks.\n\"These figures are creating a system of 'us and them' and shouldn't come across like we're in the 'racism Olympics',\" Dr Waqar said.\nHe also criticised the GMC for following a \"common sense\" definition of antisemitism and Islamophobia, rather than working with groups to establish a clearer, more precise definition.\nFor the Jewish community, the rise in antisemitism complaints against medical professionals has been particularly disturbing, mirroring an overall trend in the UK since 7 October.\nDr Dave Rich from the Community Security Trust, a charity that monitors antisemitism, said: \"It is shocking to see this happening within the medical profession - the one part of society where we expect everybody to behave with complete professionalism and neutrality.\"\nDr Rich said his organisation had received \"quite unusual\" reports from Jewish medics about \"things either said to them, or posted online, or other kinds of antisemitic behaviour from colleagues\" in recent months. \nHe called it \"really disappointing to see this playing out\" in the wake of an overseas conflict.\nDr Rich said Jewish medical professionals were being singled out by their colleagues simply due to their identity.\n\"The vast majority of incidents that we record involve visibly Jewish people or Jewish organisations being singled out simply because they are Jewish, and either harassed or threatened, or treated as if they are somehow to blame or responsible for anything Israel has done, simply because they are Jewish,\" Dr Rich said.\nThe Jewish Medical Association's Prof David Katz accused the GMC of being \"sluggish\" and \"unclear\" over its criteria for determining and resolving cases of alleged antisemitism.\nHe believes the reported incidents are \"just the tip of the iceberg\", with some Jewish doctors hesitant to come forward.\n\"There's a question th",
    "Chess tables each costing \u00a32,500 have been installed in parks across the North West as part of the government's levelling up investment programme.\nTwenty of the stone boards, which do not include chess pieces, have been placed around Merseyside, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Cumbria.\nLeigh-born grandmaster Nigel Short MBE welcomed the investment as \"great news\" which would benefit the sport.\nBut community groups have questioned whether the money could have been spent more effectively, and Northern Powerhouse Partnership chief executive Henri Murison said it \"summed up just how tokenistic levelling up had become\".\nLevelling up is the government's policy designed to reduce inequality. \nIt was a big slogan for the Conservatives ahead of the 2019 general election and a key manifesto commitment.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said its aim was \"to create jobs, drive growth, and make sure that people feel enormous pride in the places that they call home\".\nThe BBC has found that, as a region, the north-west of England has benefitted most from the \u00a3250,000 chess tables project.\nLocal authorities which received funding under the Levelling Up Parks Fund (LUPF), were invited to apply for an additional \u00a32,500 for the installation of a chess table and accompanying seats or benches.\nThe investment forms part of a wider \u00a31m package which aims to both support primary school children in disadvantaged areas to learn and play the game, as well as fund elite-level chess.\n\"It's not a massive amount of money but it's extremely welcome,\" said Mr Short.\n\"If you spent half a million quid on football it's loose change, but for chess this is quite a substantial sum.\"\nThe government's hope is that the funding will help England create more grandmasters and return the country to a higher position in the world rankings.\n\"It doesn't happen overnight and, although I do think we're turning the corner to some degree, I'm not sure it's going to be sufficient to make a big splash,\" Mr Short added.\nKarl Mercer, chairman of the Friends of Central Park voluntary group in Wirral, said the board in Wallasey Central Park was a \"white elephant\".\n\"I think the \u00a32,500 for this board probably could have been spent on something that is actually going to get used,\" he said.\nMr Mercer said it \"definitely does not\" deliver on levelling up.\n\"I think it should be about things like transport or looking after the community,\" he said.\n\"Park budgets around here have been cut right back to the bone, now we've ended up with a chess board that's sort of a white elephant.\"\nThe Northern Powerhouse Partnership is a business-led think tank and advocacy group for the North of England which fosters collaboration between local and national government.\nIts leader Mr Murison said: \"It shows the misunderstanding the prime minister has about how local government works, because his job in central government is to give local government enough money to pick its own priorities, not to throw sweeties at the provinces.\n\"If there's money to spend, it should be spent on what local people want and need the most.

    "There was a gap in Northern Ireland's early response to the Covid pandemic, the chief scientific advisor has said.\nProf Ian Young was testifying at the UK Covid Inquiry, which is sitting in Belfast.\nHe said his part-time role had not been replaced in February and March 2020 while he was on leave.\nThe first Covid lockdown began on 23 March, the same day Prof Young returned to his role.\nThat absence meant there was no local health representative attending Sage (Strategic Advisory Group of Experts) meetings.\nThe Sage group is a committee of scientists responsible for advising meetings on Covid.\nProf Young said there was a lot of catching up to do and it was not until mid-April that he had time to establish a broader group of experts within Northern Ireland.\nHe told the inquiry he had not been integrated into the Department of Health's (DoH) initial response to the pandemic as he hadn't been directed to by anyone in the department.  \nHe said it was his expectation that he would be \"called on\" for his advice when others thought it was \"necessary\".\nWhen Prof Young returned to his job several significant decisions had already been taken in Northern Ireland with regards to its response to the pandemic. \nHis evidence was part of week two of the inquiry's sitting in Northern Ireland. \nThe inquiry was told that, by the end of January 2020, Northern Ireland was aware of two different scenarios provided by the UK government, which outlined the potential impact of massive loss of life as the virus began to take hold around the world.  \nThe inquiry's lead counsel is continuing to look at who exactly was in charge and taking he lead on preparing for the impact of a global pandemic. \nProf Young also said:\nEarlier, the top civil servant at the DoH during the pandemic was challenged over who should have taken the lead advising Stormont departments at the start of the crisis.\nRichard Pengelly was questioned by inquiry chairwoman Baroness Hallett.\nHe said his department led the health response, but did not believe it was responsible for taking the lead for other parts of government.\nHe said his department \"cannot dictate or mandate other departments\". \nBaroness Hallett replied that the department may not be able to \"dictate\" to other departments, but she suggested \"you can lead\".\n\"Forgive me, I don't understand what lead means if it doesn't?\" Mr Pengelly asked her.\n\"As in encouraging others to check that their resilience is better, getting them prepared?\" Baroness Hallett replied.\nMr Pengelly suggested that was in fact the role of civil contingencies planners, through Stormont's Executive Office.  \nMr Pengelly also said:\nMr Pengelly was also questioned by Peter Wilcock KC, counsel for the NI Covid-19 bereaved families for justice.\nMr Wilcock put it to the former permanent secretary that based on evidence by Eddie Lynch, the commissioner for older people in Northern Ireland, older people had been forgotten about in pandemic planning. \nMr Pengelly accepted that a Covid-19 emergency response strategy, published by the department in March 2020, made no specific mention of the \"acutely vulnerable status of older people\".\nHowever, he said that at the time the document was published his department understood that the Covid response would include this group, which, he added, it did. \nMr Pengelly was asked by Mr Wilcock if it was surprising the document did not refer to the importance of infection prevention and control measures in the \"microenvironment of care homes\" in particular.\nHe responded the document did not get into the \"granular detail\" across every sector and that there were other areas not mentioned.\n\"The fact that something is not specifically mentioned in there does not mean that it's not strategically important, and I can't emphasise that point enough,\" he said.\n\"Care homes were hugely important to us and particularly the care of all residents within care homes and indeed the staff.\"",
    "A man who was shot dead outside a petrol station in Waringstown, County Down, was struck by at least six bullets whilst he sat in his BMW, Belfast Crown Court has heard.\nMalcolm McKeown was shot six times at close range in the head and body in August 2019.\nThe court heard a forensic expert who examined the scene after the murder concluded that at least 16 cartridges were fired from a minimum of two guns.\nThe four accused are 29-year-olds Jake O'Brien from Rectory Road in Lurgan and Andrew Thomas Kenneth Martin from Bridge Street in Banbridge, 35-year-old Stevie Lee Watson, from Princeton Avenue in Lurgan and 34-year old Simon Smyth from Hazelgrove Avenue in Lurgan.\nAll four have denied murdering 54-year-old Mr McKeown and of possessing firearms and ammunition, two firearms, and assorted bullets and cartridges, with intent to endanger life on the same date.\nCiaran Murphy KC told the court Mr McKeown was released from custody 12 days before his murder. \n\"Mr McKeown would, considering his background, have been wary of being attacked by other criminals,\" he said.\n\"He had been shot and seriously wounded in the past and he had received warnings from police about being under threat.\"\nThe court heard Mr McKeown was last seen alive at 19:19 BST on 19 August, when he walked out of Dewart's garage and got into his BMW, which was parked at the rear of the petrol station.\nLess than a minute later, a navy Volkswagen Passat was seen speeding away from the scene.\nIt was later found burned out in Lurgan.\nA sales assistant in the garage heard several loud bangs and assumed it was either fireworks or bangers, and when police arrived at the scene shortly after 21:00, Mr McKeown was found slumped over the driver's seat of the BMW.\nA post mortem examination found death was caused by bullet wounds to the head and body and that Mr McKeown has been \"struck by at least six bullets\".\nAfter the murder, items recovered from the burned-out Passat were forensically examined along with cartridges found beside Mr McKeown's car.\nThe court heard Mr O'Brien's DNA was found on a black disposal glove and a boiler suit found near the Passat, and he was also identified as one of two men running into a cul-de-sac close to where the Passat was dumped and set on fire.\nMr Martin was identified as the second man in the footage.\nThe court heard that in the days before the murder, Mr Martin had conducted searches about Mr McKeown on his phone and searched \"the act of killing aftermath\".\n \"This material evidences a distinct interest in Mr McKeown in the period before his death and is consistent with preparations for the killing,\" the prosecution barrister said\nHe said it was the Crown's case that all four accused \"had a role to play\".\nHe said when all the evidence had been presented, it would indicate \"all the accused were jointly responsible for the murder of Malcolm McKeown\".\nThe trial continues.",

    "Many Palestinians are fleeing eastern parts of Rafah, after the Israeli military ordered their evacuation before starting an operation in the southern Gaza city.\nOn Monday the military told the tens of thousands of people affected to begin heading towards an \u201cexpanded humanitarian area\" to the north, where it said they would find field hospitals, tents and basic supplies.\nBut Palestinians warned that the area was made up of neighbourhoods that were already overcrowded and lacking in essential services, were still coming under intense bombardment, or had been left in ruins by recent fighting.\nAlmost seven months into its war against Hamas, senior Israeli government and military figures have insisted that victory is impossible without a full-scale ground assault on Rafah. \nBut Israel\u2019s closest ally, the US, has said it has yet to see a credible plan to protect the more than a million displaced Palestinians sheltering there - half of them children.\nIn March, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was intending to evacuate most, if not all, of the civilians in Rafah ahead of major offensive and send them to \u201chumanitarian islands\u201d in central Gaza where aid and tents would be provided.\nIt appeared that plan was being at least partly put into action, when the IDF announced the evacuation of eastern Rafah and the \u201cexpansion of the humanitarian area\u201d in nearby al-Mawasi as part of its preparations for ground operations there.\n\u201cThis expanded humanitarian area includes field hospitals, tents and increased amounts of food, water, medication and additional supplies,\u201d an IDF statement said.\nAn IDF spokesperson said the evacuation would be \u201cgradual\u201d and affect an estimated 100,000 residents and displaced people. However, a Palestinian Red Crescent official put the figure at 250,000 and a UN official said many others would be on the move because they feared this was only \u201cthe first phase in a longer operation\u201d.\nFlyers dropped by Israeli aircraft over Rafah on Monday featured a map that identifies nine area blocks in south-eastern Rafah, including al-Shokat, al-Salam, al-Jneineh, Tabbet Zarei and al-Yarmouk, as well as open land around the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom and Egyptian-controlled Rafah border crossings.\nThe UN said the evacuation zone covered more than 30 sq km (12 sq miles) and was home to nine sites sheltering displaced people, as well as three clinics and six warehouses.\nThe flyer instructed all residents to evacuate immediately and head towards an approximately 60 sq km area stretching north along the Mediterranean coast from al-Mawasi - a narrow strip of agricultural land that has long been an IDF-designated \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d - to the city of Khan Younis and the central town of Deir al-Balah.\nThe IDF did not provide any details about the locations of the tents for the people being evacuated, but in recent weeks satellite images have shown several encampments constructed north of Rafah and west of Khan Younis.\nMohammed Daoud said the 35 members of his family living had \u201cno choice but to leave\u201d after finding out that their house in the Oraiba area was inside the evacuation zone.\n\u201cWe do not know where to go and how we will manage,\u201d he told the BBC.\nRasha Sheikh Khalil, a displaced woman living in a tent in Rafah with her husband and four children, said: \u201cI had started preparing my bags and getting ready to return to my neighbourhood in Gaza City, but the bad news [on Monday] surprised us.\u201d\n\u201cNo-one cares about our fate. For seven months we have not tasted comfort and tranquillity.\u201d\nGhada el-Kurd, a mother-of-two who has been displaced six times over the last four months, told the BBC that she was living only 15 minutes away from one of the evacuated areas but was staying put for now.\n\u201cI\u2019m so confused... I have no place to go. This was the last place I know,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIf I want to come back to Khan Younis there is no place - it is all destroyed. [As for] areas of al-Mawasi, they are crowded and I cannot any more live inside a tent - it\u2019s so hot and my health does not allow me to be in such a situation. Regarding Deir al-Balah... there are a lot of air strikes there... and it is a very dangerous area.\u201d\nThe UN said it was \u201cnot taking part in involuntary evacuations or in the setting up of any displacement zones\u201d.\nBut James Elder, a spokesman for the UN children\u2019s agency, Unicef, who was in Gaza last month, said Ghada el-Kurd\u2019s assessment of the IDF\u2019s humanitarian area was \u201cabsolutely spot on\u201d.\n\"There's nowhere to go. Khan Younis, let's be clear, is rubble,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cI've walked around those streets of Khan Younis. It's not a little bit destroyed, it's utterly devastated.\u201d\n\u201cDeir al-Balah... has now got raw sewage running through the streets because sanitation has just been devastated, and al-Mawasi is a beach, a sandy area, and we're starting to hit summer.\u201d\n\u201cWe've already had reports of children dying of dehydration.

    "A mother who lost her seven-year-old to cancer who now has her own terminal diagnosis has shared her support for assisted dying.\nAntonya Cooper, 77, from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, wants to legalise assisted dying so human death is not \"so intolerably inhumane\".\nThe government remains neutral on the issue.\nMs Cooper's son Hamish died in 1981 aged seven years old after being diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma.\nNeuroblastoma is a rare cancer that mostly affects children.\nAssisted suicide - intentionally helping another person to end their life - is banned in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.\nOpponents to changing the law say it is to protect the vulnerable and ensure that nobody is pressured into dying sooner than they might otherwise.\nMs Cooper, who helped launch Neuroblastoma UK, said Hamish was five-years-old when diagnosed, and given a prognosis of three months.\nHe subsequently underwent 16 months of treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) which \"ruined parts of his body\" but extended his life, she said.\nSeeing the side effects of the \"beastly treatment\" was heart-breaking, but she said GOSH staff were \"so embracing\" and supportive.\nMs Cooper said Hamish's death was like an \"amputation\" that she would \"never get over\", but helping launch the neuroblastoma charity helped her cope.\nFour decades after Hamish's death she has been diagnosed with breast cancer, and more recently pancreatic cancer, which has spread to her liver and is incurable. \nShe said she was \"realistic about the probability of dying\" but that Hamish's suffering and her own diagnosis had cemented her feelings on assisted dying.\nMs Cooper, who has had four more children, has since joined Swiss assisted dying organisation Dignitas, organised her own funeral, and selected the plot where she wants to be buried.\nMPs recently carried out a parliamentary debate on assisted dying, discussing whether a change in the law is necessary.\nIn response Ms Cooper said: \"The whole point of assisted dying is to be able to seek a kind end for yourself if you know you're going anyway, and not to be wracked with pain and not to be testing the facilities of some local loving hospice.\"\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this story, the BBC Action Line has links to organisations which can offer support and advice\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

    "He could probably have walked it blindfolded.\nFor the fifth time, Vladimir Putin took the long walk through the Grand Kremlin Palace to the St Andrew's Throne Hall. There he took the oath of office and was sworn in as Russia's president for a new six-year term.\n\"We are a united and great people. Together we will overcome all obstacles, we will bring all our plans to fruition, and together we will win,\" President Putin told an audience of ministers and dignitaries.\nThe red carpet route may have been familiar to him. But much has changed since President Putin's first inauguration ceremony in May 2000. \nBack then, President Putin pledged to \"preserve and develop democracy\" and to \"take care of Russia\".\nTwenty-four years on, the Kremlin leader is waging war against Ukraine; a war in which Russia has suffered heavy losses. At home, instead of developing democracy, President Putin has been curtailing it: jailing critics, removing all checks and balances on his power. \n\"Putin thinks of himself now as Vladimir the Great, as a Russian tsar,\" believes Fiona Hill, a former White House national security advisor. \n\"If we took ourselves back to his first two presidential terms, I think we'd have a fairly favourable assessment of Putin. He stabilised the country politically and made it solvent again. The Russian economy and system were performing better than at any other previous time in its history.  \n\"The war in Ukraine, going back to the annexation of Crimea 10 years ago, has dramatically changed that trajectory. He's turned himself into an imperialist instead of a pragmatist.\"\nPutin 5.0 had plenty of supporters in the hall. \n\"Putin is leading Russia to victory!\" Russian MP Pyotr Tolstoy told me.\n\"What is victory?\" I asked.\n\"Victory is when Britain and the West realise that Russia is a superpower and recognise Russia's national interests.\" \n\"And if the West doesn't do that?\"\n\"Then that's the end of the West,\" concluded the MP.\nInside the Kremlin Palace, I met one of President Putin's biggest fans. Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament, is famous for having declared that \"If there is Putin, there is Russia; if there is no Putin, there is no Russia,\" \n\"The West needs a weak Russia that will fall apart,\" Mr Volodin told me. \"Putin is in their way.\"\nIt's remarkable to think that since Vladimir Putin first came to power, America has been through five different presidents and Britain has had seven prime ministers. \nAfter nearly a quarter of a century running Russia, Mr Putin has certainly made his mark. In the past, people rarely spoke of \"Brezhnevism\", \"Gorbachevism\" or \"Yeltsinism\". \nBut Putinism: that's a thing. \n\"We have one more -ism in our history: Stalinism,\" says Andrei Kolesnikov, senior fellow at the Carnegie Eurasia Russia Centre. \n\"I would say that Putinism is one more incarnation of Stalinism. He behaves like [former Soviet dictator] Stalin. His power is personalised, like in Stalin's time. He prefers to use a lot of political repressions. And like Stalin, he is ready to keep himself in power until the physical end.\" \nThe challenge, for the West, is how to deal with an increasingly authoritarian Russian leader determined to restore what he sees as Russia's greatness; a modern-day tsar\u2026 with nuclear weapons.\n\"On the issue of nuclear weapons, there's an awful lot that we can do,\" believes Fiona Hill. \n\"Some countries, like China, India, Japan, have been extraordinarily nervous when Putin has engaged in nuclear sabre-rattling in Ukraine and have pushed back against that. We can enforce restraint on Russia by creating an international framework for pushing back on this wild and speculative talk about using nuclear weapons. \n\"Perhaps that is something of a model for how we can deal with Vladimir Putin, who in many respects is something of a rogue leader. We need to create a more constraining environment, less permissive for the kinds of actions that he wants to undertake.\" \nOfficially, Vladimir Putin won more than 87% of the vote in the March presidential election. However, he'd faced no serious challenger in a contest widely seen as neither free nor fair: a point I put today to Ella Pamfilova, chairperson of Russia's Central Election Commission. It didn't go down well. \n\"Many opponents of the president weren't allowed on the ballot,\" I said.\n\"People who make such a criticism have either never been to Russia or haven't been here for a long time,\" Ms Pamfilova replied. \"It's all myths and lies.\" \nThe Grand Kremlin Palace isn't the only place you can find Vladimir Putin. \nIn the town of Kashira, 70 miles from Moscow, a gigantic Putin portrait, a massive mural, takes up one whole side of an apartment block.\nIn Kashira, Big Vladimir is watching you.\n\"I like him,\" says pensioner Valentina, who is selling flowers by the roadside. \n\"Putin has good ideas and does a lot for people. True, our pensions aren't big. But he can't fix everything in one go.\" \n\"He's had nearly 25 years,\" I point out.\n\"But ",
    "The US has repatriated 11 of its citizens and six Canadian children from camps in north-eastern Syria, the state department announced. \nTen of the US citizens are reportedly members of a single family. The six Canadians are all children. \nFour Dutch citizens and a Finnish citizen were also repatriated by the state department, it says.\nAbout 30,000 people from 60 countries - most of them children - remain stranded in two overcrowded camps in Syria. \nThe camps, Al-Hol and Roj, are run by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which battled the Islamic State group for years until the fall of its so-called caliphate in early 2019.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it was the single largest repatriation of American citizens from camps in Syria to date. \nA nine-year-old non-US citizen sibling of one of the American children was also resettled in the US, the statement added. \nWhile the Americans were not named by the state department, US media have identified one of them as a Massachusetts-born woman, Brandy Salman, and her nine children now ranging in age from about seven to 26.\nThey arrived back in the US on Tuesday morning and Ms Salman will live initially with her mother in New Hampshire, according to National Public Radio.\nMs Salman's Turkish-American husband reportedly took the family to Syria in 2016. He was killed and the family was eventually taken into custody by the SDF. \nIt is unclear where Ms Salman and her family will be resettled, or whether she could face criminal charges. \nSome other US citizens who allegedly became members of the Islamic State group have faced charges of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorism, among other charges. Others have not been charged. \nThe New York Times has reported that two of the children being brought to the US - an American and his non-citizen adopted brother - are the sons of a Minnesota man named Abdelhamid Al-Madioum. \nAl-Madioum - a Moroccan-born American - travelled to Syria to join the Islamic State group in 2015. \nAfter being captured by the SDF in 2019, he was returned to Minnesota. In 2021, he pleaded guilty to charges of supporting terrorism. \nTo date, the US has repatriated 51 of its citizens from Syria. \nWhile Global Affairs Canada has acknowledged that six of its citizens, all minors, had been repatriated, it declined to give any further details, citing privacy concerns. \n\"The focus is now on protecting the children's privacy and ensuring they receive the support and care needed to begin a new life here in Canada,\" Global Affairs said in a statement. \nA Canadian lawyer working on their file, Lawrence Greenspon, told the BBC on Tuesday that the six are siblings and have been settled together with one family in Canada for the time being. \nLast year, Canada offered to repatriate the six children without their mother, which she refused. \nMr Greenspon said their mother is now out of the Islamic State camp in north-eastern Syria where she was at the time and is again seeking authorisation to return to Canada to be reunited with her children.  \nAbout 30,000 people from dozens of countries remain in the Al-Hol and Roj camps, where human rights groups have reported abuses and poor conditions. \nOthers have warned that children raised in the camps are vulnerable to radicalisation from Islamic State militants. \nSome countries, however, have resisted repatriating their citizens. \n\"The only durable solution to the humanitarian and security crisis in the displaced persons camps and detention facilities in north-east Syria is for countries to repatriate, rehabilitate, reintegrate and, where appropriate, ensure accountability for wrongdoing,\" Mr Blinken said in Tuesday's statement.

    "Residents in a market town that has awards for its floral displays have been told to complete a \u00a3165 safety course or hire a contractor to hang baskets on streetlights following new council rules.\nChatteris in Bloom members have won gold at Britain in Bloom and Anglia in Bloom, but this year have been hit with regulations from Cambridgeshire County Council.\nGroup president Sue Unwin, 64, said \"bureaucracy was going to kill community spirit\", with volunteers giving enough of their own time and money towards the arrangements.\nThe council said because the streetlights were connected to the power grid it needed to \"ensure everyone's safety\".\nThe group's award-winning displays are usually adorned on 20 lampposts and are put up with the help of a local farmer and a telehandler each May, before judging begins in July.\nThe county council said the new safety course would last a day, but if the group already had a qualified member they would be able to hang the baskets - once the council approved their application.\n\"It has become impossible with the bureaucracy and red tape,\" Mrs Unwin said.\n\"There's some jobsworth in the county council who has made this decision... we have been doing this for over 18 years. None of us have that capability or the money - we give enough of our time.\n\"We do everything properly and this bureaucracy is going to kill community spirit because we are getting fed up with this. We work hard to make our town look nice.

    "The government is \"gaslighting\" Britain over the state of the economy and its plans are \"deluded\", shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has said.\nKey economic figures this week are likely to show the UK emerging from recession, while the Bank of England could take steps towards interest rate cuts.\nThe economy is likely to be a key battleground in the upcoming general election.\nThe Tories said Labour had \"no plan\".\nGiving a speech in the City of London, Ms Reeves said that suggestions the feel-good factor is returning are \"completely out of touch with the realities on the ground\".\nOn Friday, however, the first official data on gross domestic product in the three months to March is likely to show that the economy grew, marking the official end to a shallow recession last year.\nThe Bank of England could take further steps towards interest rate cuts on Thursday too, ahead of a likely sharp fall in inflation - which measures how prices rise over time - later in the month.\nWhile Ms Reeves acknowledged \"these things could happen this month\", the opposition's intervention is designed to pre-empt the government's argument about the cost-of-living crisis being over and the coming general election being about \"protecting the recovery\".\n\"The Conservatives are gaslighting the British public,\" she said.\n\"Gaslighting\" is psychologically manipulating a person into questioning his or her perception of reality.\nAt the beginning of 2023, Rishi Sunak set out the Conservatives' priorities, including halving inflation, growing the economy, and reducing government debt.\nThe government has met the first pledge, and never set out what it meant by growing the economy. Debt remains at levels last seen during the early 1960s.\nJust days after a difficult set of local and mayoral elections for the Conservatives, Ms Reeves announced that Labour hopes to fight the general election \"on the economy\", saying that voters could choose \"five more years of chaos with the Conservatives\" or \"stability with a changed Labour Party\".\nIn response, chairman of the Conservative Party, Richard Holden MP, said: \"The personnel may change but the Labour Party hasn't.\"\nHe said that the Labour Party has \"no plan\" and would take the British public \"back to square one\" with higher taxes and higher unemployment rates.\nDespite abandoning its long-standing plan to borrow and spend \u00a328bn of public money on new, green industries, Mr Reeves restated Labour's commitment to a new vision for a green economy, reflecting thinking in the US and Europe.\nIn February Labour rowed back on plans to spend \u00a328bn a year on environmental projects if it wins the upcoming general election.\nResponding to a question from the BBC on Tuesday, Ms Reeves said that getting to clean energy by 2030 and creating green jobs can be done \"through other means\", including the creation of GB Energy, the National Wealth Fund, and planning reforms.\nMs Reeves said that investment in low-carbon industries was being held back by the UK planning system.\nLast month, her National Wealth Fund \"taskforce\", including former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, and the chief executives of Barclays and Aviva, met to discuss how to raise \u00a322bn in private sector investment in next generation technologies. \nIt is expected to report back before the summer.",

    "An art collective has defended a tribute mural to Palestinian journalists amid calls for its removal. \nThree artists from Creative Debuts painted the mural in Ilford, east London, in March.\nIt depicts four reporters and photographers standing before a pile of rubble in Gaza, based on a photograph taken by photographer Suhail Nassar.\nAn Israeli legal support group has argued it could worsen tensions in London's multi-ethnic communities.\nThe mural has the words \"Heroes of Palestine\" written above the journalists' heads and, further down the road, the words \"all eyes on Gaza\" have also been painted over a Palestinian flag.\u00a0\nAlia Shaikh, who owns and lives in the home the mural was painted on, said she personally commissioned the piece after feeling \"powerless\" about the ongoing Israel-Gaza war.\nShe said: \"I think it's important for young children to have good role models.\n\"They're heroes. Without them, we'd have no idea what's happening.\"\nShe said Redbridge Council had visited her but she was resolute the mural would stay, adding she had been widely supported by the community, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nShe explained: \"We've not broken any laws.\u00a0We shouldn't be bullied into doing something and stand up for what we believe.\"\nA group called UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLI) says that Redbridge is one of a number of councils including Tower Hamlets, Hackney, Worcester and Lambeth with murals, signs or artwork that \"promotes divisiveness\", and asked Redbridge Council to wash it off.\nIn a statement, the group's director, Caroline Turner, said: \"Councils are legally required to have regard to the need to foster good relations between different religious and ethnic communities.\n\"The murals do not foster good relations between different communities and have proved divisive in the locations where they have been painted.\u00a0Many have already been defaced.\"\nSimilar murals in Shoreditch and Hackney, depicting journalists and medics, have been sprayed over with Stars of David and messages condemning Hamas, the group that governs Gaza.\nMs Turner added: \"Councils have powers to remove these murals and should do so as a priority where the murals promote one side of the current war, in view of their impact on community cohesion.\"\nCreative Debuts has made various other murals in support of Gaza across London and in other cities, as well as for other campaigns. \nFounder Calum Hall said the Ilford mural commemorated journalists showing \"incredible resilience and bravery\" in the face of \"unspeakable horror\".\u00a0\nHe said the group was \"not trying to antagonise\" anyone, adding: \"It's a pretty neutral and uncontroversial way of showing solidarity and raising awareness. It's unfathomable to take issue with a painting of a doctor or a journalist.\"\n\"We need to have a look at what's going on and the wider context around it.\u00a0\n\"The enemy is not a doctor, it is not a journalist - they are human beings in impossible situations, trying to survive and help people.\u00a0\n\"It would be totally different if we were painting Hamas battalions on the side of a wall.\"\nUK Lawyers for Israel argues the Ilford mural's placement contravenes section 224 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which prohibits unregulated adverts.\nMs Turner added the mural was \"in effect an advertisement, advertising the Palestinian cause\" and that it breached the planning act \"since it had been displayed without the consent of the local authority\".\nMr Hall said this was \"nonsense,\" arguing: \"It's an artwork; it's quite obviously not an advert.\"\nHe added there would be a \"chilling effect on street art and visual campaigning\" if Redbridge Council upheld the charge that the mural constituted an advert.\nA spokesperson for Redbridge Council told the Local Democracy Reporting Service that it was reviewing the situation but declined to comment further.\u00a0\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A runner has broken a world record after completing his 1,000th marathon over more than 40 years.\nSteve Edwards said his response to finishing his first aged 18 was \"never again\" but the 61-year-old, from Gloucestershire, ran his 1,000th at the Milton Keynes Marathon on Sunday.\nFifty other people have completed 1,000 marathons each but Mr Edwards has now recorded the fastest aggregate time.\nHe said it was the \"finale to what has been an incredible 43-year journey\".\nMr Edwards, from Longborough near Moreton in Marsh, has been raising money for Kate's Home Nursing, a palliative nursing care charity in Gloucestershire.\nAll of the other runners who had previously been recorded finishing 1,000 marathons had average finish times of more than four hours.\nHowever, Mr Edwards' total average finish time for all 1,000 marathons is 3:21:47.\nBreaking that down, it means he has run a marathon, on average, every 13 days for the past 36 years.\nMr Edwards said the day before his latest race, he and his wife of 25 years, Teresa, became emotional because they knew what a big day it represented.\n\"People were starting to get excited in the lead-up... I hadn't even set off yet and I had to keep it together as I still had 26 miles to run,\" Mr Edwards said.\nIn Sunday's marathon he set off with his friend and running companion, Dennis Walmsley, from Bourton-on-the-Water, a former renowned marathon runner himself. \n\"We had T-shirts made and other runners were wearing them too,\" Mr Edwards said.\n\"The support was incredible.\"\n\"I've had a hip injury since marathon number 996 and in any other circumstances I would have rested, but it was just a case of keeping going,\" he added.\n\"And as soon as I hit the stadium it was like the pain disappeared. The support - literally hundreds, thousands of people were supporting me.\n\"I crossed that line and was so excited and relieved and five seconds later I was on the floor crying my eyes out. I just couldn't control myself.\"\nAfter crossing the finish line Mr Edwards was called to the podium by the race director and presented with his official world record certificate. \n\"It's overwhelming, the adulation and support of people coming up to me, telling me they'd followed me for years and were so inspired and how massive this is for the running community. \n\"All I'd done was enjoy my running for the last 40 years. It is humbling, truly humbling.\"\nHe said he chose the charity - which he has so far raised more than \u00a310,000 for - because his wife had been part of the nursing team at Kate's Home Nursing.\nHis wife Teresa said: \"The whole week has been an emotional rollercoaster and there have been peaks and troughs and we were tired emotionally before we got here.\"\nShe added: \"What I find so amazing about him, is he's held down a full-time job [before retiring] and been back at work the Monday mornings after a weekend of running.\n\"I'm just so, so proud of Steve and having his son and grandchildren and sister and nephew there was so lovely and so meaningful. You could see they were so happy to witness his achievement.\n\"He's amazing and I'm so proud to call him my husband,\" she added.\nMr Edwards said throughout his life, his motto has been: \"Never underestimate your potential and follow your dreams.\" \n\"I was born with a deformed left hand and was bullied so I felt excluded, but with running when you're on that start line with thousands of other runners, it doesn't matter who you are in life.\n\"Everyone has a mutual respect for what you're about to endure.\"\nHe said he would like to thank the whole running community \"and everyone who supported us on Sunday. It was just very humbling\". \nFor now though, he said it was about taking some time, resting and booking a holiday. \n\"I'd like to think this was not the last marathon, but for me I've achieved more than I could have imagined in a sport I've lived since I was 18. \n\"I'd like to run into old age, just for wellbeing, but maybe more for the social aspect of a marathon than to be competitive and chase my best time.\n\"I've always said [running] is the best medicine physically and mentally.\"\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "An artist's daughters have supported a campaign to save her herd of steel dinosaurs.\nGenevieve Glatt created sculptures at the heart of Middlesbrough's Teessaurus Park, which opened in 1979.\nA campaign to save her dinosaurs began when Middlesbrough Council said they could be relocated to accommodate Gypsy or traveller pitches, which it said were needed to meet government targets.\nA bid has been submitted to have the dinosaurs listed and Mrs Glatt's daughters said the dinosaurs were created to reflect their industrial setting and should remain \"cherished\" at the site.\nJude Keenan and Susie Glatt visited the park on Tuesday, en route to a meeting at Teesside Archives, where they handed over dinosaur blueprints and other artefacts from their mother's career.\nThey clambered on Mrs Glatt's trio of triceratops as they reminisced about childhood memories and the importance of the steel creatures to their family, and Middlesbrough more widely.\n\"Mum's very proud of them,\" Mrs Glatt said.\n\"She is in a home now, but if she has a down day, the staff use the dinosaurs to cheer her up.\"\n\"They've been here forever,\" Mrs Keenan said.\n\"They were almost forgotten but the interest in them now is heartwarming and incredible to see.\n\"They're part of people's backgrounds and lives, people came here as kids and now bring their own kids.\n\"It's bonkers, it's brilliant.\"\nThe sisters also met volunteers who care for the site and have helped lead the campaign to save Teessaurus Park.\nThousands of people have signed a petition to keep the dinosaurs in their current home on the banks of the River Tees.\nThe campaign was boosted last week when the 20th Century Preservation Society submitted a bid to Historic England to have Mrs Glatt's dinosaurs listed.\nMiddlesbrough Council then said it would engage with the process and was considering the results of a public consultation into its draft local plan, which earmarked the land for 14 Gypsy or traveller pitches.\nThe proposals, which set out a policy for development in the town until 2041, said the collection of dinosaurs would remain publicly accessible, but not necessarily at the same site.\n\"I'm not happy about the idea of them being relocated,\" said Miss Glatt.\n\"When mum came here, she saw the industry across the river, the shipbuilding, the cranes, the Transporter Bridge and felt it needed monsters, to sit well with it all.\n\"Her immediate thought was dinosaurs - they were conceived because they married with the Transporter, and that backdrop.\"\nThe listing bid has been welcomed by Mrs Glatt's family.\n\"They deserve listing, they're unique,\" said Mrs Keenan.\n\"This park represents Middlesbrough's heritage, and it's such an unusual thing to come across walking along the river.\n\"It belongs to Middlesbrough, they should definitely cherish it.\"\nMiss Glatt added: \"We've always called it mum's park, but we've come to realise it's Middlesbrough's park, it's Teessaurus Park.\"\nFollow BBC Tees on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Northern Ireland's GPs have agreed a new contract which for the first time will help cover the cost of insuring them against medical negligence claims.\nThe Department of Health has set aside \u00a35m to help GP surgeries meet the insurance costs. \nThe British Medical Association (BMA) has welcomed the one-year funding.\nIt is among changes in the 2024/25 GP contract aimed at cutting the cost of running a GP practice and stemming the flow of doctors from the sector.\nAll GPs must have insurance known as GP indemnity to work in the UK.\nThe NHS already pays for GP indemnity in other parts of the UK, but until now GPs in Northern Ireland had to pay their own indemnity bills.\nIt can cost each full-time GP up to \u00a310,000 a year according to the BMA, which argued it was one of the factors which discouraged medical graduates from choosing to work in Northern Ireland.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said the agreement of the GP contract for 2024/25 was \"very welcome news\" and an important step towards helping to stabilise GP services.\nBut he acknowledged there was \"much more work to be done\".\nThe BMA's contract negotiations were led by Belfast GP Alan Stout, who chairs the Northern Ireland General Practitioners Committee (NIGPC).\n\"Equalising the indemnity provision for GPs in Northern Ireland was a red line for the negotiators,\" he said.\nState-backed indemnity schemes were introduced in England and Wales five years ago and since then Northern Ireland has \"stood out like a sore thumb,\" according to Dr Stout.\nHe said indemnity fees \"not only harmed us retaining our GPs because they could see this increased cost of being here, but it also then made it virtually impossible for us to attract people from elsewhere to come and work here\".\nDr Stout explained that the \u00a35m would be shared out between practices, based on their number of patients, meaning an average practice will receive about \u00a315,900 for this financial year. \n\"We will continue to work with the department to bring forward a longer-term indemnity solution that ensures we have parity with the rest of the UK,\" he added.\nThe Department of Health said: \"Despite the significant challenges facing the health budget, we have been able to reach agreement within the existing GMS (General Medical Services) budget envelope.\"\nNorthern Ireland's health service is under huge pressure, with increasing demand on GP surgeries, hospitals and social care services fuelled by an ageing population with increasingly complex health needs.\nIn recent years, 25 GP practices in Northern Ireland have handed back their contract to the health service, meaning health authorities often have to step in to run services until a new contractor can be found.\n\"Stabilising GP services is of crucial importance and I believe this contract is a step forward in that regard,\" Mr Swann said. \n\"Whilst the budget provided to me by the executive does not allow me to make a substantial increase in the overall value of the contract, I am pleased that the agreement announced today makes significant progress against key aims identified by GPs in their negotiations, including provision of dedicated funding for their indemnity costs.\"\nLast month, Stormont ministers agreed an overall budget for Northern Ireland, under which the Department of Health was allocated the largest share of day-to-day funding, receiving \u00a37.76bn.\nHowever, Mr Swann, from the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), voted against the budget, saying it represented \"a 2.3% cut on what we receive and on what we spent last year\".\nHe had requested a budget of \u00a31bn and warned that the shortfall would negatively affect hospital waiting lists, pay settlements, GP services and domiciliary care packages.\nIn order to simplify how GPs access payments from the health service, the Department of Health and the BMA agreed to move payment arrangements for some services into what is known as \"core funding\".\nDr Stout said this would streamline income for surgeries and provide \"some much-needed simplification of current arrangements\".\n\"I am pleased that practices will now see the bulk of their funding paid in 12-monthly instalments to help with cashflow and budget planning,\" he added.\n\"We were also able to ensure that no practice will lose any of their current income as there will be a financial floor for everyone.\"",

It's just great.\"\nThe show is intended to show normal women celebrating their bodies after cancer. \nZoe believes those who try to go back to being exactly the same person they were before a cancer diagnosis are \"probably going to be disappointed\".\n\"I get to see these women who have been through so much - their bodies have changed, the control has been taken away from them and they're trying to find a new normal,\" she said. \n\"Once you've heard those words, you can't go back to normal.\"\nAll the money raised will fund Breast Friends - jokingly dubbed \"the best support group you never wanted to join\" by Zoe and Sara - to ensure that anyone with a breast cancer diagnosis can enjoy meeting up with women in a similar position, no matter their financial status. \nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

Sweden was involved with the Pvt King case, a spokesman for the Swedish embassy in the US has confirmed.\nIt is believed the 23-year-old soldier was detained and questioned by North Korean authorities.  \nPvt King was last seen running across the demilitarised zone separating North and South Korea. Tensions then escalated in the region, with North Korea firing two ballistic missiles into the sea on 26 July after a US nuclear-powered submarine was stationed in the South. \n\"All sides are trying to understand what happened and what to do,\" said Mickey Bergman, executive director of the Richardson Center for Global Diplomacy.\nMr Bergman, who has spent nearly 20 years negotiating to return US citizens from hostile nations, said the best chance at releasing a prisoner is right after they are detained. This is when they are likely being interrogated by the country's officials but before they have been charged with a crime, like spying.\nIt was in that time before things became official that negotiators could best appeal to people's humanity, Mr Bergman said.\n\"I think there's a misconception about what negotiations are,\" he said. \n\"If we pound our chests, and flip tables, and demand that the evil North Koreans return our soldier, we are likely going to cause them to dig in.\"\nHere is how the US has previously negotiated for an American citizen's return. \nBecause the United States has never officially held diplomatic ties with North Korea, during a detainee crisis, Sweden has served as an intermediary from their embassy in Pyongyang and has helped to relay communications to North Korean officials.  \nBut there are also backchannels. North Korea maintains a mission at the United Nations in New York. In times of crisis, the mission - dubbed the New York Channel - has become an avenue for officials for both countries to hold talks.  \nFor years, Robert King was one of the first people who received a call when an American was captured by North Korea. As the former special envoy for North Korean human rights at the US state department, the ambassador has helped negotiate for the release of multiple detainees including student Otto Warmbier and American missionary Kenneth Bae.   \nAfter 17 months in captivity, US college student Otto Warmbier was released from North Korean detention in 2017 in a comatose state. He returned to the United States with extensive brain damage and died days after reuniting with his family. \nOtto Warmbier's death sparked international outrage and his family has levelled allegations of abuse and torture against the North Koreans.\nAfter a brief period of diplomacy under the Trump administration, Mr King said renewed political tensions between the two countries often colour negotiations, making detainees a pawn in wider geopolitical fights.\n\"[The North Koreans] see this as, 'how do we use this opportunity to make the US look bad?' And whatever happens it's not going to be a happy outcome,\" Mr King said. \nFor nearly 20 years, Mr Bergman has worked alongside former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson to secure the release of prisoners from countries hostile to the United States.  \nAlthough the Richardson Center is not involved in the Travis King case, Mr Bergman said in his experience, when it came to North Korea, there was no playbook for negotiations. \nInstead, he said, it is best to approach tense negotiations through what he calls \"fringe diplomacy\". \nUS non-profit-making organisations and humanitarian agencies have provided aid to North Koreans for decades. When official channels stall, these non-governmental backchannels are often called upon to negotiate on behalf of a detainee's family. \nAn NGO's separation from the US government is a benefit, Mr Bergman said, because it allows negotiations to focus solely on the wellbeing and return of the detainee, instead of global politics.\n\"People can talk to us about policy issues but there's nothing we can do about that,\" he said. \"We are much more able to insulate the issue and come up with pathways to resolve some of these situations.\" \nMr Bergman said the world often focuses on the moment of \"intervention,\" when a political prisoner is rescued and returned home. But that moment, he said, is not possible without years of meaningful e",

    "After more than three billion doses, the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is being withdrawn.\nAstraZeneca said it was \"incredibly proud\" of the vaccine, but it had made a commercial decision.\nIt said the rise of new coronavirus variants meant demand had shifted to the newer updated vaccines.\nIts vaccine was estimated to have saved millions of lives during the pandemic, but also caused rare, and sometimes fatal, blood clots.\nIn the race to lift the world out of pandemic lockdowns, the Covid vaccine was developed by scientists at the University of Oxford in record time. A process that normally takes 10 years was accelerated down to about 10 months. \nIn November 2020, it was heralded as \"a vaccine for the world\" as it was far cheaper and easier to store than other Covid vaccines. The pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca had agreed to manufacture it en masse.\nInitially, it was the cornerstone of the UK's plans to vaccinate our way out of lockdown.\n\"The truth is it made an enormous difference, it was what lifted us out of the catastrophe that was unfolding at the time, combined with the other vaccine from Pfizer,\" said Prof Adam Finn, from the University of Bristol. \nHowever, its reputation was dented as unusual blood clots emerged as a rare side effect of the vaccine, and the UK turned to alternatives.\nIn a statement, AstraZeneca said: \"According to independent estimates, over 6.5 million lives were saved in the first year of use alone.\n\"Our efforts have been recognised by governments around the world and are widely regarded as being a critical component of ending the global pandemic.\"\nIt said the development of new vaccines that more closely match the mutated forms of Covid that are now circulating meant there was a \"surplus of available updated vaccines\", leading to a \"decline in demand\" for its vaccine which is \"no longer being manufactured or supplied\".\nProf Finn added: \"I think the withdrawal of the vaccine simply reflects it's no longer useful. \n\"It's turned out that this virus is very agile and it's evolved away from the original vaccines, so they have in a sense become irrelevant and only the reformulated vaccines are likely to be being used now.\"",
    "Saudi authorities have permitted the use of lethal force to clear land for a futuristic desert city being built by dozens of Western companies, an ex-intelligence officer has told the BBC.\nCol Rabih Alenezi says he was ordered to evict villagers from a tribe in the Gulf state to make way for The Line, part of the Neom eco-project.\nOne of them was subsequently shot and killed for protesting against eviction. \nThe Saudi government and Neom management refused to comment.\nNeom, Saudi Arabia's $500bn (\u00a3399bn) eco-region, is part of its Saudi Vision 2030 strategy which aims to diversify the kingdom's economy away from oil. \nIts flagship project, The Line, has been pitched as a car-free city, just 200m (656ft) wide and 170km (106 miles) long - though only 2.4km of the project is reportedly expected to be completed by 2030.\nDozens of global companies, several of them British, are involved in Neom's construction.\nThe area where Neom is being built has been described as the perfect \"blank canvas\" by Saudi leader Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman. But more than 6,000 people have been moved for the project according to his government - and UK-based human rights group ALQST estimates the figure to be higher.\nThe BBC has analysed satellite images of three of the villages demolished - al-Khuraybah, Sharma and Gayal. Homes, schools, and hospitals have been wiped off the map.\nCol Alenezi, who went into exile in the UK last year, says the clearance order he was asked to enact was for al-Khuraybah, 4.5km south of The Line. The villages were mostly populated by the Huwaitat tribe, who have inhabited the Tabuk region in the country's north-west for generations.\nHe said the April 2020 order stated the Huwaitat was made up of \"many rebels\" and \"whoever continues to resist [eviction] should be killed, so it licensed the use of lethal force against whoever stayed in their home\".\nHe dodged the mission on invented medical grounds, he told the BBC, but it nevertheless went ahead. \nAbdul Rahim al-Huwaiti refused to allow a land registry committee to value his property, and was shot dead by Saudi authorities a day later, during the clearance mission. He had previously posted multiple videos on social media protesting against the evictions.\nA statement issued by Saudi state security at the time alleged al-Huwaiti had opened fire on security forces and they had been forced to retaliate. Human rights organisations and the UN have said he was killed simply for resisting eviction. \nThe BBC was not able to independently verify Col Alenezi's comments about lethal force. \nBut a source familiar with the workings of the Saudi intelligence directorate told us the colonel's testimony - regarding both how the clearance order was communicated and what it said - was in line with what they knew about such missions more generally. They also said the colonel's level of seniority would have been appropriate to lead the assignment.\nAt least 47 other villagers were detained after resisting evictions, many of whom were prosecuted on terror-related charges, according to the UN and ALQST. Of those, 40 remain in detention, five of whom are on death row, ALQST says.\nSeveral were arrested for simply publicly mourning al-Huwaiti's death on social media, the group said. \nSaudi authorities say those required to move for The Line have been offered compensation. But the figures paid out have been much lower than the amount promised, according to AlQst. \nAccording to Col Alenezi, \"[Neom] is the centrepiece of Mohamed Bin Salman's ideas. That's why he was so brutal in dealing with the Huwaitat.\"\nA former senior executive of Neom's ski project told the BBC he had heard about the killing of Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti a few weeks before leaving his native US for the role in 2020. Andy Wirth says he repeatedly asked his employers about the evictions, but was not satisfied with the answers. \n\"It just reeked of something terrible [that] had been exacted upon these people\u2026 You don't step on their throats with your boot heels so you can advance,\" he said. \nHe left the project less than a year after joining it, disenchanted with its management.\nA chief executive of a British desalination company who pulled out of a $100m (\u00a380m) project for The Line in 2022 is also extremely critical.\n\"It might be good for some high-tech people living in that area, but what about the rest?\" said Malcolm Aw, the CEO of Solar Water PLC.\nThe local population should be seen as valuable assets, he added, given how well they understand the area. \n\"You should seek that advice to improve, to create, recreate, without removing them.\" \nDisplaced villagers were extremely reluctant to comment, fearing that speaking to foreign media could further endanger their detained relatives. \nBut we spoke to those evicted elsewhere for another Saudi Vision 2030 scheme. More than a million people have been displaced for the Jeddah Central project in the western Saudi Arabian city - set to include an opera house, sporting distr",
    "Reigning Miss USA Noelia Voigt has resigned her title, citing mental health challenges. \nMs Voigt, who won the annual competition in September, said she believed in making decisions \"that feel best for you and your mental health\". \n\"Never compromise your physical and mental wellbeing,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"Our health is our wealth.\" \nThe Miss USA organisation said it supported her decision and would announce a successor.\nThe 24-year-old Venezuelan-American, of Utah, said that she hoped to \"continue to inspire others\" as she started \"a new chapter\" in life.\n\"Prioritise your mental health, advocate for yourself and others by using your voice and never be afraid of what the future holds, even if it feels uncertain,\" she said.\nShe expressed her gratitude for her seven months as Miss USA, which she said gave her a \"platform ... to make a difference\" as well as realise a \"lifelong dream\" and meeting \"people all over the world.\" \nMiss USA thanked Ms Voigt and said on Instagram that \"the well-being of our titleholders is a top priority\".\nThe organisation said it was reviewing plans for the \"transition of responsibilities to a successor\". \nSavannah Gankiewicz of Hawaii came second to Ms Voigt in last year's competition. The New York Times reported Ms Gankiewicz has already been offered the title.\nWhile health professionals praised the decision to step down, fans have speculated about her motivation to renounce her crown little over seven months into the role.\n\"When mental illness gets in the way of someone's ability to go about not just their day-to-day activities, but to actually do their job, it is as life-threatening and as severe as untreated diabetes [and] uncontrolled high blood pressure,\" Dr Jen Ashton, an American health correspondent, told Good Morning America in reaction to the news.\nMs Voigt's resignation came three days after Miss USA's social media director, Claudia Michelle, announced her own resignation from the brand, citing alleged \"workplace toxicity and bullying\" and saying that titleholders \"should be heard and not silenced\".\n\"I have had the privilege of getting to work with Noelia closely and unfortunately seen a decline in her mental health since we first met,\" Ms Michelle wrote in a statement.\nMs Voigt's \"ability to share her story and her platform have been diminished\", she claimed.\nMiss USA told USA Today that Ms Michelle's statement contained \"false accusations\", and said the organisation was \"committed to fostering a safe, inclusive and supportive environment, and we take these allegations seriously. \n\"Indeed, we have and will continue to prioritize the well-being of all individuals involved with Miss USA.\"\nBut fans on social media noticed that the first letter of each sentence of Ms Voigt's lengthy resignation statement spelled out \"I AM SILENCED\" - though the final three sentences spelled \"HIP\". Beneath her resignation statement posted to Instagram, dozens of fans commented on the apparent connection. \nThe BBC has approached Miss USA for further comment.\nMiss USA has previously courted controversy over the treatment of contestants. The year before Ms Voigt was crowned, the pageant faced allegations of rigging the 2022 contest in favour of winner B'Roney Gabriel, who had ties to sponsors - including one owned by the then-president Crystle Stewart. \nMs Stewart was suspended from her role, though she, Miss USA and Ms Gabriel denied the rigging claims. It was later revealed that Ms Stewart's husband, Max Sebrechts, a Miss USA vice-president, resigned his role after multiple contestants alleged he had sexually harassed them in 2021.",
    "The high-profile trial of a Canadian man accused of murdering four indigenous women two years ago has opened in Winnipeg, Manitoba.\nJeremy Skibicki has pleaded not guilty to four first-degree murder charges.\nIn an unexpected development on Monday, his lawyers said their client has admitted the killings but will argue he is not criminally responsible due to a mental disorder. \nFamilies of the victims say they want him held responsible for the murders. \nCaution: This article contains upsetting content.\nJeremy Skibicki's victims - Morgan Harris, 39, Marcedes Myran, 26, Rebecca Contois, 24, and a fourth unidentified woman who has been given the name Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman - are all First Nations women. \nProsecutors accuse the Winnipeg native, who is in his mid-30s, of taking the women home and sexually assaulting them before murdering them between March and May of 2022. \nHe was arrested that same year, after the remains of Ms Contois were discovered in a garbage bin and at a local landfill. \nPolice believe the bodies of Ms Harris and Ms Myran were disposed of at a separate landfill north of the city. Their remains have yet to be found. \nThe location of the remains of the fourth victim - Buffalo Woman - is unknown. \nCrown prosecutors have agreed the trial, which was originally scheduled to be before a jury, can be heard by a judge alone. \nAn earlier request by Jeremy Skibicki's lawyers to not have a jury was initially denied, but on Monday the trial judge accepted their request after the defence said it was now seeking a not criminally responsible verdict.\nJurors who had already been selected in late April to hear the case are expected to be officially dismissed on Wednesday morning.\nThe trial is expected to continue through early June.\nExperts say the trial's focus will likely shift given the suspect's not guilty plea on the basis of mental illness.\nBrandon Trask, a law professor at the University of Manitoba, told the BBC on Wednesday that typically, murder trials are about proving the accused's guilt. In this case, the onus will be on the defence to prove that the suspect suffers from \"a disease of the mind that rendered him incapable of appreciating the nature of his actions\".\n\"That's very much an uphill battle for the defence in this case, where you've got multiple victims spread out over a period of time,\" Mr Trask said.\nIf the suspect is successful in proving he is not criminally responsible, he would spend time in a forensic hospital setting rather than behind bars, and would be subject to annual hearings that would determine the level of freedoms that can be afforded to him moving forward.\nThe killings of the four women sparked an outcry in Canada, where a disproportionate number of indigenous women and girls are murdered or go missing. \nIn 2014, the federal statistics agency reported that indigenous women are six times more likely to be the victim of a homicide than non-indigenous women.\nThe case has also remained in the news as the families of the victims have fought to pressure the government to authorise and pay for the search the Prairie Green landfill, where the remains of Ms Myran and Ms Harris are believed to be.\nInitially, the provincial Manitoba government refused, citing the challenges of finding the remains, the cost, and concerns for worker safety given the presence of hazardous chemicals at the site.\nBut the province shifted course after a change in government saw the election of Premier Wab Kinew, who is indigenous. \nA search will likely start later this year after the province and Ottawa set aside a combined C$40m ($29m; \u00a323.3m) in funding. \nThe news was welcomed by Cambria Harris, Ms Harris' daughter, who has been advocating for the search since 2022.\n\"It's about showing our indigenous women, our indigenous people, that we're worth it,\" Ms Harris told CBC news recently. \n\"That we're valued, that we're loved and we're more than worth searching for.\"",
    "On our arrival in Nigeria's self-proclaimed capital of twins to investigate the proliferation of multiple births in the small rural town of Igbo-Ora, we are greeted by the news that a woman has just delivered a healthy pair of babies at the local clinic.\nTheir mother is a twin - her twin brother is in the ward taking photos of the new arrivals, his nephew and niece. Surrounding the bed are the babies' grandmother, who is herself a twin, and their great-grandmother, who has given birth to two sets of twins.\n\"That's how we do it here. We give birth to twins. It makes our town special,\" the five-hour-old twins' grandmother tells the BBC.\n\"It makes us proud and we love them. We love our twins. They bring us success,\" she says.\n\"People are disappointed if they don't give birth to twins.\"\nIt is true that Igbo-Ora, in south-western Nigeria, appears to have a higher-than-usual number of twins - walking through the town it is easy to spot younger sets of twins, who tend to wear matching clothes. \nThe global average birth rate for twins is around 12 per 1,000 births, but in Igbo-Ora it is reported to be about 45 per 1,000. \nIn Yoruba culture, which predominates in the south-west of the country, twins are a blessing and their names are predestined.\nIrrespective of gender, the older twin is called Taiwo, meaning \"the one that tests the world\", the younger is called Kehinde, meaning \"the one that came after\".\nThe next day, at Igbo-Ora's high school we find out that these names tend to dominate roll-call. When we ask a group of around 1,500 students during morning assembly to raise their hand if they are a twin, or have a twin in the family, nearly everyone's arm shoots up.\nSo why are there so many twins in the area?\nAccording to oral folklore, the village was founded in the 14th Century by an exiled prince of the Oyo Kingdom, who was told to make specific offerings to the Yoruba gods in pairs and in return, the village was blessed with twins. \nMany locals though put their fertility down to a dish called \"ilasa\", made from okra leaves. These spinach-like leaves are added to a pot of boiling water along with salt and spices, locust beans and melon seeds. \nThe reason behind Igbo-Ora's multiple births is a genuine subject of study in Nigeria.\nOnly a minority of the twins born in Igbo-Ora are identical - when one egg is fertilised and then divides.\nThe majority are non-identical, meaning multiple eggs are released and fertilised at the same time. \nResearchers are investigating whether natural chemicals in the local food, like ilasa or perhaps even the local yams, might make women produce multiple eggs. \nProf Akinola Kehinde Akinlabi, rector of the Oyo State College of Agriculture and Technology based in Igbo-Ora, thinks genetics may have more to do with it.\nThe academic, who is himself a twin - and father of twins, says someone born a twin in these parts will not find it hard to find a wife or husband.  \n\"Twins are venerated almost as deities who bring good fortune and protection. People present twins and their families with gifts, money and offers of help. All that encourages people to marry those from twin-producing families,\" he tells the BBC.\nThe traditional ruler of the town, known as an oba, is eagerly awaiting the results of scientific studies.\nJimoh Olajide hopes that in a country with a love of setting Guinness World Records, Igbo-Ora will soon be officially recognised for its phenomenal fertility - given nearly every home in town has at least one set of twins.\n\"My vision for this town is to see us holding the world record for highest multiple births in the whole world,\" says Oba Olajide, who is of course a father of twins.\n\"Things that will follow will be tourism, hotels.\"\nWith this in mind, the town launched an annual international twin festival several years ago.\nProf Akinlabi hopes the focus on twins will also lead to investment for the broader community to tackle things like its poorly equipped and old health centres.\nSuch is the status of twins that despite the adoption of Islam and Christianity in this area the traditional Yoruba worship of them is still prevalent.\nKehinde Adeleke, our local guide and a younger twin, takes us to witness a ritual offering, including palm wine and beans, to the twin gods at a shrine in her family's community.\n\"I feel specially blessed as a twin,\" says Ms Adeleke who has two children, but no multiple births as yet.\n\"I will be disappointed if I don't have twins - it's the twins I need,\" she admits amid the drumming and singing at the ceremony.\nSuch attitudes were a complete anathema for some members of the minority Bassa-Komo community near the capital, Abuja. Twins for them have been a source of fear.\nIn the mid-1990s, Nigerian missionary Olusola Stevens heard the villagers in this remote and poorly developed area thought twins were evil and that they were mysteriously dying.\nSuch beliefs were not unheard of in Nigeria - especially in the south-east of the country where differen",
    "The US last week paused a bomb shipment for Israel over concerns it was going ahead with a major ground operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, a senior US administration official said. \nThe shipment consisted of 1,800 2,000lb (907kg) bombs and 1,700 500lb bombs, the official told the BBC.\nIsrael has not \"fully addressed\" US concerns over the humanitarian needs of civilians in Rafah, they added.\nAn Israeli military official appeared to play down the US move.\nThe delayed arms shipment comes as US President Joe Biden faces mounting domestic pressure - from Democratic lawmakers and some parts of the US public - to rein in Israeli operations in Gaza amid rising civilian deaths and a worsening humanitarian situation. \nDespite firm and vocal US opposition, Israel appears poised to mount a large-scale invasion of Rafah, a congested part of southern Gaza that is Hamas' last major stronghold in the territory. \nUS officials have warned that an operation in the city - where the population has swelled with refugees from other parts of Gaza - could lead to extensive civilian casualties. \nIDF spokesman Daniel Hagari told a news conference that the US had provided \"unprecedented\" security assistance since the beginning of the war, adding that disputes between the allies were resolved \"behind closed doors in a matter-of-fact way\".\nBut a leading member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party in Israel told BBC's Newshour on Wednesday that he believes US domestic political considerations are behind the decision to halt the delivery of bombs.\n\"I totally disagree that the American election has nothing to do with it,\" said Boaz Bismuth, a member of the both the Israeli parliament and the foreign affairs and defence committee. \nThe weapons being held back by the US are related to a future delivery, so it is unlikely to have any immediate impact. But given the rate at which Israel is bombing it will likely affect future strikes fairly soon. \nOvernight, there were more Israeli air strikes in the Gaza Strip, hours after Israeli forces took control of the Palestinians side of the Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt.\nThe Israeli bombardment was particularly intense around Rafah. Local medics said seven members of one family were killed.\nRafah has been a key entry point for aid, and the only exit for people able to flee, since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas last October.\nThe crossing remained closed on Wednesday morning, but the Israeli military said it was reopening the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing, which had been closed for four days because of Hamas rocket fire.\nOn Monday, the Israeli military ordered tens of thousands of civilians to begin evacuating eastern parts of Rafah city, ahead of what it called a \"limited\" operation to eliminate Hamas fighters and dismantle infrastructure.\nMeanwhile, efforts continue to reach a ceasefire, alongside the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. In Cairo, delegations from Israel and Hamas have resumed negotiations through mediators. \nAfter refusing to confirm or deny reports of delayed weapons shipments, a US official on Tuesday finally confirmed that at least one shipment of bombs was delayed this week. \n\"The US position has been that Israel should not launch a major ground operation in Rafah, where more than a million people are sheltering with nowhere else to go,\" the senior US administration official said.\nThe official added that talks with Israel are \"ongoing and have not fully addressed our concerns\" and the US had been reviewing its weapons transfers to Israel since April.\n\"We are especially focused on the end-use of the 2,000lb bombs and the impact they could have in dense urban settings as we have seen in other parts of Gaza,\" the official said.\nThey stressed that the shipments were unrelated to last month's landmark $17bn military aid package, but had been drawn from \"previously appropriated funds\". \nThe larger 2,000lb bombs are most likely to be Mk-84s or possibly BLU-109s - or both. \nThe former is a cheap, general purpose munition and the latter a penetration bomb designed for use against hardened or underground targets. Both can be fitted with JDAM kits that deliver precision capability using satellite navigation. Laser guidance kits can also be fitted.\nThese bombs can be made to be very accurate, down to just a few metres. But in a dense, urban environment like Gaza the risk of so-called \"collateral damage\" is high. And that is where the concern lies. The smaller 500lb bombs can also be fitted with guidance units dropped from jets.\nWe do not know exactly how Israel uses these weapons, but media posts from the Israeli Air Force frequently show F-16 and F-15 jets loaded with JDAM [Joint Direct Attack Munition] kits for strikes. \nIt is worth remembering that such weapons would not just be used in Gaza but also targets in southern Lebanon belonging to the Iran-backed group Hezbollah, which has been involved in almost daily cross-bord",

A strip of a mud-floored foyer packs in a kitchen, a few plastic chairs, two rope beds and fraying clotheslines. \nAfter a three-year wait, the Bhallavi family received 120,000 rupees ($1,445; \u00a31,136) from a programme run by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government last year, allowing them to start building a new home. \nMore than 25 million homes have been built since 2016 under the rural public housing programme, called the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Prime Minister's Housing Scheme). It is one of the more than 300 federal schemes that Mr Modi is leaning on to bolster support for his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) during the general election as he eyes a record-equalling third term in office.   \n\"Life is tough. But I am grateful to get money from the government to build my first house,\" Mr Bhallavi, 42, said.\nAfter coming to power in 2014, Mr Modi has expanded India's welfare programmes, targeting women and farmers in particular. This includes providing cooking gas, free grain, houses, toilets, piped water, electricity and bank accounts, and beefing up a long-running jobs guarantee programme. \nMany benefits - pensions, subsidies, loans and scholarships - are delivered through cash transfers to bank accounts linked to biometric identity cards held by over a billion Indians. Giant posters of Mr Modi promoting these schemes as his personal \"guarantees\" dominate the landscape.\nMr Modi says his government has spent more than 34 trillion rupees ($400bn; \u00a3316bn) in the past decade, delivering direct cash benefits to low-income households and reaching over 900 million people. A yearly handout of 6,000 rupees to more than 110 million farmers constitutes one of the world's largest cash transfer programmes. The transfers, officials claim, have cut corruption and slashed costs.   \nEconomist Arvind Subramanian calls this Mr Modi's \"New Welfarism\", funding essential private items like toilets, rather than expanding public goods such as primary education and healthcare.\nTo be sure, \"New Welfarism\" stands apart from the traditional welfare models in Europe or the US. \nWhile the US tends to favour smaller government and lower taxes, resulting in modest social transfers, European welfare states have been more generous. Social democracies such as those in Scandinavia have favoured higher social spending, supported by higher taxes. \nFollowing Mr Modi's cue, all parties in India have caught what Devesh Kapur of Johns Hopkins University calls the \"virus of cash transfers with numerous schemes across states and political parties\". \nThe country's state governments now operate more than 2,000 cash transfer programmes. \"Every party in India knows that welfare matters for votes,\" says Mr Kapur.\nOn a recent balmy morning in Bishnupur in West Bengal state, more than a hundred men, women and children gathered under a blue-and-white tent in a school courtyard. The event had a festive air about it.\nExcept this was a welfare delivery camp organised by the ruling Trinamool Congress party, led by Mamata Banerjee, a charismatic regional leader who has so far repelled Mr Modi's BJP in the eastern state, home to over 100 million people.\nServing her third term, Ms Banerjee has prioritised welfare initiatives, running some three dozen schemes. These include free bicycles to get to school, scholarships for girls, financial aid, pensions for women, the elderly and the disabled, alongside universal health insurance. \n\"We are giving welfare benefits here from birth to death,\" Naziruddin Sarkar, a senior district official, said. \nTo ease the burden of travelling to distant government offices and dealing with unhelpful officials, Ms Banerjee's government operates a benefits outreach programme called 'Duare Sarkar', meaning 'government at your doorstep'. In the last three years alone, over 100 million people have registered for welfare benefits across different schemes at more than 650,000 such camps in 23 districts, according to official data.\nThe camp in Bishnupur offers a snapshot of the livelihoods of beneficiaries. \nShobha Mondal says she is using her widow's pension to send her son to school. Monika Tithi uses three separate pensions - as a farmer, tribesperson and woman - to run a village grocery. Dipali Mondal, another widow, uses her pension to make and sell street-side snacks.\n\"When old or widowed women get money, they are respected more in their household. Pensions give them dignity,\" Choten Dhendup Lama, a senior official, said.  \nHundreds of miles away in the coastal city of Visakhapatnam in southern India's Andhra Pradesh state, Y Laxmi pins her hopes on welfare to secure a brighter future for her children.\nShe lives with her deaf and speech-impaired husband, their two school-going sons, and ",
    "It is a spring evening in Germany's eastern city of Cottbus, and dozens of people have crowded into a small venue to hear a man who once dubbed himself the \"friendly face\" of National Socialism (Nazism).\nTwo other men with prior links to extremist groups are also in the room, including a candidate for forthcoming state elections. \nThey're all there to hear Matthias Helferich at a youth event organised by members of the prominent far-right party, Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD).\nThe AfD has repeatedly rejected accusations of extremism.\nHowever, by investigating the past of these three men, the BBC has found a clear crossover between AfD figures and far-right networks, some of which are classed as anti-democratic or racist by German authorities.\nStephan Kramer, a regional spy chief in eastern Germany, has told the BBC the AfD now poses a danger to the \"roots\" of democracy, as the party eyes electoral gains in three states in the east this autumn: Saxony, Thuringia and Brandenburg.\nAhead of next month's European elections the AfD, beset by extremism and corruption allegations, has dipped in the polls but still consistently places second nationwide.\nIt remains strong in Germany's post-communist communities. \nMatthias Helferich's speech in Cottbus was all about \"remigration\" - a burgeoning concept within Europe's far right about mass \"returns\" or deportations. The BBC asked to attend his talk but was told there wasn't space. \nElected to Germany's Bundestag in 2021, he was effectively barred from joining the AfD's parliamentary faction, after damaging Facebook exchanges came to light dating back to 2016-17.\nIn leaked remarks Mr Helfrich mentions Nazism several times, including an apparent description of himself as the \"friendly face\" of National Socialism and as a \"democratic Freisler\" - a reference to Nazi-era judge, Roland Freisler.\nMr Helferich told the BBC he didn't seriously call himself the friendly face of Nazism at all but was merely \"parodying\" left wingers online.\n\"If you are confronted with Nazi accusations as frequently as AfD politicians, you compensate for that in private spheres. You ridicule it.\" \nHe continues to hold AfD roles at a local level and, as Cottbus shows, is welcomed within some party circles as an unapologetic proponent of \"remigration\".\nMany view the term as little more than a euphemism for the large-scale expulsion of people with migrant backgrounds, brought about by force or political pressure. \nMatthias Helferich is outspoken about his hopes of \"remigrating\" millions in response to the \"mass influx\" of migrants from Africa and the Middle East.\nBut he claims that no-one who's legally in Germany would be forced to leave - though some could be offered the chance to return to their \"home country\" and \"culture.\"\n\"This is not about downgrading people or deporting them for racist reasons. It is about preserving Germany as the land of the Germans,\" he said.\nMr Helferich also spoke at a \"summer party\" last year hosted by the Institut f\u00fcr Staatspolitik (IfS), which months earlier had been designated as right-wing extremist by the federal domestic intelligence - which said the IfS was striving for an ethnically \"homogeneous\" nation.\n\"I don't share the view of the intelligence service that it is a right-wing extremist organisation,\" says Mr Helferich. \"I decide for myself where I speak.\"\nAfD figures accuse domestic intelligence, the Verfassungsschutz, of being a body stuffed with government appointed officials, unfavourable to their cause. \nMore than \"50 young patriots\" came to hear the Cottbus speech, says one of its organisers, Jean-Pascal Hohm. \nMr Holm has held numerous roles in the AfD and is now running in September's Brandenburg state elections. That is despite having been involved with - or linked to - a string of groups that went on to be classified as right-wing extremist. \nThey include the Ein Prozent (One Percent) association, Zukunft Heimat (Future Homeland) and Identitarian movement, which has been known to promote the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy theory. \nThat's the far-right idea that global elites are deliberately plotting to change the demographics of Western countries.\nMr Hohm is unapologetic in his belief that \"population replacement\" is going on in Germany and Europe - something he describes as \"the main theme of our times\".\n\"I do not say that this is organised from up high, I say it is happening.\"\nIn 2017, Jean-Pascal Hohm was spotted among the crowd when a group of football fans chanted antisemitic slogans. Some even gave what appeared to be the Hitler salute.\nHe insists he was \"on the fringe\" with his father: \"This was a Cottbus away game, I am a Cottbuser.\"\n\"It's not my fault that some lunatics use this as a stage to do things which I expressly do not support,\" he tells me. \nPictured smiling in the audience for Matthias Helferich's talk in March was a man called Benedikt Kaiser, who works in parliament for J\u00fcrgen Pohl, an AfD MP in Thuringia.\nAn investigation by D",
    "People in southern Brazil have described the unprecedented devastation wreaked by flooding and overflowing rivers which have left swathes of the area under water.\nThe floods are the worst natural calamity ever to hit the state of Rio Grande do Sul, officials say.\nAt least 95 people have died and more than 130 are still missing.\nAn estimated 1.4 million people have been affected by the floods and aid workers are struggling to provide them with drinking water. \n\nDays of torrential rain caused rivers to overflow and have submerged entire towns.\nThe capital of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, is among those affected. \nThe city of 1.3 million inhabitants has been almost totally cut off by the floods.\nAn estimated 80% of its population do not have access to running water after five of the city's six water treatment plants ceased working.\nSuzan, a resident of Porto Alegre, said that people in the city had \"never experienced anything like it\".\n\"There are thousands of people who lost their houses. Now we don't have water anywhere,\" she said in a voice message she sent to the BBC.\n\"My mother-in-law is 90 years old and she had to be carried by the rescuers. It's unbelievable what is going on here,\" she added.\nThe city's mayor has rationed drinking water and city officials are distributing water in tanker trucks.\nThe work of aid and rescue teams has been hampered by criminal gangs, which have been stealing their boats.\n\"Jet skis and houses were looted. This is deplorable and must be denounced,\" a presidential spokesman said. \nThe city authorities have called for anyone who owns \"any kind of boat\" to put it at the disposal of emergency teams as thousands of residents still need to be rescued from neighbourhoods cut off by the water.  \nOne resident, Alexander Ramos, told AFP news agency that he had been forced to leave his home because \"everything had been washed away by the flood\".  \n\"We tried to wait as long as we could, but there was no chance, the army came and rescued us, as well as our dogs.\"\nSome families are leaving the city on foot. \"We've been without food for three days,\" one man told Reuters news agency.\n\"I'm with people I don't even know, I don't know where my family is,\" he added.\nThe latest estimates suggest 155,000 people have been left homeless. \nThe governor of the region has warned that torrential rainfall is due to resume this week.\n",
    "People in several regions of Ukraine have been experiencing power blackouts after the latest wave of Russian attacks on the country's energy infrastructure. \nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said there had been missile and drone attacks on critical energy facilities in seven regions.\nBBC Verify has been tracking Russian strikes on energy targets in the past months and industry experts have said Russia has been shifting its strategy  - increasingly targeting power plants to try to disrupt energy supplies to Ukrainians. \nIn posts on social media, Mr Zelensky said more than 50 missiles and 20 drones had been fired by Russia on Tuesday, hitting facilities in the Lviv, Vinnytsia, Kyiv, Poltava, Kirovohrad, Zaporizhzhia, and Ivano-Frankivsk regions.\nUkraine's national electricity company, Ukrenergo, said there were new blackouts in nine regions and warned of possible power cuts across the country on Wednesday evening as a result of the new damage and ongoing fighting. \nBefore the most recent Russian attacks, our analysis verified damage to 12 facilities and Ukrainian authorities have reported at least a dozen more hit - with the impact ranging from them running at significantly reduced capacity to being taken entirely out of commission.\nOn 22 March, a series of air strikes hit power plants across Ukraine.\nOne thermal plant in Kharkiv was destroyed, according to government-run energy company Centrenergo. An image of it, which we have verified, shows a hole blown in the centre of the building that served Ukraine's second-largest city. \nRussia also hit the two power plants run by private firm DTEK - one in Ladyzhyn in central Ukraine and another in Burshtyn in the west. DTEK said at the time, without specifying which, that some of its facilities had been destroyed totally and others were running at around 50% capacity.\nYou can see the extent of the damage to the Ladyzhyn plant in satellite images from before and after the strikes. \nOther key facilities we have verified as being hit on this day include Ukraine's largest hydroelectric power station in Zaporizhzhia, where a fire broke out at the facility on the vast dam spanning the Dnipro river.\nStrikes on three different hydroelectric plants followed a week later. \nFootage posted on social media on 29 March showed two big explosions at the Kremenchuk Hydroelectric Station in central Ukraine, although satellite imagery of it is not conclusive about the level of damage. \nA third wave of attacks came on 11 April, including the destruction of the Trypillya power plant in Kyiv. Footage of it on fire went viral on social media and received significant media coverage.\nThis is the only strike BBC Verify has been able to corroborate from that night, but Ukrainian authorities also reported damage to plants in Sumy, Zaporizhzhia and Odesa.\nMore hits were reported on 27 April and then again on 8 May, though we have not been able to find any verifiable footage of these so far. \nThis is largely because the publishing of images or videos of strikes on key infrastructure is banned under martial law in Ukraine.  \nRussia has carried out frequent and widespread attacks on Ukraine's power infrastructure since the beginning of its full-scale invasion in 2022, but one expert told BBC Verify that its tactics have changed in recent months.\nVolodymyr Omelchenko, director of energy programmes at the Ukraine-based Razumkov Centre think tank, said Russian forces have been targeting larger energy generation infrastructure over smaller substations -  as power plants take longer to fix.\nAs of mid-April, he said Ukraine had lost more than 80% of all thermal generation capacity, on top of the destruction of Ukraine's largest hydroelectric power station.\nMr Omelchenko added he believes the attacks are aimed at creating a \"socio-economic collapse\" in Ukraine, rendering the country essentially impossible to live or run a business in.\n\"Moscow hopes that the collapse of the energy sector will force millions of people to emigrate,\" he warned.\nAnother energy industry expert told BBC Verify the focus on thermal and hydroelectric generation plants was also intended to reduce the flexibility of Ukraine's grid, as they can supply power regardless of the time of day or weather conditions.\nThe damage to the facilities, according to Olena Lapenko from the DiXi group think tank, means Ukraine's national energy company has been forced to import power from neighbouring countries to meet peak demand in the evening.\nShe believes the missiles have been targeting turbines and generators - elements which are the most complex to fix and expensive to replace.\n\"The goal of the Russians is obvious - to plunge Ukraine into darkness and leave the Ukrainian economy without electricity, undermining defence capabilities.\"\nThe Ukrainian military has also responded with its own series of drone strikes on Russian oil depots and refining facilities in recent months, which BBC Verify has looked at previously. \nAdditional reporting by Paul",
    "A top barrister who was paid by the Post Office to review subpostmasters\u2019 convictions knew about a \"tainted witness\" but failed to investigate, report it to the police or disclose it to defendants.\nBrian Altman KC told the Post Office Horizon inquiry on Wednesday that he \"didn\u2019t turn a blind eye to anything\".\nBut he admitted with hindsight, the Post Office should have disclosed the information to subpostmasters.\nMr Altman knew after his appointment in August 2013 that Gareth Jenkins, an expert witness, had failed to disclose information about bugs in the Horizon IT system to defendants.\nThat information might have helped subpostmasters who had been found guilty to challenge their convictions.\nSoon after his appointment, Mr Altman, formerly the top barrister representing the government, read formal legal advice from Simon Clarke, a barrister with law firm Cartright King. This made it clear Gareth Jenkins had been in breach of his duties as an expert, and that that might be disclosable to subpostmasters convicted of theft and false accounting.\nHowever, he avoided meeting Mr Jenkins and did not advise the Post Office to investigate his evidence. Mr Clarke\u2019s advice was not shown to defendants until 2021.\nThe inquiry saw evidence that Mr Altman re-wrote the terms of reference of his review to remove issues of Gareth Jenkins\u2019 evidence and avoided meeting him.\nHe wrote to fellow lawyers for the Post Office at Bond Dickenson that he knew that not meeting Gareth Jenkins \"risks exposing the final report [of his review of convictions] to criticism\".\n\"This is something I shall need to think about carefully. At this very early stage I am not unnaturally undecided,\" he wrote. \"For now it may be better for the Terms of Reference to remain silent about him.\"\n\"Why did you consider it best for the terms of reference to remain silent on Mr Jenkins?\" asked Jason Beer, counsel to the inquiry.\n\u201cMy view was if the terms if I had yet not yet resolved to see him, that there was no point sticking it in the terms of reference,\u201d Mr Altman said.\n\u201cNot meeting him would be turning a blind eye to a potentially useful source of information? That\u2019s why you wouldn\u2019t want to do it,\u201d said Mr Beer.\nMr Altman responded: \u201cIf you\u2019re suggesting that I\u2019m turning a blind eye, I was not turning a blind eye to anything.\u201d\nMr Beer also asked why Mr Altman didn\u2019t advise the Post Office that it should investigate why Mr Jenkins had given evidence that was, according to Mr Clark, misleading and in breach of his duties to the court.\n\u201cBecause I come back to what I had thought\u2026 that the advice I was giving was about the impact of that failure on the prosecutions and the convictions - and not the reasons why he had failed to do it,\u201d said Mr Altman.\nMr Altman also admitted he did not ask whether Mr Jenkins had been properly instructed by the Post Office on his duties as an expert witness.\nMr Beer: \u201cDid you consider making a report to attorney general?\u201d\nMr Altman: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cOr the [Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions?]\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I think you\u2019ve said it didn\u2019t cross your mind to advise to call in the police?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nThe inquiry saw evidence that Post Office lawyers were interested in hiring Mr Altman because of his political connections and because he \"had the ear\" of the Attorney General\u2019s office.\nPost Office lawyers Rod Williams  and Gavin Matthews discussed on 25 July 2013 how Altman was a good candidate to review subpostmasters\u2019 convictions because he was \"clearly [very] alive to the political dimension\".\nThe inquiry continues.",
    "A UK girl born deaf can now hear unaided, after a groundbreaking gene-therapy treatment.\nOpal Sandy was treated shortly before her first birthday - and six months on, can hear sounds as soft as a whisper and is starting to talk, saying words such as \"Mama\", \"Dada\" and \"uh-oh\".\nGiven as an infusion into the ear, the therapy replaces faulty DNA causing her type of inherited deafness. \nOpal is part of a trial recruiting patients in the UK, US and Spain.\nDoctors in other countries, including China, are also exploring very similar treatments for the Otof gene mutation Opal has. \nHer parents, Jo and James, from Oxfordshire, say the results have been mind-blowing - but allowing Opal to be the first to test this treatment, made by Regeneron, was extremely tough. \n\"It was really scary, but I think we'd been given this unique opportunity,\" Jo told me in an exclusive TV interview for BBC Breakfast News. \nHer sister, Nora, five, has the same type of deafness and manages well wearing an electrical cochlear implant.\nRather than making sound louder, like a hearing aid, it gives the \"sensation\" of hearing, by directly stimulating the auditory nerve that communicates with the brain, bypassing the damaged sound-sensing hair cells in a part of the inner ear known as the cochlea.\nIn contrast, the therapy uses a modified, harmless virus to deliver a working copy of the Otof gene into these cells. \nOpal had the therapy in her right ear, under general anaesthetic, and a cochlear implant put into her left.\nJust a few weeks later, she could hear loud sounds, such as clapping, in her right ear.\nAnd after six months, her doctors, at Addenbrooke's Hospital, in Cambridge, confirmed that ear had almost normal hearing for soft sounds - even very quiet whispers. \n\"It's wonderful seeing her respond to sound,\" chief investigator and ear surgeon Prof Manohar Bance told BBC News. \n\"It's a very joyful time.\"\nExperts hope the therapy could also work for other types of profound hearing loss. \nMore than half of hearing-loss cases in children have a genetic cause.\nAnd Prof Bance hopes the trial can lead to gene therapy being used for more common types of hearing loss. \n\"What I am hoping is that we can start to use gene therapy in young children... where we actually restore the hearing and they don't have to have cochlear implants and other technologies that have to be replaced,\" he said.\nHearing loss caused by a variation in the Otof gene is not commonly detected until children are two or three years old, when a delay in speech is likely.\nBut genetic testing for at risk families is available on the NHS. \nProf Bance said: \"The younger we can restore hearing, the better for all children because the brain starts to shut down its plasticity [adaptability] after the age of about three or so.\"\nOpal's experience, alongside other scientific data from the trial, is being presented at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy in Baltimore, in the US. \nMartin McLean, from the National Deaf Children's Society, said more options were to be welcomed.\n\"With the right support from the start, deafness should never be a barrier to happiness or fulfilment,\" he said.\n\"As a charity, we support families to make informed choices about medical technologies, so that they can give their deaf child the best possible start in life.\"\nAdditional reporting by Nicki Stiastny and James Anderson.

    "Reigning Miss USA Noelia Voigt has resigned her title, citing mental health challenges. \nMs Voigt, who won the annual competition in September, said she believed in making decisions \"that feel best for you and your mental health\". \n\"Never compromise your physical and mental wellbeing,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"Our health is our wealth.\" \nThe Miss USA organisation said it supported her decision and would announce a successor.\nThe 24-year-old Venezuelan-American, of Utah, said that she hoped to \"continue to inspire others\" as she started \"a new chapter\" in life.\n\"Prioritise your mental health, advocate for yourself and others by using your voice and never be afraid of what the future holds, even if it feels uncertain,\" she said.\nShe expressed her gratitude for her seven months as Miss USA, which she said gave her a \"platform ... to make a difference\" as well as realise a \"lifelong dream\" and meeting \"people all over the world.\" \nMiss USA thanked Ms Voigt and said on Instagram that \"the well-being of our titleholders is a top priority\".\nThe organisation said it was reviewing plans for the \"transition of responsibilities to a successor\". \nSavannah Gankiewicz of Hawaii came second to Ms Voigt in last year's competition. The New York Times reported Ms Gankiewicz has already been offered the title.\nWhile health professionals praised the decision to step down, fans have speculated about her motivation to renounce her crown little over seven months into the role.\n\"When mental illness gets in the way of someone's ability to go about not just their day-to-day activities, but to actually do their job, it is as life-threatening and as severe as untreated diabetes [and] uncontrolled high blood pressure,\" Dr Jen Ashton, an American health correspondent, told Good Morning America in reaction to the news.\nMs Voigt's resignation came three days after Miss USA's social media director, Claudia Michelle, announced her own resignation from the brand, citing alleged \"workplace toxicity and bullying\" and saying that titleholders \"should be heard and not silenced\".\n\"I have had the privilege of getting to work with Noelia closely and unfortunately seen a decline in her mental health since we first met,\" Ms Michelle wrote in a statement.\nMs Voigt's \"ability to share her story and her platform have been diminished\", she claimed.\nMiss USA told USA Today that Ms Michelle's statement contained \"false accusations\", and said the organisation was \"committed to fostering a safe, inclusive and supportive environment, and we take these allegations seriously. \n\"Indeed, we have and will continue to prioritize the well-being of all individuals involved with Miss USA.\"\nBut fans on social media noticed that the first letter of each sentence of Ms Voigt's lengthy resignation statement spelled out \"I AM SILENCED\" - though the final three sentences spelled \"HIP\". Beneath her resignation statement posted to Instagram, dozens of fans commented on the apparent connection. \nThe BBC has approached Miss USA for further comment.\nMiss USA has previously courted controversy over the treatment of contestants. The year before Ms Voigt was crowned, the pageant faced allegations of rigging the 2022 contest in favour of winner B'Roney Gabriel, who had ties to sponsors - including one owned by the then-president Crystle Stewart. \nMs Stewart was suspended from her role, though she, Miss USA and Ms Gabriel denied the rigging claims. It was later revealed that Ms Stewart's husband, Max Sebrechts, a Miss USA vice-president, resigned his role after multiple contestants alleged he had sexually harassed them in 2021.",

    "Hundreds of Gaza's water and sanitation facilities have been damaged or destroyed since Israel began military action against Hamas, satellite analysis by BBC Verify has found.\nDamage to a major supplies depot has also severely disrupted repairs.\nThe lack of clean water and flows of untreated sewage pose a serious threat to health, say aid agencies. \nThe Israel Defense Forces told the BBC that Hamas cynically exploits civilian infrastructure for terror purposes.\nThe destruction comes despite Israel's duty to protect critical infrastructure under the rules of war, unless there is evidence sites are being used for military reasons, say human rights lawyers.\nClean water has always been a limited resource in Gaza and the territory has largely relied on a system of boreholes and desalination plants for its supply.\nOur analysis found that more than half of these vital facilities have been damaged or destroyed since Israel launched its retaliation in Gaza after Hamas attacked on 7 October. \nWe also found that four of the six wastewater treatment plants - crucial to preventing the build-up of sewage and the spread of disease - have been damaged or destroyed. The two others have shut down because lack of fuel or other supplies, according to one aid agency. \nThe plants were among more than 600 water and sanitation facilities that we analysed, using a list of locations provided by Gaza's Coastal Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU).\nIn one satellite image, of Khan Younis in the south of Gaza, two damaged large water storage tanks can be seen.\nThe destruction of water and sanitation facilities has led to \"disastrous health consequences for the population\", said Dr Natalie Roberts, executive director of Medecins Sans Frontieres UK.\n\"The rates of diarrhoeal disease have gone catastrophically high,\" she said.\nIn very severe cases, such disease can kill young children and the vulnerable. Rates of hepatitis A - found in contaminated water and particularly dangerous for pregnant women - are also high, according to the charity.\n\"This is killing people,\" Dr Roberts said. \nThere is a particular spike in disease in Rafah in the south where many Gazans have fled to, Dr Roberts said, and a risk of cholera. \nThere has been widespread damage to buildings across Gaza since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October. According to the UN, about 69,000 housing units have been destroyed and a further 290,000 damaged. \nHomes are now \"very unlikely\" to have running water, according to aid workers we spoke to.\nTo carry out this analysis we sought advice from experts at the UN and Human Rights Watch on the best approach. \nFor each site, we sourced the most recent high resolution satellite imagery and compared each shot with an image taken prior to 7 October. \nWe then marked a facility as destroyed or damaged if the closest structure to the given co-ordinates appeared to be reduced to rubble, partially collapsed, or showed other signs of damage. \nBBC Verify has not distinguished between \"destroyed\" and \"damaged\" facilities. This is because without knowing the precise outline of each facility, we cannot say whether it has been partly damaged or completely destroyed. \nWater wells usually consist of an underground borehole and electric pump, together with a small control room above ground. However, as the control room is not always visible or easily identifiable we had to rely on analysing the nearest visible buildings when assessing damage.\nOf the 603 water facilities we analysed, 53% appeared to have been damaged or destroyed since 7 October. \nA further 43 facilities were in areas that showed some damage or where solar panels had been removed, but we were unable to determine whether the water facility itself had been damaged so these were not included in our analysis.\nThe latest available satellite images were acquired in March and April, and our analysis has been ongoing since April.\nThe majority of sites identified as destroyed or damaged are in northern Gaza or in the area around the southern city of Khan Younis. \nAt one wastewater facility in Bureij, in the centre of the Strip, solar panels that power the plant had been obliterated and sewage treatment tanks appeared to have algae growing on the surface.  \nNot all damage is visible from satellite images, so our analysis may have missed some affected facilities. Some sites also may not be fully operational due to a lack of fuel.\nFor example, the Unicef desalination plant in Deir al-Balah - one of three large seawater facilities in Gaza - can only work at 30% capacity because of lack of fuel, Unicef told the BBC.\nWith most Gazans now displaced from their homes, and living in tented camps, the build-up of sewage in the streets is even more of a threat.\n\"The pumps for sewage are not operating and the streets are flooded [with it],\" said Muhammad Atallah, who works for the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights.\nThe conflict has already made water facility repair difficult for Gaza's water authority, but a ",
    "Kyren Wilson's former mentor - the 2002 World Snooker champion Peter Ebdon - said the emotion of watching Wilson's first world title moved him to tears.\nWilson, from Kettering, defeated Jak Jones 18-14 as the World Championship final in Sheffield concluded on Monday.\nEbdon said the pair first met when Wilson played him in an exhibition match in Northamptonshire aged six.\n\"I was taken by his natural ability,\" said Ebdon. \"I said he should take up snooker - and the rest is history.\"\nEbdon, 53, who was born in London but grew up in Wellingborough, said he and 32-year-old Wilson played many hours of snooker together at Rushden's Windmill Club and Barratts Club in Northampton.\n\"He [Wilson] is a true world champion,\" said Ebdon. \"He is a lovely lad, with a really nice family.\n\"To be so close to him in a professional sense and see him go through and become a world champion - knowing how hard it is - was magical. I couldn't be happier for him.\n\"He put the work in and came through every test with flying colours. He was by far the best player at the Crucible this year and a very, very worthy champion. \n\"He had the all important ingredient - he believed in himself.\"\nHe said Wilson's nickname - The Warrior - was \"very apt\" and reflected his \"very strong mentality\". \nMore recently Wilson has had to contend with challenging family issues away from the table.\nHis wife Sophie had a stroke and was diagnosed with epilepsy, while his younger son Bailey suffered with illness and had to have an operation after an accident at school.\nEbdon - who retired from professional snooker in 2020 - was not present at Monday's final and said he chose to stay away so as not to \"upset his routine\", but he predicted more titles for Wilson.\nThe World Championship was his sixth victory in a ranking event and his first in one of the sport's Triple Crown tournaments - the Masters and UK Championship being the other two.\n\"I believe he can go on and become a Triple Crown winner,\" said Ebdon. \"He has a great chance of being a multiple world champion.\n\"It is such a huge thing to become world champion.

    "A 28-year-old man who died from a vaccine-related blood clot was wrongly offered the jab due to a clinical error by a GP surgery 17 years earlier.\nWhen he was 11, Alex Reid's weight was wrongly recorded as 22st 11lb (145kg) - suggesting he had a BMI of almost 69.\nHis parents, who say his death has \"destroyed\" them, said this put him in the \"vulnerable\" category eligible for an early AstraZeneca shot.\nThe GP surgery said it sent \"sincere sympathies\" to the Reid family. \nMr Reid received his first dose of the vaccine in March 2021, but weeks later an official recommendation said under 30s should be offered an alternative due to an extremely rare chance of blood clots.\nThose who had already received the AstraZeneca jab as their first vaccination were advised to receive it as their second, with Mr Reid having his in May 2021.\nHe died on 29 June 2021, with the medical cause of death being Covid-19 vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, a prevention of future deaths report said.\nHis family said he had called Moorfield House Surgery in Garforth, Leeds, to query why he was being invited for an early vaccine.\nHis mother, Halina Reid, told the BBC: \"Surely this one call from Alex should have raised alarm bells since most of the calls the surgery was getting were from people asking why they had not been called.\n\"The person who took the call said she did not know, made no attempt to find out and just said, 'count yourself lucky'.\"\nShe continued: \"After Alex's death, we knew something was not right - it has taken two years and five months to get answers.\"\nMr Reid's weight had been incorrectly entered in 2004 during a routine appointment for asthma when he was 11, his family said. \nAt no point over the next 17 years was it flagged up as being unusual that a 4ft 9in (145cm) boy had a BMI of nearly 69, with a healthy BMI being between 18 and 25, they added.\n\"The error was so serious that a safeguarding concern should have picked it up,\" his mother said. \n\"It would be almost impossible for a child to weigh that much - they had opportunities to rectify this mistake over the course of his life.\"\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine, which is being withdrawn due to shifting demands, was estimated to have saved millions of lives during the pandemic but also caused rare, and sometimes fatal, blood clots.\nThe prevention of future deaths report, prepared by coroner Oliver Longstaff, called for \"validation rules in general practice IT systems\" for when data is entered or a function that \"challenges\" potential errors. \nHe wrote: \"If the obviously erroneous BMI had not been recorded or had been challenged at the point of entry by the relevant IT system, Alex would not have been classed as vulnerable... and would not have died when he did.\"\nHis report was sent to NHS England, the British Medical Association and the Royal College of General Practitioners as well as EMIS and TPP - healthcare technology companies used by GPs. \nAll have been contacted for comment by the BBC. \nAn NHS England spokesperson said: \"We extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Alex Reid.\n\"We are carefully considering the prevention of future deaths report sent to us by HM Coroner and will respond in due course.\" \nMrs Reid said she was alerted to the BMI error in July 2021 during a phone call with one of the surgery doctors, who suggested her son's weight may have been incorrectly inputted. \nBut the surgery was \"not forthcoming with the truth\" and failed to disclose the error when replying to two coroner's letters about the matter, she said. \nIn response to a further letter, the surgery stated in February 2023 a raised BMI on its system could have triggered the early vaccine invitation, she added. \nThe surgery has since apologised to Mr Reid's parents, but his mother called it an \"insult\".\n\"It is gobsmacking they were so blatant in trying to blame others, when it was one fatal mistake they made,\" she said.\nAlex loved aviation and music, his family said, and described him as \"their world\".\nHis father, Antony Reid, said: \"We feel we have been destroyed. He was my best friend.\n\"It's a nightmare we are living every single day - we've followed every avenue to get the truth and some justice for him but it will not bring him back.\"\nHe added: \"The last three years have been horrendous, not only grieving him but fighting for justice he deserves.\"\nMrs Reid said she hoped the coroner's report would cause \"real change\" in how medical records were kept. \nIn a statement, the surgery said: \"We are very sorry about the death of Mr Reid and send our sincere sympathies to his family and friends. \n\"The practice gave evidence at the inquest hearing, however we are unable to comment further because of our duty of patient confidentiality.\"",
    "A school head teacher accused of sexually abusing five young girls has said he knew his relationship with one teenager was \"inappropriate\".\nBut Neil Foden, 66, who pleads not guilty to 20 charges, denied anything sexual had taken place.\u00a0\nHe told Mold Crown Court he would meet one complainant, known as Child A, and go for \"road trips\" with her.\nHe compared the experience to \"caving\", likening it to the moment when \"you go so far and can't go back\".\n\"I looked at locations for walks so we could talk, she valued those conversations,\" he told the jury, before adding that they had only ever stayed in the car.\n\"She fantasised about sitting in a car and looking at the view,\" said Mr Foden, from Old Colwyn in Conwy.\u00a0\nHowever, when asked by his defence barrister Duncan Bould if the pair had become \"sexually entangled\", he said they had not.\n\"I didn't want her sexually, I didn't want her romantically,\" Mr Foden added.\nQuestioned about a number of late night WhatsApp messages sent between the two \"with reciprocated love and kisses\", he said he had \"got into a pattern of sending affectionate messages to help her feel better\".\nHe said he never discussed what was happening with anyone else, adding he \"knew it was inappropriate.\"\u00a0\nRegarding a message about oral sex he had sent to her, which had previously been shown to the court, he said he had explained the process because Child A had asked about it. \nMr Foden added that it only seemed as though he was detailing what he would do to her because the message had been taken out of context.\nHe was later asked about pictures and videos that Child A had sent him and he said he had never asked for them.\u00a0\u00a0\nMr Foden admitted that he did not tell her not to send them because he \"didn't want to upset her\".\n\"I would compliment her appearance online, but in person I would tell her it was inappropriate,\"\u00a0he said.\nHe admitted to having routinely deleted the WhatsApp messages containing the pictures but had not known they had been saved elsewhere on his phone.\u00a0\u00a0\nLater he found them and deleted them, he said, because he was concerned Child A's father had seen them.\n\"I wasn't aware police had been called,\" he said.\u00a0\nMr Foden was then asked about the other girls about whom charges against him relate.\nHe admitted touching the left shoulder of Child B but denied \"squeezing\" parts of Child C's body and touching her \"in a sexual way\".   \nHe told the court that he would put his arm around Child C if she was upset and would always ask first.\nAsked about Child D, he said he had not behaved in a \"flirty way\" towards her and the only physical contact with her was on one occasion when he placed his hand on her shoulder.\nHe denies 20 charges, including 13 of sexual activity with a child.\nThe trial continues.",
    "Hong Kong's government will be able to proceed with making a protest song illegal under the city's national security laws after winning a court challenge.\nThe High Court had last year rejected the government's request for Glory to Hong Kong to be banned, saying it would have \"chilling effects\" on free speech. \nBut on Wednesday an appeal court overturned that ruling.\nThe move is likely to deepen concerns about freedoms being further eroded in the city.\nAmnesty International said the government's ban was \"as ludicrous as it is dangerous\".\nThe US, meanwhile, said it was \"the latest blow to the international reputation\" of the city.\nIn the court's ruling on Wednesday, it said that the song can still be used for \"academic\" or \"news\" activities.\nBut its melodies and lyrics can not be broadcast, performed, shared or reproduced in any setting where the user intends to \"incite others to commit secession\" or is used \"with seditious intention\" against the Hong Kong government. Those convicted of breaching the ban on the anthem could face up to life imprisonment.\nIt is also illegal for people to use the song to advocate for Hong Kong's separation from China, and to present it as the anthem of the territory.\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokesman on Wednesday said banning the song was a \"necessary measure by (Hong Kong) to fulfil its responsibility of safeguarding national security\". \nAmnesty's China Director, Sarah Brooks said: \"Banning \u2018Glory to Hong Kong\u2019 not only represents a senseless attack on Hong Kongers\u2019 freedom of expression; it also violates international human rights law.\n\"Singing a protest song should never be a crime, nor is it a threat to \u2018national security\u2019.\"\nHong Kong is part of China, but has had some autonomy since the end of British rule in 1997. Campaigners say that democratic freedoms have been gradually eroded since then.\nThe song Glory to Hong Kong - sung in the territory's native dialect Cantonese - emerged during pro-democracy protests in 2019 against a controversial extradition law and later became the unofficial anthem of the movement.\nIts lyrics include lines such as \"Liberate Hong Kong\" and \"Revolution of our times. May people reign, proud and free, now and evermore. Glory be to thee Hong Kong\".\nWhile the new ban will specifically codify when the song's use is illegal, people in Hong Kong had already been punished under national security laws for playing it.\nIn 2022, a harmonica player was arrested for playing the song outside the British consulate in Hong Kong to mourn the death of Queen Elizabeth II.\nThe song has been banned in schools since 2020.\nOfficials had also petitioned internet giants like Google to remove the protest song from their search results and video platforms - something the sites refused to do.\nThe song has also at times been mistakenly played as the city's anthem at official events like international sporting matches, something that has angered authorities. \nOn Thursday, the appeal court said pursuing a ban on the song's use in political contexts fell within the remit of current national security laws.\nIt said that because it was hard to prosecute individual criminal acts, \"a more effective way to safeguard national security was to ask\" would be to ask internet platforms to \"stop facilitating the acts being carried out on their platforms\".

    "Fighting and bombardment continued on the outskirts of the southern Gaza city of Rafah as Israel said the key Kerem Shalom crossing had reopened for aid. \nThe Israeli military said troops had killed Hamas fighters in eastern Rafah as part of a \"precise\" counterterrorism operation. Hamas also reported battles.\nEarlier, the military said lorries had reached Kerem Shalom, which was closed after a Hamas rocket attack on Sunday.\nBut the UN says no supplies have passed through the crossing yet.\nThe US said that while the crossing was open again, aid could not get through \"because of logistical and security concerns\" on the ground. \nThe UN had expressed alarm on Tuesday over what it called Israel's \"choking-off\" of Gaza's two main aid arteries, after Israeli troops took full control of the Palestinian side of the nearby Rafah crossing with Egypt.\nThe closing of the Rafah crossing is of particular concern because of the consequences for fuel deliveries - the UN says all of its fuel enters there.\n\"Without fuel, trucks cannot move critical humanitarian assistance, water pumps will stop functioning and the remaining hospitals will shut down,\" Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, wrote on social media on Wednesday.\nWorld Health Organization head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that hospitals in the south of Gaza had only three days of fuel left.\nPlumes of smoke from Israeli air strikes were seen over Rafah and heavy gunfire was heard on Wednesday, as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops were continuing a limited offensive in eastern areas.\nResidents of Rafah reported intense bombardment overnight and video footage on Wednesday morning showed people searching through the rubble of a building destroyed in one of the strikes.\n\"We are in a safe area according to the army's map - an area without operations,\" neighbour Reda al-Najili told Reuters news agency.\n\"We were sitting when suddenly the explosion happened. Our neighbour's house was gone, and our house was all damaged internally. In the house there are only civilians. Women died. Those who were injured were all children.\"\nPalestinian medics also said seven members of one family, including five children, were killed in an overnight strike on a home in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City, in the north of the territory.\nAn IDF statement issued on Wednesday morning said they had \"eliminated terrorists and uncovered terrorist infrastructure, as well as underground shafts in several locations\" during several encounters over the previous day. They were also carrying out raids on the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing, it added.\nThe IDF also said aircraft had struck more than 100 \"terror targets\" throughout Gaza over the same period.\nSeven months into its war with Hamas in Gaza, Israel has insisted victory is impossible without taking Rafah. \nBut with more than a million displaced Palestinians taking refuge there from the fighting elsewhere, the UN and Western powers have warned that an all-out assault could have devastating humanitarian consequences.\nNegotiations on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal have resumed in Cairo, with the US saying it believes a revised Hamas proposal could lead to a breakthrough.\nThe Israeli military played down the significance of the US government's decision to halt a shipment of powerful bombs over concerns that Israel was about to launch a major offensive on Rafah city.\nHowever, US President Joe Biden later warned that  the US would stop supplying some weapons if Israel launched a major ground operation in Rafah.\nThe Israeli military has ordered the evacuation of an estimated 100,000 residents and displaced people in a number of eastern neighbourhoods and told them they will find field hospitals, tents and aid in an \"expanded humanitarian area\", which stretches north from al-Mawasi to the city of Khan Younis and central town of Deir al-Balah.\nMeanwhile, the director general of the World Health Organization said one of the three hospitals in Rafah, al-Najjar, was \"no longer functioning due to the ongoing hostilities in its vicinity and the military operation in Rafah\".\nDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also warned that the partially functioning Kuwaiti and Emirati hospitals would soon run out of fuel unless the UN received a delivery. \"Hospitals in the south of Gaza only have three days of fuel left, which means services may soon come to a halt,\" he added. \nThe WHO has also said the European Gaza hospital in Khan Younis, where critical patients from Rafah are referred, may also become unreachable. \nA displaced man sheltering at the hospital told BBC Arabic's Gaza Today programme that life was very difficult for him.\n\"I suffer from diabetes, high blood pressure, and osteoarthritis - a matter which means the displacement causes a great deal of suffering for me,\" he said. \"We hope to return to our land in Gaza and that everyone will set up a tent in the place of his home and settle back there.\"\n",
    "A criminal investigation has been launched by authorities in Egypt following the fatal shooting of an Israeli-Canadian businessman.\nThe incident happened in the northern coastal city of Alexandria on Tuesday. \nThe victim has been named by Israeli and Arabic media as Ziv Kipper - the head of an Egyptian food exporter. \nA previously unknown group has said it was behind the shooting.\nIt has called itself the Vanguards of Liberation - the Martyr Mohammad Salah group - an apparent reference to an Egyptian police officer who was killed after shooting dead three Israeli soldiers last year. \nIn a statement, the group described Mr Kipper as an Israeli agent and said his killing was in retaliation for what it called massacres in Gaza and Israel's seizure of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, which also happened on Tuesday. \nA security source told Reuters they had no information about the existence of such a group and whether it had been involved in Tuesday's attack. \nNeither Israel nor Egypt have yet officially named the man who was killed. \nHowever, the Israeli foreign ministry confirmed that the victim was a businessman with dual Canadian-Israeli citizenship. \nIt added that the Israeli embassy in Cairo was in contact with the Egyptian authorities.\nEgypt's interior ministry, meanwhile, said in a statement that the man had been \"residing permanently\" in the country.\n\"Legal action has been taken,\" it said, without providing further details. \nJames Emmanuel Wanki, a spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada - the government's diplomatic department - said they were aware of the death of a Canadian citizen in Egypt and  \"express our deepest condolences to the family\". \n\"Consular officials are in contact with local authorities and available to provide consular assistance to the family,\" he said.\n\"Due to privacy regulations, no additional information can be disclosed.\"\nMr Kipper is listed online as the CEO of OK Group, which was founded in 2008 and exports frozen fruits and vegetables.

    "Australia has announced it will ramp up its extraction and use of gas until \"2050 and beyond\", despite global calls to phase out fossil fuels.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese's government says the move is needed to shore up domestic energy supply while supporting a transition to net zero.\nBut critics argue the move is a rejection of science, pointing to the International Energy Agency (IEA) call for \"huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas\" to reach climate targets.\nAustralia - one of the world's largest exporters of liquefied natural gas - has also said the policy is based on \"its commitment to being a reliable trading partner\". \nReleased on Thursday, the strategy outlines the government's plans to work with industry and state leaders to increase both the production and exploration of the fossil fuel. \nThe government will also continue to support the expansion of the country's existing gas projects, the largest of which are run by Chevron and Woodside Energy Group in Western Australia. \nIt argues these moves are needed for Australia's domestic energy supply as it tracks towards its targets of delivering 82% renewable energy to the grid by 2030, and achieving net zero emissions by 2050. \nCurrently gas accounts for 27% of the country's existing energy needs. But the bulk of what is produced domestically is exported to countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea.\nGas is responsible for roughly a quarter of Australia's total emissions, according to government data. \nThe policy has sparked fierce backlash from environmental groups and critics - who say it puts the interest of powerful fossil fuel companies before people. \n\"Fossil gas is not a transition fuel. It\u2019s one of the main contributors to global warming and has been the largest source of increases of CO2 [emissions] over the last decade,\" Prof Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics and author of numerous UN climate change reports told the BBC.\nIndependent Senator David Pocock lashed it as \u201cmorally bankrupt, negligent and just plain stupid\u201d in a statement on Thursday.  \nSuccessive Australian governments have touted gas as a key \"bridging fuel\", arguing that turning it off too soon could have \"significant adverse impacts\" on Australia's economy and energy needs. \nBut Prof Hare and other scientists have warned that building a net zero policy around gas will \"contribute to locking in 2.7-3C global warming, which will have catastrophic consequences\". \nIn 2015, world leaders promised to try to limit long-term temperature rises to 1.5C, which is seen as crucial to avoiding the most damaging impacts of climate change.\nThat limit was recently exceeded for the first time - from February 2023 to January 2024, according to the EU's climate service. \n",
    "When former prime minister Imran Khan was dragged out of a court house by police on charges of corruption on 9 May 2023, the reaction was unlike anything seen in Pakistan before. \nEnraged supporters took to the streets in cities across the country and buildings belonging to Pakistan's powerful military became the target - a shock to the institution widely known locally as the establishment.\n\"When he was arrested, our hearts sank. We were crying and didn't know what to do,\" said Hasan, who cycled to a central market in Lahore where Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party had often gathered.\nThe residence of a lieutenant general in the city had already been set ablaze by then.\nOn the streets of the capital Islamabad, where Khan was arrested, protesters pulled down street signs, lit fires and threw stones. Scores of military monuments were vandalised.\nThe military, which has long held sway over governance in the Muslim majority country, swiftly labelled 9 May 2023 a \"Black Day\". They have also described the protests as an \"attack on the army\". \nOne year on, many supporters of the former cricket star are still reeling from the physical and emotional wounds of the day's events. \nHasan was among hundreds arrested for their involvement in the protests. Many of them told BBC Urdu they took to the streets \"peacefully\" and were not involved in the violence, but were nevertheless held without due process and mistreated while in detention.\n\n\nHasan said he joined the protests \"because I felt that what happened to Imran Khan was wrong... We were telling the police, 'Today, you have crossed the red line', he said. \n\"Many Pakistanis have an emotional connection with Khan Sahib,\" he said, using a local term or respect. \"He is like a brother, like a father, to us.\" \nAbrar, another supporter who took to the streets after Khan's arrest, recalled that he left his house in Lahore \"immediately\" after seeing footage of Khan's arrest last May, as he felt his \"leader should not have been humiliated in this way\". \nKhan is a cricketing icon in a country where the sport enjoys almost fanatical support. He brought glory to the country as captain when he led the national team to World Cup victory in 1992. Many Pakistanis have grown up idolising him. \nBut critics argue that Mr Khan had the backing of the army during his rise to power, an allegation both sides reject. The military has heavily influenced Pakistan for most of its existence and is a crucial behind-the-scenes player in the country's politics.\nHe was elected PM in July 2018 but ousted in a parliamentary vote of no-confidence four years later. Shortly before general elections this February he was given several criminal convictions, barring him from standing. He is battling scores of legal cases, including charges for corruption and terrorism, but continues to be a powerful force dividing Pakistan.\nDuring the February elections, his party, which had been denied its election symbol and a united platform, was forced to run candidates as independents, who then emerged as the single largest bloc in a shock result. However, they fell short of the majority needed to form a government.\nAt least 10 people were killed and hundreds wounded during the 9 May protests, which authorities also said resulted in losses of 2.5 billion rupees ($9m; \u00a37.2m).\nThe crackdown after was effective and harsh. Protesters who were jailed have spoken of abuse and despair. \n\"Sometimes the prison felt more like a graveyard. Like how we recite prayers at the graves of our loved ones, perhaps our families were reciting the same prayers when they came to meet us,\" said Abrar, who was released early this year after spending nine months in jail.\n\"My daughter would be crying and I could not wipe her tears,\u201d he added.\nIntizar, a fellow protester who was detained, told BBC Urdu prison officials \"treated us as if we were terrorists, not Pakistanis\".\n\"I told them I only protested and did not vandalise,\" he said.\nHe turned himself into police after they went after his family and broke the gate of his house in an attempt to locate him. \n\"I don't think we can ever describe what we and our families endured.\"\n\nFormer interior minister Rana Sanaullah said the events of 9 May 2023 were but a continuation of the PTI's protests in the past.\n\u201cThe atmosphere had been created because the PTI founder was determined to prove itself more powerful than the state,\u201d he said, referring to Imran Khan.\n\"How can anyone say that 'If I am arrested, it will be crossing a red line'? This is like a rebellion.\"\nWhile a year has passed, political watchers say Pakistan will not be able to move on until the grievances of the protesters are addressed.\n\"I feel the state has only been venting its anger on this matter, as if trying to take revenge, instead of investigating it,\" said journalist Benazir Shah, who reported on the protests.\nMs Shah urged authorities to launch an investigation and make clear the roles of everyone involved.\n\"We will not be a",

    "Former Paralympian John McFall is working with the European Space Agency on a ground-breaking study to see if it's feasible for someone with a physical disability to live and work in space. BBC News has been following his progress as he undergoes astronaut training.\nIt's a test that any budding astronaut has to go through. But it's not for the fainthearted - or the claustrophobic.\nWith a clang, the door slams shut, enclosing John McFall in the darkness of a coffin-sized metal box.  \nThe spinning begins. \nHe's in a giant centrifuge, being whizzed around and around, to mimic the extreme gravitational forces of a rocket launch - and the even more extreme G-Forces of coming back down.\n\"The faster it spins, the higher the G load,\" John explains.\n\"And today we're going to be going up to about 6 Gs - so six times the force of gravity. It replicates what it would be like during re-entry into the atmosphere in a Soyuz capsule.\"\nThe test is part of John's training programme with the European Space Agency.  \nIn 2022 he was selected as their first astronaut candidate with a physical disability, to work on a ground-breaking study to see if he could go to space safely. \nJohn's an amputee, he lost the lower part of his right leg in a motorcycle accident when he was 19.\nHe usually wears a hi-tech prosthesis. But he's taken it off to test the effects of the centrifuge on his upper-leg.\nESA flight surgeon Maybritt Kuypers is monitoring him. \n\"It's the first time we have had an amputee in the centrifuge,\" she explains.\n\"The astronaut is basically lying on their back in a sort of seated position, so this influences the blood flow - also in the leg.  We were curious to see how that would affect him, but it went really well.\"\nJohn's paused his career as an orthopaedic surgeon to take a leap into the unknown of astronaut training.\nHe's moved from the UK to the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne, Germany.\nHe isn't guaranteed a space flight, but this study will see what needs adapting to make it possible -  the spacecraft, spacesuits or his various prosthetic legs. \nToday he's assessing his running blade. \nSport is a big part of his life, John's a former medal-winning Paralympic sprinter.  And keeping fit in space is crucial to maintain muscle mass and bone density. \nJohn's using a special anti-gravity treadmill, which recreates the weightless conditions on the International Space Station (ISS). A pocket of air lifts him slightly, artificially making him lighter. \nHe explains how his body weight pushes his blade into the ground, compressing it so it bounces back up again to give him a natural spring to propel him forward.\nBut the treadmill lightens him to about 80% of his body weight, so his blade doesn't work as well.\n\"I notice that the blade is too stiff,\" he explains. \"That's because I'm lighter and putting less force into the blade, so it's bending less, and therefore giving me less spring back.\"\nHe thinks he'd need a bendier blade - but there's more. \nOn a parabolic flight last year, where John experienced weightlessness for the first time, he found his day-to-day, hi-tech, microprocessor prosthetic leg would need recalibrating.\nIn fact, John thinks he might need several prosthetic legs on the ISS.  \n\"There would be a prosthesis for running, a back up for the microprocessor prosthesis, and then there's the mechanical one, which will probably need to be worn inside the spacesuit for launch and return,\" he explains. \n\"I'll need a bit of a wardrobe of prosthetic hardware.\"\nESA is the first space agency to carry out a project like this.\nUntil now, John's disability would have prevented him from becoming an astronaut. But Frank De Winne, the head of the European Astronaut Centre, wants to change that.\n\"We think this is a great opportunity because we have so many great talents - people that have a disability, like we see with John,\" he says. \n\"Why should we not try to harvest this talent for great missions like astronaut missions?\"\nThe move to Germany is a big change for his wife Sonia, a former Olympic gymnast, and their three young children Fin, Isla and Immy. \nAround the dinner table, they talk about their dad's new job. Their friends think it's \"cool\". Fin can't believe his dad has swapped being a doctor for a job where he might be sent \"into the big black void\" of space.\nSonia says John's new career is 100% right for him. \n\"It's a big thing in our family that you go for every opportunity,\" she says. \"And for me, this was an opportunity and he's gone and taken it.  I hope he gets the reward for it, which is eventually going to space and showing people that it's possible.\"\nThe World's First Para-astronaut\nFrom a taste of space on a parabolic flight to taking a spin in a giant centrifuge, follow ESA astronaut John McFall as he studies whether it's possible for someone with a disability to go into space.\nAvailable now on BBC iPlayer (UK only)\nBack at the centrifuge, it slows to a stop and the door clangs open.

    "The United States is the one country that has real leverage over Israel. And yet, throughout the war in Gaza, Israel has chosen to ignore much of the advice of its closest ally. \nThe US government says its support for the war against Hamas is \"ironclad\", but it has repeatedly raised concerns about the failure of the Israeli army to protect civilians and the lack of humanitarian access afforded to the people of Gaza.  \nFor seven long months, the US has gradually stepped up pressure on Israel. It has advised privately. It has warned publicly. It has stopped vetoing condemnatory resolutions at the United Nations. It has sanctioned Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank. \nIn a particularly robust telephone call a month ago, President Joe Biden told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu he would reduce US support if Israel did not allow fleets of aid lorries to cross the border into Gaza. \nAnd yet, much of this counsel and cajoling has fallen on deaf ears. So now the US is beginning to wield its biggest stick. \nThe US is by far Israel's biggest source of weapons and ammunition. By law, it provides Israel with $3.8bn (\u00a33bn) of military aid each year, designed to give the country an advantage over neighbouring countries. The US Congress last month passed a bill providing a further $14bn of military support. \nNow the Biden administration has for the first time delayed a shipment of munitions to Israel. A senior administration official confirmed to the BBC that the delivery of thousands of 2000lb and other bombs has been paused. \nThe official said they were also reviewing other weapons sales, including equipment that helps convert free-falling bombs into precision-guided munitions.\nSo why is the US finally reaching for perhaps its biggest lever of influence over Israel? A first answer is the proposed military operation against Hamas in Rafah. The US and many Western countries fear this would lead to mass civilian casualties and a humanitarian catastrophe. \nUS officials say the bombs they have delayed are the kind that might be used in Rafah and would have devastating consequences in dense urban settings. The US does not want Israel to attack Rafah and this is another way of reinforcing that message. One US official told the Washington Post this was a \"shot across the bow\" to show Israel the seriousness of US concerns. \nA second answer is the US government's desire to maintain pressure on Israel's cabinet to support a ceasefire deal with Hamas. Negotiations continue in Cairo and Washington may want to increase the costs that Israel may face for failing to agree a compromise. \nA third reason is surely domestic US politics. President Biden is coming under huge pressure from Democratic supporters to temper his support for Israel. \nIt is election year in the US and opinion pollsters are suggesting that some Democrats - especially younger people - may be reluctant to come out and vote for Mr Biden in November because of the US role in the war in Gaza. Low turnout could hit him hard in his battle with Donald Trump. \nAny decision to withhold military support for Israel comes with risks for the US. Israel could once again simply ignore what its ally was saying and doing. It could effectively call Washington's bluff and trust that US military support would continue in the long term. \nThat would be a very public demonstration of diminishing US influence in the world. But equally, Israel might be loath to risk an historic rift with its biggest ally, one upon whom it relied utterly for the air defences that protected it from a mass Iranian drone and missile attack just a few weeks ago. \nA big test will come when the US State Department decides whether the Israel Defense Forces are using US weapons to commit human rights abuses. A statement about an inquiry is expected soon. \nFinally, the US is not Israel's only ally. And if the US delays arms sales to Israel, then pressure will grow on other countries to do the same, including the UK. Such restrictions would be more symbolic than actual. But they would contribute to Israel's diplomatic isolation. ",
    "Conservative MP Natalie Elphicke has defected to the Labour Party, saying the Tories \"have become a byword for incompetence and division\".\nIn a statement released just as PMQs was starting, the MP for Dover said the key factors for her decision were housing and border security.\nShe accused Rishi Sunak of \"broken promises\" and abandoning key pledges.\nIt is the second defection to Labour for Rishi Sunak in less than two weeks, after Dan Poulter also quit the Tories. \nLabour will retain their existing candidate in Dover and Deal at the next general election and Mrs Elphicke will stand down.\nThe constituency replaces Dover, where Mrs Elphicke had a majority of 12,278 at the last election, following boundary changes. \nConservative Transport Minister Huw Merriman said he was \"absolutely staggered\" by the defection and accused Mrs Elphicke of being \"opportunistic\", while other Tory MPs said they were surprised as Mrs Elphicke had been on the right wing of their party.\nIn dramatic scenes, Prime Minister's Questions began in the Commons with Mrs Elphicke crossing the floor to sit behind Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. \nThere was bemusement and confusion from many on the Conservative benches.\nThe news has only been announced at midday and plenty of Tory MPs had not realised that their former colleague was now sitting opposite them - directly behind Sir Keir and so in the camera shot when he is talking - rather than on their side. \nSir Keir welcomed her to the party, asking Mr Sunak \"what is the point of this failed government staggering on\" when \"the Tory MP for Dover on the front line of small boats crisis says the prime minister cannot be trusted with our borders and joins Labour\". \nDover is the arrival point for many people who cross the Channel in small boats.\nIn her statement, Mrs Elphicke said Mr Sunak's government \"is failing to keep our borders safe and secure\", with lives being lost in the Channel and small boat arrivals \"at record levels\". \nLast April, Mrs Elphicke wrote in an article for the Express that Labour had \"no plan of their own to tackle illegal immigration\" and described the government's Rwanda plan as \"world-leading\". \nHowever, more recently she said she feared legislation aimed at reviving the plan would not stop small boat crossings, and suggested a returns agreement with France would be more effective.\nAsked whether she had changed her mind on Labour's immigration policies, Mrs Elphicke said Mr Sunak had not stopped small boat crossings and Labour would tackle this issue. \nBoth the MP and Labour insisted she had not been offered a peerage to defect but she will be given an unpaid Labour role advising the party on housing policy.\nMultiple sources claim that Labour whips, who are responsible for enforcing discipline, expressed concerns about admitting Mrs Elphicke to the party, though Labour denied this.\nFormer Labour leader Lord Kinnock told BBC Radio 4's The Week in Westminster: \"I think we have got to be choosy to a degree about who we allow to join our party because it's a very broad church but churches have walls and there are limits.\"\nHe said Mrs Elphicke had to decide whether she is \"committed to the programme and principles of the Labour Party\".\nMrs Elphicke was elected in 2019, taking over the Dover seat which had been held by her disgraced then-husband Charlie Elphicke. \nHe was jailed for two years in September 2020 for sexually assaulting two women. \nAfter his conviction, she gave an interview saying the allegations were \"false\" and he had been punished for being \"charming, wealthy, charismatic and successful\".\nLabour MP Sarah Champion expressed reservations about \"some of the things Mrs Elphicke had said defending her ex-husband from the sexual abuse allegations,\" which she told BBC Radio Sheffield \"don't sit well with me at all\".\nA spokesperson for the Labour leader said \"all those issues have been dealt with previously both in Parliament and in public\".\nMrs Elphicke, who supported Liz Truss in the 2022 Tory leadership contest, was on the right of the Conservative Party and a member of the Brexit-backing European Research Group.\nSir Keir's decision to welcome her to Labour has come in for criticism from some on the left of his party, particularly as Diane Abbott and Jeremy Corbyn remain suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party.\nLeft-wing campaign group Momentum said: \"This hard-right Tory should have no place in a Labour Party worthy of the name.\n\"It speaks volumes about Keir Starmer that he is welcoming her with open arms, while leaving Diane Abbott out in the cold.\"\nOn housing, Mrs Elphicke said the government was \"failing to build the homes we need\" and had \"betrayed\" renters and leaseholders by not delivering on promises to end no fault evictions and abolish ground rents. \n\"When I was elected in 2019, the Conservative Party occupied the centre ground of British politics,\" she said.\n\"Since then, many things have changed. The elected prime minister [Boris Johnson] was ousted",
    "Many of us of a certain age will remember the Alan Partridge scene where he is pitching to a TV executive in a bid to get a new series commissioned.\nGetting ever more desperate, the fictional British TV presenter suggests shows such as Inner City Sumo, Youth Hostelling With Chris Eubanks, and finally, Monkey Tennis. All were perhaps unsurprisingly rejected. \nMaybe Partridge, played by comedian and actor Steve Coogan, would have had better luck if he had let an artificial intelligence (AI) computer system pick the ideas.\nThat may initially sound like a highly fanciful idea, but a number of TV production companies have already announced that they are using AI to help them dream up new programmes.\nThese include RTL Group, whose subsidiaries make everything from The X Factor, to The Apprentice, Grand Designs and QI. It said last year that it had \"started to support content creation with generative AI.\"\nMeanwhile, Banijay, which makes Deal or No Deal and Keeping Up with the Kardashians, now has a fund to back AI-created content. Announcing this last year, it said: \"While human creativity will always prevail, it's important to work alongside the tools which are available to contribute to the future of ground-breaking entertainment.\"\nWhile neither firm has yet to unveil a new TV series whose idea came from an AI system, I decided to put one to the test.\nSo I logged into an AI chatbot, and typed in what I was looking for. I wrote: \"I am trying to think up a new TV format. A series with contestants.\n\"Maybe they would be learning a new skill, like dancing, or perhaps they are trying to compete in communities to have the most sustainable environment. Can you help me with some ideas?\"\nThe AI confirms that this could be an exciting endeavour. And instantly comes up with six ideas.\nI like its first suggestion - Skills Mastery Showdown - where contestants would be paired with skilled mentors, and have a limited time to master a specific new skill, such as dancing, cooking or painting. \nBut what do TV industry experts think about the use of AI in coming up with future content? I ask Dan Whitehead, who is a senior consultant at K7 Media, a Manchester-based research firm that reports on the TV business.\n\"The idea of a machine that you can type a request into, in normal conversational language, and have it spit out something close to what you asked for, still feels pretty magical,\" he says. \"So it's understandable that people are drawn to it.\n\"Can something like [AI chatbot] ChatGPT generate ideas for a TV show? Of course, but then ideas for TV shows have never been in short supply. The big problem for most production companies is the uncertainty - which ideas are best, which ones are worth investing in?\" \nMr Whitehead argues that AI can give people false confidence, giving them the sense that if it - with access to billions of data points - can come up with these ideas, they must somehow be better.\nI look back at Skills Mastery Showdown. Maybe it's not that innovative after all.  Mr Whitehead says that AI is better used in a much more nuanced, background way.\n\"The BBC's Springwatch and Winterwatch use a bespoke AI system that monitors live camera feeds, and has been trained to recognise, record and log different species of animals and birds as they appear in the frame,\" he says. \"It can then tell the production team how often they appear, give behavioural insights, and generally do something that would eat up hours of human production time.\"\nEline van Der Velden, founder and chief executive of London-based TV production firm Particle 6, is more positive about using AI to both help come up with ideas for new programmes, and to write scripts.\nShe says that recently she had two versions of a script ready for a client, one edited by humans, and the other by Chat GPT. \"We gave them both versions, and they preferred the ChatGPT one,\" she says.\nMs van Der Velden adds that she wants her producers to know how to use AI to help them do their job. \"[Otherwise] it's like having someone who doesn't know how Microsoft Word works,\" she says. \"It speeds everything up.\"\nShe also says that AI isn't replacing jobs in TV, or at least not all of them. \"It's like when accountants thought they'd be out of work with the advent of Excel.\n\"You still need a creative director, but this is a tool that programme makers should use. It will enable us to reach the next level of our full potential.\"\nRead more stories on artificial intelligence\nI still want to see if AI can help me make a hit TV programme? What about a drama series instead?\nMr Whitehead reminds me that AI is not human, that it will never have an emotional response to any requests or prompts that I give it.\nUndeterred, I asked my AI chatbot for ideas for a new TV show about the Post Office scandal. It comes back with a six-part series called \"Broken Trust\", which will combine drama and documentary elements to \"engage viewers emotionally, while providing factual insights into the larger issues ",
    "The US government says it has revoked some licences that allowed US chip makers to export certain goods to Chinese technology giant Huawei.\nThe Department of Commerce did not specify which permits were cancelled but US chip giants Intel and Qualcomm said they had been informed that some export licenses have been revoked.\nHuawei did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.\nSince 2019, the US has restricted technology exports to Huawei, citing alleged ties to the Chinese military but companies like Intel and Qualcomm were granted some exemptions.\nBeijing condemned Washington's moves against its companies.\nThe US was \"over-stretching the concept of national security and abusing export controls to suppress Chinese companies without justification,\" the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement.\nSome US lawmakers had criticised the administration of President Joe Biden following the launch last month of Huawei's MateBook X Pro laptop.\n\"Make no mistake, the Biden Administration would not have taken this action if Republicans in Congress were not holding them accountable,\" said Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik in a social media post.\nHuawei has been hit hard by US trade restrictions but more recently appeared to mount a comeback.\nThe Chinese company has enjoyed a resurgence particularly after the launch of the Mate 60 Pro smartphone in August.\nIn 2019, during the presidency of Donald Trump, US officials added Huawei to a so-called \"entity list.\"\nIt means that US companies need to obtain a licence from the government to export or transfer some technologies, especially over concerns that they will be used by the Chinese military.\nHowever, in that time licences have been granted to some US companies, including Intel and Qualcomm, to supply Huawei with technology that was not related to 5G.\nThe US has imposed restrictions on several Chinese technology firms in recent years, as tensions between the world's two biggest economies intensified.\nEarlier this month President Biden signed a law that could ban the video app TikTok in the country unless it is sold by its Chinese parent company.

    "A 28-year-old man who died from a vaccine-related blood clot was wrongly offered the jab due to a clinical error by a GP surgery 17 years earlier.\nWhen he was 11, Alex Reid's weight was wrongly recorded as 22st 11lb (145kg) - suggesting he had a BMI of almost 69.\nHis parents, who say his death has \"destroyed\" them, said this put him in the \"vulnerable\" category eligible for an early AstraZeneca shot.\nThe GP surgery said it sent \"sincere sympathies\" to the Reid family. \nMr Reid received his first dose of the vaccine in March 2021, but weeks later an official recommendation said under 30s should be offered an alternative due to an extremely rare chance of blood clots.\nThose who had already received the AstraZeneca jab as their first vaccination were advised to receive it as their second, with Mr Reid having his in May 2021.\nHe died on 29 June 2021, with the medical cause of death being Covid-19 vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, a prevention of future deaths report said.\nHis family said he had called Moorfield House Surgery in Garforth, Leeds, to query why he was being invited for an early vaccine.\nHis mother, Halina Reid, told the BBC: \"Surely this one call from Alex should have raised alarm bells since most of the calls the surgery was getting were from people asking why they had not been called.\n\"The person who took the call said she did not know, made no attempt to find out and just said, 'count yourself lucky'.\"\nShe continued: \"After Alex's death, we knew something was not right - it has taken two years and five months to get answers.\"\nMr Reid's weight had been incorrectly entered in 2004 during a routine appointment for asthma when he was 11, his family said. \nAt no point over the next 17 years was it flagged up as being unusual that a 4ft 9in (145cm) boy had a BMI of nearly 69, with a healthy BMI being between 18 and 25, they added.\n\"The error was so serious that a safeguarding concern should have picked it up,\" his mother said. \n\"It would be almost impossible for a child to weigh that much - they had opportunities to rectify this mistake over the course of his life.\"\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine, which is being withdrawn due to shifting demands, was estimated to have saved millions of lives during the pandemic but also caused rare, and sometimes fatal, blood clots.\nThe prevention of future deaths report, prepared by coroner Oliver Longstaff, called for \"validation rules in general practice IT systems\" for when data is entered or a function that \"challenges\" potential errors. \nHe wrote: \"If the obviously erroneous BMI had not been recorded or had been challenged at the point of entry by the relevant IT system, Alex would not have been classed as vulnerable... and would not have died when he did.\"\nHis report was sent to NHS England, the British Medical Association and the Royal College of General Practitioners as well as EMIS and TPP - healthcare technology companies used by GPs. \nAll have been contacted for comment by the BBC. \nAn NHS England spokesperson said: \"We extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Alex Reid.\n\"We are carefully considering the prevention of future deaths report sent to us by HM Coroner and will respond in due course.\" \nMrs Reid said she was alerted to the BMI error in July 2021 during a phone call with one of the surgery doctors, who suggested her son's weight may have been incorrectly inputted. \nBut the surgery was \"not forthcoming with the truth\" and failed to disclose the error when replying to two coroner's letters about the matter, she said. \nIn response to a further letter, the surgery stated in February 2023 a raised BMI on its system could have triggered the early vaccine invitation, she added. \nThe surgery has since apologised to Mr Reid's parents, but his mother called it an \"insult\".\n\"It is gobsmacking they were so blatant in trying to blame others, when it was one fatal mistake they made,\" she said.\nAlex loved aviation and music, his family said, and described him as \"their world\".\nHis father, Antony Reid, said: \"We feel we have been destroyed. He was my best friend.\n\"It's a nightmare we are living every single day - we've followed every avenue to get the truth and some justice for him but it will not bring him back.\"\nHe added: \"The last three years have been horrendous, not only grieving him but fighting for justice he deserves.\"\nMrs Reid said she hoped the coroner's report would cause \"real change\" in how medical records were kept. \nIn a statement, the surgery said: \"We are very sorry about the death of Mr Reid and send our sincere sympathies to his family and friends. \n\"The practice gave evidence at the inquest hearing, however we are unable to comment further because of our duty of patient confidentiality.\"",
    "Sharing knowledge between schools is a \"win-win situation\" when it comes to learning a second language, according to a Ballyclare teacher.\nPupils in the County Antrim town have come together to tackle the falling numbers of children who learn a second language in Northern Ireland.\nSixth form students from Ballyclare High School teach language classes to pupils in several local primary schools.\nJonny Nelson, head of Spanish at the school, said the lessons are mutually beneficial for the students.\nLearning a second language is not compulsory for primary school children in Northern Ireland.\nThe 'Language Leaders' scheme allows primary school pupils to get a taste of German, French and Spanish, which they would not otherwise learn on the primary curriculum.\nThe sixth form students lead lessons including games and interactive activities for younger pupils, while they in turn are provided with leadership and teaching experience.\n\"Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK at the moment that doesn't have a primary languages programme as part of the curriculum so we have to take the steps to try and instil that knowledge and enthusiasm from day one,\" Mr Nelson told BBC News NI.\n\"At the moment we deliver French, Spanish and German in Ballyclare High and our pupils are also delivering all three of these languages to four primary schools.\n\"As languages are not part of the curriculum, primary schools are glad of the help, and we are glad of the enthusiasm that we get back from them.\"\nRecent research suggests that pupils in Northern Ireland are required to learn languages less than those in any other country in Europe.\nThere has also been a dramatic fall in the number of pupils taking languages like French at GCSE over the past two decades.\nIrish language teachers have also previously called for action to halt the \"critical decline\" in pupils studying second languages in schools.\nA scheme to teach primary pupils additional languages was axed by the Department of Education (DE) in 2015 due to financial cuts.\nThe Year 13s and Year 14s from Ballyclare High School who are teaching the primary school pupils have studied languages at GCSE or are currently studying at A-Level.\nThose taking the classes are juggling their lesson-planning alongside studying for their upcoming exams.\nOne of the students, Neve, is learning French and German at A-Level.\n\"We get the pupils involved in fun activities; they get to learn a bit of different languages and when they get to high school, it makes it much easier for them to continue on with,\" she said.\n\"I think it's very important to get involved with languages at primary school age.\n\"When I look back at my time at primary school, I remember learning a little bit of German and French, which made it much easier as I knew the basics of the language once I got to secondary school,\" Neve added.\n\"Our world is becoming so much more online and there are so many other cultures out there meaning there's a big need for linguists.\"\nErin told BBC News NI that she loves learning languages.\n\"I study French for A-Level and I learn on my own outside of school,\" she said.\n\"I want to be a teacher when I'm older so being able to come in and share my passion, it's a very enriching experience.\"\nBBC News NI joined a class  joined a class taught by Neve and Erin at Fairview Primary School for Primary 4 pupils, including Jack and Sadie. \n\"When I'm older, I want to travel the world, so I'd like to learn languages so I can talk to people\" Jack said.\n\"I've been learning German and French.

With the tight-knit Invictus congregation seated in a circle, under the cathedral dome, it was almost literally his circle of trust.\nWith the traditional hymns and prayers, the ranks of clergy, and no gimmicks or modern twists, you could imagine his grandmother the late Queen Elizabeth II fitting in comfortably with such a service.\nWith the mellow late afternoon sunshine coming in through the long windows, it was a surprisingly intimate celebration of a decade of helping to give a sense of purpose to individuals and families under pressure.\nIt was also shaped like a royal event, complete with cameras and cheers outside and Prince Harry shaking a few excited hands as he was leaving. \nThere was plenty of support for him in this instant crowd of passers-by and tourists.\nHe has been in legal battles over security during visits to the UK, but there were lines of City of London police here seeing him safely away.\nHowever, there was also an inescapable sense of absence, with none of his royal relations there with him. \nThe headlines have become about who wasn\u2019t there, including his father and brother. \nThis felt very much like a solo mission.\nThe duke, who now lives in California, last saw the King in person shortly after his February announcement that he was being treated for an unspecified form of cancer.\nThe King has since returned to some public duties but is continuing to receive medical care.\nOn Wednesday he was seen removing his top hat and waving it in the air as a crowd greeted him by singing the national anthem at Buckingham Palace.\nPrince Harry is also not expected to meet the Prince or Princess of Wales - who is also being treated for cancer - while in the UK.\nOn Tuesday, a spokesperson for the duke said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\"The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\nOn Tuesday, the duke attended an Invictus Games summit in London, where he told delegates: \"Sometimes you... look back and go 'Look at what we've done'.\n\"But also given the state of the world, there is so much more to do and I think a lot of uncertainty - but what we've created is a global community.\"\nPrince Harry is not being joined by the Duchess of Sussex for this visit, but his wife is scheduled to meet him in Nigeria, where he is due to travel after his stop in London.\nThe couple were invited by Nigeria's chief of defence staff after they met at the Invictus Games held last year in Germany.\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis straight to your inbox every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

    "Hong Kong's government will be able to proceed with making a protest song illegal under the city's national security laws after winning a court challenge.\nThe High Court had last year rejected the government's request for Glory to Hong Kong to be banned, saying it would have \"chilling effects\" on free speech. \nBut on Wednesday an appeal court overturned that ruling.\nThe move is likely to deepen concerns about freedoms being further eroded in the city.\nAmnesty International said the government's ban was \"as ludicrous as it is dangerous\".\nThe US, meanwhile, said it was \"the latest blow to the international reputation\" of the city.\nIn the court's ruling on Wednesday, it said that the song can still be used for \"academic\" or \"news\" activities.\nBut its melodies and lyrics can not be broadcast, performed, shared or reproduced in any setting where the user intends to \"incite others to commit secession\" or is used \"with seditious intention\" against the Hong Kong government. Those convicted of breaching the ban on the anthem could face up to life imprisonment.\nIt is also illegal for people to use the song to advocate for Hong Kong's separation from China, and to present it as the anthem of the territory.\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokesman on Wednesday said banning the song was a \"necessary measure by (Hong Kong) to fulfil its responsibility of safeguarding national security\". \nAmnesty's China Director, Sarah Brooks said: \"Banning \u2018Glory to Hong Kong\u2019 not only represents a senseless attack on Hong Kongers\u2019 freedom of expression; it also violates international human rights law.\n\"Singing a protest song should never be a crime, nor is it a threat to \u2018national security\u2019.\"\nHong Kong is part of China, but has had some autonomy since the end of British rule in 1997. Campaigners say that democratic freedoms have been gradually eroded since then.\nThe song Glory to Hong Kong - sung in the territory's native dialect Cantonese - emerged during pro-democracy protests in 2019 against a controversial extradition law and later became the unofficial anthem of the movement.\nIts lyrics include lines such as \"Liberate Hong Kong\" and \"Revolution of our times. May people reign, proud and free, now and evermore. Glory be to thee Hong Kong\".\nWhile the new ban will specifically codify when the song's use is illegal, people in Hong Kong had already been punished under national security laws for playing it.\nIn 2022, a harmonica player was arrested for playing the song outside the British consulate in Hong Kong to mourn the death of Queen Elizabeth II.\nThe song has been banned in schools since 2020.\nOfficials had also petitioned internet giants like Google to remove the protest song from their search results and video platforms - something the sites refused to do.\nThe song has also at times been mistakenly played as the city's anthem at official events like international sporting matches, something that has angered authorities. \nOn Thursday, the appeal court said pursuing a ban on the song's use in political contexts fell within the remit of current national security laws.\nIt said that because it was hard to prosecute individual criminal acts, \"a more effective way to safeguard national security was to ask\" would be to ask internet platforms to \"stop facilitating the acts being carried out on their platforms\".

    "A Berlin senator and former mayor of the German capital has been attacked by a man in a local library in the latest of a spate of assaults on German politicians.\nFranziska Giffey, a well known figure in Germany's centre-left SPD, was briefly treated in hospital after she was hit on the head and neck with a bag \"filled with hard contents\",  police said.\nPoliticians and campaign workers have been targeted in recent days, especially in eastern Germany.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the attacks were \"outrageous and cowardly... Violence does not belong in a democratic debate\".\nLast Friday, a lead SPD candidate in next month's European elections was seriously hurt while putting up posters in Dresden.\nMatthias Ecke, 41, had to have surgery in hospital after he was attacked by four people. Four teenagers are currently under investigation and at least one has been linked to the far right.\nA campaign worker for the Greens in the city was beaten and kicked moments earlier.\nSeparately, a female Greens politician in Dresden also came under attack from two people while putting up posters on Tuesday evening.\nYvonne Mosler was pushed and spat on while she was out filming with a TV crew.\nDresden police said the two suspects, a man and a woman, had been part of a group that had been giving the Hitler salute when she began putting up election posters.\nColleagues reacted with shock to the attack on Franziska Giffey, Berlin's senator with responsibility for the economy. Ms Giffey served in Angela Merkel's last federal government as minister for women and families before becoming mayor of Berlin in 2021.\nMs Giffey wrote later on Instagram that she had visited the Alt-Rudow library in the Neuk\u00f6lln district of south-east Berlin because it was a special place for her: \"I would have never have thought it possible that I might come under attack there.\"\nThe Berlin ex-mayor said she was shocked at how people engaged in politics had increasingly become \"fair game\" for attack: \"There is no justification for these attacks. A boundary has been crossed and we as a society must resist it decisively.\"\nPolice said they had detained a 74-year-old man already known to them for \"state security and hate crimes\". Prosecutors said there were indications the man was suffering from \"a mental illness\" and were assessing whether he should be admitted into psychiatric care.\nBerlin centre-left senator Iris Spranger condemned the spate of assaults on all politicians and campaign workers, \"all of whom are committed to a robust democracy\".\nFederal and state interior ministers met on Tuesday to assess how to respond to the attacks.\nMichael St\u00fcbgen, the Brandenburg minister who chairs the conference of interior ministers, told reporters that criminal law no longer gave politicians and campaigners adequate protection.\n\"Unfortunately we have see this spiral for years, and this year we are dealing with a violent spiral of physical attacks on female and male politicians, which I'm extremely worried about,\" he told local radio in Berlin.\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is challenging for second place in European Parliament elections on 9 June, and hopes to become the dominant political party in state elections in eastern Germany in September.\nHowever, it has been hit by spying allegations, with an aide to its top EU candidate in custody.",
    "A man charged over the disappearance of three tourists on a surfing trip in Mexico confessed to killing them, a court has heard.\nAustralian brothers Jake and Callum Robinson and their American friend Jack Carter Rhoad disappeared on 27 April near Ensenada.\nKnown as \"El Kekas\", the suspect appeared in court on Wednesday on kidnapping charges, but officials say murder charges will soon be laid.\nHe is yet to enter a plea.\nBaja California state officials have said the three tourists - all in their early 30s - were probably killed while trying to stop the tyres of their pickup truck being stolen. \nTheir bodies were found dumped in a cliffside well six days after they disappeared, each with a gunshot to the head, according to local authorities. A fourth body was also found in the well but had been there longer and was unconnected to the case, they added.\nThe suspect, who can only be described under Mexican law by his first names, Jes\u00fas Gerardo, has been charged with \"forced disappearance\" and his girlfriend Ari Gisel and another man have been detained for their suspected involvement. Their surnames have been suppressed by the courts.\nDuring Wednesday's court appearance, prosecutors named Ari - who has not been charged over their disappearance - as one of their witnesses. \nThe court heard the 23-year-old told investigators Jes\u00fas had turned up at her house on 28 April, telling her he had done something to \"three gringos\".\nShe asked what he meant, to which he replied \"I killed them\", the hearing was told.\nHe then showed her he had fitted out her car with new tyres, that were allegedly stolen from the slain surfers, prosecutors alleged.\nThey also told the court they believed other people were involved in the killings.\nEarlier this week, Jake and Callum Robinson's parents travelled from Perth to Mexico to identify their bodies.\nIn an emotional tribute on Tuesday, Debra Robinson said: \"Now it's time to bring them home to family and friends and the ocean waves in Australia.\"\nThe killings have sparked fear and anger in Baja California.\nIt is one of Mexico's most violent states, as local drug gangs fight turf wars.\nBut the Ensenada area, about 120km (75 miles) south of the US-Mexico border and known for its surfing conditions, is considered safer and has long attracted tourists from California.\nScores of protesters marched through the city on Sunday, carrying surfboards plastered with slogans demanding safe beaches. \nA group of surfers later performed a \"paddle-out\" ceremony, an ocean vigil to honour the trio.",
    "Walt Disney and Warner Bros Discovery say they will start to offer a bundle of the Disney+, Hulu and Max streaming services to customers in the US this summer.\nThe new package will be available to customers on all three streaming platforms.\nThe media giants said they will offer plans with and without adverts but did not reveal how much they will charge customers.\nThe move comes as Disney and Warner Bros face competition from rivals, including Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.\n\u201cThis new offering... will help drive incremental subscribers and much stronger retention,\u201d Warner Bros Discovery executive JB Perrette said in a statement.\nThe two media companies said they will reveal more details about the plans in the coming weeks.\nAs audiences move away from traditional TV, companies like Disney and Warner Bros are under pressure to attract more subscribers to their streaming services.\nThe companies will be hoping that their combined offering will complement each other.\nDisney+ is best known for its family-friendly shows and films, while Warner's Max is home to HBO and its more adult-focussed content.\nIn recent years, streaming companies have been joining forces and offering combinations of their services.\nIn February, Walt Disney's ESPN, Fox Corp and Warner Bros Discovery announced a new sports platform to be launched in the autumn.\nBetween them they own a wide range of portfolios of sports rights including those for the FIFA World Cup, Formula 1, NFL, NBA and Major League Baseball.\nIn its quarterly financial results released on Tuesday, Disney said that Disney+ had gained more than six million subscribers globally between January and March, excluding India. The streaming service now has more than 117 million subscribers.\nThe increase is important for a service that has seen growth flag in recent months but is viewed as critical to Disney's future.\nDisney also told investors that a planned password crackdown, which will start in the summer, should help drive up subscriber numbers.\nThe increasingly crowded streaming market has put off some customers who have complained about having to sign up to multiple services.\nBundles can address this issue by simplifying payment and potentially lowering the cost to users.",
    "Police arrested 33 people at George Washington University (GW) early Wednesday after officers moved to clear a pro-Palestinian encampment on campus.\nWashington DC police told the BBC that protestors were arrested for assaults on a police officer and unlawful entry. \nUniversity students had been inside the encampment since 25 April. \nHouse Republicans cancelled scheduled testimony by Mayor Muriel Bowser following the arrests after pressuring DC officials to clear the protests.\nThe police operation came a week after six Republican members of the House of Representatives Oversight Committee visited the GW protest encampment and called on officials to arrest protesters involved.\nWednesday's move to clear the encampment was made ahead of a planned appearance by Ms Bowser and Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith before the House Oversight Committee on the city's handling of the unrest.\nIn a statement, the Chair of the House Oversight Committee, Republican Representative James Comer, announced that appearance was being cancelled and said he was \"pleased that the potential Oversight hearing led to swift action by Mayor Bowser\". \nAccording to a report on the arrests by GW Hatchet, the university's independent student-run newspaper: \"Officers gave their third and final warning to demonstrators to move at about 03:30 local time, saying all who remained in U-Yard and the stretch of H Street in front of the plaza would be arrested.\"\nThe newspaper reported that some protestors who refused to leave were pepper sprayed by police.\nIn a statement, the university said police \"conducted an orderly and safe operation to disperse the demonstrators from the illegal encampment on the GW's University Yard\". \nThey added there were no reports of serious injuries during the arrests.\nPreviously, despite GW's efforts to offer an alternative protest site, the encampment remained. \nUniversity officials say they are unsure how many of the demonstrators were students. \n\"While the university is committed to protecting students' rights to free expression, the encampment had evolved into an unlawful activity, with participants in direct violation of multiple university policies and city regulations,\" a previous GW statement said.\nTensions had grown in recent days after police removed a large Palestinian flag that demonstrators had raised above a campus building. The university called the flag's hoisting an \"aggressive act of lawlessness\". \nMetro Police told the BBC there has been \"a gradual escalation in the volatility\" of the protest and, as a result, officers moved in.\n\"Therefore, this morning, working closely with the GW administration and police, MPD moved to disperse the demonstrators from the GW campus and surrounding streets,\" the statement added. \nGW said it remains open and operating as normal, but additional security personnel have been deployed to University Yard and the surrounding area.\nThe yard will remain closed until the end of commencement ceremonies on 19 May, the university added.\nThere have been heated demonstrations at a number of universities across the country against the war in Gaza. \nSince the 7 October attack by Hamas and Israel's retaliatory assault, students have launched rallies, sit-ins, fasts and, most recently, encampments against the war.\nAccording to a BBC tally, there have been pro-Palestine protests at 45 states and Washington DC since the demonstrations started at Columbia University in New York on 17 April.\nThey are demanding that their schools, many with massive endowments, financially divest from Israel. \nMany also want their universities to end academic relationships with Israeli institutions.\nPreviously, President Joe Biden said people had the right to protest but not the right to cause chaos.\nBut, Mr Biden warned on Tuesday the threat of antisemitism is growing in the US, including on college campuses, joining a heated American debate about Jewish security, Zionism, free speech and support for Israel, in the country with the largest Jewish population after Israel.\nAddressing a bipartisan audience at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual commemoration, Mr Biden said: \"This hatred (of Jews) continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness,\" Biden said.\n\"Now here we are, not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later, and people are already forgetting ... that Hamas unleashed this terror,\" he added. \n\"I have not forgotten, nor have you. And we will not forget.\"",
    "A Georgia appeals court has agreed to review a lower court ruling that kept District Attorney Fani Willis on Donald Trump's election subversion case. \nThe former president has tried to have Ms Willis removed from the case, arguing her romantic relationship with another prosecutor created a conflict. \nSuperior Court Judge Scot McAfee last month found no conflict of interest but allowed for his ruling to be appealed.\nThis latest development is expected to delay the start of trial.\nNo date had yet been set for it to begin, but the appeal makes it increasingly likely that the trial will take place after November's presidential elections.  Mr Trump is the presumptive Republican standard-bearer. \nMr Trump and 18 others are being prosecuted in Georgia for conspiracy to overturn the state's 2020 election results, which they deny.\nThe case was nearly upended after one of the co-defendants, Michael Roman, claimed that Ms Willis - the Fulton County District Attorney overseeing the case - was improperly benefitting from a romantic relationship with lead prosecutor Nathan Wade.\nSeveral of Mr Roman's co-defendants, including Mr Trump, joined the motion to have Ms Willis disqualified and the charges dismissed.\nOver several tense days in court in February, Ms Willis admitted she had had relationship with Mr Wade but denied that she had benefitted financially.\nJudge McAfee ultimately found in March that Ms Willis had a \"serious lapse in judgment\" and that the relationship damaged the case with the \"appearance of impropriety\". But he ruled the case could continue with Ms Willis as long as Mr Wade resigned. He stepped down soon after. \nProsecutors had asked the Georgia court of appeals not to hear arguments on Mr McAfee's ruling, but their request was unsuccessful. \nMr Trump now has 10 days to file a notice of appeal. Once the appeal court makes its decision, either side could appeal again and bring the case to the Georgia Supreme Court. \nIn a statement to US media, Mr Trump's lead attorney in Georgia said the former president \"looks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution\".\nThe Fulton County district attorney's office did not respond to a request for comment. \nThe Georgia election interference case is one of four criminal cases Mr Trump faces. \nThree are unlikely to take place before the November elections.  The fourth - a criminal hush-money trial  - is currently underway in New York. \nOn Tuesday, a judge in Florida indefinitely postponed Mr Trump's classified documents case there, cancelling the planned 20 May start date.

    "A \"nationwide issue\" which caused huge delays at passport e-gates has been resolved, the Home Office has said. \nMajor UK airports including Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester and Edinburgh all confirmed a Border Force problem was causing delays with arrivals late on Tuesday.\nPictures and videos on social media showed long queues.\nOne passenger told the BBC he spent longer queuing for passport control than he did on his flight from Lisbon.\nE-gates are automated gates that use facial recognition to check a person's identity and allow them to enter the country without talking to a Border Force officer. \nThere are more than 270 of them in place at 15 air and rail ports in the UK, according to the government's website, which also says they are supposed to \"enable quicker travel into the UK\".\nDue to the outage, staff were left manually processing passengers instead.\nAffected airports included London Stansted, Birmingham, Bristol, and Newcastle.\nThe Home Office, which oversees Border Force, said in a statement early on Wednesday: \"eGates at UK airports came back online shortly after midnight.\"\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said the problems were caused by a \"system network issue\" and were first reported around 19:50BST, meaning the issues persisted for more than four hours. \nThey added that \"at no point was border security compromised, and there is no indication of malicious cyber activity\".\nThey extended apologies to \"travellers caught up in disruption\" and thanked \"partners, including airlines for their co-operation and support\" during the outage.\nHowever, the problem did not appear to not just be affecting the e-gates themselves, as Belfast International Airport, which does not have them, said the Border Force \"systems\" had been impacted.\nBy Wednesday morning, most flights at airports across the UK were shown to be departing and arriving on time.\nSteven Brownrigg, who arrived on a flight into Manchester Airport, told the BBC there were \"several flights in quick succession, which meant a lot of passengers\" queueing for passport control.\n\"I was in the queue for around 90 minutes. Priority was given to families with small children and vulnerable passengers, and staff were handing out bottled water to everyone,\" he said.\n\"Generally, most were frustrated but accepted the situation, but a few people were unhappy and questioned staff.\"\nA passenger at Heathrow described border officials rushing to manually process passport holders.\n\"All the e-gates were totally blank and there was just a lot of chaotic scenes,\" said Sam Morter, 32, who was returning after a holiday in Sri Lanka.\nHe said he made it through the airport after about 90 minutes.\nSamira, who had arrived from Spain, said people were distressed and \"everyone was arguing\", while Julian, who had flown in from Lisbon, said: \"I've spent longer in the terminal than I did in the air.\"\nDennis Marsh was among the first people affected, and said he saw the e-gates go from green to red.\n\"It wasn't just e-gates mind you. All manual checking procedures failed too,\" he said. \n\"We were given water and were so lucky being right at the front. \n\"We waited about 40 minutes, so not too bad but thousands were arriving behind us.\"\nManchester Airport said any excess charges for people who are late to leave car parks as a result of the problems would also be waived.\nTuesday is not the first time the UK's automated e-gates have stopped working. Airports were also impacted by an IT issue in May 2023.\nSeparately, in August last year, around 2,000 flights at airports across the UK were cancelled when the National Air Traffic Services system for automatically processing flight plans failed, leaving passengers stranded.\nAdditional reporting by Nicky Schiller\nAre you affected by the issues raised in this story?

    "US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr says he is in \"robust health\" following reports that he suffered from a brain parasite more than a decade ago.\nThe New York Times reported that Mr Kennedy also previously suffered from mercury poisoning and heart problems.\nMr Kennedy has made health a key part of his campaign. \nHe has contrasted his physical fitness with that of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. \n\"Questioning Mr Kennedy's health is a hilarious suggestion, given his competition,\" his campaign said in a statement Wednesday.\n\"Mr Kennedy travelled extensively in Africa, South America, and Asia in his work as an environmental advocate, and in one of those locations contracted a parasite,\" the campaign said. \n\"The issue was resolved more than 10 years ago, and he is in robust physical and mental health.\" \nThe New York Times report, based on a divorce deposition, said that in 2010 Mr Kennedy experienced severe memory loss and brain fog. \nHe sought treatment and said in the deposition two years later that a doctor told him the issues could be \"caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died\".\nWorms do not eat brain tissue, experts say, but the idea is a non-medical or layman's understanding of what parasites might do if they enter the central nervous system.\nDr Philip Budge, an associate professor of infectious diseases at the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, said that parasite larvae can migrate to the brain and create cysts, in a condition known as neurocysticercosis.\n\"The cysts don't absorb any brain tissue, they simply create a space for the parasite to live,\" potentially pushing aside small parts of the brain, Dr Budge said.\n\"The cysts can occur in many places in the body. They usually don't cause any trouble unless they are in the brain,\" he said. \nAnd the effects of brain parasites depend on where they end up: \"It's like real estate: it's all about location location location.\"\n\"I'm unaware of any examples where a parasite affected cognition,\" said Dr Arnab Chatterjee, vice president of medicinal chemistry at the Center for Antiviral Medicines and Pandemic Preparedness in La Jolla, California. \nNeither Dr Budge nor Dr Chatterjee have treated Mr Kennedy or have any specific knowledge of his health history.\nHowever, Dr Chatterjee noted that another condition that RFK Jr reported suffering - mercury poisoning - does have a strong link to neurological problems. \nIn the deposition, Mr Kennedy also said he had elevated levels of mercury in his blood due to a diet heavy in tuna fish. He reduced his fish intake and underwent treatment for the condition. \nAfter a career as an environmental lawyer, Mr Kennedy rose to prominence as the head of anti-vaccine organisation Children's Health Defense, formerly known as the World Mercury Project.\nMr Kennedy, 70, frequently talks about health on the campaign trail and has tried to contrast himself with Mr Biden, 81, and Mr Trump, 77. \nHowever, the member of America's most famous political family has suffered from a variety of other health problems. \nHe is a former heroin addict and contracted hepatitis C from intravenous drug use, and has suffered from atrial fibrillation, a type of abnormal heartbeat. \nThe condition has put him in hospital at least four times, he told the New York Times, although he says has not had an episode for a decade.\nHe also has a noticeably strained, raspy voice caused by spasmodic dysphonia, a disorder that causes involuntary spasms in the muscles of the voice box. \nOn social media, he responded to the reports of his parasite by writing: \"I offer to eat 5 more brain worms and still beat President Trump and President Biden in a debate.\"\nAlthough Mr Kennedy is mounting the most popular third-party or independent challenge in decades and could swing the result, polls show him trailing far behind the front-runners.

    "When former prime minister Imran Khan was dragged out of a court house by police on charges of corruption on 9 May 2023, the reaction was unlike anything seen in Pakistan before. \nEnraged supporters took to the streets in cities across the country and buildings belonging to Pakistan's powerful military became the target - a shock to the institution widely known locally as the establishment.\n\"When he was arrested, our hearts sank. We were crying and didn't know what to do,\" said Hasan, who cycled to a central market in Lahore where Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party had often gathered.\nThe residence of a lieutenant general in the city had already been set ablaze by then.\nOn the streets of the capital Islamabad, where Khan was arrested, protesters pulled down street signs, lit fires and threw stones. Scores of military monuments were vandalised.\nThe military, which has long held sway over governance in the Muslim majority country, swiftly labelled 9 May 2023 a \"Black Day\". They have also described the protests as an \"attack on the army\". \nOne year on, many supporters of the former cricket star are still reeling from the physical and emotional wounds of the day's events. \nHasan was among hundreds arrested for their involvement in the protests. Many of them told BBC Urdu they took to the streets \"peacefully\" and were not involved in the violence, but were nevertheless held without due process and mistreated while in detention.\n\n\nHasan said he joined the protests \"because I felt that what happened to Imran Khan was wrong... We were telling the police, 'Today, you have crossed the red line', he said. \n\"Many Pakistanis have an emotional connection with Khan Sahib,\" he said, using a local term or respect. \"He is like a brother, like a father, to us.\" \nAbrar, another supporter who took to the streets after Khan's arrest, recalled that he left his house in Lahore \"immediately\" after seeing footage of Khan's arrest last May, as he felt his \"leader should not have been humiliated in this way\". \nKhan is a cricketing icon in a country where the sport enjoys almost fanatical support. He brought glory to the country as captain when he led the national team to World Cup victory in 1992. Many Pakistanis have grown up idolising him. \nBut critics argue that Mr Khan had the backing of the army during his rise to power, an allegation both sides reject. The military has heavily influenced Pakistan for most of its existence and is a crucial behind-the-scenes player in the country's politics.\nHe was elected PM in July 2018 but ousted in a parliamentary vote of no-confidence four years later. Shortly before general elections this February he was given several criminal convictions, barring him from standing. He is battling scores of legal cases, including charges for corruption and terrorism, but continues to be a powerful force dividing Pakistan.\nDuring the February elections, his party, which had been denied its election symbol and a united platform, was forced to run candidates as independents, who then emerged as the single largest bloc in a shock result. However, they fell short of the majority needed to form a government.\nAt least 10 people were killed and hundreds wounded during the 9 May protests, which authorities also said resulted in losses of 2.5 billion rupees ($9m; \u00a37.2m).\nThe crackdown after was effective and harsh. Protesters who were jailed have spoken of abuse and despair. \n\"Sometimes the prison felt more like a graveyard. Like how we recite prayers at the graves of our loved ones, perhaps our families were reciting the same prayers when they came to meet us,\" said Abrar, who was released early this year after spending nine months in jail.\n\"My daughter would be crying and I could not wipe her tears,\u201d he added.\nIntizar, a fellow protester who was detained, told BBC Urdu prison officials \"treated us as if we were terrorists, not Pakistanis\".\n\"I told them I only protested and did not vandalise,\" he said.\nHe turned himself into police after they went after his family and broke the gate of his house in an attempt to locate him. \n\"I don't think we can ever describe what we and our families endured.\"\n\nFormer interior minister Rana Sanaullah said the events of 9 May 2023 were but a continuation of the PTI's protests in the past.\n\u201cThe atmosphere had been created because the PTI founder was determined to prove itself more powerful than the state,\u201d he said, referring to Imran Khan.\n\"How can anyone say that 'If I am arrested, it will be crossing a red line'? This is like a rebellion.\"\nWhile a year has passed, political watchers say Pakistan will not be able to move on until the grievances of the protesters are addressed.\n\"I feel the state has only been venting its anger on this matter, as if trying to take revenge, instead of investigating it,\" said journalist Benazir Shah, who reported on the protests.\nMs Shah urged authorities to launch an investigation and make clear the roles of everyone involved.\n\"We will not be a",
    "Fighting and bombardment continued on the outskirts of the southern Gaza city of Rafah as Israel said the key Kerem Shalom crossing had reopened for aid. \nThe Israeli military said troops had killed Hamas fighters in eastern Rafah as part of a \"precise\" counterterrorism operation. Hamas also reported battles.\nEarlier, the military said lorries had reached Kerem Shalom, which was closed after a Hamas rocket attack on Sunday.\nBut the UN says no supplies have passed through the crossing yet.\nThe US said that while the crossing was open again, aid could not get through \"because of logistical and security concerns\" on the ground. \nThe UN had expressed alarm on Tuesday over what it called Israel's \"choking-off\" of Gaza's two main aid arteries, after Israeli troops took full control of the Palestinian side of the nearby Rafah crossing with Egypt.\nThe closing of the Rafah crossing is of particular concern because of the consequences for fuel deliveries - the UN says all of its fuel enters there.\n\"Without fuel, trucks cannot move critical humanitarian assistance, water pumps will stop functioning and the remaining hospitals will shut down,\" Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, wrote on social media on Wednesday.\nWorld Health Organization head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that hospitals in the south of Gaza had only three days of fuel left.\nPlumes of smoke from Israeli air strikes were seen over Rafah and heavy gunfire was heard on Wednesday, as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops were continuing a limited offensive in eastern areas.\nResidents of Rafah reported intense bombardment overnight and video footage on Wednesday morning showed people searching through the rubble of a building destroyed in one of the strikes.\n\"We are in a safe area according to the army's map - an area without operations,\" neighbour Reda al-Najili told Reuters news agency.\n\"We were sitting when suddenly the explosion happened. Our neighbour's house was gone, and our house was all damaged internally. In the house there are only civilians. Women died. Those who were injured were all children.\"\nPalestinian medics also said seven members of one family, including five children, were killed in an overnight strike on a home in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City, in the north of the territory.\nAn IDF statement issued on Wednesday morning said they had \"eliminated terrorists and uncovered terrorist infrastructure, as well as underground shafts in several locations\" during several encounters over the previous day. They were also carrying out raids on the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing, it added.\nThe IDF also said aircraft had struck more than 100 \"terror targets\" throughout Gaza over the same period.\nSeven months into its war with Hamas in Gaza, Israel has insisted victory is impossible without taking Rafah. \nBut with more than a million displaced Palestinians taking refuge there from the fighting elsewhere, the UN and Western powers have warned that an all-out assault could have devastating humanitarian consequences.\nNegotiations on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal have resumed in Cairo, with the US saying it believes a revised Hamas proposal could lead to a breakthrough.\nThe Israeli military played down the significance of the US government's decision to halt a shipment of powerful bombs over concerns that Israel was about to launch a major offensive on Rafah city.\nHowever, US President Joe Biden later warned that  the US would stop supplying some weapons if Israel launched a major ground operation in Rafah.\nThe Israeli military has ordered the evacuation of an estimated 100,000 residents and displaced people in a number of eastern neighbourhoods and told them they will find field hospitals, tents and aid in an \"expanded humanitarian area\", which stretches north from al-Mawasi to the city of Khan Younis and central town of Deir al-Balah.\nMeanwhile, the director general of the World Health Organization said one of the three hospitals in Rafah, al-Najjar, was \"no longer functioning due to the ongoing hostilities in its vicinity and the military operation in Rafah\".\nDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also warned that the partially functioning Kuwaiti and Emirati hospitals would soon run out of fuel unless the UN received a delivery. \"Hospitals in the south of Gaza only have three days of fuel left, which means services may soon come to a halt,\" he added. \nThe WHO has also said the European Gaza hospital in Khan Younis, where critical patients from Rafah are referred, may also become unreachable. \nA displaced man sheltering at the hospital told BBC Arabic's Gaza Today programme that life was very difficult for him.\n\"I suffer from diabetes, high blood pressure, and osteoarthritis - a matter which means the displacement causes a great deal of suffering for me,\" he said. \"We hope to return to our land in Gaza and that everyone will set up a tent in the place of his home and settle back there.\"\n",
    "A man who was injured when an attacker burst into his Hainault home has told the BBC it is a \"miracle\" he and his family were not killed.\nHenry De Los Rios Polania, his wife and four-year-old daughter were sleeping when a man brandishing a sword broke into their home on 30 April.\nThe 35-year-old suffered serious hand injuries as he fought off the intruder.\nFour other people were attacked in the area, including Daniel Anjorin, 14, who died of his injuries. \nMr Los Rios Polania said he and his wife had fallen asleep watching TV on an \"ordinary\" night and opened their eyes the following morning to find a man with a sword standing in front of them.\nHe said: \"I thought I was going to die... even my wife and child. We thought we were going to die that morning.\"\nIn his first interview since the attack, he said: \"I believe a miracle happened in that room.\"\nHe recounted the moment he looked around for something to protect himself from the sword with, only to find \"pillows and teddy bears\".\nMr Los Rios Polania made it clear he could not go into further detail about what happened in the bedroom, because he did not want to jeopardise the police investigation.\nHis wife and child were not injured, but he fears his daughter will suffer from the trauma she experienced and could suffer flashbacks in the future. \"I just hope she doesn't remember anything,\" he said.\nMr Los Rios Polania was released from hospital on Wednesday but will need to return for further surgeries due to the severity of his injuries.\nHe underwent almost 10 hours of surgery to reconstruct tendon and veins, as surgeons battled to save his hand.\nOn the day he spoke to the BBC, doctors had given him the news a finger they feared might be lost would recover.\nMr Los Rios Polania's sister said last week that she believed he was a hero for protecting his family. He became tearful as he accepted there was truth in this.\n\"I protected my family... I will do everything for my family,\" he said. \nThe 35-year-old thanked paramedics, police and doctors who \"came forward\" to help, and said they had all done a \"great job\". He added that he wanted to \"thank God for keeping me alive\".\nAmong others injured on the same morning was Daniel Anjorin, 14. He was attacked a short distance from his home and later died of his injuries.\nMr Los Rios Polania told the BBC: \"I feel so sorry for his family... When I got close to the ambulance, I saw him on the floor... It shouldn't have happened.\"\nThree other people - including two police officers - were also seriously injured.\nA man has been charged with murder and is due to go on trial in February.\nIt has been little more than a week since the Hainault attack and Mr Los Rios Polania told the BBC he was still coming to terms with the \"nightmare\".\nHe has not yet returned to his home, and fears he and his family will never be able to face going back and will need to look for somewhere else to live.\n\"The local community, they've been supportive but we just need to find a way out, try to start over again,\" he said.\n\"We need to continue with our lives. All I know is that the next house I'm going to get into, I'll just make it really safe. I don't want anyone to come from the outside. \"\nOn Saturday, Daniel's parents issued a statement paying tribute to their \"loved and amazing son\".\nThey said: \"We as a family are devastated by the loss of our beloved son Daniel. It is difficult for us at this time to process what has happened to him and that he will never come home. Daniel had left the house for school and then he was gone.\n\"Our children have lost their loving and precious brother and we have lost the most loved and amazing son.\"",
    "Balaram Bhallavi and his family might finally get a proper roof over their heads. \nFor years, a tiled shanty in a sun-drenched village in India's central Madhya Pradesh state has been home to Mr Bhallavi, his wife, and their four school-going children. A strip of a mud-floored foyer packs in a kitchen, a few plastic chairs, two rope beds and fraying clotheslines. \nAfter a three-year wait, the Bhallavi family received 120,000 rupees ($1,445; \u00a31,136) from a programme run by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government last year, allowing them to start building a new home. \nMore than 25 million homes have been built since 2016 under the rural public housing programme, called the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Prime Minister's Housing Scheme). It is one of the more than 300 federal schemes that Mr Modi is leaning on to bolster support for his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) during the general election as he eyes a record-equalling third term in office.   \n\"Life is tough. But I am grateful to get money from the government to build my first house,\" Mr Bhallavi, 42, said.\nAfter coming to power in 2014, Mr Modi has expanded India's welfare programmes, targeting women and farmers in particular. This includes providing cooking gas, free grain, houses, toilets, piped water, electricity and bank accounts, and beefing up a long-running jobs guarantee programme. \nMany benefits - pensions, subsidies, loans and scholarships - are delivered through cash transfers to bank accounts linked to biometric identity cards held by over a billion Indians. Giant posters of Mr Modi promoting these schemes as his personal \"guarantees\" dominate the landscape.\nMr Modi says his government has spent more than 34 trillion rupees ($400bn; \u00a3316bn) in the past decade, delivering direct cash benefits to low-income households and reaching over 900 million people. A yearly handout of 6,000 rupees to more than 110 million farmers constitutes one of the world's largest cash transfer programmes. The transfers, officials claim, have cut corruption and slashed costs.   \nEconomist Arvind Subramanian calls this Mr Modi's \"New Welfarism\", funding essential private items like toilets, rather than expanding public goods such as primary education and healthcare.\nTo be sure, \"New Welfarism\" stands apart from the traditional welfare models in Europe or the US. \nWhile the US tends to favour smaller government and lower taxes, resulting in modest social transfers, European welfare states have been more generous. Social democracies such as those in Scandinavia have favoured higher social spending, supported by higher taxes. \nFollowing Mr Modi's cue, all parties in India have caught what Devesh Kapur of Johns Hopkins University calls the \"virus of cash transfers with numerous schemes across states and political parties\". \nThe country's state governments now operate more than 2,000 cash transfer programmes. \"Every party in India knows that welfare matters for votes,\" says Mr Kapur.\nOn a recent balmy morning in Bishnupur in West Bengal state, more than a hundred men, women and children gathered under a blue-and-white tent in a school courtyard. The event had a festive air about it.\nExcept this was a welfare delivery camp organised by the ruling Trinamool Congress party, led by Mamata Banerjee, a charismatic regional leader who has so far repelled Mr Modi's BJP in the eastern state, home to over 100 million people.\nServing her third term, Ms Banerjee has prioritised welfare initiatives, running some three dozen schemes. These include free bicycles to get to school, scholarships for girls, financial aid, pensions for women, the elderly and the disabled, alongside universal health insurance. \n\"We are giving welfare benefits here from birth to death,\" Naziruddin Sarkar, a senior district official, said. \nTo ease the burden of travelling to distant government offices and dealing with unhelpful officials, Ms Banerjee's government operates a benefits outreach programme called 'Duare Sarkar', meaning 'government at your doorstep'. In the last three years alone, over 100 million people have registered for welfare benefits across different schemes at more than 650,000 such camps in 23 districts, according to official data.\nThe camp in Bishnupur offers a snapshot of the livelihoods of beneficiaries. \nShobha Mondal says she is using her widow's pension to send her son to school. Monika Tithi uses three separate pensions - as a farmer, tribesperson and woman - to run a village grocery. Dipali Mondal, another widow, uses her pension to make and sell street-side snacks.\n\"When old or widowed women get money, they are respected more in their household. Pensions give them dignity,\" Choten Dhendup Lama, a senior official, said.  \nHundreds of miles away in the coastal city of Visakhapatnam in southern India's Andhra Pradesh state, Y Laxmi pins her hopes on welfare to secure a brighter future for her children.\nShe lives with her deaf and speech-impaired husband, their two school-going sons, and ",
    "John Swinney has been sworn in today as Scotland\u2019s first minister, the seventh person to fill that role. \nHowever, he has not only taken on responsibility for leading the country\u2019s devolved government, he has also taken on the job of his party\u2019s leader - with a Westminster election probably no more than six months away.\nGoverning Scotland is not easy at a time when public services are under pressure and the economy is flatlining. \nBut turning around the SNP\u2019s fortunes could prove an even more demanding task.\nWhen Humza Yousaf decided to throw the Greens out of the government, polls of voting intention for Westminster were on average putting the SNP on just 33%.\nThat meant the party was only neck-and-neck with Labour in terms of votes \u2013 an outcome that, because of the greater geographical concentration of its vote, would most likely result in Labour winning most seats.\nThat 33% figure represents no less than a 10-point drop in the party\u2019s rating compared with where it stood when Nicola Sturgeon announced her intention to resign in February last year. \nThat decision triggered what has proven to be a calamitous year for the SNP.\nBy March this year only 29% were telling Ipsos that they regarded Mr Yousaf favourably, while 45% looked on him unfavourably. \nBy last autumn Savanta were reporting that over half felt the party was not united. \nAnd shortly before Mr Yousaf\u2019s fateful decision to oust the Greens, rather more were telling Redfield & Wilton they thought the SNP government was incompetent (37%) than said it was competent (30%).\nEven many of those who voted for the SNP in 2019 had their doubts. Almost as many said the party was not united (43%) as said that it was (47%). Less than half (45%) reckon the SNP government is competent.\nMeanwhile, the fallout from the departure of the Greens has done nothing to improve the party\u2019s standing. \nTwo polls conducted since then, but before it became clear Mr Swinney would become leader without a contest, put the SNP behind Labour.\nEqually, YouGov were now reporting that 67% believed that Mr Yousaf was doing badly as first minister, up from 45% last September. As many as 60% now regarded him unfavourably.\nBut in bringing down Mr Yousaf the opposition parties have potentially given the SNP an opportunity to repair some of the damage of the last 12 months.\nCertainly, Mr Swinney starts his job with rather better polling numbers than his predecessor. \nOnly 40% feel unfavourably about him, 20 points lower than the equivalent figure for Mr Yousaf. \nAccording to Ipsos 37% feel Mr Swinney will do a good job as first minister, only 23% a bad one. \nAnd Panelbase say that among those who voted SNP in 2019, 28% reckon they are more likely to vote SNP with Mr Swinney at the helm - over twice the proportion (13%) who take the opposite view.\nHowever, whether Mr Swinney can seize the opportunity he seems to have remains to be seen.\nHe would appear to have a good chance of being able to make his party seem less divided.  The lack of a contest for the leadership will help for a start. And Mr Swinney is widely respected within his party.\nMeanwhile, much of the open criticism of Mr Yousaf\u2019s regime came from those associated with Kate Forbes, who was narrowly defeated by Mr Yousaf in last year\u2019s ballot.  \nShe is now part of Mr Swinney\u2019s new government. So perhaps the noises off will die down.\nAnd there is also an easily identifiable body of voters for Mr Swinney to target  \u2013 those who have become disenchanted with the SNP but who still believe in independence.\nPanelbase have reported that only just over half (56%) of those who would vote Yes in an independence referendum are currently minded to vote SNP for Westminster. As many as 21% say they would vote Labour.\nBut the key question is whether Mr Swinney can find the persuasive arguments and engaging style needed to bring these voters back into the SNP fold. \nThis was the aspect of the job of party leader that Mr Swinney found more difficult when he was previously leader 20 years ago.\nMr Swinney says he is a changed man. The SNP have to hope this means he can now change their fortunes.\nSir John Curtice is professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde and senior research fellow at the Scottish Centre for Social Research and \u2018The UK in a Changing Europe\u2019.

    "Ambassadors from EU member states have agreed in principle to seize windfall profits from frozen Russian assets to finance arms supplies to Kyiv.\nIn the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, EU countries froze hundreds of billions of euros worth of assets. \nIf the decision is approved at a gathering of EU finance ministers next Tuesday, the interest - worth up to \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.5bn) per year - will be used to buy weapons for Ukraine.\nThe European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \"There could be no stronger symbol and no greater use for that money than to make Ukraine and all of Europe a safer place to live.\"\nEuropean Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis also welcomed the decision.\nHe said the funds would have to get to Ukraine as soon as possible, with the first \u20ac1bn tranche - to be used \"mainly for military support\" - ideally reaching the country by summer.\n\"Russia will pay directly for its crimes,\" Mr Dombrovskis said.  \nEarlier this week, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said around 90% of revenues from frozen Russian should be spent on arms purchases for Ukraine.\nThe value of frozen Russian assets in the EU alone is estimated to be almost \u20ac211bn (\u00a3181bn). \nThe majority of the profits from the assets are currently being held in Euroclear, a Belgium-based clearing house.\nThe expropriation of the profits has been a topic of discussion among EU officials and heads of state since the start of the war.\nHowever, the cash had so far not been used because EU members had objected to a 25% tax imposed under Belgian law. Belgium has now agreed to waive the tax. \nEurope's central bankers were also long sceptical about potentially setting a difficult legal precedent that could undermine global financial stability - as well as putting off other countries from placing their safe haven assets in the West.\nThe Kremlin has previously said that seizing the interest made on frozen Russian assets was a move towards the \"destruction of the legal foundations of European law and international law\".",
    "The high-profile trial of a Canadian man accused of murdering four indigenous women two years ago has opened in Winnipeg, Manitoba.\nJeremy Skibicki has pleaded not guilty to four first-degree murder charges.\nIn an unexpected development on Monday, his lawyers said their client has admitted the killings but will argue he is not criminally responsible due to a mental disorder. \nFamilies of the victims say they want him held responsible for the murders. \nCaution: This article contains upsetting content.\nJeremy Skibicki's victims - Morgan Harris, 39, Marcedes Myran, 26, Rebecca Contois, 24, and a fourth unidentified woman who has been given the name Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman - are all First Nations women. \nProsecutors accuse the Winnipeg native, who is in his mid-30s, of taking the women home and sexually assaulting them before murdering them between March and May of 2022. \nHe was arrested that same year, after the remains of Ms Contois were discovered in a garbage bin and at a local landfill. \nPolice believe the bodies of Ms Harris and Ms Myran were disposed of at a separate landfill north of the city. Their remains have yet to be found. \nThe location of the remains of the fourth victim - Buffalo Woman - is unknown. \nCrown prosecutors have agreed the trial, which was originally scheduled to be before a jury, can be heard by a judge alone. \nAn earlier request by Jeremy Skibicki's lawyers to not have a jury was initially denied, but on Monday the trial judge accepted their request after the defence said it was now seeking a not criminally responsible verdict.\nJurors who had already been selected in late April to hear the case are expected to be officially dismissed on Wednesday morning.\nThe trial is expected to continue through early June.\nExperts say the trial's focus will likely shift given the suspect's not guilty plea on the basis of mental illness.\nBrandon Trask, a law professor at the University of Manitoba, told the BBC on Wednesday that typically, murder trials are about proving the accused's guilt. In this case, the onus will be on the defence to prove that the suspect suffers from \"a disease of the mind that rendered him incapable of appreciating the nature of his actions\".\n\"That's very much an uphill battle for the defence in this case, where you've got multiple victims spread out over a period of time,\" Mr Trask said.\nIf the suspect is successful in proving he is not criminally responsible, he would spend time in a forensic hospital setting rather than behind bars, and would be subject to annual hearings that would determine the level of freedoms that can be afforded to him moving forward.\nThe killings of the four women sparked an outcry in Canada, where a disproportionate number of indigenous women and girls are murdered or go missing. \nIn 2014, the federal statistics agency reported that indigenous women are six times more likely to be the victim of a homicide than non-indigenous women.\nThe case has also remained in the news as the families of the victims have fought to pressure the government to authorise and pay for the search the Prairie Green landfill, where the remains of Ms Myran and Ms Harris are believed to be.\nInitially, the provincial Manitoba government refused, citing the challenges of finding the remains, the cost, and concerns for worker safety given the presence of hazardous chemicals at the site.\nBut the province shifted course after a change in government saw the election of Premier Wab Kinew, who is indigenous. \nA search will likely start later this year after the province and Ottawa set aside a combined C$40m ($29m; \u00a323.3m) in funding. \nThe news was welcomed by Cambria Harris, Ms Harris' daughter, who has been advocating for the search since 2022.\n\"It's about showing our indigenous women, our indigenous people, that we're worth it,\" Ms Harris told CBC news recently. \n\"That we're valued, that we're loved and we're more than worth searching for.\"",

    "It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?\nIt's a question that has rung out across dancefloors for more than 20 years. \nThe answer, for The Killers' Mr Brightside, lies in breaking chart records... if not actually topping the charts. \nThe 2000s indie-rock anthem has now overtaken Oasis' Britpop ballad Wonderwall to become the UK's biggest-selling single never to reach number one.\nAccording to the Official Charts Company, Mr Brightside's 5.57 million combined sales and streams also make it the UK's third biggest song of all time, surpassing Wham!'s festive staple Last Christmas.\nThis is calculated from an eye-watering 530.3 million streams (100 paid streams or 600 free streams equal one sale) and 1.1 million copies sold since it was first released in 2003.\nIt already holds the record for the UK's longest-running chart hit, after spending 408 weeks - or seven whole years - in the UK top 100. Its closest competitor, Lewis Capaldi's Someone You Loved, is far behind, with 234 weeks in the countdown at the time of writing.\nMr Brightside is streamed 1.8 million times a week on average in the UK. Last year proved its most successful on streaming services, with a cool 80 million plays. \nNot bad for a song that only reached number 10 in the UK on its second release in 2004 - and didn't chart at all the first time around.\nNow a crowd favourite from indie discos to wedding dancefloors and karaoke bars, nowhere is its cross-generational appeal more evident than at the band's live festival shows.\nLuke Broadhurst, 51, says the song is \"one of the few the whole family loves\", including his teenage son and daughter.\n\"Festivals have given it legendary status for us, from Latitude, with my then 10-year-old old daughter Roxy on my shoulders, to seeing them headline Glastonbury in 2019.\n\"Being part of 130,000 fans was about as biblical an experience as you can get.\"\nRoxy, now 17, says experiencing Mr Brightside at Reading Festival with her friends was \"the best thing I've seen live - uplifting, a sense of unity, it's seen as the national anthem.   \n\"At house parties people belt out the lyrics, it's a classic.\"\nReflecting on the song's seismic impact, The Killers frontman Brandon Flowers told the Official Charts Company: \"It's incredible. I recently went to see Ed Sheeran in Las Vegas, and I joined him for a version of Mr Brightside.\n\"These are people that may not be Killers fans, but it just lit up like a casino in this place when we started playing Mr Brightside.\" \nSo how did it all happen? \nFlowers wrote the lyrics when he was about 20, after discovering his girlfriend had been cheating on him.\nAround that time, Flowers met guitarist Dave Keuning, who'd already written Mr Brightside's backing track. As soon as Flowers heard that chiming riff, his heartbreak spilled onto the page.\n\"When I first heard those chords, I wrote the lyrics down and we didn't waste much time,\" he told Spin magazine. \"That's also why there's not a second verse. The second is the same as the first. I just didn't have any other lines and it ended up sticking.\"\nThe primitive demo was a much darker song. Flowers alternately sounds angry and on the verge of tears - his vocals raw and raspy against a grungy, fuzztone guitar. \nBut when it came to recording the studio version, he adopted a more detached, almost voyeuristic tone.\nMr Brightside was the first complete song The Killers wrote - and the only track to survive from the original version of their debut album, Hot Fuss.\nAll the other songs were scrapped after The Strokes released Is This It, a record that redefined US guitar music at the start of the millennium.\n\"That record just sounded so perfect,\" Flowers told the NME in 2012. \"We threw away everything [we were working on] and the only song that made the cut and remained was Mr Brightside.\"\nThe Killers debuted Mr Brightside at their first ever show, in Las Vegas in 2002 - a gig Flowers later recalled was \"terrible\".\nThings didn't improve for some time. Their sound, heavily influenced by British bands like The Cure, New Order and Depeche Mode, was unpalatable to the US record industry. It wasn't until their demo found its way to UK indie label Lizard King that they landed a record deal.    \n\"Everyone in America had turned them down,\" said label boss Martin Heath. He was particularly impressed by the band's frontman. \"It was very clear to me that he was a major star. He had huge charisma.\"\nLizard King released Mr Brightside in 2003 in a limited run of 500 CD singles, and it got its first review in The Times.\n\"Mr Brightside is one of those records that come along all too rarely and make you think, hel-lo,\" wrote Dan Cairns. \"A fantastically bleak and catchy ode to romantic paranoia and jealousy, it nails that moment in a love affair when one half is suddenly forced to accommodate the possibility that the other half is playing away.\"\nDespite the buzz, 500 copies wasn't enough to make a dent in the charts, and The Killers seemed destined to ",

    "A man who suffered a cardiac arrest while running the Belfast Marathon could not be treated with a defibrillator as the device had not been registered.\nThe defibrillator was attached to the front of Bethany Church on the Lisburn Road in Finaghy, near where the man collapsed on Sunday.\nA spectator who saw what happened and attempted to help the runner using the defibrillator said relief turned to frustration after he was unable to use the device.\nThe church told BBC News NI this was because the defibrillator had not been registered to the national network.\nThe man was helped with another defibrillator and taken to hospital where the BBC understands he is recovering.\n\nDefibrillator boxes are locked and a code is needed to open them - which is obtained by phoning the ambulance service on 999.\nBut the ambulance service only has a code if the device has been registered.\nDevices bought privately by organisations such as community groups or churches need to be registered after they are purchased.\nWhen Shane Horan phoned 999 on Sunday he was told there was no code and was advised to speak to someone at the church.\nHe said when he eventually found someone, they did not know the code either.\n\"At first I was relieved at being able to find the defibrillator, but it very quickly turned to frustration when it wouldn't open,\" Mr Horan said.\n\"This was a massive breakdown in process.

    "Ambassadors from EU member states have agreed in principle to seize windfall profits from frozen Russian assets to finance arms supplies to Kyiv.\nIn the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, EU countries froze hundreds of billions of euros worth of assets. \nIf the decision is approved at a gathering of EU finance ministers next Tuesday, the interest - worth up to \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.5bn) per year - will be used to buy weapons for Ukraine.\nThe European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \"There could be no stronger symbol and no greater use for that money than to make Ukraine and all of Europe a safer place to live.\"\nEuropean Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis also welcomed the decision.\nHe said the funds would have to get to Ukraine as soon as possible, with the first \u20ac1bn tranche - to be used \"mainly for military support\" - ideally reaching the country by summer.\n\"Russia will pay directly for its crimes,\" Mr Dombrovskis said.  \nEarlier this week, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said around 90% of revenues from frozen Russian should be spent on arms purchases for Ukraine.\nThe value of frozen Russian assets in the EU alone is estimated to be almost \u20ac211bn (\u00a3181bn). \nThe majority of the profits from the assets are currently being held in Euroclear, a Belgium-based clearing house.\nThe expropriation of the profits has been a topic of discussion among EU officials and heads of state since the start of the war.\nHowever, the cash had so far not been used because EU members had objected to a 25% tax imposed under Belgian law. Belgium has now agreed to waive the tax. \nEurope's central bankers were also long sceptical about potentially setting a difficult legal precedent that could undermine global financial stability - as well as putting off other countries from placing their safe haven assets in the West.\nThe Kremlin has previously said that seizing the interest made on frozen Russian assets was a move towards the \"destruction of the legal foundations of European law and international law\".",
    "Kate Forbes has returned to the Scottish government as deputy first minister as John Swinney unveiled an almost entirely unchanged cabinet. \nShe replaces Shona Robison, the only switch from Humza Yousaf's cabinet.\nMs Robison, who said she had offered to step down as deputy first minister, has kept her other position as finance secretary.\nMs Forbes said she was \"deeply honoured\" to become deputy first minister.\nShe has also taken control of the economy portfolio - with Net Zero and Energy Secretary Mairi McAllan losing the wellbeing economy brief - as well as gaining responsibility for Gaelic. \nMs Forbes, who has spent more than a year as a backbench MSP after stepping down from government in March 2023, had been promised a \"significant\" role in the government after opting not to run against Mr Swinney for the SNP leadership.\nThe first minister made the cabinet appointments at his official residence, Bute House, after being sworn in at the Court of Session. \nHe said: \"I have selected a cabinet team that blends experience and energy, with a strong focus on the priorities my government will pursue \u2014 eradicating child poverty, driving economic growth, meeting climate obligations and investing in our vital public services.\"\nDetails were later given of 14 non-cabinet ministerial appointments, down from the previous figure of 16, with the role of minister for independence now removed. \nJamie Hepburn - who previously held that remit - takes over as minister for parliamentary business from George Adam.\nMr Adam is leaving the government to return to the backbenches along with Emma Roddick and Joe Fitzpatrick. \nIvan McKee, a key ally of Kate Forbes who quit government in the wake of Nicola Sturgeon's resignation, returns as minister for public finance\nEarlier, in a statement, Shona Robison revealed she had told Mr Swinney last week she believed her stepping down as deputy leader, in favour of Ms Forbes, would help bring the SNP together. \n\"I told you I believed this would strongly signal that for all of us in government, this is the best approach to showing we are united and ready to serve the people of Scotland,\" Ms Robison said in a letter to the first minister. \n\"It is also in the best interests of your leadership and for the party; and both of us have always put public duty and the interests of the party over and above any self interest.\" \nMr Swinney, in a written response, said he was \"deeply\" appreciative of Ms Robison's offer to \"step aside from the role\". \nThe cabinet appointments will be formally approved in parliament on Thursday. \nKate Forbes returns to government after more than a year on the backbenches.\nShe quit government in March 2023 after narrowly losing out to Mr Yousaf in the SNP leadership contest and rejecting a demotion to a rural affairs minister.\nThe Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP had enjoyed a rapid rise following her election to parliament in 2016, aged 26, becoming Scotland's first female finance secretary in 2020. \nAfter being named deputy first minister, Ms Forbes said: \"This is a moment of extraordinary privilege for me. Having previously served in cabinet, I know the duty that all ministers have to reflect the government's priorities and the missions that drive them.\" \nMr Swinney said Ms Forbes was an \"immensely talented politician\", adding: \"Her new role will prove critical as we focus on our key commitments of eradicating child poverty, investing in public services and supporting economic growth.\" \nGreens co-leader Patrick Harvie - who served with Ms Forbes in government for more than 18 months - raised concerns about her return to office. \nHe said \"a lot of people will be concerned about the appointment\" unless Mr Swinney recommitted his government to \"progressive\" policies on climate, social rights and taxation.\nMr Harvie also posted a \"no right turn\" sign on X.\nDuring the 2023 SNP leadership campaign, Ms Forbes came under fire for her views on gay marriage, abortion and trans rights. A member of the Free Church of Scotland, she said that having children outside of marriage was \"wrong\" according to her faith. \nMr Swinney, also a Christian, said at the time he profoundly disagreed with her comments and questioned whether her views made her \"appropriate\" to be first minister. \nMs Forbes also said she was opposed to the SNP government's power-sharing Bute House Agreement with the Scottish Greens. The collapse of the Bute House deal last month led to Mr Yousaf's resignation. \nMr Harvie said the new deputy first minister had expressed \"quite startlingly social conservative views\" in the last SNP leadership campaign and said he would \"welcome\" a commitment from the government to a progressive agenda.  \nScottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy said the \"uninspiring\" new cabinet would deliver \"more of the same\". \n\"The return of Kate Forbes is a desperate attempt by both John Swinney and his new deputy to gloss over the huge splits in the SNP and fixate on independence,\" he said. \nScottish ",
    "It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?\nIt's a question that has rung out across dancefloors for more than 20 years. \nThe answer, for The Killers' Mr Brightside, lies in breaking chart records... if not actually topping the charts. \nThe 2000s indie-rock anthem has now overtaken Oasis' Britpop ballad Wonderwall to become the UK's biggest-selling single never to reach number one.\nAccording to the Official Charts Company, Mr Brightside's 5.57 million combined sales and streams also make it the UK's third biggest song of all time, surpassing Wham!'s festive staple Last Christmas.\nThis is calculated from an eye-watering 530.3 million streams (100 paid streams or 600 free streams equal one sale) and 1.1 million copies sold since it was first released in 2003.\nIt already holds the record for the UK's longest-running chart hit, after spending 408 weeks - or seven whole years - in the UK top 100. Its closest competitor, Lewis Capaldi's Someone You Loved, is far behind, with 234 weeks in the countdown at the time of writing.\nMr Brightside is streamed 1.8 million times a week on average in the UK. Last year proved its most successful on streaming services, with a cool 80 million plays. \nNot bad for a song that only reached number 10 in the UK on its second release in 2004 - and didn't chart at all the first time around.\nNow a crowd favourite from indie discos to wedding dancefloors and karaoke bars, nowhere is its cross-generational appeal more evident than at the band's live festival shows.\nLuke Broadhurst, 51, says the song is \"one of the few the whole family loves\", including his teenage son and daughter.\n\"Festivals have given it legendary status for us, from Latitude, with my then 10-year-old old daughter Roxy on my shoulders, to seeing them headline Glastonbury in 2019.\n\"Being part of 130,000 fans was about as biblical an experience as you can get.\"\nRoxy, now 17, says experiencing Mr Brightside at Reading Festival with her friends was \"the best thing I've seen live - uplifting, a sense of unity, it's seen as the national anthem.   \n\"At house parties people belt out the lyrics, it's a classic.\"\nReflecting on the song's seismic impact, The Killers frontman Brandon Flowers told the Official Charts Company: \"It's incredible. I recently went to see Ed Sheeran in Las Vegas, and I joined him for a version of Mr Brightside.\n\"These are people that may not be Killers fans, but it just lit up like a casino in this place when we started playing Mr Brightside.\" \nSo how did it all happen? \nFlowers wrote the lyrics when he was about 20, after discovering his girlfriend had been cheating on him.\nAround that time, Flowers met guitarist Dave Keuning, who'd already written Mr Brightside's backing track. As soon as Flowers heard that chiming riff, his heartbreak spilled onto the page.\n\"When I first heard those chords, I wrote the lyrics down and we didn't waste much time,\" he told Spin magazine. \"That's also why there's not a second verse. The second is the same as the first. I just didn't have any other lines and it ended up sticking.\"\nThe primitive demo was a much darker song. Flowers alternately sounds angry and on the verge of tears - his vocals raw and raspy against a grungy, fuzztone guitar. \nBut when it came to recording the studio version, he adopted a more detached, almost voyeuristic tone.\nMr Brightside was the first complete song The Killers wrote - and the only track to survive from the original version of their debut album, Hot Fuss.\nAll the other songs were scrapped after The Strokes released Is This It, a record that redefined US guitar music at the start of the millennium.\n\"That record just sounded so perfect,\" Flowers told the NME in 2012. \"We threw away everything [we were working on] and the only song that made the cut and remained was Mr Brightside.\"\nThe Killers debuted Mr Brightside at their first ever show, in Las Vegas in 2002 - a gig Flowers later recalled was \"terrible\".\nThings didn't improve for some time. Their sound, heavily influenced by British bands like The Cure, New Order and Depeche Mode, was unpalatable to the US record industry. It wasn't until their demo found its way to UK indie label Lizard King that they landed a record deal.    \n\"Everyone in America had turned them down,\" said label boss Martin Heath. He was particularly impressed by the band's frontman. \"It was very clear to me that he was a major star. He had huge charisma.\"\nLizard King released Mr Brightside in 2003 in a limited run of 500 CD singles, and it got its first review in The Times.\n\"Mr Brightside is one of those records that come along all too rarely and make you think, hel-lo,\" wrote Dan Cairns. \"A fantastically bleak and catchy ode to romantic paranoia and jealousy, it nails that moment in a love affair when one half is suddenly forced to accommodate the possibility that the other half is playing away.\"\nDespite the buzz, 500 copies wasn't enough to make a dent in the charts, and The Killers seemed destined to ",

The Garrick has been contacted for comment.\nThe vote confirming the resolution required a 50% majority, although previous votes on the question of female membership had required a two-thirds majority.\nAnalysis of the club's rules by senior judges concluded there was nothing in the Garrick's constitution preventing women from being allowed to join, because the 1925 Law of Property Act advises that in legal documents the word \"he\" should also be read to mean \"she\".\nPublished by the Guardian newspaper, the closely guarded membership list included the King, judges, lawyers, peers, cabinet ministers and other MPs, as well as academics, actors, rock stars and senior journalists.\nDeputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden and Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove were both revealed as members, as well as former cabinet ministers including Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, Kwasi Kwarteng and Robert Buckland.\nBBC broadcasters John Simpson and Melvyn Bragg were also revealed to be members.\nSpeaking about when he was a member of the club, former culture minister Lord Vaizey told the Today programme \"it really was quite backward - women couldn't even walk up the front stairs, they couldn't dine in the main dining room. \n\"All of that has changed a long time ago, thankfully.\" \nHe added he did not \"think the Garrick is a secret cabal of men that is quietly running a country\" but \"it's just a convivial place where people go and have lunch and dinner, and that's as valid for women as it is for men\".\nThe Guardian also reported pro-women members planned to nominate a list of seven women to join the club, including actress Juliet Stevenson.\nShe told Today a club that \"for hundreds of years [has] been a club largely dedicated to the theatre community and then the arts community... must by definition be open to all\".\n\"I'm not so much interested in wining and dining, but I'm really interested in exchanges of ideas and challenging each other,\" she said.\n\"If it's a place where that can take place, I would be interested in it for sure.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "An award winning play about sexual assault and the legal system is being used to help train judges in Northern Ireland.\nJodie Comer starred in Prima Facie in both the West End and on Broadway.\nA recorded version of the show is being made available to judges who deal with sexual assault cases in Northern Ireland's courts.\nMs Comer played the character of Tessa in the one-woman show about a barrister who defends people accused of sexual assault, before she herself is raped by a colleague.\nPlaywright Suzie Miller told BBC News NI she believed theatre could change society.\n\"When you take a character and show, rather than tell, someone what's not working - it's really easy to see it when it's in a story context, and with a character that you really care about,\" she said.\nMs Miller said she thought it \"engages and ignites people to where the unfairness lies.\"\nShe said she had received phone calls from \"so many\" judges who came to see the play. \n\"This is a conversation that everyone has to have and we have to have it now,\" she said. \n\"We need to talk about what we can do within our court system to actually protect someone who's a complainant and encourage people to complain,\n\"Encourage them to have faith there will be some outcome that is, at the very least, not re-traumatising for them, but at the better end of the scale is that they are believed.\n\"The more aware that our judges are in court, the more they can come to terms with something that they see as a rape myth and call it out.\"\nRosie Cowan, a lecturer at Queen's University Belfast, has carried out research into the impact of rape myths in criminal cases. \nShe told BBC News NI the use of the play in training judges could be a powerful tool.\n\"I think it'll be a very compelling reminder of the power of rape myths in society. \n\"Rape myths are false beliefs and stereotypes about rape, like what a victim wears or how much she drinks or indeed as happens in the play, her previous sexual history.\"\n\"There's a substantial body of research, my own included and which has found that rape myths bias many people against complainants.\"\nOne memorable line from the play highlights the character's journey through her perception of the criminal justice system: \"Once you see you cannot unsee\". \n\"When I was at law school, I remember thinking it was really odd that a defence barrister could hold up a pair of underwear that most women in the school were wearing that day at university,\" said Ms Miller.\n\"And so \u2026 that means you were wanting sex.\"\n\"I thought, well I've got underwear on that's fairly decent, but that doesn't mean I'm here wanting to be raped,\" she said. \n\"And I remember thinking there's something very wrong in this area of law, but I couldn't quite articulate it because I was a human rights advocate and I believed in innocence until proven guilty. \n\"So I thought there's something missing. There's a fundamental key missing here that they're actually set up to fail in court.\"\nPrima Facie also puts a spotlight on court delays and the resulting impact on victims. \nRecent figures uncovered by BBC News NI show that it takes 757 days on average for a sex crime to be dealt with in Northern Ireland, considerably longer than most of other crimes. \nIn 2022, a judge was criticised for comments he made during a sentencing when he suggested a convicted sex offender should \"find a wife\".\nThis prompted Lady Chief Justice Dame Siobhan Keegan to announce that judges would receive more training.\nIn a statement she said: \"The Judicial Studies Board regularly monitors developments and innovations to identify material and resources which might enhance the quality of training which judges receive.\n\"The subject matter of any given training may include new legislation or case law, newly available research or any other available material capable of improving the learning outcomes of the judicial participants\".",
    "The government has ordered an inspection of Warrington Borough Council after concerns about its level of debt.\nThe authority has been criticised for its \u00a31.8 billion shortfall, which is mostly as a result of its investment programme.\nAn inspector has been appointed to look into the council\u2019s compliance with its obligation to provide best value.\nThe authority said the inspection would have its full cooperation and it would work \"positively, openly and at pace with the inspector\".\nThe Labour administration had come under pressure from opposition councillors over its investments, which include the ownership of supermarkets in Greater Manchester, solar farms in York, Hull and Cirencester, a BT development being built in Salford and a third share of Redwood Bank.\nAn energy firm part-owned by the council collapsed in 2022.\nBBC research earlier this year also found the authority had one of the highest levels of average debt per resident.\nThe government commissioned a report into the council's finances, which was completed by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy.\nSimon Hoare, the minister for local government, said in a written statement that the review found the council\u2019s portfolio of debt-funded investments was \u201cvery large and uniquely complex to a degree that is concerning and puts the council at risk\u201d.\nHe said there were \u201cclear financial risks\u201d and if these materialised they were very likely to have \u201csignificant impact on local residents and some impact on the national public purse\u201d.\nIn October, another minister's letter to the council said the findings of the draft version of the review were \u201cvery serious\u201d.\nThe inspector is to look at areas including its decision making and scrutiny, the adequacy of the council\u2019s capacity to address the recommendations in the institute's report, and the impact the investment portfolio and its management has on service delivery.\nThe inspector is set to report his findings by 30 August.\nAndy Carter, the Conservative MP for Warrington South, said the council\u2019s debt was something his constituents were concerned about.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a really really serious step and decisions like this aren\u2019t taken lightly,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis is really serious, Warrington has debts far, far, far in excess of any of our neighbours and I\u2019m really pleased the government has taken action today.\"\nA council spokesman said the authority had already \"taken steps to address areas for improvement\" and would \"continue to identify any learning and further improvements that can be made as part of this inspection process\".\nHe added: \"We would like to reassure residents and businesses that this review will not impact the valuable services that you depend upon.\"\nWhy not follow BBC North West on X?

    "Some social workers in the Belfast Health Trust are taking 48 hours of strike action from Wednesday over a \"staffing crisis\" in family and childcare services. \nAbout 40 members of the Nipsa trade union from three offices across Belfast will take part.\nIndustrial action will also extend to other trust areas in the coming weeks.\nNipsa said in some cases, staffing was about 30-50% below the required levels, which the union claimed had led to excessive workloads and stress.\nIn a statement, the Health Minister Robin Swann said any improvement to workloads will be an \"incremental process\" and is \"dependent on funding available to the department\".\nHe added that he will be \"seeking Executive transformation monies and cross-departmental support for investment in training\".\nBBC News NI understands that in one office in the greater Belfast area, where 10 social work staff are needed, there are only two in place.\nThere are about 3,000 social workers in Northern Ireland. \nA major report published in 2023 found hundreds of vacancies and an increase in demand for services following the pandemic.\nThe number of looked-after children has also hit an all-time high, with at least 3,800 looked-after children.\nNipsa said the strike action came after a period of negotiations with the Department of Health, which failed to address the problem of staff shortages.\nDamien Maguire, who has been a social worker for 20 years, said some staff were working 50-60 hours every week.\n\"We can't do this anymore,\" he said.\n\"We can't have our members crying, leaving the profession, stressed out, retiring early, leaving to go to other jobs that they don't necessarily want to go into.\n\"This is people's lives, it's children's lives and it's families' lives but it's also the lives of those social workers who have lived experience of what it's like to work in the system.\"\nNIPSA's President Tanya Killen also works as a social worker within the Belfast Trust.\nShe says members are on strike action because of the \"vandalism by the Department of Health in workforce staffing within children\u2019s services.\"\nShe said there has been \"an absolute decimation of staffing within children\u2019s services\" leading to \"excessive workloads\".\n\"Members feel that families and children are being left in a vulnerable position,\" Ms Killen said.\n\"Morale is extremely low, there is a serious issue with recruitment and retention of staff. \"\nShe added: \"We have young people that are coming into the service and because of the workforce pressures they are leaving for other jobs.\n\"Nipsa\u2019s concerns is that children\u2019s lives will be put at risk and that is the real fear and lived experience of our members.\"\nClaire Joudeh has been a social worker for 35 years and says she has never seen the system as broken as it is at the moment.\n\"There\u2019s an ever increasing number of children coming into the care system. \n\"We have unprecedented numbers of looked after children, alongside a decrease in the workforce, alongside a decrease in resources and services so we need to highlight that this is no longer safe.\"\nThe Health Minister said he recognised \"the sustained pressures that social workers are facing\".\nHe added: \"I have warned that the budgetary position for health would impact heavily on key areas, including training.\n\"This is the first confirmation of that highly regrettable reality.\"\nThe strike action is due to last until 10 May.",
    "A freediver from Devon is showing her underwater-inspired artwork in a new exhibition.\nLouise Scammell, South Brent, said she sketched the wildlife she saw on waterproof paper while holding her breath under the sea. \nOnce on dry land, she creates prints from the sketches. \nHer work is on display as part of the Delamore Arts exhibition throughout May at Delamore House in Cornwood, near Ivybridge.\nMs Scammell said she had always loved the sea and its wildlife, and sketching underwater developed from a love of snorkelling and taking photographs. \nShe said she found that photographs were too complex and busy, so she found sketching while in the water helped her focus in and simplify the wildlife she was witnessing. \nShe said: \"It\u2019s very difficult with my camera equipment and a drawing pad, floating around to be coordinated and work quickly. It's a complicated process.\"\nAlong with a homemade drawing pad, she uses graphite to draw.\n\"It's taken a few years to adapt and learn how to do it. \n\"My interest in the sea has a constant throughout my life and it\u2019s been a progression from snorkelling and observing, then taking photographs, and subsequently actually sketching under water.\"\nHer latest work features the birds that live off the Pembrokeshire coast. \nIt took a while for the puffins and razorbills to get used to her, she said, even with her wearing a headpiece shaped like a puffin sometimes in an attempt to not scare any off.\nShe said: \"By day five, they got used to me always being there.\n\"The razorbills were like little bandits diving in around me. I\u2019m not convinced the puffins were fooled by my hat though.\"\nOnce she is out of the water, she works quickly on developing her sketches further and creating lithograph prints from them.\nThe exhibition she is taking part in is in Delamore Art\u2019s newly-refurbished Carriage Gallery. \nIt features 11different print techniques, from lino printing to screen printing.\nGavin Dollard, from Delamore Arts, said: \"The new gallery has been really popular and drawing people in... We hope to see about 6,000-7,000 visitors this year in just the one month.\"\nGavin and Nicky Dollard have been opening Delamore House for the month of May for 23 years now. \nAbout 300 painters, ceramicists and textile artists all have work on display.\nHowever, many of the visitors turn up to see the sculpture gardens where the art is placed amongst a background of spring flowers.\nFollow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Ofcom has warned social media sites they could be named and shamed - and banned for under-18s - if they fail to comply with new online safety rules. \nThe media regulator has published draft codes of practice which require tech firms to have more robust age-checking measures, and to reformulate their algorithms to steer children away from what it called \"toxic\" material.\nBut parents of children who died after exposure to harmful online content have described the proposed new rules as \"insufficient\" - one told the BBC change was happening \"at a snail's pace.\"\nIn statements, Meta and Snapchat said they had extra protections for under-18s, and offered parental tools to control what children can see on their platforms.\nOther firms have not responded to a BBC request for comment.\nOfcom boss Dame Melanie Dawes said any company that broke the draft codes of practice would be \"named and shamed\", and she made clear tougher action such as banning social media sites for children would also be considered.\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast, Esther Ghey - whose daughter Brianna was murdered, aged 16, by two teenagers in February 2023 - said she believed Ofcom \"really did care\" about trying to get regulation right.\nBut she said the full extent of the problem remained unknown.\nLisa Kenevan, whose son Isaac died aged 13 after taking part in a \"black out\" challenge online, said the pace of change was not fast enough.\n\"The sad thing is the snail's pace that is happening with Ofcom and social media platforms taking responsibility, the reality is there's going to be more cases,\" she told BBC Breakfast.\nIt is Ofcom's job to enforce new, stricter rules following the introduction of the Online Safety Act - these codes set out what tech firms must do to comply with that law.\nOfcom says they contain more than 40 \"practical measures.\"\nThe centrepiece is the requirement around algorithms, which are used to decide what is shown in people's social media feeds.\nOfcom says tech firms will need to configure their algorithms to filter out the most harmful content from children\u2019s feeds, and reduce the visibility and prominence of other harmful content.\nOther proposed measures include forcing companies to perform more rigorous age checks if they show harmful content, and making them implement stronger content moderation, including a so-called \"safe search\" function on search engines that restricts inappropriate material.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Dame Melanie described the new rules as \"a big moment\". \n\"Young people are fed harmful content on their feed again and again and this has become normalised but it needs to change,\u201d she said.\nAccording to Ofcom's timeline, these new measures will come into force in the second half of 2025.\nThe regulator is seeking responses to its consultation on the draft codes until 17 July, after which it says it expects to publish final versions of them within a year.\nFirms will then have three months to carry out risk assessments on how children could encounter harmful content on their platforms and their mitigations, taking Ofcom's guidance into account.\nDame Melanie added: \"We will be publishing league tables so that the public know which companies are implementing the changes and which ones are not.\u201d\nDame Melanie met Ms Ghey and Ian Russell, whose daughter Molly took her own life in 2017 at the age of 14.\nIn 2022, a coroner concluded she died from an act of self-harm while suffering depression and the negative effects of online content.\nThey are part of a group of bereaved parents who have signed an open letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and leader of the opposition Sir Keir Starmer.\nIn it, they implore the politicians to do more for the online safety of children - including making \"a commitment to strengthen the Online Safety Act in the first half of the next parliament.\"\nThey also ask for mental health and suicide prevention into the school curriculum.\n\"While we will study Ofcom\u2019s latest proposals carefully, we have so far been disappointed by their lack of ambition,\" they add in the letter.\nThe government insists the measures announced by Ofcom \"will bring in a fundamental change in how children in the UK experience the online world.\"\nThe Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan urged big tech to take the codes seriously.\n\"To platforms, my message is engage with us and prepare,\" she said.\n\"Do not wait for enforcement and hefty fines \u2013 step up to meet your responsibilities and act now.\"\nBruce Daisley, the former UK boss at Twitter and YouTube, told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast the tech for checking the ages of under-18s would need to improve for the proposals to work.\n\u201cThe challenge of course is identifying who young users are -

    "Some social workers in the Belfast Health Trust are taking 48 hours of strike action from Wednesday over a \"staffing crisis\" in family and childcare services. \nAbout 40 members of the Nipsa trade union from three offices across Belfast will take part.\nIndustrial action will also extend to other trust areas in the coming weeks.\nNipsa said in some cases, staffing was about 30-50% below the required levels, which the union claimed had led to excessive workloads and stress.\nIn a statement, the Health Minister Robin Swann said any improvement to workloads will be an \"incremental process\" and is \"dependent on funding available to the department\".\nHe added that he will be \"seeking Executive transformation monies and cross-departmental support for investment in training\".\nBBC News NI understands that in one office in the greater Belfast area, where 10 social work staff are needed, there are only two in place.\nThere are about 3,000 social workers in Northern Ireland. \nA major report published in 2023 found hundreds of vacancies and an increase in demand for services following the pandemic.\nThe number of looked-after children has also hit an all-time high, with at least 3,800 looked-after children.\nNipsa said the strike action came after a period of negotiations with the Department of Health, which failed to address the problem of staff shortages.\nDamien Maguire, who has been a social worker for 20 years, said some staff were working 50-60 hours every week.\n\"We can't do this anymore,\" he said.\n\"We can't have our members crying, leaving the profession, stressed out, retiring early, leaving to go to other jobs that they don't necessarily want to go into.\n\"This is people's lives, it's children's lives and it's families' lives but it's also the lives of those social workers who have lived experience of what it's like to work in the system.\"\nNIPSA's President Tanya Killen also works as a social worker within the Belfast Trust.\nShe says members are on strike action because of the \"vandalism by the Department of Health in workforce staffing within children\u2019s services.\"\nShe said there has been \"an absolute decimation of staffing within children\u2019s services\" leading to \"excessive workloads\".\n\"Members feel that families and children are being left in a vulnerable position,\" Ms Killen said.\n\"Morale is extremely low, there is a serious issue with recruitment and retention of staff. \"\nShe added: \"We have young people that are coming into the service and because of the workforce pressures they are leaving for other jobs.\n\"Nipsa\u2019s concerns is that children\u2019s lives will be put at risk and that is the real fear and lived experience of our members.\"\nClaire Joudeh has been a social worker for 35 years and says she has never seen the system as broken as it is at the moment.\n\"There\u2019s an ever increasing number of children coming into the care system. \n\"We have unprecedented numbers of looked after children, alongside a decrease in the workforce, alongside a decrease in resources and services so we need to highlight that this is no longer safe.\"\nThe Health Minister said he recognised \"the sustained pressures that social workers are facing\".\nHe added: \"I have warned that the budgetary position for health would impact heavily on key areas, including training.\n\"This is the first confirmation of that highly regrettable reality.\"\nThe strike action is due to last until 10 May.",
    "John Swinney has become Scotland's seventh first minister after securing the SNP leadership. \nIt is his second turn leading the party and marks a remarkable turn-around 20 years after he stood down from a difficult period in the top seat.\nFor many in the SNP - particularly those who have been in the movement for a long time - John Swinney embodies what they think of as core SNP values.\nThey see him as trustworthy, hard-working and loyal. He is a favourite at the party conference and his admirers recognise in him a burning desire for independence.\nEdinburgh born and bred, the 60-year-old has something of the traditional Scottish banker about him, and indeed he spent five years working for Scottish Amicable Life Assurance before winning the Tayside North seat at Westminster in 1997.\nBut by then he was already a party veteran, having joined in 1979 aged just 15. \nHe ran the SNP's youth wing before climbing through senior roles in the national party, becoming its secretary at 22. \nMr Swinney is full of contradictions. He rose rapidly among the fiery young party activists yet there is something quite old-fashioned about him.\nHis cautious strain of nationalism was forged in the era of SNP leader Gordon Wilson, who headed the party from 1979 to 1990.\nYet he became a close and trusted colleague of the next leader, Alex Salmond, who had emerged from the more radical wing of the party.\nThrough his time at Westminster and then at Holyrood from 1999, he was a trusted lieutenant to Mr Salmond and so it seemed natural that he should succeed him in 2000, when the leader stood down.\nHis own time as leader, however, was not seen as a success. The early years of devolution were a surprisingly unhappy time for the party. \nThe Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition seemed to quell the nationalists. Seats were lost in the 2003 Holyrood election and there was a disappointing result in the 2004 European poll.\nTowards the end of his four years in the top job, it was clear his time as leader was over.\nHis party colleague Michael Russell borrowed from tales of Conservative fixers in grey suits to warn that Mr Swinney was facing a visit from \"the men in grey kilts\".\nMr Swinney was furious, and as he stood down launched a scathing attack on Mr Russell and other senior members of his party, blaming them for briefing against him and creating a \"fog of media speculation\" about his position.\nThose people \"should know better'\" than to \"import the grubby concepts from the Conservatives,\" he said.\n\"Our leader is democratically elected and, once democratically elected, should be supported by every single member of the party,\" he added.\nYet his ability to adapt and fit in, get on with the job and put duty first served him well when, after a spell on the back benches, he joined Mr Salmond's first government as finance secretary.  \nIt was a job he would fill for the next nine years, adding the title deputy first minister to his office door when Nicola Sturgeon succeeded Alex Salmond in 2014. \nHe remained her loyal deputy, moving to take over the education brief in 2016.\nHis time in office was not without its problems. He was particularly criticised for falling standards in science and mathematics and survived two votes of no confidence while in the role, one in 2020 and the other a year later.\nJust two months after that second vote he was moved to head the Scottish government's response to Covid, while remaining Ms Sturgeon's deputy.\nAnd that had looked like being his final job in government. Just after Ms Sturgeon stood down in February 2023, he announced that he too was going, returning to the back benches after 16 years as a cabinet secretary.\nHe remains liked and respected by both colleagues and political opponents. \nBut remember those contradictions. \nPolite and moderate in person - and much funnier than on camera - Mr Swinney is also a ferocious parliamentary performer and has been a serious political operator for almost 40 years.\nAs he announced his candidacy he spoke of uniting the party for independence.\nAlmost his first act was to say there would be a place for Kate Forbes - who had considered a rival bid - in his government and he denied he would be a \"caretaker\" leader, saying he was in it to lead the SNP through the next Westminster and Holyrood elections.\nAlmost 20 years after standing down, John Swinney is stepping up once again.",
    "The government has ordered an inspection of Warrington Borough Council after concerns about its level of debt.\nThe authority has been criticised for its \u00a31.8 billion shortfall, which is mostly as a result of its investment programme.\nAn inspector has been appointed to look into the council\u2019s compliance with its obligation to provide best value.\nThe authority said the inspection would have its full cooperation and it would work \"positively, openly and at pace with the inspector\".\nThe Labour administration had come under pressure from opposition councillors over its investments, which include the ownership of supermarkets in Greater Manchester, solar farms in York, Hull and Cirencester, a BT development being built in Salford and a third share of Redwood Bank.\nAn energy firm part-owned by the council collapsed in 2022.\nBBC research earlier this year also found the authority had one of the highest levels of average debt per resident.\nThe government commissioned a report into the council's finances, which was completed by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy.\nSimon Hoare, the minister for local government, said in a written statement that the review found the council\u2019s portfolio of debt-funded investments was \u201cvery large and uniquely complex to a degree that is concerning and puts the council at risk\u201d.\nHe said there were \u201cclear financial risks\u201d and if these materialised they were very likely to have \u201csignificant impact on local residents and some impact on the national public purse\u201d.\nIn October, another minister's letter to the council said the findings of the draft version of the review were \u201cvery serious\u201d.\nThe inspector is to look at areas including its decision making and scrutiny, the adequacy of the council\u2019s capacity to address the recommendations in the institute's report, and the impact the investment portfolio and its management has on service delivery.\nThe inspector is set to report his findings by 30 August.\nAndy Carter, the Conservative MP for Warrington South, said the council\u2019s debt was something his constituents were concerned about.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a really really serious step and decisions like this aren\u2019t taken lightly,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis is really serious, Warrington has debts far, far, far in excess of any of our neighbours and I\u2019m really pleased the government has taken action today.\"\nA council spokesman said the authority had already \"taken steps to address areas for improvement\" and would \"continue to identify any learning and further improvements that can be made as part of this inspection process\".\nHe added: \"We would like to reassure residents and businesses that this review will not impact the valuable services that you depend upon.\"\nWhy not follow BBC North West on X?

    "Founded in 1924, Paulton Homing Society in Somerset has been sending off and welcoming home pigeons for 100 years. For many members it is a hobby that has taken over their lives. Now they have been reminiscing on how the sport has changed over a century.\nBarrie Simmons' father, Harry, was one of the society's 12 founding members and completed 60 years as its secretary.\n\"He was 'Mr Paulton Homing Society',\" Barrie said.\n\"Things were very much different in those days... I was brought up when it was an out-and-out hobby, but with commercialisation comes changes.\"\nPigeon racing - in which the birds return to their homes over a carefully-measured distance - is thought to have begun as a sport in Belgium before becoming popular with working-class communities in the UK.\nIn north east Somerset, it was the old coal miners who kept the hobby alive.\nThinking about the \"good old days\", Barrie said that when the pigeon arrived back at its loft, the rubber ring was removed and handed to the fastest boy from the local school who would run it to the post office for an official time to be recorded.\nThe boy would be paid sixpence for his efforts.\nNow, the sport sees high-tech devices and the use of ETF (Electronic Timing Systems) systems.\nPeter Rakes has been flying pigeons since 1952, when he was just a boy.\nHe lived in Townsend, not far from Paulton, and said in his youth there were 20 pigeon fanciers in the area.\n\"It was the coal miners who kept the sport going. It was their bit of fun,\" he said.\n\"They used to take the pigeons on the train up to Bristol to be released.\"\nAnd on the way back there would be the treat of fish and chips in Brislington, he added.\nApart from when he got married and did not fly for a couple of years, Peter said \"pigeons have been my life\".\n\"It is in my family, my father was a pigeon fancier [breeding the birds],\" he said.\n\"I've been retired a few years now. If I didn't have my pigeons it would drive me up the wall.\"\nHe said he will eventually \"pack in pigeons\" on the day he loses a sense of pride when he sees his birds come home.\nBarries said as the years had gone by, the sport had become commercialised.\n\"Even when my father retired in 1985, he remarked then it was becoming commercialised,\" he said. \"There is a lot of money involved in it now.\"\nAnd with that, comes even more competitiveness.\nLargely gone are the days when a fancier would take a young boy - or older gentleman - under their wing and pass on their knowledge of the sport, and potentially even give them a bird to get started.\n\"Nowadays, yes there are still some genuine fanciers about, but there is a lot of money that changes hands regarding young pigeons - even old pigeons - and I am talking about hundreds and thousands of pounds,\" Barrie said.\nGeoff Cooper has had some success with racing.\nHe loves the international races which can take place across Europe and see the birds flying anywhere up to 800 miles back to their lofts.\n\"I have won a lot of short and middle-distance races,\" Geoff said.\nBut asking him how that feels, he said his reply would \"have him in tears\".\n\"Those winners\u2026 I can remember every pigeon that I have timed late at night into the day and I've been racing since 13 and keeping them since 11,\" he said.\n\"My life - wasted on pigeons,\" he joked.\nBarrie added: \"It is a fascinating sport. I've been sat on the wall at West Bay with baskets of pigeons ready to let go and people have been interested.\n\"You try to explain to them about how they are going to be let go and make their way back to their loft, and they will do that on a Saturday from various race points from 50 to 800 miles [away].\n\"They become absolutely fascinated with it. It is that sort of sport. It is like a drug, it gets a hook into you.\n\"I just love the sport, to sit in the garden and wait for those birds. The words that most fanciers will say is 'here's one'. It is phenomenal.\"\nAnd so 100 years on from when the society first started, for these men at least, there is no sign of slowing down or taking a step back, just yet.",
    "GCSE exams are starting in England and Wales, with students in England given some extra help in maths and science in recognition of the disruption they faced during Covid lockdowns.\nIt is the last year GCSE students will get formulae and equation sheets.\nExams are back to normal in Wales and in Northern Ireland, where GCSE exams have already begun.\nThis group of Year 11 GCSE students have spent every year of their secondary education in the midst or the wake of the pandemic. \nSome exams that don't involve sitting a paper, like art or language speaking assessments, have already been taking place.\nBTec exams have started for hundreds of thousands of students in the UK.\nSince Covid, exams have been getting back to pre-pandemic arrangements gradually.\nStudents were given advance notice of topics, among other help, in 2022. This stopped in England last year and in Wales and Northern Ireland this year.\nGrading, too, has been getting back to normal after top grades soared in 2020 and 2021, when exams were cancelled and results were based on teachers' assessments.\nIn England, grades were brought back in line with pre-Covid levels last year.\nExam boards in Wales and Northern Ireland will do the same this year, which means results across the UK should be more similar to 2019, having been slightly higher last year.\nIn Wales, there will still be some protection in place to make sure grades do not fall \"substantially\" below 2019 levels.\nAnd most formulae are already provided for students in Wales as standard.\nNational 5, Higher and Advanced Higher exams have already started in Scotland. \n\nEducation Secretary Gillian Keegan announced last year that students in England would get formulae and equation sheets for a final time this year in maths, physics and combined science, with normal exam arrangements in 2025. \n\"Young people taking GCSEs next year will be the last who experienced two years of national closures during secondary school and it\u2019s right that we recognise that with some additional support,\" she said.\nDiscussing pre-exam rituals at Brighouse High School in West Yorkshire, 16-year-old Mihai said he planned to get as much sleep as possible before his first exam, joking that bedtime would be \"probably 7pm\". \nSam, 16, said he would be cramming until about 11:30pm, while Ruby, 15, was \"a bit nervous\" because she works part-time at a swimming pool and had a shift the evening before the Religious Studies exam.\n\"I can't revise the night before like everybody else,\" she said. \"But it's not as bad as if I had science the next day, which I'm more worried about.\"\nPupils in Year 7 at the start of the pandemic had only been at the school for about six months when most moved to home learning in the first lockdown.\nWhen they returned, there were restrictions on who they could socialise with.\n\"I actually think that our year group is one of the closest year groups in the school,\" said Phoebe, 16.\n\"We were all in sectioned-off bits of the school so we did just see our own year group at break and lunch.\"\nAnother pupil, Lily, said she found it hard to remember some of the content they were taught in Years 7 and 8, which saw the most disruption.\n\"I would definitely not pass anything if it weren\u2019t for the science formulae sheets or the equations,\" she joked. \"There\u2019s so many of them.\"\nHarriet, 18, has exams for English language and psychology A-levels coming up, as well as a BTec in performing arts.\nSharing her experience of sitting GCSEs in 2022 with the Year 11s in the room, she pointed out that she didn't have to learn as many poems as they do - prompting a collective groan.\nShe thought that was \"fair\", though, adding that she \"couldn't imagine doing anything more\" during her own GCSEs after the \"stress\" of Covid.\nLast year saw a rise in the number of students needing to take compulsory English and maths resits in England.\nColleges say this, combined with a bulge in the number of teenagers coming through the system, means they are \"under immense pressure this exam season\".\nCatherine Sezen, director of education policy at the Association of Colleges, said colleges were having to find extra invigilators, hire external buildings and pay for transport to and from those buildings.\n\"This all comes at a significant cost at a time when college finances are stretched,\" she said.\nTeacher strikes over pay last year caused more disruption for this year's GCSE candidates while they were in Year 10. \nAdditionally some students have had to deal with their school buildings closing on safety grounds - especially those identified as having a dangerous type of concrete called Raac.\nStudents at some Raac schools have been unable to access design and technology work rooms, laboratories and other specialist spaces for much of the year and are worried about the impact on their results.\nCaroline Vile, head teacher at Ellesmere Port Catholic High School in Cheshire, is among those calling for special consideration, telling the BBC her students were not on",
    "First Minister John Swinney has announced his new cabinet, which will lead what he promises will be a slimmed-down government.\nHowever, the arrival of Kate Forbes as his deputy actually increases the cabinet by one. So who's who in the 11-strong senior ministerial team?\nAt 60, John Swinney is the oldest person to take the role of first minister since Donald Dewar, who was 61 when he won the first Holyrood election in 1999.\nWith that comes enormous experience: 45 years in the SNP, a previous spell as leader, and 16 years as a cabinet secretary including nine years managing Scotland's finances.\nFew question his qualifications for the role and he is widely seen as a stabilising voice, popular with colleagues and opponents.\nHe will need all his experience to fulfil his promise to seek consensus with opposition parties, with the aim of growing the economy and tackling poverty.\n \nKate Forbes returns to government after little more than a year on the backbenches,  and the terms of the deal she struck not to run against Mr Swinney now become clear.\nThe 34-year-old becomes Scotland's youngest ever deputy first minister and takes over the economy portfolio as well as responsibility for Gaelic.\nThe MSP, who is a member of the Free Church of Scotland, has been criticised for her views on gay marriage, abortion and trans rights. \nShe is a former finance secretary and is fluent in Gaelic. \nAngela Constance remains at justice and home affairs. \nThe former social worker has been in parliament since 2007 and joined the government in 2010. \nShe previously served as education secretary and communities and social security secretary before leaving government for a spell.  \nThe 39-year-old has held the rural affairs brief since 2021.\nBefore entering parliament in 2016 she was a councillor in her native Brechin and defeated the sitting MSP, Nigel Don, in a party selection contest.\nShe was briefly public health minister before taking on her current role.\nJenny Gilruth also stays in the same job.\nThe Mid-Scotland and Glenrothes MSP was a teacher in Edinburgh and Dunfermline before entering politics. She entered government in 2020 as minister for Europe, migration and international development.\nShe is married to the former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale.\nNeil Gray was only elected to Holyrood in 2021, having spent the previous six years at Westminster. \nHe took over as health secretary earlier this year, after the resignation of Michael Matheson. \nThe native Orcadian was a journalist and producer with the BBC in Kirkwall before working for the former health secretary Alex Neil. \nA member of the Scottish Parliament since its inception in 1999, Fiona Hyslop has now served in junior and senior government roles under all four SNP first ministers.\nShe has been a member of the party for almost 40 years and stood unsuccessfully  in council and Westminster elections before devolution. \nShe held the culture portfolio for 11 years between 2009 and 2020.\nSeen as one of the SNP's brightest young stars, Mairi McAllan became a minister immediately upon being elected to the Scottish Parliament in 2021 at the age of 28.\nThe former corporate lawyer and special adviser to Nicola Sturgeon joined Humza Yousaf's cabinet in the transport, net zero and just transition brief. \nThis became wellbeing economy, net zero and energy in February. The economy role now transfers to Kate Forbes under Mr Swinney but she retains the rest of her responsibilities.\nOne of the SNP's most experienced campaigners, Angus Robertson spent 16 years as an MP for Moray before losing his seat to the Scottish Conservative leader Dougas Ross in the 2017 election.\nA German speaker who worked as a journalist in central Europe, he spoke for the SNP on foreign affairs and defence at Westminster and has been both the party's deputy and Westminster leader.\nSince being elected to Holyrood in 2021, he has been cabinet secretary for the constitution, external affairs and culture.\nA close friend and political ally of former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Shona Robison is another of the 1999 intake of MSPs.\nShe was a junior minister for public health and sport in her party's first government before joining the cabinet in 2014 but resigned as health secretary four years later.\nAfter a spell on the backbenches, the Dundee MSP re-joined the cabinet in the social justice brief before serving as Mr Yousaf's finance secretary and deputy first minister. \nShe offered to give up her role as deputy first minister in favour of Kate Forbes as a means of bringing the party together. \nShirley-Anne Somerville was an MSP from 2007-2011 before losing her seat. \nAfter a spell helping run the Yes campaign she returned to Holyrood in 2016 and has been in government ever since.\nShe has been education as well as social justice secretary and between these roles has handled controversial policies such as gender recognition, school standards and the role of the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA).

    "Several cultural projects are to be brought to life following substantial investment from Arts Council England.\nThree projects in Lowestoft, Suffolk have been awarded funding by the body.\nOne will see a former Tesco site transformed into a creative hub while a former post office will similarly be turned into work studio spaces.\nHazel Edwards, the south east director at Arts Council England, said the funding would help \"nurture a more vibrant and accessible cultural landscape for all\".\n\"We are pleased to help bolster cultural investment throughout East Suffolk thanks to the Capital Investment Programme and Place Partnership Fund,\" Ms Edwards added.\n\"By enhancing the infrastructure of cultural spaces across the region we are expanding access to arts, culture, and creative pursuits.\"\nThe first project has seen First Light Festival CIC awarded \u00a3700,000 for the so-called Battery of Ideas.\n\"It will bring together a consortium of leading cultural, education and creative health partners to test ideas for the development of the new cultural quarter\" in the town centre, according to an East Suffolk Council spokesperson. \nThe authority, along with the county council, will also invest a further \u00a3300,000 and the project will see the re-use of the former Tesco on London Road North as its base.\nGenevieve Christie, chief executive at First Light Festival CIC, said it was \"thrilled\" the project would start this spring.\n\"The Battery testing space will fire up ideas, enthusiasm and involvement, grow public awareness of the new Cultural Quarter development and create a step change in creative production and cultural participation in Lowestoft,\" she added.\nThe local council itself has also been awarded \u00a3600,000 to turn the post office also on London Road North into a landmark arts venue.\nThe money will help convert the building into studios, galleries, educational spaces and accommodation. \nIt is estimated that this space will be open to the public from the autumn of 2025.\nThe investment from Arts Council England will also help provide other physical spaces where more people in the town can enjoy creative experiences.\nThe council hopes it will help revitalise the town centre \"by offering an exciting alternative use to these former retail buildings\". \nEast Norfolk Sixth Form College has also secured funding from the Place Partnership to deliver more cultural opportunities for schools and younger people living in Lowestoft as well as Great Yarmouth. \nPrincipal Dr Catherine Richards said the money was \"essential\" in helping provide opportunities to inspire young people in both areas.\n\"By delivering more arts and cultural experiences, we can continue our work to raising the aspirations and wellbeing of our local communities,\" she added.\nFollow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A freediver from Devon is showing her underwater-inspired artwork in a new exhibition.\nLouise Scammell, South Brent, said she sketched the wildlife she saw on waterproof paper while holding her breath under the sea. \nOnce on dry land, she creates prints from the sketches. \nHer work is on display as part of the Delamore Arts exhibition throughout May at Delamore House in Cornwood, near Ivybridge.\nMs Scammell said she had always loved the sea and its wildlife, and sketching underwater developed from a love of snorkelling and taking photographs. \nShe said she found that photographs were too complex and busy, so she found sketching while in the water helped her focus in and simplify the wildlife she was witnessing. \nShe said: \"It\u2019s very difficult with my camera equipment and a drawing pad, floating around to be coordinated and work quickly. It's a complicated process.\"\nAlong with a homemade drawing pad, she uses graphite to draw.\n\"It's taken a few years to adapt and learn how to do it. \n\"My interest in the sea has a constant throughout my life and it\u2019s been a progression from snorkelling and observing, then taking photographs, and subsequently actually sketching under water.\"\nHer latest work features the birds that live off the Pembrokeshire coast. \nIt took a while for the puffins and razorbills to get used to her, she said, even with her wearing a headpiece shaped like a puffin sometimes in an attempt to not scare any off.\nShe said: \"By day five, they got used to me always being there.\n\"The razorbills were like little bandits diving in around me. I\u2019m not convinced the puffins were fooled by my hat though.\"\nOnce she is out of the water, she works quickly on developing her sketches further and creating lithograph prints from them.\nThe exhibition she is taking part in is in Delamore Art\u2019s newly-refurbished Carriage Gallery. \nIt features 11different print techniques, from lino printing to screen printing.\nGavin Dollard, from Delamore Arts, said: \"The new gallery has been really popular and drawing people in...

    "Scotland's new deputy first minister, Kate Forbes, has already experienced the highs and lows of a career at Holyrood in her relatively short time in politics.\nShe enjoyed a rapid rise to become Scotland's first female finance secretary in 2020, but was narrowly defeated in last year's SNP leadership contest by Humza Yousaf.\nThe backbench MSP considered another bid for her party's top job to succeed Mr Yousaf but ultimately pulled out and backed John Swinney, who won unopposed .\nHaving been promised a \"significant\" role in Mr Swinney's government, Ms Forbes could not have been given a greater position as she returns as his deputy.\nThe Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP said last week she had \u201clistened carefully\u201d to Mr Swinney and welcomed his \u201ccommitment to ensure internal respect for robust and divergent debate in the party\u201d.\nShe described the former deputy first minister as being best placed to deliver a \"reform agenda\".\nMs Forbes left the cabinet in March 2023 after being offered the rural affairs brief by Mr Yousaf, which would have been considered a major demotion.\nShe later told the New Statesman she \"would have found it hard to turn down\" an offer to remain as finance secretary.\nDuring the 2023 SNP leadership campaign, Ms Forbes came under fire for her views on gay marriage, abortion and trans rights.\nThe MSP was further criticised after telling Sky News that having children outside of marriage was \"wrong\" according to her faith as a member of the Free Church of Scotland.\nBut she saw being honest about her beliefs as an important part of who she is, telling the New Statesman she would have been \"haunted\" had she not answered questions about her religious views honestly during the campaign.\nIn 2018, Ms Forbes told the National Prayer Breakfast for Scotland that politicians should \"recognise that the way we treat the most vulnerable - whether the unborn or the terminally ill - is a measure of true progress\".\nShe was among the 15 SNP politicians who wrote an open letter to Ms Sturgeon the following year, asking for a delay to gender recognition reforms that would make it easier for people in Scotland to self-identify their sex.\nThe final vote on the proposals was held when Ms Forbes was on maternity leave, but when she launched her 2023 leadership campaign she said she still had significant concerns about self-identification and would not have voted for the bill. \nSeveral senior Scottish government figures rejected her comments, including Mr Swinney, who said he profoundly disagreed with her views despite his own Christian faith.\nAnother notable feature of Ms Forbes's campaign was her opposition to the SNP's power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens - the collapse of which led to Mr Yousaf's resignation. \nThe backbench MSP told the New Statesman in December that the Bute House Agreement should be repealed and called for the SNP to rule as a minority government.\nThe Greens previously described her defeat as a \"relief\".\nIt is perhaps a problem for the SNP that while many of her colleagues and fellow party members take issue with her social views, she is also widely regarded as a very gifted and intelligent politician.\nMs Forbes quickly climbed the political ladder after being elected to Holyrood in 2016, aged just 26.\nOn the backbenches, she campaigned to ban plastic straws and delivered a speech in the Holyrood chamber entirely in Gaelic, having learned the language as a child. \nShe was appointed to government as public finance minister in 2018.\nAnd in 2020 she was unexpectedly named finance secretary on the eve of the Scottish Budget, after her senior government colleague, Derek Mackay, was forced to step down when it emerged he had sent inappropriate text messages to a 16-year-old schoolboy.\nMs Forbes became Scotland's first female finance secretary and was widely praised for delivering the budget speech with just a few hours' notice.\nLight was shed on Ms Forbes's role within Nicola Sturgeon's government during evidence sessions of the UK Covid Inquiry hearings.\nMs Forbes told the inquiry she had not been invited to so-called \"gold command\" meetings during the pandemic and was \"surprised\" to learn that they had not been minuted. \nShe also spoke out last year about her struggles after being diagnosed with postnatal depression in 2022. \nShe told BBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Live she suffered from insomnia and \"extreme terror\" following the birth of her daughter, Naomi. \nMs Forbes was born in Dingwall but was partly raised in India as her parents travelled there twice as missionaries. \nWhen she returned to India at the age of 10, she studied at Woodstock School - an international residential school in the foothills of the Himalayas.\nShe went on to complete degrees at Cambridge University and Edinburgh University and became a chartered accountant for Barclays in London.\nShe worked as an assistant to the SNP MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, Dave Thompson, for two years before being selected to replace ",

    "The bid for a murderer to be released from prison early had been rejected just days before he died.\nVictor Farrant was convicted of the murder of Glenda Hoskins, 44, in 1996.\nMs Hoskins' family had been told earlier this year that Farrant was being considered for early release on compassionate leave.\nThey told the BBC that the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) informed them of a decision to reject the request last week.\nThe Prison Service said Farrant, 74, died at HMP Wakefield on 3 May.\nMs Hoskins' son Iain Hoskins said: \"We'd been contacted the day before [Farrant's death] by the justice department's victim liaison, and they told us that they weren't progressing the plans for his release to the next stage.\n\"That was a relief, but then still having this hanging over us, that this potentially could happen at some point in the future, was very stressful and we didn't quite understand where we should be going forward.\"\nEarlier this year, Ms Hoskins' family said they had been contacted by officials who said Farrant was being considered for compassionate leave as he had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and could have months to live.\nA Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (Mappa) meeting in April looked at the case, which the family said had been passed on to the prison governor to decide whether to make a formal application for his release.\nThe MoJ said the prison governor had recently concluded that the criteria to grant this was not met.\nMr Hoskins told the BBC that a lack of \"clarity\" and \"transparency\" from the MoJ hadn't \"helped us through the process and given us information that we needed to be able to process\".\n\"All those things combined unfortunately haven't helped these last couple of months and cost us probably way more stress and anxiety than what was needed,\" he added.\nIn a statement, the MoJ said: \"Our victim liaison officers aim to keep victims aware of key updates or potential changes about offenders so that they feel well-informed.\n\"We are sorry that Glenda Hoskins' family were left confused by our communications which were done with the best of intentions.\"\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

    "A private school in Hull which charges just under \u00a36,000 a year in fees has been rated as inadequate by Ofsted.\nInspectors said Froebel House School, on Marlborough Avenue, \"failed to meet the independent school standards\".\nDuring an inspection in November, Ofsted found issues in the quality of education provided, welfare, health and safety of pupils and school leadership.\nThe school said children were safe and the \"high academic achievements proved Froebel House is a good school\". \nThe independent school, which educates 110 children aged between three and 11 years old with annual fees costing up to \u00a35,960, was previously rated good.\nHowever the latest inspection raised concerns of ineffective safeguarding processes and pupils experiencing \"a jumbled, disconnected series\" of maths lessons.\nInspectors also criticised a \"distinct lack of professional development for staff\".\nThe report said: \"The proprietor has not ensured that all the independent school standards are met.\n\"Several unmet standards were addressed during the inspection.

    "It was designed to highlight organisations where women were lagging behind and motivate change that would revolutionise workplaces.\nBut five years after the first set of gender pay figures were published by big employers, the latest numbers suggest a lack of progress. Women still earn on average about 90p at these organisations for every \u00a31 a man does. \nSo is this any more than a box-ticking exercise?\nHere are five things to take into account:\nMeasuring a company's gender pay gap means lining up the male employees in order of salary, doing the same for the women, and compare the two in the middle.\nSo the pay gap isn't just about whether men and women are getting equal pay for equal work (an area covered by law for 50 years).\nIt's also about how many women there are, what roles they hold , and if they're progressing up the ranks. \nIt may be about traditional career roles - hence why construction and finance, traditionally male dominated, have particularly large gaps. \nFields in which women are overrepresented may also have traditionally attracted lower pay. Store staff at Asda, for example, have been arguing in court that they should be valued the same as the largely male workforce in depots.\nGaps may reflect a lack of opportunities- for entering or progressing or corporate culture or attitudes. Or the challenges of responsibilities outside of work.\nSome economists claim the gap is a \"myth\" , suggesting it may reflects women's choices, that they opt out of career progression or even the workplace.\nBut some may have the choice made for them: research commissioned by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy found that 1 in 9 women said they had lost their jobs when they returned to work after having a child, or felt forced out of their job.\nWhat is definitely true is that the gap opens up once children arrive - men and women earn roughly similar salaries in the early parts of their careers.\nFor employers, the challenge is hanging on to women, ensuring they have routes to progress. \nFor carers, disproportionally women, it's balancing responsibilities. And, ahead of last month's  Budget which offered more financial help for childcare,  financial services group PWC calculated that the challenge and costs of dealing with caring responsibilities in the face of a pandemic and soaring inflation may have halted women's workplace progress. \nLater in their careers, a Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development report found that almost 900,000 women in the UK had left their jobs because of menopausal symptoms. \nOn the face of it, there has, after decades of progress, been no movement in the pay gap overall since big organisations started reporting these figures five years ago. \nBut some of those with the widest pay gaps admit the scrutiny has been constructive. Less than a decade ago, only 5% of EasyJet's intake of pilots were women - now it's 10%. The spotlight didn't only highlight the gap between pay in the cockpit and the crew in the back - but encouraged more women to become pilots. \nIronically, recruiting more women at entry level can cause the gap to widen before they move up the ranks.\nAsk gender pay specialists and they'll tell you there are many initiatives that companies can take - tackling unconscious bias, offering more flexible working and encouraging shared parental leave.\nBut the issue doesn't end at the office door. The experts say society needs to change.\nSchools could encourage girls to take more STEM subjects: science, technology, engineering and maths. The variety of flexible, affordable childcare options could be increased. And some men could take on more of the household chores.\nBut campaigners say  gender pay gap reporting may not be enough. Some want legislations to force companies to explain how they intend to close gaps - with penalties for those who fail . \nOver her career the average woman can expect to earn almost a quarter of a million pounds less than the average man. But that penalty aside, failing to capitalise on what women can offer may be restricting our wider fortunes at a time when skills are in short supply. ",
    "The bid for a murderer to be released from prison early had been rejected just days before he died.\nVictor Farrant was convicted of the murder of Glenda Hoskins, 44, in 1996.\nMs Hoskins' family had been told earlier this year that Farrant was being considered for early release on compassionate leave.\nThey told the BBC that the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) informed them of a decision to reject the request last week.\nThe Prison Service said Farrant, 74, died at HMP Wakefield on 3 May.\nMs Hoskins' son Iain Hoskins said: \"We'd been contacted the day before [Farrant's death] by the justice department's victim liaison, and they told us that they weren't progressing the plans for his release to the next stage.\n\"That was a relief, but then still having this hanging over us, that this potentially could happen at some point in the future, was very stressful and we didn't quite understand where we should be going forward.\"\nEarlier this year, Ms Hoskins' family said they had been contacted by officials who said Farrant was being considered for compassionate leave as he had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and could have months to live.\nA Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (Mappa) meeting in April looked at the case, which the family said had been passed on to the prison governor to decide whether to make a formal application for his release.\nThe MoJ said the prison governor had recently concluded that the criteria to grant this was not met.\nMr Hoskins told the BBC that a lack of \"clarity\" and \"transparency\" from the MoJ hadn't \"helped us through the process and given us information that we needed to be able to process\".\n\"All those things combined unfortunately haven't helped these last couple of months and cost us probably way more stress and anxiety than what was needed,\" he added.\nIn a statement, the MoJ said: \"Our victim liaison officers aim to keep victims aware of key updates or potential changes about offenders so that they feel well-informed.\n\"We are sorry that Glenda Hoskins' family were left confused by our communications which were done with the best of intentions.\"\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

    "A Virginia school board has approved a motion for two schools to revert to their Confederate names following a debate that bitterly divided a town.\nThe Shenandoah County School Board voted 5-1 to reinstate the names of Stonewall Jackson High and Ashby-Lee Elementary in Quicksburg.\nCommunity members had been pushing for a reversal, arguing the 2020 name change was unpopular.\nThe vote marked the first such U-turn anywhere in the US.\nA large crowd flocked to the school board's public meeting on Thursday to listen to a series of arguments from residents on both sides of the issue.\nFollowing the May 2020 murder of George Floyd and a summer of racial justice unrest, Virginia and other states took down Confederate statues from public spaces.\nIn a letter to school board chairs across the state, then-Democratic Governor Ralph Northam said: \"It is time to change school names and mascots that memorialize Confederate leaders or sympathizers.\"\nThe Shenandoah County School Board took action three days later, moving to rename Stonewall Jackson High as Mountain View High, and Ashby-Lee Elementary as Honey Run Elementary.\nThe schools were named after Confederate generals Robert E Lee and Stonewall Jackson, and cavalry commander Turner Ashby.\nIn doing so, the six-member panel also approved a resolution condemning racism and affirming its \"commitment to an inclusive school environment for all\".\nBut some critics slammed the renaming effort as a hasty and undemocratic move, and have since attempted to restore the schools' Confederate names as local elections reshaped the school board. \nA 2022 vote on the matter failed by a tied 3-3 vote - but the three who voted against the move have since been replaced on the school board.\nIn April, a local conservative community group, the Coalition for Better Schools, brought up the request again, pointing to citizen surveys it conducted that \"indicate overwhelming support for this restoration\".\n\"These groups hold historical significance,\" the group wrote in a letter to the school board, and \"revisiting this decision is essential to honor our community's heritage and respect the wishes of the majority.\" \nAccording to local media, the group says it will raise private funds to cover expenses related to the name reversal, such as changing school signage.\nIts effort is drawing attention across the state, with the Virginia chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), a civil rights organisation, urging the school board in a letter on Wednesday to \"use your power in a way that positively impacts all your district's children and their families\".\nNeil Thorne, a local resident campaigning against the U-turn with a group called Claim the Names, warned \"it will indelibly damage our community's reputation\".\nMinority members of the community still recall when Stonewall Jackson High was \"whites-only\" and they had to be bussed to schools in adjacent counties, he said.\n\"The naming of these schools was not incidental but reflected the segregated policies of the time,\" he said in a statement.\n\"The people who suffered through this are not past strangers - they are people we know, they are our friends and neighbours.\"\nShenandoah County, in northern Virginia, was once a stronghold of the pro-slavery South, with its ample valley providing food, security and transportation advantages.\nDuring the US Civil War, Confederate forces waged several successful military campaigns against the Union army there.\nThe county is now home to more than 44,000 people, and is predominantly white. \nBlack residents often live and work in towns where Confederate flags are displayed on front porches. Many of those who fly the banner defend it as a celebration of heritage, not a symbol of hatred.",
    "A self-styled \"eunuch maker\" who mutilated paying customers and streamed it online has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 22 years.\nMarius Gustavson admitted offences including five counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.\nHe was described at a three-day sentencing at the Old Bailey as \"a lunatic\", \"an arch-manipulator\" and \"a butcher\".\nThe Norwegian, 46, ran a lucrative business in extreme body modifications.\nWarning: Contains graphic descriptions\nJudge Mark Lucraft KC said Gustavson had been the mastermind of the \"gruesome and grisly\", \"large-scale\" and \"extremely dangerous\" enterprise.\n\"On one occasion Gustavson cooked what appeared to be human testicles which were then plated to be eaten, and kept other body parts as 'trophies',\" he said.\nJudge Lucraft told the court he was \"entirely satisfied\" that the motivation \"was a mix of sexual gratification as well as financial reward\".\nSome of what happened was \"little short of human butchery\", he said.\nThe court heard how the defendant's \"Eunuchmaker\" pay-per-view website advertised services including castration, penis removal and the freezing of limbs.\nThe Old Bailey was also told how Gustavson got others to perform procedures on him, including having a nipple and his penis removed and a leg frozen.\nThe website showed the defendant and his medically unqualified accomplices - six of whom were sentenced alongside him - performing a series of operations in London flats and hotel rooms on apparently willing volunteers. Some were as young as 16.\nSometimes it all went badly wrong. The court heard several recordings of 999 calls in which Gustavson calmly lied to the operator about how his victims had in fact injured themselves.\nIn January, three men were sentenced after admitting causing grievous bodily harm to Gustavson.\nIn his defence, Gustavson's legal team claimed he only wanted to \"put a smile on people's faces\" by offering a service to those suffering, like him, from what was described as body integrity dysphoria (BID).\nHowever, prosecution barrister Caroline Carberry KC told the court: \"We suggest that diagnosis - if it exists - may explain why it is Mr Gustavson acted as he did to have his own body maimed and mutilated, but does not explain why he made a lucrative business out of mutilating others.\"\nGustavson earned almost \u00a3300,000 from his website, having amassed 22,841 visitors from across the globe who paid to view the gruesome footage, the court heard.\nSubscribers who paid the yearly \u00a3100 subscription would be entitled to VIP status, while victims were promised money from the video revenue.\nCourt documents also showed Gustavson used his business to sell human tissue gathered from the procedures, with references to a \"buy it now\" button.\nIn the end it was the bravery of one of Gustavson's victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, that led to the website being taken down.\nIn 2020, the participant told Devon & Cornwall Police about the procedures carried out on him, and provided a USB stick that contained 5,000 WhatsApp messages, 100 images and a number of videos.\nHe told police how he had been \"high on drugs\" when Gustavson had first cut him with a scalpel at his flat in Haringey, north London, and how he was strapped to a bed and electrocuted.\nIn later procedures the man told police how he had his testicles clamped and how Gustavson had used a red-hot iron designed by the victim to brand him with the initials EM - which stood for eunuch maker.\nIn a victim impact statement read to the court, the man described how he had been \"mesmerised\" by Gustavson, but now recognised he had needed to see a psychiatrist \"not a back-street surgeon\".\n\"I realise I have trusted a wrong person and Gustavson is in fact a lunatic.\"\nThe thousands of messages handed to police revealed how Gustavson was an \"arch-manipulator of victims\", who may have consented to the procedures but were themselves vulnerable, the prosecution said.\nHaving pleaded guilty to a series of charges including conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent, making and distributing indecent images of a child and possessing extreme pornography, Gustavson did not need to give evidence at a trial.\nInvestigations by journalists into Gustavson's background in Norway, and from what his defence team claimed at court, make it possible to trace how the once-respectable community figure descended into a spiral of criminality.\nOriginally from a small town to the south-west of Oslo, Gustavson was a postal worker and the chair of an LGBT charity, known for organising Pride weekends as well as the traditional \"Russ\" celebrations - a series of events and parties high school students enjoy before their final exams.\nBut by 1999 he had received a suspended prison sentence for a fraud committed against a housing co-operative and in 2001 he was sentenced to eight months for internet fraud.\nDefence barrister Rashvinderjeet Panesar said Gustavson's marriage in 2005 kept him \"stable\" but it broke do",
    "Apple has apologised after a backlash over an advert that showed objects, including musical instruments and books, being crushed by a hydraulic press.\nApple said the advert fell short of its goal of empowering and celebrating creatives, in a statement released to marketing publication Ad Age.\nThe video was meant to demonstrate how creativity has been compressed into the latest iPad.\nBut celebrities including Hugh Grant and Justine Bateman reacted with horror to the destruction shown in the advert.\n\u201cOur goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we\u2019re sorry,\u201d Tor Myhren, Apple\u2019s VP of marketing communications said in the statement. \nApple boss Tim Cook has been called tone deaf for his post on X, formerly Twitter, about the device, where he asked people to \"imagine all the things it\u2019ll be used to create\".\nThe advert attempts to show what Apple's latest tablet is capable of, such as watching television programmes, listening to music and playing video games, while making the point that the new device is particularly thin.\nIt does this by using a video theme that has been around for almost a decade of musical instruments being crushed.   \nHowever, in this instance, it seem the tech giant has also succeeded in mangling its own reputation, with complainants saying the ad actually shows how tech is stifling creativity rather than encouraging it.\nActor Hugh Grant labelled it \"the destruction of the human experience, courtesy of Silicon Valley\".\nThe criticism is particularly pointed because of the concerns in many of the creative industries about artificial intelligence (AI) taking people's jobs.\nActor and film-maker Justine Bateman, a vocal critic of the use of AI in the film industry, said Apple's ad was \"crushing the arts.\"\nMulti-platinum selling songwriter Crispin Hunt called the act of destroying musical instruments evocative of burning books.\nThe comments underneath Mr Cook's post on X have been particularly negative, with one person calling it \"extremely distasteful\", and another saying it makes them feel \"ashamed to buy Apple products\".\nPeople based in Japan appear to be prominent amongst the critics, which some said \"lacked respect\".\nSome said this was based in \"tsukumogami\u201d - a term from Japanese folklore describing a tool which can contain a spirit or even soul of its own.\n\"The act of destroying tools is arrogant and offensive to us Japanese,\" one person explained, while another said musicians valued their instruments \"more than life itself\".\nThe video has also drawn unfavourable comparisons with one of Apple's most famous adverts, which aired in 1984.\nIn a nod to its year of release (and the novel by George Orwell), the ad depicts an athlete fighting back against a dystopian future.\nOne user said the new ad was \"almost quite literally the exact opposite\" of it, and another said it showed Apple had \"become the faceless culture crashing force they rallied against in 1984\".\nAnd for one person, it was \"a visual and metaphorical bookend\" to the original advert.",
    "A free bottle of wine has finally been claimed after being hidden in the privacy policy of a tax-focused think tank's website for three months.\nTax Policy Associates added the clause in February as an experiment, to see if anyone would actually read the full terms.\nThe non-profit organisation's head Dan Neidle shared the story in a tweet on X, formerly Twitter, saying the first person to spot it would get sent a \"bottle of good wine\".\nMr Neidle - who has previously reported on high-profile tax cases, including that of former Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi - told the BBC it was his idea to add the wine offer.\nThe business has recently changed the small print on its site after the eagle-eyed discovery.\n\"We know nobody reads this, because we added in February that we\u2019d send a bottle of good wine to the first person to contact us, and it was only in May that we got a response,\" a sentence in their privacy policy now reads.\nMr Neidle said it was \"my childish protest that all businesses have to have a privacy policy and no one reads it\". \n\"Every tiny coffee shop has to have a privacy policy on their website, it\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s money that\u2019s being wasted.\"\nAny company that holds personal data, including small businesses and charities, has to have a privacy policy, according to the Information Commissioner's Office.\nIt is a key requirement under the UK's General Data Protection Regulation 2018 (GDPR).\nMr Neidle said the person who spotted the passage on his website \"kind of cheated\" because they were trying to write their own policy and looking at examples. Then they emailed the organisation saying they guessed the bottle of wine was gone, but they were in luck.\nMr Neidle said he originally did something similar when his organisation first launched over two years ago. Back then it took four months until someone spotted it.\n\"We did it again to see if people were paying more attention and they\u2019re not,\" he added.\nAs for the \"good wine\" in question that the site referred to; the lucky recipient was sent a bottle of Ch\u00e2teau de Sales 2013/14, Pomerol as a reward.\nMr Neidle said his approach was inspired by one used by the band Van Halen, who would ask for a bowl of M&Ms with all the brown ones removed as part of their tour rider.\nIt was not because they were picky eaters though, they included it as a test to make sure promoters were paying attention to their requests, which often included complicated technical instructions.\n\u201cIt was a brilliant strategy to see if people were paying attention,\" Mr Neidle said.",
    "Delving into salacious details of an alleged sexual encounter in a Nevada hotel suite with Donald Trump, adult-film star Stormy Daniels provided Manhattan prosecutors with helpful - but sometimes irrelevant - context. \nMr Trump has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges of falsifying business records in relation to a hush-money payment made to Ms Daniels. He also denies having sex with her.\nOne of the most eagerly awaited witnesses of the trial, her appearance in the Manhattan courthouse Tuesday and Thursday proved dramatic. \nBut whether her at times long-winded testimony significantly boosted prosecutors' case is unclear. \n\"She was a very sensational witness. There was a lot of evidence that came out that was wholly irrelevant,\" said former Manhattan prosecutor Diana Florence. \n\"But at the end of the day, she adds context to the story.\"\nTaking the stand in a modest look with her hair clipped back, Ms Daniels got off to a rocky start Tuesday. \nHer meandering responses to prosecutors prompted criticism from Justice Juan Merchan, who later told the court that some of it \"would have been better left unsaid\". \nMr Trump, meanwhile, sat hunched over in his seat - his son Eric just two rows behind him - as Ms Daniels aired lurid details about their alleged meeting.\nThe details included Mr Trump greeting her in silk pyjamas at his hotel suite, and her claim that he did not wear a condom when they allegedly had sex. \nThe testimony prompted Mr Trump's lawyers to lodge two mistrial requests, which Justice Merchan denied. The judge had asked prosecutors to tread carefully when probing the specifics of the alleged sexual encounter. \nBBC News reporters are in the Manhattan courtroom covering the historic first criminal trial of a former US president. You'll find their updates and analysis on the BBC news website and app, and across TV, radio and podcasts.\nBut ultimately, Ms Florence said, the day in court amounted to a \"side show\" that had little to do with the heart of the case: whether Mr Trump broke the law by classifying reimbursements for Ms Daniels' hush-money payment as \"legal expenses\". \nWhile the hush-money payment itself was not illegal, prosecutors allege he tried to cover it up to save his 2016 presidential election bid. \n\"It doesn't really matter whether they had intercourse or not,\" Ms Florence said, adding that Ms Daniels' testimony \"went on too long.\" \nStill, the material made for a tense couple of days in court, including on Thursday, as a defiant Ms Daniels went head-to-head with a forceful Trump attorney, Susan Necheles. \nMs Necheles worked to damage Ms Daniels' credibility by accusing her of making up the alleged sexual encounter. \nAt one point, Ms Necheles claimed Ms Daniels had made up the story just like the screenplays she wrote for the adult films she starred in. \n\"The sex in those films was very much real, just like what happened to me in that [hotel] room,\" a frustrated Ms Daniels responded. \nHer response was a \"mic drop\", said former Manhattan prosecutor Jeremy Saland. \n\"She hit back hard,\" he said. \nAt another point, Ms Necheles accused Ms Daniels of lying about not actually eating dinner at Mr Trump's hotel suite on the night of the alleged sexual encounter. \n\"Your words don't mean what you say, do they?\" she told Ms Daniels. \nMs Daniels stuck to the broad facts of her story. \n\"You're trying to trick me into saying something that's not entirely true,\" she told Ms Necheles later on. \nMs Necheles kept swinging, portraying Ms Daniels as a money-hungry woman who fabricated details. \nThe strategy may have been too aggressive for a witness who had an \"air of truthfulness\", Mr Saland said. \n\"She came across as very strong, and I think the defence did a poor job \u2026 in really trying to dehumanise her,\" he said. \nWith their cross-examination, Mr Trump's legal team also may have inadvertently helped the prosecution's case, experts said.\nWhile grilling Ms Daniels, the defence demonstrated exactly why Mr Trump would have tried to conceal the sex scandal before the election - to avoid association with a witness the defence team portrayed as ''tawdry,'' Ms Florence said. \n\"It was a side show at the trial - and it would've been a main event just before the election,\" she said. \nThough Ms Daniels appeared more composed during her second day of cross examination, her testimony at times aired bizarre details about her life. \nOn one occasion, Ms Necheles -  to damage Ms. Daniels' credibility - started pressing her for details on a television show she made about \"talking to ghosts\".\nMs Daniels explained that the show involved investigating ghosts at her haunted Louisiana home. In the end, though, it was just a \"giant opossum that was under the house\", she testified. \nBut the story also veered away from the business records that are key to the case.\nStill, Mr Saland said, Ms Daniels' candid answers helped set up Mr Trump's motivation for the reimbursement of the hush money - and his alleged illegal cover up. \n\"It ",
    "About 1,750 people in the UK are living with an undiagnosed hepatitis C infection after being given a transfusion with contaminated blood, according to BBC analysis.\nOfficial documents, seen by BBC News, reveal how the UK government and the NHS failed to adequately trace those who were most at risk of having the virus.\nThey show how officials slowed detection rates and even sought to keep public awareness of the virus low.\nUp to 27,000 people were exposed to hepatitis C after having blood transfusions in the 1970s, 80s and 90s.\nThe true scale of undiagnosed cases is based on BBC analysis of statistics submitted to the Infected Blood Inquiry by an expert panel, as well as Freedom of Information requests to infected blood support schemes.\nBBC News can reveal for the first time how the UK government and the NHS actively tried to limit the public's awareness of the virus to avoid embarrassing \"bottlenecks\" at liver units. Testing was limited because of \"resource implications for the NHS\". \n\"Raising awareness poses undoubted difficulties for the NHS,\" an internal government note from the 1990s says. \"In terms of value for money, there may be better candidates for additional resources.\" The document has been added to the inquiry's website.\nRather than prioritising care for those harmed by NHS-provided blood, officials squeezed budgets as cost concerns took precedence over patient safety. \nEven though it wasn't formally identified until 1989, health officials and NHS staff recognised that this form of hepatitis could be fatal as early as 1980. \nBut they chose to delay \"look back\" programmes until 1995, which further hampered efforts to track down people who may have been infected, reducing their chances of receiving treatment before permanent liver damage was caused.\nAs NHS funding for hepatitis remained limited, and awareness low, victims told BBC News how they felt doctors patronised and ignored them instead of offering tests and support.  \nKnown as the \"silent killer\", hepatitis C may cause few symptoms initially, with early signs including night sweats, brain fog, itchy skin and fatigue. But for every year a person carries the virus, their chance of dying from liver cirrhosis and related cancers increases. \nThe infected blood scandal is one of the biggest treatment disasters in NHS history - 3,000 people who were infected with HIV and hepatitis C after being given contaminated blood products have died.\u202f \nMany of the victims were haemophiliacs, who were given infected blood products as part of their treatment.\nBut many thousands more were given transfusions using contaminated blood after accidents, emergencies or childbirth.\nThe Hep C Trust says, on average, two people a month call its helpline following a diagnosis as a result of a blood transfusion more than 30 years ago. More often than not, they say their prognosis is dire. \nVictoria's mother, Maureen Arkley, was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and hepatitis C in September last year. \nBy the following month, it was clear she had untreatable liver cancer. \nMaureen had an operation in 1976 involving multiple blood transfusions. They were noted on her medical records, but at no stage was she contacted by her GP or anyone in the NHS about the fact she might have been exposed to hepatitis. \nYears later, in 2008, she began having pains in her abdomen. Tests were eventually done in 2010, including an ultrasound but the consultant concluded nothing was wrong. She wasn't tested for Hep C. \nMaureen passed away in February, five months after she was diagnosed - and 47 years after she had the blood transfusion that infected her. \n\"The end was utterly horrific, she weighed less than four stone when she died,\" says Victoria. She says her mother felt there was a stigma attached to the virus. \"She was very ashamed and hid from it. \n\"I work in social care but we just didn't make the link there was a chance someone with a blood transfusion could have been infected with hepatitis C. Where was the public health campaign? Why didn't the doctor test her?  \n\"They knew she had had transfusions, but no one tested her. I'm so angry,\" says Victoria.\nIn 1973, a Blood Transfusion Service booklet was released warning of the risks of hepatitis. Over the next 20 years, it became common knowledge that blood transfusions carried the risk of infecting patients with hepatitis. \nBut, despite this, it was not until 1995 that the UK government began a look-back exercise to find people who may have been infected by contaminated blood transfusions decades earlier.\nOther countries, including the US, started their process years before.\nHospital trusts were tasked with looking through medical records, but without funding, efforts were limited. Some people were traced but there was a postcode lottery when it came to treatments and counselling.\nA year after the exercise began, an official report noted that \"increased testing has resource implications for the NHS\".

    "The NHS continued to give patients infected blood after virus screening had been introduced in the UK. \nScreening, including for hepatitis C, began in September 1991 but there was no process to stop old, contaminated blood being used.\nBBC News has learned untested and potentially contaminated blood could have been stored for up to 10 years. \nWe have identified patients infected after 1 September 1991, who are currently unable to claim compensation.\nSchemes for victims to claim financial compensation are only open to those treated with infected blood prior to the introduction of routine virus screening. \nLawyers have told BBC News the rules about eligibility should be changed. \nCaz Challis was diagnosed with cancer in 1992 and received several blood transfusions over the next 12 months. In 1993, she was diagnosed with hepatitis C before undergoing a stem cell transplant.\nThe NHS trust where she was treated has confirmed the virus came from blood she received during her cancer treatment. \nShe is one of many victims who are not eligible for compensation. She says she has been left \"fighting for every crumb\" and feeling \"that you don't count\".  \nBeatrice Morgan, a solicitor at law firm Leigh Day, represents more than 300 infected blood victims. She is calling for compensation schemes to be extended to those who received infected blood beyond the date routine screening was introduced.\n\"Although there was a national rollout of testing of new donations from 1 September 1991, blood that was already in the system wasn't tested,\" Ms Morgan says. \"We have evidence to show that there was untested blood that slipped through the net.\" \nThe infected blood scandal is one of the biggest treatment disasters in NHS history - 3,000 people who were infected with HIV and hepatitis C after being given contaminated blood and blood products have died.\u202f\nMany victims were haemophiliacs and were given infected blood products as part of their treatment. But thousands more were given transfusions using contaminated blood after accidents, emergencies or childbirth.\nAfter years of campaigning by victims, the Infected Blood Inquiry was announced in 2017. Led by former judge Sir Brian Langstaff, it heard evidence between 2019 and 2023.\nDuring hearings at the inquiry, several doctors confirmed untested blood remained within the NHS supply after virus screening began. \n\"There was quite a lot of uncertainty about what we were doing,\" Dr Frank Boulton, who was working in the west of England at the time, said. \"I did feel a little bit nervous about the chance of HCV [hepatitis C] emerging amongst some of our recipients.\"\nGiving evidence, blood expert Professor Marcela Contreras told the inquiry that in some parts of the country there was blood in the system which had not been tested for viruses, including HIV, until as late as October 1995. Some rare blood groups \"could be frozen for 10 years\", she added.\nConcerns about remaining untested blood product stocks in the system being administered to patients had been raised by doctors before screening was introduced.\nIn February 1991, Dr John Cash, from the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service, wrote a letter to Dr Harold Gunson, who at the time was director of the National Blood Transfusion Services.\nHe asked when a decision would be made about whether existing blood stocks would be tested, noting: \"The task is doable but formidable.\"\nNo national policy was ever announced and testing was piecemeal, if it happened at all. \nDuring the Infected Blood Inquiry, Sir Brian Langstaff noted some old blood donations were not tested, saying: \"If it's right, it may have repercussions for the accuracy of the start date [of the compensation schemes].\"\nThe inquiry into the wider infected blood scandal will conclude on 20 May.\nBBC Wales Investigates: Blood Money\nHow did 3,000 people lose their lives to deadly diseases in blood?

    "A Scottish scientist has described her record-setting deep sea dive as the underwater equivalent of climbing Mount Everest.\nHeather Stewart from Edinburgh inadvertently set a new world record by being part of the deepest dive ever to be carried out by an all-female-crew.   \nShe completed the feat in the Bakunawa submersible in the South Pacific Ocean with her colleague Kate Wawatai from New Zealand.\nThe almost 10-hour dive - part of a research trip on 16 April - took them 8,000m under the surface. Everest reaches 9,000m in the opposite direction.\nSpeaking to BBC Scotland News after the mission, marine geologist Prof Stewart, 43, said she and her pilot partner were unaware they were going to break a world record.\n\"I didn\u2019t realise until that day. Kate, as we were descending, said 'I think this might be the first time that an all-female submersible crew has descended this deep'.\"\nThe area they are researching is called the Nova-Canton Trough, a geological feature called a fracture-zone that is 400 miles long and 8,000m deep.\nThe two women and a group of experts are based in Samoa, where it takes four days to sail from there to the research area.\nThey are taking part in series of four expeditions, which started at the beginning of April, each lasting 21 days. \nThe group is now on its fourth and final expedition, with Prof Stewart set to return home at the end of May. \nDuring the dive, the team gathered data to look at the ecological, biological, geological and oceanographic questions about how that area of the world functions.\nProf Stewart said it was an \"amazing opportunity\" and compared the scale of the dive to the world's highest mountain.\n\"It's almost 9,000m high and we\u2019re studying a feature that\u2019s 8,000m deep. \n\"We\u2019re kind of exploring the underwater equivalent of a mountain range in scale. Instead of going up, it\u2019s a long linear hole in the sea floor rather than a set of mountains.\"\nDespite working as a marine geologist since 2001, Prof Stewart only did her first dive in 2019.\nShe has now completed five, with her first ever deep dive below 6,000m being a record breaker.\nDespite her relative lack of diving experience, Prof Stewart says she only gets a \"bit\" nervous.\n\"It isn\u2019t something that most people would ever get the opportunity to do, so the technology isn\u2019t necessarily familiar.\n\"I think nerves are good because it shows a bit of respect for what we\u2019re doing as well, it\u2019s not easy and not a lot of people do it, but I\u2019m not scared.\"\nDuring the series of dives, she has had the opportunity to see features which nobody has ever seen before.\n\u201cWe\u2019re down there doing research but at the same time, it's amazing seeing the sea floor and the features that we\u2019re seeing for the first time. We\u2019re the only people that have ever seen these,\" she said.\nAs a geologist, Prof Stewart is looking at the structure of rocks and sediment, trying to unpick the processes that are going on at these depths. \nShe is also studying how geological features such as fracture zones act as pathways for deep ocean currents, which are key in regulating the Earth's climate.\n\"I\u2019m also seeing these amazing sponges, fish and octopus and lots of other fauna that live in the deep sea.\"\nShe said that time spent on the sea floor goes \"in the blink of an eye\" because you don\u2019t know what you're going to come across, so it\u2019s \"really exciting\".\nProf Stewart and Mrs Wawatai have daughters and nieces and hope to inspire young women to go in to Stem [science, technology, engineering, and mathematics].\n\u201cMy kids are still young. I talk to them about me going away. It sounds really mushy but they are really proud of me,\" she said\n\"If either of them wanted to go in to a career in research, that would be totally awesome.\n\"Something that Kate and I do talk about a lot, even if we just inspire a handful of kids to consider going into a Stem career, that's truly our job done.\"",
    "A Premier League boss has been granted a High Court anonymity order in a civil case against him for allegedly sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl.\nHe is being sued for aggravated damages by a woman who says the offences took place two decades ago.\nA BBC investigation has already revealed the boss remains in position despite a police investigation over the alleged rape of a different girl, 15.\nThe judge said the order was necessary for the \"administration of justice\".\nA civil case against the boss was filed in January, and his lawyers have successfully argued to the court that an order be implemented to prevent his name from being released by the media.\nMaster Stevens, who sits as a judge in the King's Bench Division of the High Court, said in court documents that she had considered human rights to private and family life, as well as freedom of expression, when making her decision. \nShe concluded last month that the protection of the boss' identity was necessary to \"secure the proper administration of justice\", adding there was \"no sufficient countervailing public interest\" in his name being disclosed.\nPrivacy rules in the UK apply to identifying suspects in the early stages of police investigation, however the media is usually allowed to report cases in court, including civil courts.\nEarlier this year, the BBC asked the court for documents related to this case but the court did not respond to the journalist making the request or provide them with notice of the anonymity application, therefore the BBC were unable to make representations objecting to the order before the judge's decision.\nThe alleged victim in this civil case reported allegations of sexual abuse to the police in 2021, but no further action was taken due to legislation which stated that if an offence of \"unlawful sexual intercourse\" took place between 1956 and 2004, and the alleged victim was a girl aged 13 to 15, she had to make a complaint within a year. The legislation only applies to girls, not boys.\nIn court documents, seen by the sports news publication the Athletic, the civil action details accusations against the Premier League boss of sexual abuse and claims he \"committed trespass to the claimant's person (assault and battery) and intentionally inflicted injury\". This is said to have caused psychological harm to his alleged victim.\nIn an investigation in November, the BBC revealed how the boss was still in post despite being under criminal investigation for raping a different 15-year-old, who we are calling Kate, in the 1990s.\nKate told the BBC she was \"terrified\" to come forward.\nCommenting on the recent decision by the High Court, Kate said: \"Courts should not be swayed by the wealthy and powerful, no matter how long ago the allegations occurred.\n\"Other potential victims need to know that they are trying to be stopped and brought to justice, as this might give them the courage to come forward after years, even decades, of silent horror.\"\nA third woman, Lisa, told the BBC investigation that she was locked in a room by the boss during a job interview and alleges he tried to coerce her into sexual activity.\nShe was recently told that no further action would be taken by the police in relation to her allegation.\nThe club and FA have been informed of the allegations against the Premier League boss, but he has continued his prominent role within football - representing his club at games and events.\nThe BBC found that seven out of 20 Premier League clubs have had players or bosses investigated by the police for sexual offences since 2020. \nThe Football Association (FA) and Premier League have been accused of prioritising commercial interests over the safety of women.\nThe powerful status of figures within the highest level of football has led to calls for suspensions until allegations have been fully investigated.\nKate, believes the lack of action within football and the protection of the boss' identity is putting further women and children at risk. \nThe FA told the BBC they do not comment on individual cases, adding: \"We have robust safeguarding measures in place and all referrals into us are handled in line with our policies and procedures.\n\"We investigate and assess all allegations and concerns about individuals who may pose a risk of harm to children and adults in football and, where applicable, can impose proportionate safeguarding measures in accordance with FA safeguarding regulations.\"\nDo you have information about this story that you want to share?

    "The discovery of small stone carved with an early form of Celtic script has caused excitement among archaeologists after being dug up in a garden.\nIt was found by geography teacher Graham Senior in Coventry during lockdown in 2020 while he was weeding, but its true value was only recently understood.\nDating back possibly as far as the 4th Century, the stone's Ogham script features a series of lines inscribed on three of its sides, and experts are trying to understand their full meaning.\nTeresa Gilmore, finds liaison officer for Staffordshire and West Midlands said: \"It's an amazing find, we're very lucky.\"\nShe added: \"Most Ogham inscriptions you generally find in the more Celtic areas - Scotland, Ireland and down in Cornwall - you don't generally get them down in the Midlands.\"\nMr Senior told the BBC he had a \"fair idea\" what the stone was when he found it, but was unable to find someone to confirm his suspicions and \"hit a brick wall\".\nBut he said that changed when Katherine Forsyth from the University of Glasgow \"took the trouble to come down with a researcher\" a few months ago.\nShe partially translated the script to reveal a name: Mael Dumcail.\nMr Senior said his theory was that it could have been a keepsake, possibly carried by a Roman soldier.\n\"It\u2019s a very tactile thing - just feels right as if it was meant to be held,\" he said.\nThe piece of sandstone measures just 11cm (4 inches) in length and is believed to have been carved sometime between the 4th and 6th Century AD.\nMs Gilmore said another theory was that it could have been used by Irish tradesmen to make contact with each other.\nThe team said Ogham was highly unusual among world writing systems, consisting solely of parallel lines in groups of one to five.\nThey said it could provide an insight into the Irish language before the use of the Latin insular script\nShe said the discovery took her by surprise, but finds like this can \"leave more questions than answers\".\nShe hopes to learn more when the rest of the stone is translated.\nIt is due to go on display at the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry on Saturday, as part of a free exhibition titled Collecting Coventry.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The Bank of England held interest rates at 5.25% in May, but cuts are expected later in the year.\nInterest rates affect mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK.\nAn interest rate tells you how much it costs to borrow money, or the reward for saving it.\nThe Bank of England's base rate is what it charges other lenders to borrow money.\nThis influences what other banks charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, and the interest they pay on savings.\nThe Bank of England moves rates up and down in order to control UK inflation - the increase in the price of something over time.\nWhen inflation is high, the Bank - which has a target to keep inflation at 2%- may decide to raise rates.\nThe idea is to encourage people to spend less, to help bring inflation down by reducing demand.\nOnce this starts to happen, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them.\nThe Bank rate is currently at its highest level for 16 years.\nHowever, it was higher than this for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and was 17% in November 1979.\nThere have been questions about why interest rates have not been cut, with inflation dropping sharply.\nInflation was at 3.2% in March - down from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022. Further falls are expected.\nFollowing May's decision to keep interest rates at 5.25%, the Bank's governor Andrew Bailey said he was \"optimistic that things are moving in the right direction\".\nBut he said the Bank needed to \"see more evidence\" that price rises had slowed further before cutting interest rates.\nIt left open the possibility of an interest rate cut in June, after two sets of new figures for inflation and wages are published. However, a cut later in the summer is considered more likely.\nThe Bank has to balance the need to slow price rises against the risk of damaging the economy - which has shown little sign of growth.\nMortgages\nJust under a third of households have a mortgage, according to the government's English Housing Survey.\nWhen interest rates rise or fall, more than 1.2 million people on tracker and standard variable rate (SVR) deals usually see an immediate change in their payments.\nMore than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. While their monthly payments aren't immediately affected, any future deals are. \nMortgage rates are much higher than they have been for much of the past decade.\nThis means homebuyers and those remortgaging have to pay a lot more than if they had borrowed the same amount a few years ago. \nAbout 1.6 million deals will expire in 2024, according to banking trade body UK Finance.\nYou can see how your mortgage may be affected by interest rate changes by using our calculator:\nCredit cards and loans\nBank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans. \nLenders could decide to put their rates up if they expect higher interest rates from the Bank of England. However, if rates fall, interest payments may get cheaper.\nSavings\nThe Bank of England interest rate also affects how much savers can earn on their money. \nIndividual banks and building societies have been under pressure to pass on higher interest rates to customers.\nThere are some good deals on the market and experts say customers should shop around, as money may be in accounts paying little or no interest.\nThe UK's financial watchdog warned banks will face \"robust action\" if they offer unjustifiably low savings rates to customers.\nInterest rates have been increasing across the world over the past few years. \nHowever, in recent months, other central banks - including the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank - have also paused their rate rises, with the next moves expected to be downwards.\nThe UK has had one of the highest interest rates in the G7 - the group representing the world's seven largest so-called \"advanced\" economies.",

I apologise for the hurt caused by my actions.\"\nThe former minister also wrote about receiving abuse online during the pandemic, some of which she said was misogynistic.\nShe concluded by saying she hoped lessons could be learned \"to ensure that we are better placed to protect lives in the event of a future pandemic\".\nMs N\u00ed Chuil\u00edn said there needed to be better information sharing and co-operation with the Irish government.",
    "Rappers have been trading insults since the dawn of hip-hop. \nIt's part of the culture. A test of lyrical skill and a declaration of superiority that has produced hundreds of classic \"diss tracks\", from 2Pac's Hit 'Em Up to Jay-Z's Takeover.\nThe latest beef originally erupted between three of hip-hop's biggest stars - Drake, Kendrick Lamar and J Cole - all triggered by a seemingly innocuous lyric praising their respective careers.\nAs tensions grew, Cole dropped out of the fight. However, Drake and Kendrick continue to battle with increasing ferocity - levelling life-changing accusations against each other in a flurry of tracks.\nHere's a guide to the battle's history, its fire starters, flashpoints and future.\nDrake (above left) - the Canadian actor-turned-musician whose vulnerable blend of rap and R&B has made him the most commercially successful hip-hop artist of the 21st Century. Among his multi-platinum hits are tracks like Hotline Bling, One Dance and Hold On We're Going Home.\nKendrick Lamar (centre) - A Compton-born rapper whose compelling rhymes and conceptual vision have seen him named the best rapper of his generation. One of the most inventive lyricists in the game, he tackles big topics like police brutality, black self-worth and his own internal conflicts. In 2018, he became the first hip-hop artist to win the Pulitzer Prize for music.\nJ Cole (right) - Born in Germany and raised in North Carolina, J Cole was mentored by Jay-Z and went on to score hits with songs like Middle Child and Deja Vu. But he grew disenchanted with the trappings of commercial success and began to forge his own path with more introspective, analytical songs, resulting in some of the most popular and successful music of his career.\nWhen Kendrick Lamar was a young up-and-comer, Drake offered him a helping hand by inviting him onto his Take Care album, and giving him an opening spot on his 2012 Club Paradise Tour.\nBut in 2013, after the success of Lamar's debut record Good Kid, m.A.A.d City, he made his ambitions clear. \nDuring a guest verse on Big Sean's Control, he called out Drake, J Cole, Meek Mill, Mac Miller, Pusha T and a host of other rappers, warning them: \"I got love for you all, but I'm trying to murder you.\"\nAsked about the diss, Drake told Billboard Magazine: \"I didn't really have anything to say about it. It just sounded like an ambitious thought to me. That's all it was. \n\"I know good and well that [Lamar]'s not murdering me, at all, in any platform. So when that day presents itself, I guess we can revisit the topic.\"\nThe rappers traded a few jibes over the next few years (Lamar memorably boasted that he'd \"tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes\" during the BET hip-hop awards) but it never seemed particularly serious. \nThe initial spark was a gesture towards unity, rather than division.\nIn October last year, Drake released his eighth album For All The Dogs, which featured a collaboration with J Cole called First Person Shooter.\nIn one verse, Cole suggested that he, Drake and Kendrick were the \"big three\" of the current era of hip-hop.\n\"Love when they argue the hardest MC / Is it K. Dot [Kendrick]? Is it Aubrey [Drake]? Or me? / We the big three, like we started a league.\"\nThe song debuted at the top of the US singles chart, becoming Drake's 13th and Cole's first number-one song. \nThe achievement meant Drake tied with Michael Jackson for the most number one singles by a male solo artist. \nA week later, Taylor Swift's Cruel Summer replaced them at number one, and the moment seemed to have passed. But privately, Kendrick had taken note - and he wasn't happy.\nIn March 2024, producer Metro Boomin' and rapper Future released a collaborative album called We Don't Trust You.\nHidden in the tracklisting was a song called Like That with an uncredited verse by Kendrick Lamar... and it was explosive.\nWith a tightly-wound, expletive-laden delivery, he took aim at Cole's verse, claiming there was no \"big three - it's just big me\".\nHe went on to call Drake and Cole's best verses insubstantial - \"a light pack\" - and declared he was the Prince to Drake's Michael Jackson.\nThe power of the verse can't really be conveyed in print, but when it ends with Lamar promising to put all of Drake and J Cole's \"dogs\" in the \"pet sematary\" - the name of a Stephen King 1983 horror novel - you know a fuse has been lit.\n(NB: Lamar doesn't mean literal pet dogs, but the rappers' nearest and dearest. The lyric doubles up as a reference to Drake's album title, For All The Dogs)\nIt's worth noting that the placement of Lamar's verse is also significant, as Metro Boomin' is a former Drake collaborator who fell out with the Canadian star.\nMetro, whose real name is Leland Wayne (more on him later), produced the majority of Drake's 2015 album What A Time To Be Alive, but a promised sequel never materialised, allegedly leading to bad blood between the pair.\nIn 2022, the producer removed Drake from a song called Trance, and unfollowed him on I",
    "Venezuela may be the first nation in modern history to lose all its glaciers after climate scientists downgraded its last one to an ice field.\nThe International Cryosphere Climate Initiative (ICCI), a scientific advocacy organisation, said on X that the South American nation's only remaining glacier - the Humboldt, or La Corona, in the Andes - had become \"too small to be classed as a glacier\".\nVenezuela has lost at least six other glaciers in the last century.\nWith global average temperatures rising due to climate change, ice loss is increasing, helping to raise sea levels around the world.\n\"There has not been much ice cover on the last Venezuelan glacier since the 2000s\", Dr Caroline Clason, a glaciologist at Durham University, told Newsround. \"Now it's not being added to, so it has been reclassified as an ice field.\"\nIn March, researchers at the University of Los Andes in Colombia told AFP the glacier had shrunk from 450 hectares to just two.\nLuis Daniel Llambi, an ecologist at the university, told the Guardian that it had now shrunk to less than that.\nWhile there is no global standard for the minimum size a body of ice must be to qualify as a glacier, the US Geological Survey says a commonly accepted guideline is around 10 hectares.\nOne study, published in 2020, suggested the glacier shrank to less than this sometime between 2015 and 2016 - though it was still considered Venezuela's last glacier by Nasa in 2018.\nDr James Kirkham and Dr Miriam Jackson, glaciologists with the ICCI and the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development respectively, explained that \"glaciologists recognise a glacier as an ice mass that deforms under its own weight\".\nThey told the BBC in a joint statement: \"Glaciologists often use a criteria of 0.1 sq km [10 hectares] as a common definition, but any ice mass above that size still has to deform under its own weight [to count].\"\nThey suggested that there may have been issues accessing the Humboldt glacier in recent years, which could have delayed the publication of the measurements.\nProfessor Mark Maslin, a professor of earth system sciences at University College London, said an ice field like the Humboldt - roughly equivalent to the area of two football pitches - \"is not a glacier\".\n\"Glaciers are ice that fills valleys \u2013 that\u2019s the definition \u2013 and therefore I would say Venezuela has no glaciers whatsoever,\" he told the BBC.\nIn December, the Venezuelan government announced a project to cover the remaining ice with a thermal blanket it hoped would stem or reverse the thawing process.\nBut the move drew criticism from local climate scientists, who warned that the covering could contaminate the surrounding habitat with plastic particles as it degraded, according to Spanish newspaper El Pais.\nProf Maslin said mountain glacier loss was \"not directly reversible\" as to survive through the summer months they needed enough ice to reflect sunlight and keep the air around it cool.\n\"Once a glacier\u2019s gone, the sunlight heats the ground, makes it much warmer and makes it much less likely to actually build ice up over the summer,\" he said.\nMaximiliano Herrera, an extreme weather researcher, wrote on X/Twitter that the next countries that were likely to become glacier-free were Indonesia, Mexico and Slovenia.\nProf Maslin said these suggested nations \"make logical sense\" because of their relative proximity to the equator and relatively low-lying mountains, which made their ice caps more susceptible to global warming.\n\"The warm zones are just expanding upwards and outwards with climate change,\" he said, pushing the point at which snow and ice can form year-round higher.\nThe author of several books on climate change said these smaller glaciers \u2013 like the one recently lost in Venezuela \u2013 did not contain enough ice to substantially raise sea levels when they melt. But in some regions, glaciers play a crucial role in supplying communities with fresh water, particularly during hot, dry periods.\n\"Once you get rid of that, the problem is you\u2019re then purely reliant on spot rainfall,\" he said.\nDr Kirkham and Dr Jackson said: \"The latest projections show that between 20 and 80% of glaciers globally will be lost by 2100 (with significant regional variation), depending on the emissions pathway followed.\"\nThey said that even though \"a portion of this loss is already locked in\", rapidly lowering CO2 emissions could save other glacial deposits, \"which will have enormous benefits for livelihoods, and energy, water and food security\".",
    "Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed Israel can \"stand alone\", after the US warned arms shipments could be stopped if he orders a full-scale invasion of Rafah in Gaza.\nThousands of people have already fled the southern city after the Israeli military began what it called a \"limited\" operation on Monday.\nUS President Joe Biden has repeatedly warned against the operation, saying that it would cross a \"red line\".\nBut Mr Netanyahu dismissed the US warning, saying Israel would fight on.\n\"If we need to ... we will stand alone. I have said that if necessary we will fight with our fingernails,\" the prime minister said. \nMr Netanyahu also invoked the war of 1948 - where the newly formed State of Israel was attacked by a coalition of Arab states - to dismiss the US warnings. \n\"In the War of Independence 76 years ago, we were the few against the many,\" he said. \"We did not have weapons. There was an arms embargo on Israel, but with great strength of spirit, heroism and unity among us - we were victorious.\"\nDespite Mr Netanyahu's comments, his government has come under pressure after the US suspended the delivery of 1,800 2,000lb (907kg) bombs and 1,700 500lb bombs over fears that they could cause civilian deaths in Rafah. \nMr Biden went further still in an interview with CNN on Wednesday, saying that if the attack went ahead he would further suspend supplies of artillery shells and other weapons. \nYoav Gallant, Mr Netanyahu's defence minister, dismissed the US warnings, saying Israel's \"enemies as well as ... best of friends\" should understand that his country \"cannot be subdued\". \n\"We will stand strong, we will achieve our goals,\" he added. \nThe comments came hours after the UN said more than 80,000 people had fled Rafah since Monday amid constant bombardment and as Israeli tanks massed close to built-up areas.\nThe UN also warned that food and fuel were running out for the more than one million still sheltering in the city, because it was not receiving aid through nearby crossings.\nIsraeli troops took control and closed the Rafah crossing with Egypt at the start of their operation, while the UN said it was too dangerous for its staff and lorries to reach the reopened Kerem Shalom crossing with Israel.\nIsraeli forces said they were conducting \"targeted raids\" against Hamas elements remaining in the city. However, the Israeli government has refused to rule out a full scale invasion, leading to Mr Biden's warning he would not supply it with the munitions to do so.\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby said Mr Biden did not believe \"smashing into Rafah\" would advance Israel's objective of defeating Hamas.\n\"An enduring defeat of Hamas certainly remains the Israeli goal, and we share that goal with them,\" Mr Kirby said. \n\"The argument that somehow we're walking away from Israel, or we're not willing to help them defeat Hamas just doesn't comport with the facts,\" he said.\nPalestinian media said two people were killed on Thursday afternoon in an Israeli air strike in the al-Jneineh neighbourhood of Rafah - one of the eastern areas which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ordered residents to evacuate before beginning its ground operation began on Monday night.\nAnother three people were reportedly killed in an air strike in the nearby Brazil area, which is not in the evacuation zone but is next to the Egyptian border.\nHamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) - which are proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the US and other countries - said they were targeting Israeli forces on the eastern outskirts with mortar bombs and anti-tank missiles.\nHamas also said it had blown up a booby-trapped tunnel east of Rafah underneath three Israeli military vehicles. The IDF said three of its soldiers were moderately wounded as a result of the explosion.\nOvernight, at least five people were reportedly killed when a family's home in the western Tal al-Sultan neighbourhood was hit in an Israeli strike. They included three children, one of them a one-year-old infant, medics said.\nMeanwhile hopes of a peace deal - which seemed close earlier in the week before Israel said it did not past muster - appeared to be fading. Both Israeli and Hamas delegations left indirect talks in Cairo on Thursday.\nAfter seven months of war in Gaza, Israel insists victory is impossible without taking the city of Rafah and eliminating the last remaining Hamas battalions.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities.\nMore than 34,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nIsrael says 128 hostages are unaccounted for, 36 of whom are presumed dead.",
    "I am sitting in a shopping mall in Iraq, face-to-face with one of Europe\u2019s most notorious people-smugglers.\nHis name is Barzan Majeed, and he is wanted by police forces in several countries, including the UK.\nOver the course of our conversation - both here and the next day at his office - he says he does not know how many migrants he has transported across the English Channel.\n\u201cMaybe a thousand, maybe 10,000. I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t count.\u201d\nThe meeting is the culmination of what had seemed like an impossible task a few months earlier.\nTogether with Rob Lawrie, a former soldier who works with refugees, I had set out to find and question the man known as Scorpion.\nFor several years, he and his gang controlled much of the people-smuggling trade - in boats and lorries - across the English Channel.\nMore than 70 migrants have died making the crossing by boat since 2018 - last month, five people were killed off the French coast, including a seven-year-old girl.\nIt is a dangerous journey, but for the smugglers it can be very lucrative. \nThey can charge \u00a36,000 per person for a boat crossing - and with nearly 30,000 people attempting it in 2023, the potential for profit is obvious.\nOur interest in Scorpion had begun with a little girl we met in one of the migrant camps near Calais, in northern France.\nShe had almost died trying to cross the English Channel in an inflatable dinghy.\nThe dinghy was not seaworthy - it was cheap, bought second-hand in Belgium - and the 19 people on board had no lifejackets.\nWho would send people out to sea like this?\nWhen police in the UK pick up illegal migrants, they take and inspect their mobile phones.\nFrom 2016 onwards, the same number kept cropping up.\nIntrigue: To Catch A Scorpion\nBBC journalist, Sue Mitchell, and volunteer aid worker, Rob Lawrie go on a dramatic hunt for one of Europe's most-wanted crime bosses. Code-named Scorpion, he's smuggled thousands of people into the UK and is on the run.\nListen now to the Radio 4 podcast on BBC Sounds\nOften it would be stored under the name \u201cScorpion\u201d. Sometimes it would be stored as a picture of a scorpion.\nMartin Clarke, a senior investigating officer at the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency (NCA) told us that officers started to realise \u201cScorpion\u201d referred to a Kurdish Iraqi man called Barzan Majeed.\nAs a 20-year-old in 2006, Majeed had himself been smuggled into England in the back of a lorry. Despite being refused leave to remain a year later, he stayed several more years in the UK - some of it in prison for gun and drug offences.\nHe was finally deported to Iraq in 2015. Shortly after this, it is believed that Majeed \u201cinherited\u201d a people-smuggling business from his elder brother, who was serving a jail sentence in Belgium. \nMajeed became known as Scorpion.\nBetween 2016 and 2021, Scorpion's gang is believed to have controlled much of the people-smuggling trade between Europe and the UK.\nA two-year international police operation resulted in convictions for 26 members of the gang at courts in the UK, France and Belgium. \nBut Scorpion himself evaded arrest and went on the run.\nIn his absence, he was tried in a Belgian court and convicted of 121 counts of people-smuggling. In October 2022, he was sentenced to 10 years in jail and fined \u20ac968,000 (\u00a3834,000).\nSince then, Scorpion\u2019s whereabouts were unknown. This was the mystery we wanted to crack.\nA contact of Rob introduced us to an Iranian man who said he dealt with Scorpion when he had been trying to get across the Channel. Scorpion had told the Iranian he was based in Turkey, from where he was co-ordinating his business remotely.\nIn Belgium, we tracked down Majeed\u2019s elder brother - now out of jail. He also said Scorpion was likely to be in Turkey.\nFor most migrants heading to the UK, Turkey is an important staging post. Because of its immigration laws, it is relatively easy to get a visa to enter the country from Africa, Asia and the Middle East.\nA tip-off led us to a cafe in Istanbul frequented by people-smugglers. Barzan Majeed had recently been seen there.\nOur initial enquiries did not go well. We asked the manager if he could tell us about the trade - the cafe went quiet. \nSoon after, a man passed our table and unzipped his jacket to show us he was carrying a gun. It was a reminder that we were dealing with dangerous people.\nOur next stop yielded more promising results. We were told that Majeed had recently deposited \u20ac200,000 (\u00a3172,000) at a money exchange a few streets away. We left our number there, and in the middle of the following night, Rob's phone rang.\nThe caller ID said \u201cNumber withheld\u201d - on the end of the line was someone claiming to be Barzan Majeed.\nIt was so late, and so unexpected, there was no time to record the beginning of the call. Rob recalled the voice on the line: \u201cHe goes, \u2018I hear you\u2019re looking for me.\u2019 And I go, \u2018Who are you? Scorpion?\u2019 He goes, \u2018Ha, you want to call me that? That\u2019s fine.\u2019\u201d\nThere was no way of telling whether this was the real Barzan Majeed, but the ",
    "With the Chinese economy facing massive challenges, there have been concerns over its growth potential, at least in the immediate future.\nYet a key exception is emerging in the form of domestic tourism.\nLast week's five-day public holiday to mark labour day saw 295 million trips made within China, according to figures from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. This was 28% higher than pre-pandemic figures recorded in 2019.\nThe Transport Ministry's figures are also staggering: 92 million rail trips; almost 10 million air trips and 1.25 billion highway journeys.\nHowever, this comes as international arrivals continue to lag, with foreigners currently entering China at barely 30% of 2019 levels. Why the disparity?\nThe beautiful historical river town of Wuzhen, a short drive from Shanghai, is considered one of China's top visitor sites for travellers of all types. When we arrive the little pathways and old bridges which cross narrow waterways are filled with visitors.\nA popular thing to do in Wuzhen is to pose for photos dressed in traditional hanfu clothing - as if you have really been transported back hundreds of years.\nTwo women in their 20s, friends since high school, are visiting from Jilin Province in the north east. After arriving, they spend an hour getting their hair done in an elaborate imperial-era style - and they are full of praise for Wuzhen's classical beauty. \nWe ask if, following the post-Covid opening up, many of their family and other friends have been travelling much? \"Of course, after the pandemic, we're all visiting other places.\"\nNearby a local man who is selling ice-creams also says tourist numbers are \"not that bad lately\".\nAs good as before Covid? \"Almost the same,\" he replies.\nShopkeeper Wang Ying, who sells traditional snacks, echoes this sentiment with a big smile on her face. \"Business is going well, and it'll only get better.\"\nAll this will be seen as good news for the Chinese government. It's been saying that a push on domestic consumption can counter the significant faltering portions of the economy.\nMajor players in the once-mighty property sector are struggling to stay afloat, local government debt continues to rise, and persistent youth unemployment has left highly qualified university graduates uncertain of their future.\nAmid all these challenges, the Communist Party has set a target of \"around 5%\" GDP growth for this year. Apart from the fact that analysts have long questioned the veracity of the country's official growth figures, economists are also asking how such a target can be reached, in any genuine sense, in 2024 without significant extra stimulus.\nOne lifeline could be a more buoyant travel scene which could bring broader business opportunities and greater service industry employment.\nSchubert Lou, chief operating officer at travel agency Trip.com, told the BBC: \"We've seen very strong domestic travel demand with search volumes in hotels up 67% compared to last year, and flight volumes up 80%.\"\nTourism industry consultant Peng Han from Travel Daily is following the investment trail to see how the business community really views the possibilities in the sector.\n\"With famous international hotel brands - like Intercontinental, Marriott and Hilton - you just have to look at their growth in China in 2023,\" he says. \"Then check the performance goals for these large hotel groups in 2024 which have also been set relatively high. This shows that they are very optimistic about the growth potential of the Chinese market.\"\nBut, while the volume of local travellers might be up, Mr Peng does point to the problem of per capita consumption which remains persistently low.\nHe says general uncertainty about the Chinese economy is putting more emphasis on saving, so people are looking for good value options. They are going on holidays and paying for things but doing so much more frugally.\nThis is where an increase in big-spending foreigners could help. But they are simply not travelling to China in the numbers they used to. \nIn 2019, nearly 98 million international visitors came to the country. Last year it was only 35 million - including business trips, students and the like. Mr Lou describes the domestic versus international market as \"uneven\".\nFor many in the tourism industry here specialising in services for foreign travellers, \"uneven\" would be an understatement. Three years of harsh Covid prevention measures drove down arrivals from other countries, but that alone can't account for the current situation.\nHuang Songshan, the head of the Centre for Tourism Research in the School of Business and Law at Australia's Edith Cowan University, blames this weakness in part to \"the shifting geopolitical landscape globally\".\nIn the peer-reviewed East Asia Forum, he pointed to a 2023 survey carried out by the Pew Research Centre, writing that, \"Most individuals in Western nations hold unfavourable views towards China. The Chinese government's tightening grip on societal regulations could potent",
    "Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has struck a defiant tone after the failure of her bid to remove Mike Johnson as Speaker of the House of Representatives.\nShe had demanded Mr Johnson be kicked out due to his support for a $61bn aid package for Ukraine.\nHowever, Democrats joined Republicans in a 359-43 vote to kill her motion.\nMs Greene's speech on the House floor was met by loud boos from other members of the chamber.\nOn Thursday, Ms Greene posted on X, formerly Twitter: \"Democrats voted to save Johnson because they knew it was impossible to take control of the House. \n\"They want to keep Johnson because he's given them everything they want... The good news this morning is now the American people have been shown the truth.\" \nThe long-telegraphed motion proved to be a rare act of defiance against the party's presumptive presidential nominee - Donald Trump. He had previously voiced support for the House Speaker and called the drive to oust him \"unfortunate\".\nOnly two other Republican members of Congress supported Ms Greene's motion: Thomas Massie and Paul Gosar.\nJoined by Mr Massie, Ms Greene stood on the House floor and criticised Mr Johnson for a series of compromises he has struck with Democrats, who hold a majority in the Senate.\n\"This is the 'uniparty' for the American people watching,\" she said of politicians in the chamber as they booed her.\n\"By passing the Democrats' agenda and handcuffing the Republicans' ability and influence legislation, our elected Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has aided and abetted the Democrats and the Biden administration in destroying our country,\" she added.\nMr Johnson could be seen walking around the House floor after Ms Greene began her motion, with Republican supporters shaking his hand and patting him on the back.\nShortly after the vote, Mr Johnson said he hoped this would end \"the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress\".\n\"I'm glad that this distraction is not going to inhibit that important work and all the other things that are on the table and on the agenda for us right now,\" he added.\nAt the time of Ms Greene's speech, Mr Trump posted a message on his Truth Social platform calling on Republicans to reject her motion to vacate the speaker's post.\nWhile Mr Trump began his post with \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene\", he told Republican members of Congress that \"this is not the time\" to remove Mr Johnson. \n\"If we show DISUNITY, which will be portrayed as CHAOS, it will negatively affect everything!\" he said, adding that the Republican Speaker was a \"good man who is trying very hard\".\nIn March, Ms Greene filed the motion that would eventually trigger the vote on Mr Johnson's removal, though it was unclear when or if she would advance it. \nShe did so on Wednesday by forcing the Republican-led chamber to hold a vote on the House leader's position in no more than two legislative days. \nThe same legislative move was used to remove former Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy in the autumn, leaving the chamber without an elected leader for three weeks. \nDemocrats made the unusual move to back a Republican House Speaker due to the razor-thin margins in the chamber, but they recently criticised Mr Johnson for holding several meetings with her this week. \n\"When Speaker Johnson meets with her for hours, the American people should be asking 'what is Marjorie Taylor Greene extracting from the speaker?'\" Democratic congressman Ted Lieu said on Tuesday, according to Axios.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Johnson said the talks were not a \"negotiation\" and denied that Republican leaders were considering any concessions for her support.

    "A barrister who worked for a firm advising the Post Office says he was \u201cmisled and deceived\u201d by them about evidence in the key case of sub-postmistress Seema Misra.\nSimon Clarke from the law firm Cartwright King played a crucial role in bringing those prosecutions to an end.\nHe was giving evidence at the Horizon Inquiry, which aims to explain how hundreds of sub-postmasters were falsely accused of taking money from the tills, using evidence from a flawed computer system\nMr Clarke told the inquiry about how he came to realise that a key expert witness was not sharing information about software bugs that caused accounting discrepancies.\nIn frank and often self-critical testimony, Mr Clarke admitted that hearing about the bugs had been a \u201cbombshell\u201d.\nMore than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly convicted for theft and false accounting using evidence from the faulty computer system.\nIt appears few people played a more pivotal role than Gareth Jenkins.\nThe senior engineer from Fujitsu was a key architect of the flawed IT system which ran in every Post Office across the UK, and he provided expert evidence in several court cases testifying that the system was robust.\nHis evidence was pivotal in the case of Seema Misra, the sub-postmistress from West Byfleet in Surrey who was sent to jail in 2010 - while pregnant \u2013 for alleged theft.\nOn Thursday, the Horizon Inquiry was shown a transcript of a phone call, during which the barrister Mr Clarke discussed what Gareth Jenkins knew about the software bugs. Mr Clarke's law firm, Cartwright King, was working with the Post Office at the time.\nThe transcript confirmed that Mr Jenkins knew of two bugs in the Horizon system, and that he could not be sure there were not more. It indicated that he must have known of the bugs earlier because he had informed the independent investigators Second Sight that they existed.\nA few weeks later Mr Clarke wrote formal legal advice to the Post Office which warned that Mr Jenkins had failed to disclose information \u201cin plain breach of his duty as an expert witness\", and this put the Post Office \u201cin breach of its duty as a prosecutor\u201d.\nA lawyer for Mr Jenkins told the BBC in March it would be \"inappropriate\" for him to comment ahead of him giving evidence to the Inquiry in June.\nHowever, despite raising these doubts over Mr Jenkins\u2019 testimony, Mr Clarke advised the Post Office that the information did not have to be disclosed to lawyers representing  Mrs Misra.\nThat information would have allowed her to mount an \u201cirresistible\u201d appeal against her conviction, and would have helped defendants in other cases too, lawyers at the Inquiry suggested.\nMr Clarke said Post Office lawyers never showed him all the documents from the Misra trial.\nHe said he had asked \u201con a number of occasions\u201d to see the file of documents relating to the trial.\n\u201cI came to the conclusion that it was deliberately withheld from me,\u201d he said.\nHe said he was \u201cmisled\u201d by the Post Office over whether there were other Horizon bugs, too.\nWhen he joined the Post Office in 2013, Mr Clarke said he asked for a copy of the Post Office\u2019s prosecution policy \u2013 the rules they used to decide whether to proceed with prosecutions against sub-postmasters.\nWhat came back was a \u201csingle A4 document, badly photocopied\u201d, he told the Inquiry. \u201cI can\u2019t remember what it said, but it wasn\u2019t a prosecution policy,\u201d he said.\nHe proposed a revised version based on the Crown Prosecution Service\u2019s policy, and was disappointed when what he called a \u201cwatered-down\u201d version was adopted.\n\nLater in 2013 Mr Clarke wrote another memo warning that the Post Office was destroying evidence of Horizon bugs raised in regular \"hub\" meetings, convened to pool knowledge of problems with the system. He advised that the practice must stop.\nHe was asked about why he carried on working for the Post Office, once he knew about Gareth Jenkins\u2019s situation and the shredding of evidence about the bugs.\n\u201cI am a bit old-fashioned about this,\u201d he said. \u201cBarristers don\u2019t just walk away from their clients when life gets difficult.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s trite,\u201d he said, but he kept working for the Post Office \u201cin the hope that I could do some good for them.\u201d\nThe inquiry continues.",
    "The annual Red Square military parade felt different this time round.\nAnd not just because of the spring snowstorm.\nThere were 9,000 people marching across the square. Sounds a lot. But in previous years \u2013 before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2013 the numbers were often higher.\nThere was less military hardware on display, too, today. The only tank was one T-34.\nWhat there were plenty of were references to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Among the participants of the parade were soldiers who\u2019d been fighting there.\n\u201cWe mark Victory Day at a time when we are carrying out the Special Military Operation,\u201d President Vladimir Putin said in his Red Square address. \u201cThose taking part on the frontline are our heroes.\u201d\nIn recent days Russia has accused Western nations, including the UK and France, of threatening Russia. President Emmanuel Macron has not ruled out sending ground troops to Ukraine.\nToday Vladimir Putin issued a warning to the West. Accompanied by more nuclear sabre-rattling.\n\u201cRussia will do everything to avoid a global confrontation,\u201d the Kremlin leader said. \u201cBut at the same time, we will not allow anyone to threaten us. Our strategic forces are always on combat alert.\u201d\nUnder Vladimir Putin, Victory Day has become Russia\u2019s most important secular holiday. \nA day for remembering, not only the Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany, but also the enormous human cost of that victory - the more than 27 million Soviet citizens killed in what\u2019s known here as the Great Patriotic War.\nBut in many ways Victory Day isn\u2019t just about the past. It\u2019s about Russia now. \nIf this country today has any kind of national idea, it is the idea of victory. Russians are constantly being told that throughout history their country has come under attack from enemies abroad \u2013 like Napoleon and Hitler \u2013 and has emerged victorious.\nIn Russia today the authorities are not just remembering the past. They are weaponising it, to try to justify the present.\nThey want the Russian public to view the war in Ukraine as a continuation of World War Two, so that Russians believe that once again external forces are fighting to destroy Russia. Today\u2019s enemies - Ukraine and the West.\nIn reality, it was Russia that annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and intervened militarily in the Donbas.

    "Universities \"may need to take action\" if  protests against the Israel-Gaza war interfere with life on campus,  the president of Universities UK has said.\nProf Dame Sally Mapstone said there should be no presumption universities would clear protest encampments but all students must be able to take their exams and graduate.\nThe leaders of 17 universities met the prime minister earlier to discuss the protests and steps they should take to tackle antisemitism. \nThe Union of Jewish Students said it wanted the meeting to be followed by  \"decisive action\".\nThe police were called to Newcastle University on Wednesday, after escalated protests prevented some students accessing counselling services.\nProtesters have told BBC News the encampments are \"completely peaceful\".\n\nSt Andrews University principal and vice-chancellor Dame Sally said universities took a recent rise in antisemitism on campus \"extremely seriously\" and \u201cconcrete actions\u201d had been agreed at the meeting to ensure universities knew how to draw \u201cimportant lines\u201d.\n\u201cThere is behaviour that is acceptable when people are protesting\u2026 and behaviour that is not acceptable because it is against the law,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of this can be tricky.\u201d\nAsked whether universities should clear encampments, Dame Sally said vice-chancellors would monitor who was involved in the protests \u2013 noting that not everybody was a student -  and that \u201cwe shouldn't automatically presume that universities will straight away say \u2018you have to move off our land\u2019\u201d.\nBut she added: \u201cWhere there is clear evidence that encampments are interfering with good university business and with the rights of students and staff to go about their business \u2013 to take exams, to do their degree shows, to graduate - then universities may need to take action.\u201d\nEdward Isaacs, president of the Union of Jewish Students, told the BBC the government gave \u201creassurances\u201d to Jewish students during the meeting and offered to help universities in efforts to tackle antisemitism.\nBut he added: \u201cWhile the commitments were important, it's what follows next that will really matter for Jewish students.\u201d\nHe said vice-chancellors needed to take \u201cdecisive action\u201d, including using the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism. The definition, in part, describes it as \"a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred towards Jews\".\nThere must be \u201cclear communication\u201d with Jewish societies, Mr Isaacs added - and \"red lines need to be drawn\" when it came to protests, which the UJS previously warned were creating a \u201chostile and toxic atmosphere for Jewish students\u201d.\nThe encampments appearing on about 15 UK university campuses in recent days and weeks are much smaller than those in the US.\nThe student activists want their universities to divest from Israel in response to its military operation in the Gaza Strip.\nDivestment means selling off stock in Israeli companies or otherwise dropping financial ties.\nIsrael launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.\nMore than 34,780 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nIssy, who is protesting outside the University of Leeds, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cOf course we\u2019re opposed to antisemitism and we\u2019re opposed to all forms of oppression.\u201d\nStudents at the University of Lancaster, the latest to see tents springing up, described their encampment as \u201ca liberated space\u201d, with events and collective meals.\n\u201cAnyone is welcome to join us,\u201d the students said in a statement. \nProtests at Newcastle University escalated on Wednesday, with a rally blocking access to its King's Gate building.\n\nOne student, Gemma, who is not protesting and asked for her surname to be withheld, told BBC News protesters had blocked the entrance to the building, which houses student-support services such as counselling, financial and visa help, leaving students unable to attend appointments.\n\u201cI feel really strongly that the local university students should not be being impacted by this protest,\" she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s often hard for students to build up the courage to get to a [counselling] session in the first place, so placing barriers to these services saddens me.\u201d\nGemma added she had been \u201calso faced with shouts via megaphone about us all enabling or supporting genocide\u201d.\nNewcastle University said some services had been moved online and students would be contacted to rebook missed appointments.\n\"We continue to work with the police and our security, to ensure the safety and security of our campus,\" it said in a statement.\n\u201cThe student protesters have been reminded of our guidance that enables them to exercise their right to protest in a way that respects our university and our community.\"\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak warned, on Wednesday, protests were disru",

    "The Duke of Sussex has told the BBC it has been great to be back in the UK this week.\nThe BBC was given exclusive access to Prince Harry's final engagement during his short trip to London.\nHe was the surprise guest at a party hosted by the charity Scotty's Little Soldiers, which supports the bereaved children of military personnel.\nPrince Harry threw himself into the spirit of the party.\nWithin minutes of arriving, his jacket was off, he had a bucket on his head and teams of children were targeting him with plastic balls.\nIt was a side of him that we've not seen so much of lately - on show was the fun, informal prince.\nIn comparison, other recent visits have been more sombre or formal, such as the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, an appearance at the High Court to give evidence during the phone-hacking case, the King's coronation, and a visit to see his father after King Charles's cancer diagnosis.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped back as senior Royals in January 2020, and that year they moved to California, saying they wanted space to raise their son, Archie. Their daughter Lilibet was born there in 2021.\nPrince Harry's visits back to London are not straightforward. Relationships between him and other Royals remain broken and there was no fix to be had this week. The prince and King Charles were at events just two miles apart on Wednesday but didn't meet up. . A statement from the duke attributed this to his father's \"full programme\", but said that he \"hopes to see him soon\".\nDespite these strained relationships, Harry told me it was \"great\" to be back in the UK. \nSpeaking about attending the party, the prince said it was \"amazing\". \n\"What Scotty's is doing with these kids is absolutely incredible and very needed as well. \n\"The more opportunity you get to do these kinds of events, the more the families and kids know this place exists which is really the most important thing.\"\nWe spent around an hour with Harry.\nSince the prince left the UK for the US, it has been rare to see him up close in a context such as at the Scotty's party. \nEvery child attending the party, like Harry, had experienced the death of a parent.\nHe talked privately to a group of them about how he'd coped with the death of his mother, Princess Diana, and offered his own advice on dealing with the pain.\nNikki Scott founded Scotty's Little Soldiers after her husband, Lee, was killed in Afghanistan in 2009.\n\"I would imagine Prince Harry got so much from that room and had so much fun and joy that I wouldn't mind betting that he's probably thinking about those children right now because it does that to you, it really makes you think, these children are incredible,\" she said.\nAs well as showing his compassionate side, when it came to the party games, Harry was competitive.\nHe was on the winning team for the fastest consumption of a strawberry lace sweet but less successful when it came to rolling a Malteser down a tape measure into someone's mouth - something he learnt required a high level of skill.\nAnd no chocolate went to waste. At least three Maltesers that rolled off the tape were picked up off the floor and eaten by the fifth in line to the throne.\nThis party was the first event he'd been able to attend in person with Scotty's Little Soldiers, after becoming a global ambassador for it in November and having previously been involved since 2017.\nAs the party wrapped up - there were goodies to hand out and take home.\nFor Prince Harry that included a Lego figure of himself.\nThe family fallout and the move to California has limited what Prince Harry has been able to do for the organisations he supports in the UK.\nThese kind of events are now a personal rather than royal duty.\nWhile family ties remain fractured, Prince Harry's charity work is an important link to the place that was once home.",
    "President Joe Biden has warned Israel that the US will stop supplying some weapons if it launches a major ground operation in the Gaza city of Rafah.\n\"If they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah,\" he said during an interview with CNN.\nHe added that he would \"continue to make sure Israel is secure\".\nDespite firm and vocal US opposition, Israel appears poised to mount a large-scale invasion of Rafah.\nThe congested part of southern Gaza is Hamas's last major stronghold in the territory. US officials have warned that an operation in the city - where the population has swelled with refugees from other parts of Gaza - could lead to extensive civilian casualties.\n\"We're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells,\" Mr Biden said in the interview, which aired on Wednesday.\nIsrael's ambassador to the UN said the country was \"very disappointed\" by Mr Biden's intervention. \n\"If Israel is restricted from entering an area as important and central as Rafah where there are thousands of terrorists, hostages and leaders of Hamas, how exactly are we supposed to achieve our goals?\" he said on public radio.\nMr Biden told CNN that the US did not define the current situation in Rafah as a ground operation. \"They haven't gone into the population centres. What they did is right on the border,\" he said.\n\"But I've made it clear to [Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu] and the war cabinet, they're not going to get our support, if in fact they go in these population centres.\"\nMr Biden acknowledged that US weapons had been used by Israel to kill civilians in Gaza.\nWhen asked if Israel had crossed a \"red line\", the US president replied \"not yet\".\nThe comments amount to the president's strongest warning yet over a potential ground invasion of Rafah, and mark the first time he has said the US could stop shipments of American weapons to Israel.\nThe US has already delayed a shipment of thousands of bombs to Israel, and has said it is reviewing future deliveries.\nOn Wednesday, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed the delay of the bomb shipment - some of the most destructive munitions in Western military arsenals - while testifying in front of the Senate.\nThe weapons being held back by the US are related to a future delivery, so the move is unlikely to have an immediate impact. But given the rate at which Israel is bombing it will probably affect future strikes fairly soon.\nThe Israeli military, meanwhile, has said that the two countries will resolve disagreements \"behind closed doors\".\nPresident Biden faces mounting domestic pressure - from some Democrats and parts of the US public - to rein in Israeli operations in Gaza amid rising civilian deaths and a worsening humanitarian situation.\nWith November's presidential election looming, opinion polls indicate many young voters and Arab-Americans in key states such as Michigan are critical of what they see as the president's support for the Israeli war effort. \nUS officials confirmed that no new aid supplies had been delivered in Gaza via two gates in the south since Israeli tanks rolled into southern Rafah and took control of the Palestinian side of the crossing with Egypt this week.\nRafah has been a key entry point for aid, and the only exit for people able to flee, since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas last October.\nThe crossing remained closed on Wednesday morning, but the Israeli military said it was reopening the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing, which had been closed for four days because of Hamas rocket fire.\nOn Monday, the Israeli military ordered tens of thousands of civilians to begin evacuating eastern parts of Rafah city, ahead of what it called a \"limited\" operation to eliminate Hamas fighters and dismantle infrastructure.\nMeanwhile, efforts continue to reach a ceasefire, alongside the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. In Cairo, delegations from Israel and Hamas have resumed negotiations through mediators.\nA US official said that talks with Israel were \"ongoing and have not fully addressed our concerns\" and the US had been reviewing its weapons transfers to Israel since April.\nIsrael launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.\nMore than 34,780 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nA deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel says 128 hostages are unaccounted for, 36 of whom are presumed dead.\nAdditional reporting by Raffi Berg",

    "A nursery worker denied she \"persecuted\" a nine-month-old baby who died in her care.\nKate Roughley, 37, found Genevieve Meehan unresponsive on 9 May 2022 at Tiny Toes in Cheadle Hulme, Stockport.\nThe prosecution alleged the she \"allowed her dislike to manifest\" as the child was left \"virtually immobilised\" on a beanbag for 90 minutes before she died.\nMs Roughley denies manslaughter and an alternative charge of child cruelty.\nGenevieve's parents, John Meehan and Katie Wheeler, were at Manchester Crown Court on Thursday as the jury was shown CCTV footage from the day the baby died. \nThe jury, which was also shown footage from the baby room from May 5 and 6, was told Genevieve was subject to \"illogical and disturbing hostility\". \nPeter Wright KC, cross-examining, told the court that whatever the child \"did or didn't do\" it was \"never going to be satisfactory\" for Ms Roughley. \n\"You allowed your dislike of a nine-month-old child to manifest itself in ill-treatment that you meted out to her,\" he added. \nMs Roughley, from Heaton Norris, Stockport, denied the claims as Genevieve's parents sat behind her in court.\nShe said: \"I would never not like a nine-month-old baby. So to say I disliked her is far from the truth.\"\nMs Roughley rejected the suggestion the CCTV footage showed Genevieve was in distress. \nThe prosecution said the youngster died from a combination of asphyxia and pathophysiological stress after the defendant placed her face down, tightly swaddled and strapped to a beanbag.\nIt is alleged she then ignored the cries and distress of Genevieve, and showed \"sporadic\" and \"fleeting\" interest in her wellbeing, for 97 minutes.\nMr Wright told Ms Roughley that the footage shown the child \"moving violently\" and in distress.\nMs Roughley said she did not see Genevieve in \"discomfort and distress\" on the beanbag, and her position was how she went to sleep \"previous times at the nursery\".\nMs Roughley told the court she and other members of staff would often engage with children by singing rhymes to them.\nBut Ms Roughley was then asked by the prosecution: \"What rhymes with 'whinger' or 'diva', or other such remarks you have made to her?\"\nShe replied: \"I would not say diva is malicious. \n\"It's just when children are showing their personality off. \n\"Genevieve would not have been the only child I would have called a diva.\n\"Often we would say to children 'stop whingeing'. \n\"This was not shouted at the children or said in any malicious way. \n\"They were just passing comments through the working day.\"\nWhen asked if she believed Genevieve's death was avoidable, Ms Roughley said if she checked on her a \"couple of seconds or minutes earlier it may have been different\". \nBut she added the baby girl was sleeping on the beanbag \"like many children had done before\".\nShe told the court she felt responsible for Genevieve being in her care that day but added: \"I don't feel my actions were the reason for the death.\"\nThe trial continues. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Florida police have publicly released body camera footage from a deputy sheriff who fatally shot a US Air Force member at his home. \nSenior Airman Roger Fortson, who was 23 years old, was taken to a hospital where he died, officials said.\nA lawyer for the victim's family, citing a witness, alleged the police burst into the wrong home. \nPolice have disputed the claim and said the deputy reacted in self-defence after he saw Fortson armed with a gun. \nThe airman was shot on 3 May at his home, located 5 miles (8km) from the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field, Florida, where he is based.\nThe deputy who shot him - whom police have not named - has since been placed on administrative leave.\nOkaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden said the shooting was being investigated by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the State Attorney's Office.\nMr Aden promised to provide \"transparency and accountability\" but added: \"These investigations take time.\"\n\"But I want to assure you that we are not hiding, covering up, or taking any action that would result in a rushed judgment of Mr Fortson or our deputy.\"\nThe sheriff showed a four-minute video taken from the body camera worn by the deputy who fired the fatal shots. \nThe clip showed police arriving at Fortson's apartment complex, and being led to an elevator by a witness who said she had heard fighting coming from an apartment. \nThe deputy then approached the front door alone, knocked, and twice called out that he was a member of the \"sheriff's office\".\nFortson was seen holding a gun in his right hand as he opened the door. The deputy then fired multiple shots as soon as the door opened, telling him afterwards to drop the weapon. \n\"It's over there. I don't have it,\" Fortson said as he lay on the floor.\nA lawyer for the Fortson family, Ben Crump, said in a news conference on Thursday that Fortson \"was the best America had to offer\".\n\"He was a patriot. He was a US airman, special ops. He was fighting for our way of life. He was fighting for everybody,\" Mr Crump said.\nHis mother, Chantimekki Fortson, broke down crying as Mr Crump recounted the moments before the airman was shot. \n\"My baby was my everything,\" she said. \nMr Crump said at the time of the shooting Fortson was on a video call with a friend, who described what she heard to his family's legal team.\nThe friend said the airman heard a knock on his apartment door and asked who was there, but received no response. He then heard a second, \"very aggressive knock\" but did not see anyone when he looked through the peephole.\nIt is at this point that Fortson is said to have grown concerned and retrieved his gun, which the lawyer said was legally owned. \nAs Fortson returned to his living room, the witness said police burst through the door, saw that the resident was armed and shot him six times. \nMr Crump said the witness believed the officers were in the wrong apartment, as Fortson was alone at the time with no disturbance at his residence.\nThe sheriff on Thursday denied that officers had gone to the wrong address. \nIn an earlier statement, the sheriff's office said the deputy \"reacted in self defence after he encountered a 23-year-old man armed with a gun and after the deputy had identified himself as law enforcement.\"\nSpeaking to reporters, Mr Crump accused police of trying to \"justify unjustifiable excessive use of force\".\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron, according to the US Air Force, and entered active duty in November 2019. \nAccording to Mr Crump, he enlisted in the military after graduating from high school in Atlanta, Georgia with honours. \nMr Crump, a civil rights lawyer based in Florida, has worked on multiple high-profile cases of police-involved deaths of black Americans, including George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Tyre Nichols and Breonna Taylor.

    "Donald Trump's youngest child, Barron Trump, is to enter the political limelight with a role at July's Republican National Convention. \nDelegates from across the US will formally select the party's nominee for president at the gathering in Wisconsin - set to be Barron's father. \nThe 18-year-old has been named on a list of delegates-at-large to attend the event for the state of Florida. \nPreviously, Barron's mother Melania has kept him largely out of the public eye.\nThe only child from their nearly two-decade marriage, Barron did not immediately move to Washington after his father's inauguration.\nHe remained with his mother at their Trump Tower home in New York to finish his school year before they relocated in the summer of 2017.\nHis move to the White House, at age 11, made him the first male child to live there since John F Kennedy Jr in 1963.\nAttending a private school in Maryland, he rarely appeared in public, with his mother reported to be fiercely protective of his privacy.\nComments on his appearance and behaviour from his father's critics often drew fierce rebukes from the first lady's office, as well as from other former first children, most notably Chelsea Clinton.\nSince the family's move to Florida post-presidency, Barron has attended a private school in Palm Beach and continued an impressive growth spurt - he now stands at 6ft 7in (201cm).\nThe high school senior, who graduates next week, appears on the Florida delegate list with a number of the ex-president's close allies, according to NBC News.\nThe list includes Barron's half-siblings Eric, Donald Jr and Tiffany - but not Ivanka, who has publicly said she will not be a part of her father's re-election campaign.\nIn a statement to US media, the Florida party chairman Evan Power said: \"We are fortunate to have a great group of grassroots leaders, elected officials, and members of the Trump family working together as part of the Florida delegation.\"\nA Trump campaign official told ABC News that Barron was \"very interested in our nation's political process\".\nThe party convention, to take place in the city of Milwaukee on 15-18 July, will see Mr Trump confirmed as the Republican candidate for November's presidential election.\nHe has won enough state-level primary contests - including one held in Florida - to clinch the nomination. Each of the nation's 50 states\u00a0and several territories send delegates to the convention to officially vote for their presidential candidate, which is expected to be a simple process since there is no viable challenge to Mr Trump. \nThe ex-president has already won 2,037 delegates in the Republican primary election, far more than the 1,215 needed to clinch the nomination.\nOn the other side of the political divide, President Joe Biden is due to be confirmed as the Democratic nominee at his party's convention in Chicago this August, setting up America's first presidential rematch since 1956, when Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican, again defeated Adlai Stevenson, a Democrat.\nThis time, Mr Trump is juggling his campaigning with legal battles. He faces dozens of criminal charges across four separate cases.\nHis first criminal trial is under way in New York City, where he has been charged with falsifying business records. He denies any wrongdoing.\nHe has been given special permission by the judge to take time out of court to attend Barron's high-school graduation next week.  ",
    "Former chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has said he will stand down as an MP at the next election.\n\"My mistakes have been mine,\" he announced on X in a lengthy statement.\nMr Zahawi was sacked as Tory Party chairman in January last year after an inquiry found he had failed to disclose that HMRC was investigating his tax affairs.\nHe has been MP for Stratford-on-Avon for 14 years and said it had been his \"greatest honour\" to serve its people. \nMr Zahawi is the 64th Conservative MP to announce he'll stand down at the next election, and the 104th MP.\nReferring to the role as the \"MP for Shakespeare\" he said: \"As my most famous constituent once wrote: 'Go to your bosom; knock there and ask your heart what it doth know'.\n\"I have come to feel that the time is right for a new, energetic Conservative to fight for the honour of representing Stratford-on-Avon and assuming the mantle of MP for Shakespeare.\"\nMr Zahawi was education secretary from September 2021 to July 2022 and had a short stint as chancellor of the exchequer between July and September 2022.\nIn November 2020, in the middle of the pandemic, he was appointed vaccines minister and oversaw the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine programme for nearly a year.\nBorn in Iraq in 1967, he could have been sent to fight in the 1980s Iran-Iraq War but instead he and his parents fled Iraq and he grew up in the UK.\nIn his statement on X, Mr Zahawi said: \"Every morning as I shave my head in the mirror, I have to pinch myself. How is it that a boy from Baghdad who came to these shores, fleeing persecution and unable to speak a word of English, was able to do as much as I have?\"\nHe said helping his constituents in their time of need \"remains one of the most meaningful things I have ever done\" and pledged the Conservative Party \"will continue to have my unswerving support into and beyond the next general election\".\nMr Zahawi made his fortune after co-founding the online polling company YouGov in 2000 and is believed to be one of the richest politicians in the House of Commons. \nHis political career started when he was elected as a Wandsworth councillor in 1994, being re-elected three times, and unsuccessfully contesting the Erith and Thamesmead seat in 1997 before being elected as the MP for Stratford-upon-Avon in 2010.\nA keen equestrian, Mr Zahawi had to apologise for claiming parliamentary expenses for electricity to supply his stables and a mobile home in the stable yard in 2013, saying he was \"mortified by this mistake\" and paying back about \u00a34,000.\nHe began to climb the ministerial ladder when Theresa May made him an education minister and was known as a safe pair of hands.\nThis opened the door for him to become chancellor when Mr Sunak dramatically quit the role in July 2022, during the mass resignations that forced Boris Johnson out of Downing Street.\nMr Zahawi was given the role due to his robust defence of Mr Johnson but, after a few days, he too called on Mr Johnson to leave.\nAfter unsuccessfully bidding to replace Mr Johnson as the next Tory leader, he backed Liz Truss and then Mr Sunak, who made him Conservative Party chair when he became prime minister.\nIt was during Mr Zahawi's period as chancellor when questions were raised about the sale of shares in YouGov and whether this was taxed correctly, which eventually led to Mr Sunak sacking him for a serious breach of the ministerial code.\nStratford Can, a group of disgruntled former Conservative members who formed a group intending to run an alternative conservative candidate against Mr Zahawi at the next election, welcomed the move.\nSpokesman David Spencer said: \"That his resignation statement fails to mention a single meaningful achievement that he has delivered for this town during his 14 years as MP says everything about his negligible tenure as our local MP.\"",

    "Universities \"may need to take action\" if  protests against the Israel-Gaza war interfere with life on campus,  the president of Universities UK has said.\nProf Dame Sally Mapstone said there should be no presumption universities would clear protest encampments but all students must be able to take their exams and graduate.\nThe leaders of 17 universities met the prime minister earlier to discuss the protests and steps they should take to tackle antisemitism. \nThe Union of Jewish Students said it wanted the meeting to be followed by  \"decisive action\".\nThe police were called to Newcastle University on Wednesday, after escalated protests prevented some students accessing counselling services.\nProtesters have told BBC News the encampments are \"completely peaceful\".\n\nSt Andrews University principal and vice-chancellor Dame Sally said universities took a recent rise in antisemitism on campus \"extremely seriously\" and \u201cconcrete actions\u201d had been agreed at the meeting to ensure universities knew how to draw \u201cimportant lines\u201d.\n\u201cThere is behaviour that is acceptable when people are protesting\u2026 and behaviour that is not acceptable because it is against the law,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of this can be tricky.\u201d\nAsked whether universities should clear encampments, Dame Sally said vice-chancellors would monitor who was involved in the protests \u2013 noting that not everybody was a student -  and that \u201cwe shouldn't automatically presume that universities will straight away say \u2018you have to move off our land\u2019\u201d.\nBut she added: \u201cWhere there is clear evidence that encampments are interfering with good university business and with the rights of students and staff to go about their business \u2013 to take exams, to do their degree shows, to graduate - then universities may need to take action.\u201d\nEdward Isaacs, president of the Union of Jewish Students, told the BBC the government gave \u201creassurances\u201d to Jewish students during the meeting and offered to help universities in efforts to tackle antisemitism.\nBut he added: \u201cWhile the commitments were important, it's what follows next that will really matter for Jewish students.\u201d\nHe said vice-chancellors needed to take \u201cdecisive action\u201d, including using the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism. The definition, in part, describes it as \"a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred towards Jews\".\nThere must be \u201cclear communication\u201d with Jewish societies, Mr Isaacs added - and \"red lines need to be drawn\" when it came to protests, which the UJS previously warned were creating a \u201chostile and toxic atmosphere for Jewish students\u201d.\nThe encampments appearing on about 15 UK university campuses in recent days and weeks are much smaller than those in the US.\nThe student activists want their universities to divest from Israel in response to its military operation in the Gaza Strip.\nDivestment means selling off stock in Israeli companies or otherwise dropping financial ties.\nIsrael launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.\nMore than 34,780 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nIssy, who is protesting outside the University of Leeds, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cOf course we\u2019re opposed to antisemitism and we\u2019re opposed to all forms of oppression.\u201d\nStudents at the University of Lancaster, the latest to see tents springing up, described their encampment as \u201ca liberated space\u201d, with events and collective meals.\n\u201cAnyone is welcome to join us,\u201d the students said in a statement. \nProtests at Newcastle University escalated on Wednesday, with a rally blocking access to its King's Gate building.\n\nOne student, Gemma, who is not protesting and asked for her surname to be withheld, told BBC News protesters had blocked the entrance to the building, which houses student-support services such as counselling, financial and visa help, leaving students unable to attend appointments.\n\u201cI feel really strongly that the local university students should not be being impacted by this protest,\" she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s often hard for students to build up the courage to get to a [counselling] session in the first place, so placing barriers to these services saddens me.\u201d\nGemma added she had been \u201calso faced with shouts via megaphone about us all enabling or supporting genocide\u201d.\nNewcastle University said some services had been moved online and students would be contacted to rebook missed appointments.\n\"We continue to work with the police and our security, to ensure the safety and security of our campus,\" it said in a statement.\n\u201cThe student protesters have been reminded of our guidance that enables them to exercise their right to protest in a way that respects our university and our community.\"\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak warned, on Wednesday, protests were disru",
    "A family has hailed a barman \"a hero\" for saving the life of their choking baby.\nTwenty-month-old Khalil accidentally lodged a bottle cap in his throat during a family meal at Katana restaurant in Peterborough on Sunday.\nBarman Joshua Smith, 32, who had previously been a coastguard before joining the Army, heard pleas for help and managed to get the cap out with his fingers after trying to get Khalil to cough.\nMum Maryam Wbwama praised Mr Smith for his \"life-saving skills and quick response\". Mr Smith said he was \"humbled\".\nMs Wbwama, a nursing student, said the episode was \"scary... too scary. I was holding my baby but I could see he was struggling to breathe\".\n\"But Josh was phenomenal - he was so calm and knew exactly what to do. It's great that the restaurant had someone like him with such life-saving skills. He saved my baby's life and we are so grateful.\"\nThe mum-of-three also thanked the other restaurant staff and paramedics for their support.\nMr Smith said his career had taught him first aid skills - and it was not the first life he had saved, which helped him stay calm.\n\"I heard the mum scream, 'He is choking.' So, I knew it was serious,\" he said.\n\"I eventually intervened and took the baby from the dad. I started with slapping his back to get him to cough.\n\"But I could see a silver bit in his throat, so the object was still inside. I put my fingers in carefully and then slowly took it out.\n\"He then thankfully started breathing, but just as a precaution I called 999 and then let the paramedic - who came in minutes - take over to check him up.\n\"You can't let nerves get the better of you... you have to take a deep breath and focus on the situation on hand.\n\"I do appreciate the gratitude from everyone, but don't know how I feel... maybe humbled. I have been here before though - this is the fourth life I have saved.\"\nSaran Raj, director of operations at the restaurant on Broadway, said the team was \"very proud of Josh's heroic efforts\" and a \"special gesture\" had been planned for him on Friday.\nFollow Peterborough news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The Scottish Greens have urged First Minister John Swinney not to adopt the \"repressive values of the 1950s\" after appointing Kate Forbes as his deputy. \nMs Forbes was criticised by Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie for her views on LGBT rights, gay marriage and abortion.\nShe returned to government following a year on the backbenches after agreeing last week not to stand against Mr Swinney for the SNP leadership.\nMaking his debut at First Minister's Questions, he defended his deputy and insisted the minority SNP government would be a \"moderate left of centre\u201d administration. \nMr Swinney was officially sworn in on Wednesday after Humza Yousaf resigned as the result of the fallout from his decision to rip up a power-sharing agreement with the Greens. \nMs Forbes, a member of the Free Church of Scotland who has been criticised for her socially conservative views, returned to government as his deputy, as well as cabinet secretary for the economy and Gaelic. \nThe Greens abstained in the vote to nominate Mr Swinney as first minister, guaranteeing him a majority, but Mr Harvie urged the new first minister to give a signal of what direction his new government would take.\nHe said: \u201cYesterday that signal came pretty clearly - progressive ministers sacked, and the second most powerful job in government given to someone who has opposed LGBT people\u2019s legal equality, who has expressed judgemental attitudes against abortion, and who has even expressed the view that people who have families without being married are doing something wrong.\u201d\nHe asked: \u201cIs this the Scottish government\u2019s vision for the future of Scotland - taking us back to the repressive values of the 1950s?\u201d\nMr Harvie questioned whether the first minster understood \u201cjust how worried\u201d many LGBT people and others were in Scotland.\nHe went on to demand that Mr Swinney continued with \u201cprogressive\u201d taxation and did not \u201cgive in to the right wing of his party\u201d.\nThe SNP leader said his government would be led from the \u201cmoderate left of centre\u201d political position.\nThe first minister said Ms Forbes had delivered progressive taxation during her time as finance secretary, between 2020 and 2023. During that time, her budgets were supported by the Scottish Greens.\n\u201cI want to lead a modern, dynamic and diverse Scotland, Mr Swinney said. \u201dA place for everybody, where everybody feels at home, at peace, where they have a place and that their place in our society is protected by my leadership of this country.\u201d\nSpeaking to reporters afterwards, Ms Forbes said: \"I am here to support the first minister and together we serve all communities in Scotland as we further and progress the rights of every community in Scotland, and I look forward to doing my part in achieving the government's aims in that regard.\u201d\nShe said she had signed up the government\u2019s collective responsibility, adding: \u201cSo I stand by the government's decisions and agenda to improve and progress the rights of all of Scotland's communities.\"\nMSPs voted to formally approve the appointment of Ms Forbes later on Thursday. \nThe Greens opposed the move, with MSP Ross Greer telling parliament: \"We cannot support the appointment of someone who believes not only that equal marriage is wrong, but also children being born outside of marriage.\"\nThe official LGBT+ wing of the SNP also said it had \u201cconcerns\u201d about the appointment.\nThe Out For Independence executive posted on social media saying it wanted \u201curgent clarification\u201d that policies such as a ban on conversion therapy would not be \u201cstalled\u201d.\nMs Forbes was the only addition to Mr Swinney's cabinet, with the rest of Mr Yousaf's senior team retained. \nHowever, the new first minister discarded the minister for independence from his first government.\nJamie Hepburn, who held the post, took over as minister for parliamentary business from George Adam.\nMr Adam, as well as former ministerial colleagues Joe Fitzpatrick and Emma Roddick, have moved to the backbenches, while Ivan McKee - an ally of Ms Forbes - returned to government as public finance minister.\nMr Swinney served in SNP cabinets for 16 years before stepping down from government in 2023.\nAt First Minister\u2019s Questions, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross asked whether the government would uphold a commitment made by Mr Swinney in his previous role as education secretary to increase teacher numbers by 3,500 by 2026.\nHe pointed to a report commissioned by the government, published this week, that said the target would have \u201csignificant implications for cost and sustainability\u201d and could raise questions about whether it delivered \u201cmaximum value for money\u201d.\nThe report found teacher numbers had fallen by 252 from 2021 to 2023.\nMr Ross also pointed to reports Glasgow City Council could cut about 450 teacher jobs over three years.\nHe told MSPs the government had a record of \"broken promises\" on education and said it was \"not being straight\" with Scots.

    "Jersey has been celebrating its 79th Liberation Day, marking the day the island was freed from occupation.\nOn 9 May each year the island celebrates the end of occupation and the end of World War Two.\nThe Channel Islands were the only part of the British Isles to be occupied by German forces during the war.\nThis year's celebrations include a service of thanksgiving, music, dancing and a re-enactment of the British soldiers landing in Jersey.\nA special States meeting took place at 10:30 BST, where Chief Minister Lyndon Farnham delivered a Liberation Day address.\nHe described the stories he heard about the occupation from his family.\nHe said: \u201cIt was hearsay on 28 June 1940 that they remember the three of them on the beach looking for sand eels when German bombers flew over at low level - so low in fact that they could clearly see the pilot in the cockpit.\n\u201cThey ran up to the perceived safety of the summerhouse and heard the bombs falling on La Rocque, and then St Helier.\u201d\nMr Farnham said his family remembered \u201csecretly listening to radio broadcasts from London\u201d, and his grandparents \u201cgoing without\u201d so the children could eat.\nHe said: \u201cFor the rest of his days my father always ate everything on his plate which impressed me as a child -  I watched with a slight bewilderment as he ate plate after plate of unappetising looking greens, \u2018we would have been glad of these during the war\u2019, he used to say.\u201d\nThe meeting was followed by a procession from the Royal Square to Liberation Square, consisting of the Bailiff, the Lieutenant governor, States members and other senior officials.\nThe Musical Originals choir sang at Liberation Square prior to the Bailiff\u2019s speech.\nIn his speech, Sir Tim Le Cocq recognised the spirit of service in Jersey by honouring those who contributed to the island.\nHe said: \u201cFrom the front-line workers who serve to keep us safe to the volunteers who lend a helping hand to those in need, to those wherever they are from who would not consider themselves as anything out of the ordinary, but who all embody the spirit of community in their everyday lives.\n\u201cOn a lighter note even our traffic system has a unique filter in turn rule that relies upon taking turns and courtesy to keep the island moving - it's what we are.\u201d\nA union flag was also raised at the Pomme d'Or during the celebrations.\nThe weather provided the perfect setting for a day of joy and jubilation. \nThe chief minister told the States Assembly about his father's and uncle's experiences of occupation and how it disrupted their idyllic childhood. \nBut he said while those stories shocked and saddened, they also inspired and reminded islanders not to take our freedom for granted. \nThat message was one we regularly heard amongst the celebrations. Politicians and faith leaders pointing to conflicts around the world to remind islanders how precious the freedom we enjoy is. \nThe rendition of Beautiful Jersey was, as always, one of the most poignant and haunting moments of the day.\nIslanders have reflected on their experience of the occupation, including Iris Prigent, who said her late husband Gordon's work at a German slave camp in Alderney affected him for the rest of his life.\nJersey Heritage is putting special memorial stones across the island to commemorate significant islanders from the war years, including Mr Prigent.\nDavid Perchard, a member of Le Ronde Concert Band, remembered the Liberation in 1945, when he was five years old.\nHe said: \"I particularly remember we all went down on the Albert Pier to wait for the Tommies to come in and we were standing there waiting and the boat came through the pier heads.\n\"Instead of coming to the Albert Pier it went on to what we now called the new North Quay, so everybody started running up the harbour to get to the top of the harbour.\"\nMr Perchard said there was also another moment that stuck with him.\nHe said: \"There was a compound with barbed wire, and being a small kid I was looking up at a guy standing there dressed in rags round his feet and I couldn't believe it.\n\"I remember that very, very clearly, and these were apparently Russian prisoners of war.\"\nDavid Luce was 12 years old when Jersey was liberated, and said the island was put under extreme regulations.\n\"I have many recollections of the war years.\n\"I was seven when the Germans arrived in 1940, and remember the regulations that came in, not least the day when we had to ride bikes on the right hand side of the road which was an uncanny experience,\" he said.\nThe 91-year-old said he remembered the excitement of Liberation Day.\nHe said: \"I remember the Liberation Day when I was 12 and the excitement down here at the harbours, our soldiers were arriving in full kit and they could barely move because people were embracing them as they landed on the pier.\n\"They were throwing out cigarettes and they were throwing out sweets to the children as one of my cousins put it - the air on Liberation Day was electric with joy.\n\"It sums up just how we felt, a",

A jury at Luton Crown Court rejected the defence case and convicted him of murder.\nReading a statement outside court, Mr Migdal's grandmother, Lorna Buckland, described her grandson as a \"pacifist who hated violence\".\n\"[He] was the life and soul of our family \u2013 the beating heart,\" she said.\n\"Our utterly innocent, unique, talented and widely cherished boy\u2019s contribution to the world has been far greater than he will ever know.\n\"The vacuum that has been left behind is enormous and we are all forever changed by losing him,\" she added.\nThe trial heard how the group of friends had attended their school prom at the Holiday Inn.\nThey returned to Mr Migdal's car - parked on Sharp-Meade's street - where they intended to change before heading to an after-party in Cambridge.\nProsecutor Jane Bickerstaff KC told the court: \"They were approached by the defendant who was armed with a large zombie-style knife. He had it concealed down his tracksuit trousers.\"\nShe said the friends had backed away but Mr Migdal had not finished changing and \"momentarily stood his ground\".\nThe defendant approached and stabbed him in the chest, the jury heard.\nHe was rushed to Stevenage's Lister hospital, where he died in the early hours of the morning.\nThe jury was told that on the night of the stabbing the defendant's ex-girlfriend was heading to Sharp-Meade's flat to collect a fur hood. As she walked past the group she was talking to a friend on her mobile. \nThe defendant, who was in the flat with the person taking the call, heard the conversation and could hear the four teenagers talking in the background.\nThe prosecutor said: \"As a result of hearing them in the background, he became irrationally jealous.\n\"The defendant armed himself with a knife. Once the ex-girlfriend arrived he threw her hood at her. He put on a balaclava and speed-walked to find and confront those who he wrongly thought had engaged with her.\"\nDet Insp Justine Jenkins, from Hertfordshire Police, said: \"This was a senseless act of violence, which resulted in a young man being killed in cold blood because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, by an enraged teenager who imagined a situation that simply did not exist.\"\nMr Kajetan had appeared on BBC TV's Greatest Dancer.\nHe was a member of a dance group called Prospects Fraternity, and had also won first place in an under-14 category of the World Street Dancing Championships in 2017.\nWhen the murder verdict was delivered, his family and friends, seated in the public gallery, gasped before crying and hugging. \nSharp-Meade will be sentenced on 17 May.\nJudge John Hillen told him: \"The jury has convicted you of murder.

    "Do you believe in Joe Hendry? From a wrestler's entrance music to beating artists like Taylor Swift, Sabrina Carpenter and Dasha, it seems yes, the public do believe in Joe Hendry.\nThe Scottish professional wrestler saw his song 'I Believe in Joe Hendry' reach number four in the official charts, in what he describes as a \"series of fortunate random events\".\nNow the 36-year-old from Edinburgh is considering his next move - whether projecting his face on the Las Vegas Sphere or writing a song for the first minister of Scotland.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Mornings with Stephen Jardine, Hendry explained how the one minute long song, played as he enters the ring, became a chart hit with fan support\n\"People had always liked my entrance song.

    "An increase in business rates in Wales has created a \"perfect hurricane\" for hospitality and retail firms, an industry body has warned.\nSince April, the Welsh government\u2019s discount on business rates for the sectors has been cut, with high street traders facing bigger bills.\nUK Hospitality Cymru said rising costs had left some businesses \"on the edge\".\nThe Welsh government said it continued to offer business rates relief, with only one in five paying the full bill.\nTraders in Bangor, Gwynedd, said the rising costs were beginning to bite.\n\"We've got the longest high street in the whole of the UK, and it's one of the emptiest high streets in the whole of the UK,\" said clothes designer and upholsterer Sophia Ingham.\nSince last July she has run her Phia shop in the Deiniol shopping centre, but expects to have to close this summer in a move that would be \"entirely down to the rate increase\".\nIt will be the latest business in Bangor to close its doors.\n\"Most of the shops are closed or boarded up,\" Ms Ingham said. \nShe called on the government to cut rates completely \"to help rejuvenate the high streets, rather than terminate them\".\nBusiness rates, sometimes known as non-domestic rates, are a tax based on the rateable value (RV) of the property being used. \nThe Welsh government body Business Wales says they are calculated by taking that RV and multiplying it by a set amount. This is fixed by the Welsh government and in this financial year is 0.562.\nSo, for example, a business premises with a \u00a315,000 RV will have it multiplied by 0.562, which means a a rates bill of \u00a38,430.\nThe rates are collected by local authorities and paid into a Welsh government national fund. \nThe Welsh government determines what discounts, or relief, certain businesses are entitled to.\nIn April the amount of relief fell from 75% to 40% for retail and hospitality businesses. Similar businesses in England continue to get 75% relief.\nThe Welsh government said it was still offering retail and hospitality sectors the equivalent of \u00a378m in discounts on their business rates.\nBut the body representing hotels, pubs and restaurants said the sector was under huge financial strain.\n\"It's not just a perfect storm, it's a perfect hurricane,\" said David Chapman, executive director of UK Hospitality Cymru.\n\"We've had compulsory closure with Covid, we've had high levels of energy prices, high levels of inflation on food and drink. We've not got any cash reserves, we're paying back Covid loans.\n\"The only support that we had was business rate relief, and that's been cut away from us,\" he said.\nMr Chapman urged the Welsh government to restore the relief to its previous level, which would match the discount on offer in England.\nAndria Thomas runs the Dot clothing shop in Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, where she sells imported European fashion brands to customers in the rural market town.\nShe said the increase in her business rates was \"a little bit unfair\" when similar shops in England pay a lower rate.\n\"We\u2019re having to pay more than what [businesses] across the bridge in England are having to pay, where our running costs are probably very equal,\" she said.\nMs Thomas also sells clothing online, but wants to stay on the high street.\n\"Every extra cost impacts on how much profit you can make. And obviously, as much as I want to continue having bricks and mortar and a window shopfront, the running costs for online are cheaper and cheaper.\n\"So having business rates at a reduced cost is a massive influence to helping us locals to stay local.\"\nThe Welsh government said it was doing \"all we can, with the resources and powers available to us\" to provide support to businesses.\n\u201cWe provide a range of permanent non-domestic rates reliefs for businesses, worth \u00a3250m a year and fully funded by the Welsh government.\n\"This includes small business rates relief, which supports ratepayers for around 70,000 properties across Wales, of which more than two-thirds pay nothing at all.\n\"We are providing additional non-domestic rates support worth \u00a3134m in 2024-25. This includes a fifth successive year of support for retail, leisure and hospitality businesses with their rates bills, at a cost of \u00a378m, building on the almost \u00a31bn of support provided in rates relief to these sectors since 2020-21. \n\"Only one in five properties are liable for their full bill this year.\"",
    "Donald Trump is \"often misunderstood\" over his commitment to Nato, shadow foreign secretary David Lammy has said during a goodwill mission to the US.\nDespite \"shocking\" comments about European allies, Mr Lammy said the ex-president's time in the White House had led to a better-funded Nato alliance.\nMr Lammy previously called Mr Trump a \"neo-Nazi sympathising sociopath\". \nBut he said Labour would work with a future Trump administration, in a speech at a Republican think tank.\nDuring a two-day visit to Washington DC, Mr Lammy has scheduled meetings with senior Democrats, as well as Trump allies including Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and JD Vance, alongside Mr Trump's former deputy assistant secretary of defence Elbridge Colby.\nMr Lammy has also reportedly met Mr Trump's campaign manager Chris LaCivita - in what is believed to be the first official contact between Labour and the former president in the run-up to the 2024 US election.\nAs Labour's spokesman on foreign affairs, Mr Lammy is seeking to forge closer ties with both major US parties, to prepare for power if his party -which is well ahead in the opinion polls - wins the UK general election later this year.\nBridge-building with the Republicans may prove more challenging for Mr Lammy who has a long track-record of criticising Mr Trump, the expected Republican candidate for president.\nIn an article in Time magazine explaining why he planned to protest against Mr Trump's 2018 state visit to the UK, Mr Lammy wrote: \"Trump is not only a woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath.\n\"He is also a profound threat to the international order that has been the foundation of Western progress for so long.\"\nIn 2021, Mr Lammy posted on social media that \"Joe Biden replacing Donald Trump as President fills me with joy\" and called Mr Trump a \"dangerous clown\".\nDuring a  speech on Wednesday at the right-wing Hudson Institute, Mr Lammy argued that maintaining strong transatlantic relations is crucial, regardless of the ruling US party.\nMr Lammy said he and Mr Trump could find \"common cause,\" suggesting that as a \"good Christian boy\" and \"small-c conservative,\" he shares some views with Republicans.\n\"You're going to struggle to find any politician in the Western world who hasn't had things to say in response to Donald Trump,\" he added.\nMr Trump has a long history of criticising European Nato members for not spending enough to support the alliance, relying on the US to shoulder the burden.\nIn February, he said he would \"encourage\" Russia to attack any Nato member that fails to pay its bills as part of the Western military alliance.\nNato estimates for 2023 suggest that Poland was the top spender, allocating 3.9% of GDP, which was more than twice the amount it had spent in 2022.\nThe US was in second place, spending 3.5%, which is about the same level as it has been spending for the past decade - but in cash terms dwarfs all other contributors.\nMr Lammy said the ex-president was \"a leader whose attitude to European security is often misunderstood\".\n\"I do not believe that he is arguing that the United States should abandon Europe,\" Mr Lammy added.\n\"He wants Europeans to do more to ensure a better-defended Europe.\n\"Were his words in office a little shocking? Yes, they were. Would I have used them? Probably not.\n\"But US spending on defence actually grew under President Trump, as did the defence spending of the wider alliance during his tenure.\"\nForeign Secretary David Cameron met with Mr Trump during a visit in April to discuss Ukraine with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. \nDuring an earlier visit, Lord Cameron angered many Republican conservatives by comparing US politicians who block new Ukrainian war funding to Nazi appeasers.\nHis comments prompted Republican congresswoman and Trump supporter Marjorie Taylor Greene to tell Sky News: \"David Cameron needs to worry about his own country and, frankly, he can kiss my ass.\"",
    "The H5N1 strain of avian flu has been around since 1996, but until now its been largely confined to animals. But it has now jumped to cattle in America and some think it means we are inching towards eventual human-to-human infection, with potentially serious consequences.\nH5N1 first appeared in geese in wet markets in Guangdong, China. Since then there have been various outbreaks around the world where chickens and wild birds have become infected. But as Covid was ravaging the human world, H5N1 began to spread quickly, killing millions of birds \u2013 both reared and wild \u2013 and affecting seal and sea lion populations around the globe. The virus has also appeared in a mink farm in Spain and polar bears in the Arctic.\nThe question we were asking was where would it go next? A few weeks back we got our answer. In March, farmers in Texas and Kansas started reporting that their cows had low appetites and were producing less milk. Tests came back positive for H5N1. And this was not just individual cases brought on by chance contamination: the cows were infecting each other.\nSince March, H5N1 has been confirmed in dairy cattle in nine US states. Scientists are still trying to establish how the virus is being spread.\n\u201cRight now it seems like the milking equipment may be one of the ways,\u201d says Dr Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health\n\u201cScientists are finding very high levels of virus in milk. And so that's why the milking equipment seems like it might be playing a role.\u201d\nShe adds that the spread of the virus between states seems to be down to the movement of infected cows across state lines.\nThe Briefing Room: Avian Flu\n\nAvian flu is evolving but what risk does it pose to us? David Aaronovich investigates for The Briefing Room.\n\nListen now on BBC Sounds\nReporting and surveillance of cattle movement in the US is poor compared with the UK and Europe where the BSE outbreaks of the mid-nineties led to all cows having to be tagged.\nScience journalist Kai Kupferschmidt says that in an ideal world, we\u2019d know how many cows were asymptomatic carriers and speed up our capacity to test for antibodies in the blood.\n\u201cWe really should know a little bit more and have a bit more data,\u201d he adds.\nIn March, a dairy farm worker in Texas began displaying symptoms after direct and close contact with sick cows. After treatment he made a full recovery. Tests on the virus showed it had mutated to be better adapted to mammalian cells.\nDr Rivers says that specific mutation has not been detected elsewhere, so it could be that the virus only mutated in that case.\n\u201cAs long as that human didn't pass the virus on to other humans, then it's sort of a dead end situation,\u201d she says.\nSo we aren\u2019t there yet, and perhaps not even close. But Kai Kupferschmidt says that while he doubts we\u2019ll be in a H5N1 pandemic next week or next month, the virus is inching closer to humans.\n\u201cThe reason we are not in a pandemic has nothing to do with us humans reacting appropriately in this situation,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI think it's only because the virus, so far, seems pretty bad at infecting humans. So in some ways we are at the mercy of this virus\u2018 capabilities to change.\u201d\nAnd here\u2019s the problem - we\u2019re giving H5N1 a pretty good environment within which to mutate and if that goes on long enough, it\u2019s very possible that the virus will hit on a combination that makes it well suited for humans.\nTransmission from animals to humans is very rare. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that from 2003 to 2024 there were 889 known human cases of H5N1 in 23 countries.\nA little over half of those cases have resulted in death but many more cases will have gone undetected and the fatality rate are likely to be far lower.\nThere have been no reported cases of H5N1 in cows in the UK. Professor Ian Brown, who leads the avian virology group at The Pirbright Institute says the UK \u2013 like Europe - has very strong animal health systems that are designed to track and monitor changes in disease traits.\nHe says: \u201cIf something like milk drop, which has been reported in these cattle, was substantive, changes in that that wouldn't have gone under the radar of recognition, and would probably have been followed up.\u201d\nGiven that, and in the wake of Covid, you may be wondering about vaccine preparedness. The WHO meets twice a year to discuss emerging strains of influenza virus and I was extremely relieved when Prof Brown told me that initial data indicates that there already candidate vaccines to match the strains in cattle in the US.\nIt's a paradox, but just as we have helped create the circumstances in which viruses like to mutate and spread, we\u2019ve simultaneously become far better in tracking them and developing defences against them.\nLet\u2019s hope those defences won\u2019t be needed.\nBBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

    "The US says Israel may have used American-supplied weapons in breach of international humanitarian law in some instances during the war in Gaza.\nIt is \"reasonable to assess\" that those arms have been used in ways \"inconsistent\" with Israel's obligations, says the state department. \nBut it added that the US did not have complete information in its assessment and that shipments could continue.\nThe report was submitted to Congress on Friday after a delay.\nThe White House-ordered review looked into how the country, along with six others engaged in conflict, has used US-supplied arms since the start of last year.\nWhile the report was a clear rebuke of some Israeli operations in Gaza, it stopped short of definitively saying that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) campaign had breached international law.\nIsrael had had to confront an \"extraordinary military challenge\" fighting Hamas in Gaza, it said.\nAnd it added that assurances it had received from Israel about adhering to the legal use of US weapons were \"credible and reliable\".\nThe document also noted that because Hamas \"uses civilian infrastructure for military purposes and civilians as human shields\", it was often \"difficult to determine facts on the ground in an active war zone\" of what are legitimate targets.\nBut it said that given Israel's significant reliance on US-made weapons, they had probably been used \"in instances inconsistent with its IHL [international humanitarian law] obligations or with established best practices for mitigating civilian harm\".\nIt added that \"Israel has the knowledge, experience, and tools to implement best practices for mitigating civilian harm in its military operations\", but that \"results on the ground, including high levels of civilian casualties, raise substantial questions as to whether the IDF is using them effectively in all cases\".\nThe report said the UN and humanitarian organisations had described Israeli efforts to mitigate civilian harm as \"inconsistent, ineffective and inadequate\".\nThe state department found that Israel did not fully co-operate with US efforts to \"maximise\" humanitarian aid into Gaza in the initial months of the conflict. It said, however, that this situation had changed.\n\"We do not currently assess that the Israeli government is prohibiting or otherwise restricting the transport or delivery of US humanitarian assistance,\" the report said.\nOne of the contributors to the report, David Satterfield, a former US ambassador to Turkey, told the BBC that the report was the first of its kind and that the US would continue to keep Israeli actions \"under review\".\n\"This is a conflict quite unlike any that the world has seen,\" he added. \"We tried to take account of all those factors in coming up with a very frank, but also credible judgement.\"\nThe report was finally released days after US President Joe Biden publicly threatened to withhold certain bombs and artillery shells from Israel if it went ahead with an assault on Rafah, the last stronghold of Hamas in Gaza that is packed with more than a million Palestinians.\nShortly before the report's publication, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed President Biden's warnings that the operation in Rafah would cross a \"red line\" and vowed that Israel would \"stand alone\" if necessary. \nMore than 80,000 people have fled Rafah since Monday, the UN says, with Israeli tanks reportedly massed close to built-up areas amid constant bombardment.\nIsraeli troops took control and closed the Rafah crossing with Egypt at the start of their operation, while the UN said it was too dangerous for its staff and lorries to reach the reopened Kerem Shalom crossing with Israel.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage. More than 34,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",
    "A general strike against public spending cuts has affected most of Argentina, where schools, banks and many shops remained closed. \nTrain and metro services were suspended on Thursday, with a limited bus service running.\nOne of the main union leaders, Hector Daher, said the 24-hour strike was a wake-up call to President Javier Milei. \nMr Daher urged him to review some of the cuts to subsidies and social programmes. \nMr Milei, a right-wing economist who campaigned with a chainsaw to represent his desire to slash public spending, has begun implementing comprehensive austerity measures since coming into power in December. \nHe says his measures are necessary to reduce Argentina's public deficit and control the country's inflation rate, which is the highest in the world at nearly 300% a year.\nThe president criticised the strike, saying his government had already made many concessions to the unions.\nHis government has trumpeted some successes since he came to power, with officials pointing to falling inflation in recent months. But critics say it has come at a cost, with a slump in economic activity. \nA government spokesman described the strike as \"purely political\", and said it \"damages and complicates the lives of many people\".\nThe unions, however, have accused Mr Milei's cuts of doing the same.\n\"Far from being sustainable, [the cuts are] taking sectors of citizens to extremes that they will hardly be able to recover from if this continues,\" Mr Daher said, according to the Diario Democracia newspaper.\nOther union leaders vowed to continue the collective action if the Argentine government refused to ease some of his measures.\nViggo Mortensen, the Lord of the Rings actor who was raised in Argentina, told RTVE that he felt Mr Milei was a \"clown\" whose administration had been \"a total disaster\" for Argentines.\nBut others expressed anger towards the strikes, as while they predominantly affected public services, many businesses had remained open.\n\"This hurts us because we sell less,\" Cacho, a bingo vendor, told El Tribuno in Salta, northwest Argentina. \"We have to work. I walked 20 blocks [to] come downtown.\"\n\"I barely got a passenger,\" a taxi driver in Buenos Aires told a TN reporter. \"If I don't work one day, I don't eat.\"\nDespite the dissent towards his measures, opinion polls suggest that Mr Milei remains popular with Argentinians. Recent surveys showed his approval rating hovering around 45-50%, just short of the 56% vote share he won in the election. \nIn a recent interview with the BBC, he denied that ordinary citizens were paying the price for his cuts, arguing that \"the most regressive tax that most afflicts people is inflation\".\nMr Milei expressed pride in the fact he had lowered government spending below tax revenue for the first time since 2008, but said that \"there is no magic, real life needs time\".\n\"What would have been the alternative? To continue to print money like the previous administration that generates inflation and ends up affecting the most vulnerable?\"\nHis left-wing predecessor, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, described the cuts as a \"useless sacrifice of the people\" in the wake of the strikes.",
    "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has sacked the head of his personal protection unit after two of its top officials were detained over an alleged assassination plot.\nSerhiy Rud has led the president's security detail since 2019. \nNo reason was given for his dismissal, which was announced in a brief presidential decree.\nHowever, the state guard administration (UDO) is critical for the safety not only of the president but other key figures in Ukraine and their families.\nThe two colonels in the state guard who were detained on Tuesday are suspected of belonging to a network of agents run by Russia's FSB security service.\nMr Zelensky has spoken of repeated Russian plots to assassinate him, but the latest revelations involved his own entourage and also targeted military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov and the head of the SBU state security service, Vasyl Malyuk.\nMr Malyuk said this week that the plot was due to culminate with a \"gift to Putin\" before his fifth term as president was inaugurated on Tuesday. \nIndividuals close to President Zelensky's bodyguard were meant to kidnap and kill him, while Mr Budanov would have been attacked with rockets, drones and anti-tank grenades, the SBU said.\nThere was no suggestion that Serhiy Rud, 47, had any link to the allegations, although one of the two colonels in detention, Andriy Huk, was seen as a personal friend. Ukrainian reports said they had studied together in the border troops academy many years ago.\nMaj Gen Rud has served in Ukraine's military for most of his adult life, and much of his career has been focused on state security. \nEver since Russian paratroopers attempted to land in Kyiv and assassinate President Zelensky in the early hours and days of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, plots to assassinate him have been commonplace.\nThe Ukrainian leader said at the start of the invasion he was Russia's \"number one target\".\nPresident Zelensky has frequently replaced key figures in Ukraine's security forces, and on Thursday he also announced that the commander of special forces, Col Serhiy Lupanchuk, was being moved from the role only months into the job.\nThe man who led Ukraine's defence in the first two years of Russia's full-scale invasion, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, was replaced in February. He has now been appointed as Ukraine's ambassador to the UK and given the title \"Hero of Ukraine\".",
    "The woman who has been alleged to have inspired the character Martha in hit drama Baby Reindeer has said she will sue its creator and Netflix.\nFiona Harvey told Piers Morgan that the series, in which Martha is shown as a stalker, was \"a work of fiction\".\nShe accused Netflix and Scottish comedian Richard Gadd, who wrote and starred in the show, of \"lying\" in their \"defamatory\" depiction.\nRepresentatives for Gadd and Netflix have been contacted by the BBC.\n\"They have billed it as a true story, and so has he, and it's not,\" Ms Harvey said in the interview. \"He is lying and they are lying.\"\nThe 58-year-old Scot gave the interview after being identified online by viewers who attempted to find out who Martha was based on, calling it \"absolutely horrendous\".\nIn the interview, she accused Gadd of \"making money out of my misery\".\nAfterwards, the Guardian's Stuart Heritage saidMorgan's interview \"reeked of grubby exploitation\", while Ryan Coogan wrote in the Independent that \"you can no more expect him to be sensitive than you can expect a fish to climb a tree\".\nBut Coogan added: \"Morgan isn't the issue here - the real problem with this interview is that there's a market for it at all.\"\nEd Power wrote in The Telegraph the \"60-minute conversation was less a sparring match between Morgan and Fiona Harvey than a dreary question-and-answer session\".\nThe BBC has asked Morgan for comment. \nMorgan repeatedly challenged Harvey about how many emails, phone calls and letters she sent Gadd. The comedian has said his stalker sent more than 41,071 emails, 350 hours of voicemails, 744 tweets, 46 Facebook messages and 106 pages of letters.\nMs Harvey told Morgan there \"may have been a couple of emails\" and later said there were \"less than 10\" emails.\nShe said she sent him one letter and 18 tweets but no Facebook messages, and said she \"doubts\" he has those voice messages because she didn't have his phone number.\nMorgan also questioned her about the fact she uses six email addresses, and pushed her on other questions such as the grade she got in her law degree.\nTowards the end of the interview, Harvey said she would also sue the Daily Mail newspaper. The BBC has contacted them for comment. \nIn a column for the Sun newspaper published on Thursday evening, Morgan wrote: \"On a human level, I felt sorry for her that she's been publicly dragged through the mincer like this.\n\"But there were moments in the interview where my suspicious alarm bells rang loud.\"\nThe BBC contacted Harvey following her interview but she was not immediately available for comment.\nShe reportedly told the Daily Record that she was \"not happy\" with the interview and that she had been paid \u00a3250 to take part.\nBaby Reindeer, a word-of-mouth hit for the streaming giant, has left many people fascinated and disturbed.\nShe emphatically denied the veracity in real life of key scenes in the series, including one where the Martha character is depicted as sexually assaulting Gadd along a canal and attacking his partner.\nShe also denied harassing Gadd's family, or turning up at his house. \"I'm not a stalker,\" she said.\nAt the end of the series, Martha is seen pleading guilty of stalking Gadd and is sentenced to nine months in jail.\nBut Harvey insisted she has never been charged with an offence, let alone going to prison.\n\"That is completely untrue, very, very defamatory to me, very career damaging,\" she said.\nWhen viewers began to speculate over the real people behind the series, Gadd, 34, posted a message to his Instagram story, urging people not to speculate.\n\"That's not the point of our show,\" he wrote.\nOn Wednesday Netflix policy chief Benjamin King told UK lawmakers at a parliament hearing focused on British film and television, that they took \"every reasonable precaution\" to disguise the identities of the people who inspired Gadd's work. \n\"We didn't want to anonymise that or make it generic to the point where it was no longer his story because that would undermine the intent behind the show,\" he said. \n\"Ultimately, it's obviously very difficult to control what viewers do, particularly in a world where everything is amplified by social media.

    "Stronger than expected growth at the start of the year saw the UK emerge from recession.\nThe economy grew by 0.6% between January and March, the fastest rate for two years, official figures showed.\nThe UK fell into recession at the end of last year after shrinking for two three-month periods in a row.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said the economy had \"turned a corner\", but Labour said this was no time for a \"victory lap\".\nOn Thursday, the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, told the BBC that the UK was seeing a recovery, although it was not a strong one.\nInterest rates are currently at their highest for 16 years, meaning people are paying more to borrow money for things such as mortgages and loans, but savers have also received better returns.\nMortgage rates have been creeping up in recent weeks, after forecasts for when the Bank of England would cut borrowing costs were pushed back. \nOn Thursday, the Bank said that inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, would fall close to its target level in the next couple of months. That had boosted expectations of a rate cut in June. However, the stronger than expected growth figures have dampened those expectations.\nRuth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said it showed \"the Bank of England doesn't need to rush to cut interest rates\".\nShe said the first rate cut would ultimately be determined by upcoming employment and inflation figures.\nGrowth in the early part of the year was led by services - which includes sectors such as hospitality, arts and entertainment - and was likely to have been helped by an early Easter in March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Last year, Easter was in April.\nThere was anecdotal evidence from looking at credit and debit card transactions that consumers have been treating themselves to clothing and home furnishings.\nCar manufacturers also had a good quarter, the ONS said, although the construction sector remained \"weak\".\nHowever, while the overall economy is growing again, many people might not be feeling any better off. When the impact of inflation - the pace of price rises - and population growth are stripped out, growth per head is still 0.7% lower than a year ago.\nEd Beardwell, who has owned the RollQuick cycle shop in Bristol for the past 11 months, said his business now \"just about breaks even\". \nHe cited the cost of living as an issue. \"People are pretty cost-sensitive in Bristol. An awful lot of bikes get stolen and that keeps down the price that anyone is willing to pay.\"\nPoor sales during the recession led to a focus on bike servicing, which now accounts for 70% of his turnover.\nMr Beardwell told the BBC that while the winter had been disappointing, business seems to have turned a corner.\n\"It does feel like things are picking up again. When you look at the sales statistics we are down on this point last year but tracking better than at the end of last year.\"\nWhile the economy contracted during the second half of last year, the recession was the mildest in recent records.\nThe recession was partly caused by people spending less as they faced higher prices in shops and higher interest rates pushing up mortgage costs.\nYael\u202f Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said \"the worst is behind the UK economy\".\n\"We expect to see continued growth for the rest of this year,\" she added, with falling inflation and rising wages helping \"to repair some of the damage to household incomes and support households' consumption\".\nThe size of the economy is measured by gross domestic product (GDP), which looks at all the economic activity of companies, governments and people in a country.\nMost economists, politicians and businesses want to see GDP rising steadily, because it usually means people are spending more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid and workers get better pay rises.\nThe debate about the strength of the economic recovery is set to be a central battleground in the general election campaign.\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt said that while it had been a difficult few years, \"today's growth figures are proof that the economy is returning to full health for the first time since the pandemic\".\nSpeaking to the BBC's Today programme, he said: \"For families who have been having a really tough time, I think they can see that the very difficult decisions that we've taken in order to get the economy back on its feet after the pandemic, after the energy shock, are beginning to pay off and we need to see them through.\"\nLabour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who earlier this week had accused the government of being delusional about the state of the economy, said this was \"no time for Conservative ministers to be doing a victory lap\".\n\"After 14 years of economic chaos, working people are still worse off,\" Ms Reeves added.\nLiberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney said the figures were little cause for celebration.",
    "A family in Washington state has been left devastated after a mobile butcher confused their home with a different address and slaughtered their pet pigs. \nBetty and Patty, both two years old, were shot in their pen in Port Orchard while the family was away from home.\nOwner Nathan Gray said he could not contain his anger. \"They were my wife's pets and my kids' and they, you know, they're family.\"\nPolice told the BBC that the matter had been passed to the prosecutor's office. \nMr Gray and his wife Natalie said they returned home on 1 May to find their pets in the process of being butchered. Their home CCTV system had alerted them to an unknown vehicle on their property. \nMr Gray said that after arriving, one of his employees approached him and said: \"These guys shot your pigs.\"\nHe said he found Patty and Betty laying in pools of blood. \"They shot them. Only 16 feet from our neighbour's fence.\"\nHe said he confronted the butcher, who said his GPS \"screwed up\". \"They asked me what I wanted to do with the with the pigs - whether I wanted them to be processed.\n\"They'll be buried on this property, like the rest of our animals.\"\nMrs Gray said that her children had been traumatised. \"They were my babies,\" she said of Betty and Patty. \"And when you have kids and they don't feel safe - when they feel violated, I feel mad that they don't feel safe.\"\nThe pigs enjoyed chasing their daughters and playing in the mud and were expected to live their entire lives at their Gray Acres farm, the couple said. \nThe Grays now want to ensure that this never happens again, and hope to change the laws that regulate mobile butchering. \n\"It seems like there's no guidelines. What I've read - there's nothing about firearm training,\" said Mr Gray. He added that he would find it incredible if it was legal to walk onto private property with a gun and kill an animal without the owner's permission.\nA lawyer for the couple, Adam Karp, told BBC News that \"the law treats Betty and Patty no differently than if were they Golden Retrievers or Norwegian Forest Cats\".\nDespite being legally classified as \"livestock\", he said that it is a serious crime to intentionally cause injury to any animal without legal justification, and that the butcher may be civilly liable for the offence of theft of livestock. \nHe added that he has been hired by the couple \"to explore criminal, civil, and regulatory avenues to do justice for Betty and Patty and to ensure no horror like this ever happens again\".\nMobile slaughter units were created in the US in 2002. Each is accompanied by an official food safety inspector. They are intended to allow farmers and ranchers to have their animals butchered without being forced to travel long distances to access larger facilities.",
    "A case of BSE, commonly known as mad cow disease, has been identified on a farm in Ayrshire.\nThe Scottish government said precautionary movement restrictions had been put in place at the farm and three other sites.\nThe animal did not enter the human food chain. \nFood Standards Scotland said there was no risk to human health.\nThe Scottish government said the case of BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) was identified thought routine surveillance and control measures.\nFurther investigations to identify the origin of the disease are ongoing.\nAgriculture Minister Jim Fairlie said:  \u201cThe fact we identified this isolated case so quickly is proof that our surveillance system for detecting this type of disease is working effectively.\n\u201cI want to thank the animal\u2019s owner for their diligence. \n\"Their decisive action has allowed us to identify and isolate the case at speed which has minimised its impact on the wider industry.\"\nThere are two types of BSE. Classical and atypical. Classical can transfer to humans who eat the meat.  Scientists believe atypical occurs spontaneously and is not passed on to humans.\nThis is the fifth case of classical BSE to be discovered in the UK in 10 years.\nMovement restrictions have also been put in place at three other sites \u2013 the farm of the animal\u2019s origin and two farms where cows had access to the same feed.\nThe monitoring of BSE has been an important in the UK since the crisis of 1986 when 180,000 cattle were infected and 4.4 million slaughtered in order to eradicate the disease.\nAll cows over the age of four that die on a farm are routinely tested for BSE.\nThe disease is not directly transmitted from animal to animal, but an infected animal's offspring can be affected so are destroyed.\nThe last case in Scotland was in Aberdeenshire in 2018. There was a case in England in 2021.\nThe disease infects cows and attacks their central nervous system. It is usually fatal.\nSymptoms usually include aggression and a lack of co-ordination.\nScotland's chief veterinary officer Sheila Voas said any concerned farmers should seek veterinary advice.\nShe added: \u201cThe fast detection of this case is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job.\n\u201cWe are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency, and other partners to identify where the disease came from.\n\u201cI want to reassure both farmers and the public that the risk associated with this isolated case is minimal.\"\nIan McWatt, deputy chief executive of Food Standards Scotland said there were strict controls in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed, and removal of the parts of cattle most likely to carry the disease.\nHe said: \u201cWe will continue to work closely with Scottish government, other agencies and industry at this time.\u201d\nBSE are three letters that will send a shiver down the spine of any farmer.\nThe industry was devastated by the disease when it was first discovered in the late 1980s and early 90s resulting in 4.4 million animals being slaughtered and a sector on its knees.\nBut there's now huge knowledge about BSE and measures are in place to detect cases along with restrictions to stop its spread and prevent animals entering the food chain.\nIt's been largely eradicated with just five cases in the UK over the last decade. This appears to be an isolated detection in a beef cow; the same was true for the last case on a farm at Lumsden in Aberdeenshire.\nI understand that the farmer in Ayrshire acted well and promptly.\nBut epidemiological studies will take place over the coming weeks to understand where it originated.",

    "A Roman \"service station\" may have been found on the site of a major road development, archaeologists say.\nSome of the pieces found at the A417 in the Cotswolds are from the Neolithic period, dating back 12,000 years.\nThe items, which include a rare cupid figurine, Roman nail cleaner, pottery, coins and jewellery, went on display at a public event held at Gloucester Guildhall on 11 May.\nAlex Thompson, project manager from Oxford Cotswold Archaeology, said they believe the items may have been used by people travelling between settlements.\n\"We have a nice Roman settlement and it lies on Ermin Street, the road between Roman Cirencester and Gloucester,\" said Mr Thompson.\n\"We think that our settlement was being used to help with people that were travelling along the road and probably something to do with horses.\"\nOne of the theories is that the settlement may have been used for people to stop by to have their horses cared for or exchanged.\n\"We have a nice Roman building that may have been used as stabling or potentially as somewhere where you could stay the night and have your horse looked after,\" he added.\"\nThe pieces date from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Roman periods, and the Second World War.\nOne of the the most unusual finds from the dig was a small Cupid figurine from the Roman period, said Mr Thompson.\nFound during the excavation phase of the dig, the figurine is 7cm (2.7in) in height and is made from copper alloy.\nThe figurine is a depiction of Cupid in the style of Hercules. \n\"It represents the power of love over even the strongest Heroes. It was probably a love token,\" added Mr Thompson.\n\"It wouldn't have been cheap. It's a really unusual and special find.\"\nOf more than a thousand metal figurines from across Roman Britain, some 33 are known to depict Cupid, although this example appears to be the first to show Cupid as Hercules.\nArchaeologists also unearthed a Roman nail cleaner.\nAccording to Oxford Cotswold Archaeologists, Roman nail cleaners come in a variety of forms.\nThe one found in the A417 is a distinctive type which integrates a disc-shaped bone bead at its neck. This form has a pronounced western British distribution.\n\"The Romans were very clean people,\" said Mr Thompson.\n\"So you quite often find nail cleaners, small cosmetic sets and things like that.\"\nThe team also discovered a number of brooches - a commonly found piece of Roman jewellery. \nMr Thompson said the copper alloy brooches were likely to belong to the working people of the settlement.\n\"An archaeologist may only find something like that once in their career,\" he said.\n\"But it's the whole story that we're really interested in - it's how you draw those all together to create a narrative.\"\nMr Thompson said the team hopes to transfer the artefacts to the Corinium museum in Cirencester.\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to scrap the government's Rwanda scheme \"straight away\" if his party wins the election.\nThe Labour leader said he would use money saved to hire specialist investigators to tackle small boats crossing the Channel.\nHe also wants to use counter-terror powers to \"smash\" people smuggling gangs.\nRishi Sunak said ministers had already recruited extra police in this area. \nSpeaking to broadcasters, the prime minister said \"we've got a plan, and we're going to get our planes off\".\nSir Keir unveiled new details of his plan in Dover alongside local MP Natalie Elphicke, who defected from the Tories to Labour on Wednesday.\nIn a brief speech, Ms Elphicke took a shot at her former boss, claiming \"nowhere is Rishi Sunak's lack of delivery clearer than on the issue of small boats\".\nIn his speech, the Labour leader said he will establish a new Border Security Command to work with Border Force, MI5 and the National Crime Agency on prosecuting gangs operating small boat routes.\nThe party says this new unit would be led by a former police, military or intelligence chief, who would report directly to the home secretary.\nSir Keir argued that scrapping the Rwanda scheme would free up \u00a375m in the first year of a Labour government to hire hundreds of extra investigators and \"intelligence agents\".\nHe has already pledged to cancel the government's plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, which was first announced in 2022 but has been delayed by legal challenges.\nMinisters hope the scheme, now due to begin in July, will put people off trying to come to the UK across the English Channel in small boats.\nBut Labour argues the scheme will not deter people from trying to make the journey.\nAccording to the National Audit Office, payments to Rwanda would cost \u00a3370m over five years, plus \u00a3120m if more than 300 people are moved, and \u00a320,000 per individual relocated.\nPressed on when his party would scrap the scheme, Sir Keir told reporters Labour would \"get rid of the policy straight away\".\n\"I'm not going to continue a policy I don't think is going to work, which is going to cost a fortune,\" he added.\nWhen pushed on how large a reduction in small boat crossings he would like to see, the Labour leader did not set a figure but said he wanted levels to come down \"dramatically\". \n\"We will restore serious government to our borders, tackle this problem at source and replace the Rwanda policy permanently,\" he added.\nSir Keir also said his party would expand powers under the Blair-era Terrorism Act to enable police to search people suspected of being involved in people smuggling.\nThere would also be new powers enabling \"live monitoring\" of their financial accounts and court orders to hand over financial information.\nSuspected smugglers could also see their access to the internet, banking and travel restricted.\nLabour says these new powers would require fresh legislation to be passed in Parliament - something Sir Keir insisted would happen \"very quickly\".\nAs first reported by The Times, the party also aims to negotiate access to the EU's Eurodac database, which records the fingerprints of people aged 14 and over who arrive in European countries without permission.\nLabour has not said whether this would involve implementing EU legislation underpinning the scheme. It says this would be a matter to be discussed during the negotiations.\nPeter Walsh, from Oxford University's Migration Observatory, said Labour's scheme was \"unlikely to be a game changer\".\nThe plan \"appears on the face of it to be pretty similar\" to the current Small Boats Operational Command - the new military-led force which monitors and intercepts vessels attempting unauthorised entry into the UK via the Channel, he told BBC News.\n\"The devil will be in the detail,\" he added.\nBoth the Conservatives and Labour have accused each other of creating an \"amnesty\" - generally understood to mean allowing all those entering the country illegally to stay with a full legal pardon.\nLabour's plans, which the Conservatives have dubbed an \"amnesty for illegal immigrants\", will allow those arriving in the UK on small boats to apply for asylum - which is currently banned under the Illegal Migration Act. \nLabour have repeatedly denied they have plans for an amnesty on those entering the country illegally.\nSir Keir accused the Conservatives of \"a Travelodge amnesty\" by not processing asylum claims and housing people in hotels instead - though the plans do not amount an amnesty either as they involve deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda.\nNearly 9,000 people have crossed the English Channel in small boats so far this year, provisional Home Office figures show. \nThis is up almost a third (32%) on the same period last year, when 6,691 people made the crossing, and a 14% rise compared with the same period in 2022 when the number of people was 7,750.",
    "Late blight is an old foe of humans. This disease catalysed the devastating Irish potato famine that began in 1845.\nIt is caused by a fungus-like pathogen, which quickly kills a potato plant and turns the crop into inedible mush.\nMore recently, late blight has been creeping into higher parts of the Peruvian Andes, as warmer, wetter weather helps the pathogen spread.\nSo scientists at the International Potato Center (CIP), a research institute in Peru, were very motivated to develop potato varieties that could resist late blight.\nThey searched for this trait among so-called crop wild relatives \u2013 undomesticated plants that are distantly related to the ones now grown for food.\nAfter finding the disease resistance in potato wild relatives, they crossed the wild plants with cultivated ones. Local farmers then tested the newly developed varieties, voting for the ones they preferred to grow, sell and eat.\nThe result is CIP-Matilde, a potato variety released in 2021 that doesn\u2019t require fungicides to stand up to late blight.\n\u201cUsually it\u2019s easier to improve the resistance to a certain disease,\u201d explains Benjamin Kilian, a senior scientist at the Crop Trust, based in Bonn, Germany. The non-profit organisation partnered with CIP to develop the Matilde potato, and is working on many other crop varieties.\nWhile disease resistance might come down to a single gene, making resistance to stressors like drought or salinity, can involve working with hundreds of genes.\nTo tackle drought tolerance, for instance, scientists could explore traits like early flowering to escape the effects of drought, less loss of water from plant leaves, or long roots so that plants can extend further to reach water.\nMr Kilian leads the Crop Trust\u2019s Biodiversity for Opportunities, Livelihoods and Development (Bold) project, which brings together partners including community seed banks, national breeding programmes, and international research centres.\nCrucially, it also convenes farmers. They express their preferences for particular traits and test the different crop varieties under development (including voting by placing stones, sticks or seeds next to their favourite varieties).\nThese participatory processes involve listening to different kinds of farmers, Mr Kilian says.\nFor instance, \u201csometimes women and men, even within the same family, prefer different traits.\u201d Women might be more concerned about taste and nutrition, while men are often more focused on yield.\nYield \u2013 the amount of a crop actually harvested per unit of land \u2013 is never too far from conversations around agricultural production. However, attempting to maximise yield at all costs has led to a more monotonous food system, with high-yield varieties displacing a range of others.\n\u201cUnder optimal conditions with high input you can achieve great yields. But you can also risk complete crop failure,\u201d Mr Kilian says.\n\u201cFor most farmers, it\u2019s more important to have a stable, reliable yield under all kinds of different environments.\u201d\nOne crop that the Bold project is supporting is the grass pea. Mr Kilian explains that this nutritious legume can handle waterlogging and tough environments. \u201cIt was often the last crop that survived if there was a drought event.\u201d\nIt fell out of favour because of a toxic compound that could be dangerous if eaten in large quantities (such as during a famine). But the Crop Trust and partners are working to reduce the toxicity by cross-breeding grass peas with crop wild relatives.\nAnother neglected crop that scientists are heralding for its resilience is azolla, a fern that grows astonishingly quickly and doesn\u2019t require much water. The wild tepary bean, meanwhile, can withstand harsh desert conditions.\nTraditional crop breeding can be time-consuming and laborious. Brad Ringeisen, the executive director of the Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI) at the University of California (Berkeley and San Francisco), believes that gene editing using tools like Crispr-Cas9 is the most impactful way of ensuring that crops can withstand disasters.\n\u201cIt speeds up the innovation cycles. It is a precise tool.\u201d\nMr Ringeisen summarises the IGI\u2019s work on disease resistance in crops: \u201cThere are a tremendous number of emerging diseases, and climate change is not helping this.\u201d\nHe says gene editing is a more elegant way of tackling disease than spraying more pesticides.\nAs well as disease resistance, the IGI is working on drought tolerance. A rice variety that has been gene edited to reduce the number of pores on leaves, reducing water loss, is now in field trials in Colombia. Such tests are necessary to make sure that gene edits don\u2019t lead to unforeseen side effects in practice.\nThe IGI\u2019s project is one of a number of scientific efforts to make rice less vulnerable to unpredictable water cycles. Scientists at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines, for example, have developed a \"scuba rice\" strain that can withstand weeks of submergence in water during floods.\nSometim",
    "More than four years after the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ended the special status of Indian-administered Kashmir, the party has decided not to contest this year's general election there. \nPolitical analysts and opposition leaders say the decision hints at anger in the region over the move - and the party's acknowledgement of it. \nRelations between Kashmir and Delhi have been tense for decades. An insurgency against Indian rule and military action against it have claimed thousands of lives in the Himalayan region over the past three decades.\nThe situation worsened in 2019, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked nearly all of Article 370 - a part of the Indian constitution which had given significant autonomy to the region - and divided it into two federally-administered territories of Ladakh, and Jammu and Kashmir. \nThe government also imposed a strict communication blockade and jailed hundreds of political leaders, including three former chief ministers, for months. \nSince then, Mr Modi and his ministers have repeatedly championed the 2019 decision, claiming that it has brought peace to the region. \nIn the last few years, local BJP leaders have also worked extensively to expand its support base in Kashmir by launching door-to-door campaigns.\nSo the party's decision not to field any candidates in the ongoing general election - the first in the region since the abrogation of Article 370 - has come as a surprise to many. (The BJP has candidates in two seats in Hindu-majority Jammu, but none in the three seats of the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley.)\nThe BJP's chief spokesperson in Jammu and Kashmir claims that elections are not a priority and their main objective is to win the \"hearts of the people\". \n\"It took us 75 years to fully integrate Kashmir with the rest of the country and we don't want [to create] an impression that we have done this exercise just to win seats,\" Sunil Seth said. \nBut critics say this is because the party leadership realises that securing victory in the region would not have been easy.\nWhile the \"achievement\" may sell in other states, removing the special status of the Himalayan region hasn't gone down well with the people here, says Noor Ahmad Baba, a political analyst. \nOpposition leaders also allege that Mr Modi's party wanted to avoid the election from turning into a referendum on its 2019 decision. \n\"If people were happy with the abrogation of Article 370, the BJP wouldn't have hesitated to fight,\" says Omar Abdullah, a former chief minister of the region and a member of the National Conference (NC) party. \n\"But they don't want to expose themselves, and to save their face, they have decided not to contest.\"\nVoting in Jammu and Kashmir is being held in five phases. Apart from Mr Abdullah's NC, those in the fray include the People's Democratic Party (PDP), the Peoples Conference (PC) and Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party. India's main opposition party Congress is also contesting.\nLeaders from the NC and PDP have repeatedly claimed that the BJP is supporting the PC and Apni Party in the elections and have called them their \"proxies\". \nThe BJP hasn't made any formal announcements about an alliance. But sources in the BJP told the BBC that it would extend its support to some parties that have strongholds in northern and central Kashmir. Last month, the party's regional chief Ravinder Raina said they would rally behind \"like-minded parties\".\nThe party's decision to cede ground has caught off-guard many of its local members, who say they had been preparing for the polls since 2019. \n\"We had been going door-to-door, meeting people and telling them about the work done by the government,\" said Shabir Ahmad Zargar, a BJP worker from north Kashmir's Kupwara district.\n\"We are disappointed, but we have to accept the decision of the party,\" adds Fida Hussain, another party worker from north Kashmir's Baramulla district. \nThe move is also surprising because this is the first time the BJP has not contested a general election in the region since 1996. \nThe party traditionally does not enjoy much support here, but experts say its cadre base has increased in recent years.\nIts best performance was in the state elections of 2014, when it emerged as the second-largest party and formed the government with the PDP. The party won 25 of the total 87 seats - all in Jammu. \nThis marked the final assembly elections held in the former state. The coalition collapsed in 2018, and Mr Modi's government imposed direct rule in the region.\nThe party received a boost in 2020, after it won the local elections, including three seats in Kashmir.\nTwo years later, the government redrew the boundaries of assembly seats in a way that Jammu received six additional seats, while Kashmir was given one extra seat, taking the tally to 90. (Until 2019, Jammu had 37 seats and Kashmir had 46).\nThe exercise was widely seen as a move to increase the influence of Hindus in the region's electoral politics. \nBut desp",
    "The UK is out of recession after the economy returned to growth in the first three months of the year, official figures show.\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt said the economy was \"returning to full health\", but Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said this was no time for a \"victory lap\".\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes figures for the UK's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This is the value of all the goods and services the UK produces.\nWhen GDP rises, a country's economy grows and average incomes rise as a result.\nBut sometimes the economy shrinks, GDP falls, and that's a sign that the economy is doing badly, which could hit people's pockets.\nThe UK is in recession if GDP falls for two successive three-month periods - known as quarters.\nThe economy shrank 0.1% between July and September last year and then by a further 0.3% between October and December.\nThis meant the economy went into recession at the end of 2023.\nBut the latest figures from the ONS show the UK economy grew by 0.6% between January and March 2024, marking the end of the recession.\nThe previous UK recession was in 2020, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.\nIt only lasted for six months, although the 20.4% fall in GDP recorded between April and June 2020 was the largest on record.\nIn 2008 a recession started as a result of the global financial crisis, and went on for five quarters, or 15 months. \nEconomic growth can mean more jobs are available and companies can pay more to employees and shareholders. \nHigher wages and larger profits also generate money for the government through taxes. \nIt can choose to spend more on things like benefits and public services, or cut tax rates.\nWhen the economy shrinks and a country goes into recession, these things can go into reverse. \nSome people might lose their jobs, and unemployment could rise. \nOthers may find it harder to be promoted, or to get big enough pay rises to keep pace with price increases. \nHowever, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. \nBenefit recipients and those on fixed incomes are particularly likely to struggle, especially if the government decides to spend less on public services. \nIn a recession, the Bank of England - which is independent of government - typically cuts interest rates. \nThis makes it cheaper for businesses and households to borrow money which can boost spending and economic growth.  \nHowever, prices have been rising very quickly in the UK, and the Bank put interest rates up to tackle that inflation.  \nAfter 14 rate increases,the Bank has held interest rates at 5.25% six times in a row.\nWhen the economy is struggling to grow at the same time as there is high inflation, there can be a situation called \"stagflation\".\nThis can be very difficult to solve, because the two issues require different solutions. \nHowever in May 2024, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told the BBC that the UK economy had \"turned a corner\".\nWith growth of 0.6% from January to March this year, the UK was the joint fastest growing economy in the G7 group of industrialised nations.\nBut until then, the UK had been one of the weaker members of the G7.\nThe US economy grew by 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was much better than expected. \nThat put the US at 2.5% over 2023 as a whole, the best performance of all other advanced economies.

We need an action like we took to make us jump out of the pan.\"\nReid, from Kendal, in Cumbria, said she has protested \"politely\" in the past, voted and written to her MP but \"it hasn't worked\".\nWhittingham's actions caused \u00a3899.90 worth of damage to the table, the court heard. \nCompletion of the first-round match was delayed until the following day as a result.\nReid's attempts to disrupt the match on the other table, on which Mark Allen and Fan Zhengyi were playing, were foiled when she was tackled by referee Olivier Marteel.\nBoth will be sentenced at Sheffield Magistrates' Court on 10 July.\nMax Hinchcliffe, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said the pair \"showed an utter lack of thought or care for the players at the tournament or the fans watching from across the world\".\nHe added: \"The law upholds the right to protest but this must be balanced against the rights of others and this case shows that when lawful protest crosses the line into criminality we won't hesitate to prosecute offenders.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "Spain's Balearic Islands are expanding curbs on street drinking and further restricting party boats in a bid to crack down on alcohol-fuelled holidays in tourist areas.\nThe government says the toughening of a law passed in 2020 will apply to popular hotspots including Playa de Palma and Magaluf in Majorca and Sant Antoni in Ibiza.\nPeople caught drinking outside of authorised areas will be fined between \u20ac500-1,500 (\u00a3430-1290).\nUnder the new law, coming into force on Saturday, the number of sanctions taken against foreigners will be counted and submitted to the respective embassies.\nThe legislation introduces tougher rules against party boats, which will be banned from getting closer than one nautical mile (1.852 km) of the designated areas. Picking up or disembarking passengers will continue to be banned. \nParty boats had previously been banned from advertising in the three areas. \nLuis Pomar, a press officer at the Balearic Islands tourism council, told the BBC that the 2020 law had been working to curb anti-social behaviour. He added that he hoped the law would no longer be needed \u201cin three to four years, if we instil in people how to behave\u201d.\nUp to \u20ac16 million (\u00a313.7m) will be spent on improving areas which see the most tourism. \nThe areas the law applies to have been modified at the request of the local authorities, the Balearic Islands said.\nMr Pomar said a commission on \"the Promotion of Civility in Tourist Zones\" would be expanded to include representatives of the countries whose tourists are most associated with problems - the UK and Germany.\nThe government reiterated that the 2020 law bans shops from selling alcohol between 21:30 and 08:00 local time (20:30-07:00 GMT).\nAt the time of the introduction of the 2020 law, the regional government said it was the first in Europe to restrict the promotion and sale of alcohol in certain tourist zones.\nIt said the new measures would \"fight excesses\" and \"force a real change in the tourism model of those destinations\".\nBut some locals complained that the law would hurt businesses.

    "The Royal College of Surgeons has expressed alarm that a non-surgeon has removed patients\u2019 gall bladders at Walsall Manor Hospital.\nIt said that Surgical Care Practitioners (SCPs) - the staff who play a support role during procedures - should not be performing laparoscopic cholecystectomies with or without supervision.\nThe comments follow the publication of a research paper showing that 175 surgeries were carried out by an SCP at the hospital during a four-year period.\nWalsall Healthcare Trust said it was reviewing the comments.\nThe Council of the Royal College of Surgeons  said there were serious risks to safety posed by such practice, plus issues to do with consent and medical negligence litigation should anything go wrong.\nIt added the framework for SCPs did not support them actually undertaking the operation.\nThe council also expressed concern that if SCPs were doing operations, it was taking away training opportunities from trainee surgeons.\nThe research paper, published in the annals of the Royal College of Surgery, said that a former nurse had qualified as an SCP in 2006, with her skills developing over the next 10 years as she was mentored by the surgical team.\nThe SCP progressed from minor surgery to hernia repairs and, after assisting with major keyhole surgery procedures, it was decided she should develop her skills further.\nIn total, according to the paper, she was involved in 53 laparoscopic cholecystectomies assisted by a consultant, 110 by a specialist or associate specialist grade, and seven by a second-year surgical trainee between 2015 and 2019.\nThe report stated there were no major complications. However, five patients, it said, had to be readmitted to hospital - three with pain and two with portal infections.\nProfessor Shafi Ahmed, chief of surgery at the Royal London Hospital, said such an approach to the procedure was playing with patients\u2019 lives\n\u201cA laparascopic cholecystectomy is a major operation with significant major potential complications, including mortality,\" he said.\n\"Even as consultants there is a great deal of scrutiny on the number of cases and the complication rates.\u201d\nHe said trainees had normally been through five years at medical school and then in surgery for three to four years before they were allowed to perform the procedure.\nHe said of the actions at Walsall: \u201cThis is unsafe and dangerous and needs to be stopped immediately.\"\nWalsall Healthcare NHS Trust did not respond to specific questions from the BBC regarding consent and medical negligence insurance.\nNed Hobbs, deputy chief executive, said: \u201cAs a trust, we are in support of additional roles in the NHS such as the nationally recognised SCP along with a commitment to high-quality training for doctors and other healthcare professionals.\n\u201cWe have received the response from the Royal College of Surgeons regarding laparoscopic cholecystectomies undertaken by an SCP in the trust and are reviewing the comments raised.\u201d\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The Scottish government has recommitted to legislation that will allow someone to self-identify their legally recognised sex.\nThe Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill was passed by the Scottish Parliament in December 2022 but the UK government blocked it from becoming law over fears it would impact on equality laws across Great Britain. \nUK ministers used section 35 of the Scotland Act to veto the legislation.\nLast year the Court of Session in Edinburgh rejected a Scottish government legal challenge to the veto.\nSpeaking to BBC Scotland News on Thursday, John Swinney declined to answer whether he would open up discussions with any future Labour government on the Gender Recognition Reform Bill.\nThe first minister said he would \"wait and see\" what the political landscape was like.\nBut the Scottish government has now confirmed that its position remains that it wants to see the section 35 challenge lifted and for the legislation to take effect.\nDeputy First Minister Kate Forbes, who was on maternity leave when the legislation was passed, previously said she had \"significant concerns\" about gender self-identification.\nOn Friday she told BBC Scotland News that she would \"wholeheartedly endorse\" the Scottish government position.\nShe said: \"The first minister has been absolutely clear that the Scottish government intends to promote, to protect and to enhance the rights of every LGBT person in Scotland, and I wholeheartedly endorse that position.\"\nSpeaking after being sworn in at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, she added that the government was \"united as one\" in trying to achieve change for Scotland on a number of issues, including the cost of living and the squeeze on public services.\nShe stressed that she would abide by collective responsibility, meaning she backs all Scottish government policy.\nRepresentatives of Out for Independence, the official LGBTQ+ wing of the SNP, met Mr Swinney and the social justice secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville on Friday, and said they were given \"specific reassurances\" that the bill would be moved forward.\nThe group said there had been a \"frank, honest, and open discussion\" with the first minister.\nThey added they had also been reassured that the Scottish government will move forward with legislation to end conversion therapy - \"and that it will remain trans inclusive\".\nLabour have indicated that they would not repeal the section 35 order if they formed the next UK government.\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \u201cThe GRR Bill was passed by the Scottish Parliament. If the UK government lifted its legal block \u2013 the section 35 order - it would become law.\n\u201cThe problem is that the current UK government has said they will not.\n\u201cThe Scottish government\u2019s position is simple - UK government should lift their section 35 order.\n\u201cThey have made clear however that they will not, and until they do, it is simply not legal to implement the legislation.\u201d\nScottish Conservative deputy leader Meghan Gallacher said: \u201cWomen\u2019s groups, and the vast majority of Scots, will be dismayed to hear that John Swinney is doubling down on Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s reckless gender self-ID policy.\n\u201cThis is further proof that John Swinney spells more of the same, and is wedded to the same failed and flawed approach as Nicola Sturgeon and Humza Yousaf.\"",
    "Students hoping to start undergraduate courses in 2025 will be able to see the grades that recent successful applicants have achieved at A-level or equivalent.\nUniversities already publish entry requirements for courses but they can be flexible and let students in with lower grades.\nThe Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas), which is making the changes, said nearly half of applicants were admitted with lower grades. \nUcas said the change would help students make \"informed, ambitious choices\" and give them confidence in their applications.\n\nUniversities UK, which represents more than 140 institutions, said it welcomed moves to increase access to university.\nApplications for undergraduate courses starting in 2025 open on Tuesday 14 May.\nThe tool should allow students to search a course and see the most common grades held by those accepted on to it in previous years, alongside the highest and lowest grades.\nIt should show the ratio of how many students were offered a place compared with how many applied, and allow students to put in A-level or BTec grades to see what percentage of applicants with those grades were previously accepted.\nUcas said it hoped to \"increase transparency\" and give students a better understanding of how their grades, or predicted grades, compare with those of previous successful applicants to the courses they hope to study.\nStudents who get free school meals will also no longer have to pay the \u00a328.50 application fee.\nDr Jo Saxton, chief executive at Ucas, said both measures were part of a plan to \"ensure more students from disadvantaged backgrounds\" can go to university.\n\"I want to make sure no young person is forced to rule out higher education as an option, either because of the costs associated with applying or because they lack the confidence that their application will be successful,\" she said.\n\nResearch published by Ucas in 2021 suggested that 49% of 18-year-old applicants with three A-levels were accepted below the published entry requirements.\nThe historical grade data will be visible using the Ucas course search tool.\nThe change is the result of a recommendation by Universities UK (UUK) in 2020.\nA 2021 report by the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities, a review set up by No 10, also said young people should be empowered to make informed decisions.\nUcas said that 19.1% of 18-year-olds eligible for free school meals in England go on to university, compared with 36.4% of those who do not claim them.\nVivienne Stern, chief executive of UUK, welcomed the decision to waive the application fee for pupils on free school meals.\n\"The university sector has made great strides towards expanding opportunity, but there is much further to go, and it is clear that affordability is a real barrier,\" she said. \n\"It would be nothing short of a tragedy if someone chose not to apply to university because they couldn\u2019t afford the Ucas application fee.\"",
    "India's top court has granted interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, more than a month after he was arrested in a corruption case. \nThe court said that the bail is applicable until 1 June after which he must surrender to authorities again.\nA former anti-corruption crusader, Mr Kejriwal was arrested in connection with a now-scrapped alcohol sales policy in March.\nHe has denied the charges against him and has called his arrest \"illegal\".\nThe chief minister moved the Supreme Court after the Delhi High Court refused to give him bail last month. His bail was strongly opposed in court by India's financial crimes agency, the Enforcement Directorate. \nOn Friday, a bench of Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Dipankar Datta said Mr Kejriwal would have to surrender on 2 June, two days before the results of India's general election are due.\nThe court has said Mr Kejriwal would be allowed to campaign for the election upon his release but will not be allowed to perform official duties during that time.\nA member of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Mr Kejriwal was arrested on 21 March, days after the election dates were announced. He was the third AAP leader to be jailed in the case.\nThe ED accused him of favouring liquor barons in exchange for kickbacks. The party has denied the allegation. \nCritics said the action against Mr Kejriwal and several other opposition parties was politically motivated and denied them a level playing field in the parliamentary election. The Indian government said the investigative agencies were just doing their work.\nDuring his time in jail, Mr Kejriwal did not give up office. His party said he was running the Delhi government from prison. \nA diabetic, the Delhi chief minister's detention also caused concerns about his health among supporters.\nLast month, Mr Kejriwal and his party accused prison authorities of refusing to give him proper treatment which, they said, had led to the spike in his blood glucose levels.\nThe ED, however, claimed he had deliberately had too many mangoes and sweets to spike his sugar levels and use it as grounds for bail.\nHe later received insulin shots after a court ordered doctors from a premier hospital to determine his medication.\nDuring the court proceedings, the ED opposed Mr Kejriwal's bail plea, claiming it would set a bad precedent as he had evaded the agency's summons nine times. \nJustice Khanna, however, said: \"While granting interim bail, we examine whether there will be any misuse or if the person is a hardened criminal. That is not the case here.\"\nIn March, the arrest had also drawn comments from the US and Germany. \nUS State Department spokesperson, Mathew Miller said the country was closely following Mr Kejriwal's arrest and actions taken against opposition parties in India. \n\"We encourage fair, transparent, timely legal processes [in both cases],\" Mr Miller said. \nThe German foreign ministry said it hoped that Mr Kejriwal would get a \"fair and impartial trial as India is a democratic nation\".\nIndia summoned senior diplomats of both the US and Germany to register its protest.",
    "The Eurovision Song Contest reaches its grand final on Saturday night, with Croatia, Israel and Switzerland among the favourites to win.\nThe competition is back in its spiritual home in Sweden, 50 years after Abba's historic win in 1974.\nTheir winning entry, Waterloo, was the sort of oddity only Eurovision could produce: A glam rock anthem about the Napoleonic Wars, performed by two married couples in spangled trouser suits. \nIt just also happened to be one of the best songs ever written.\nAbba's golden anniversary will be celebrated on stage in Malm\u00f6 on Saturday, with former Eurovision winners Charlotte Perrelli, Carola and Conchita Wurst performing a special version of Waterloo.\nBut the competition has changed beyond recognition in the last five decades. \nIn 1974, only 17 countries took part in the competition, all accompanied by a live orchestra.\nThis year has seen 37 entrants, whose musical styles encompass heavy metal, hardcore techno, shimmering Europop and, in Norway's case, a gothic folk tale about a child who turns into a wolf and kills their stepmother. Fun times!\nSo here are some of the highlights to keep on your radar when the Grand Final kicks off on Saturday evening.\nEurovision loves nothing more than an outsider and an underdog - and Bambie Thug fits the bill perfectly this year.\nWhen they won Ireland's national selection in January, eyes were rolled and insults were thrown. A priest even declared \"Ireland is finished\", accusing the non-binary artist of \"shoving their orientation\u201d in people's faces.\nBut guess what? Bambie's song, Doomsday Blue, is an absolute blast. A witchy, spooky blend of electro-goth and grinding metal guitars, that unexpectedly segues into a sweet melody of regret and heartbreak. \nBambie sells it with a genuinely cinematic performance, summoning a demon then dancing ballet with it, before wrapping things up with a cathartic scream.\nImagine Kate Bush's evil twin singing an anti-lullaby and you'll get the idea.\nIf Irish goths aren't your style, maybe you'd prefer a drum and bass EDM opera from Switzerland?\nThat's what we get from Nemo, who has become one of the favourites to win the contest with their song, The Code.\nThe 24-year-old performs it while balancing on a giant, spinning turntable - while hitting the highest of high notes (the chorus is inspired by Mozart's The Magic Flute, typically sung by a soprano).\nAmazingly, there's no trickery involved. \n\"Someone asked me if I have magnets in my shoes,\" they said. \"And I was like, damn, that would have been an amazing idea - because then I wouldn't have to worry about balancing all the time.\n\"It's always a little bit scary, but that's what makes it special for me.\"\nIt all happened at the last minute.\nIn January, Croatian singer Zsa Zsa pulled out of the country's Eurovision selection process, and the gap needed filling. Producers called musician Marko Puri\u0161i\u0107, who performs as Baby Lasagna, and asked if he could step in.\nHe gave a tentative yes, then worked all weekend with his fianc\u00e9 Eliabeta to pull together a performance.\nAmazingly, his song - a techno-metal crossover called Rim Tim Tagi Dim - won by a landslide. Baby Lasagna scored 321 points, with the runner-up getting 82.\nNow he's the bookies' favourite to win Eurovision, too, thanks to his raucous stage presence and a killer hook. (Keep an eye out also for an on-stage tribute to his one-eyed cat, Stipe). \nAfter qualifying for the finals on Tuesday, Marko said it all seemed surreal. \n\"I remember writing Rim Tim Tagi Dim in my small room,\" he wrote on social media. \"Never could I imagine this would happen. It still feels like I'm living somebody else's life.\"\nAs he says in the song, \"there's no going back\".\n\nOne welcome development at this year's contest is an influx of traditional music, alongside the usual Europop bangers and windswept ballads.\nThat means you'll see a few unfamiliar instruments onstage.\nEstonia's 5Miinust x Puuluup (pictured) play a traditional bowed lyre called the Talharpas, while Norway's G\u00e5te brandish the Nyckelharpa - another bowed instrument, originally built and played by farmers in the 17th Century.\nOther countries, including Greece and Italy, fuse their country's folklore with modern sub-bass and Latin rhythms. \nArmenia's Ladaniva even include a recorder solo in their infectiously catchy dance number Jako.\nRepresenting the UK this year is Olly Alexander - who has some of the most ambitious staging of the night.\nThe official description of his set suggests he will \"transport viewers into a post- apocalyptic dystopian boxing gym locker room, aboard a spaceship hurtling toward Earth through a black hole in 1985.\"\nIn practice, this means he's writhing around with four scantily-clad men, while clever camera trickery makes it look like he's Lionel Richie, dancing on his ceiling.\nAlexander, who was formerly lead singer of the pop group Years & Years, comes with something very few British contenders have had in recent years: Stage experience. \nThat c",
    "When Rachael Fletcher-Beaumont got married last year, she was determined that her wedding wasn't going to break the bank.\n\"There's a perception that the word 'wedding' adds noughts [to the cost of services],\" says the 34-year-old from Bradford.\nThe thing that saved Rachael and her husband Luke the most money was choosing to get married on a Thursday, which reduced the cost of their wedding package by \u00a33,000 when compared to a Saturday wedding.\nThe savings they made on the venue allowed the couple to spend money on other aspects of their wedding.\n\"It was worth getting married on a Thursday, without a doubt,\" says Rachael.\nRachael and Luke's choice of day mirrors a growing shift among couples when it comes to picking a date.\nResearch from the Bank of England suggests that more people are choosing cheaper midweek dates to get married.\nWedding planning apps also report evidence of this trend.\nAccording to Hitched, Monday 23 September is set to be the most popular date for weddings this year. \nIt says Tuesday has seen the biggest growth in popularity, up 42% in the last two years.\nSimilarly, Bridebook, which claims to help plan 70% of UK weddings, found that in 2023, for the first time, less than half of weddings took place on a Saturday, \nIt also found that couples who marry on Tuesdays or Wednesdays spend over a fifth less on their weddings than average.\n\"The first thought couples have is that it has to be a Saturday, then they realise they may not care if it's not on a weekend if it puts a couple grand back in their pocket,\" says Holly Poulter, wedding planner for Revelry Events.\nShe says the turning point was the pandemic as \"general chaos\" caused couples to move to weekdays, and the trend has \"stuck around as couples are now more open-minded\".\nHazel Barnes, 59, is getting married in Datchworth, Hertfordshire on a Thursday in July next year, and is saving \u00a33,000 as a result.\nShe says she found the difference in price for weddings across the week \"disgusting... [and] quite jaw dropping\".\nHazel has also managed to cut costs on the reception venue by providing the decorations herself.\nHazel and her husband-to-be Dannie Sanderson, 63, are planning a small wedding and although two of their guests are unable to attend due to issues with childcare, she says: \"What we have been able to get as a result of saving money has outweighed that.\"\nSimilarly, Sophie Wardle, 29, is getting married on Thursday 1 May next year in Wetherby, West Yorkshire. \nThe wedding package was cheaper, partly because it allowed a smaller number of guests, prompting Sophie to reduce her original guest count from 70.\nShe and her fianc\u00e9 sent their wedding date out in August 2023, nearly two years in advance, to give their guests time to book the weekday off, with no complications arising. \nWhile weekday weddings are popular for budget-conscious couples, it is also possible to make savings at a luxury venue location.\nGetting married at Hedsor House in Buckinghamshire would cost you at least \u00a320,950 plus VAT on a Saturday in the peak summer months. However, the same wedding package at the same time of year but on a Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday is offered at \u00a38,500 plus VAT.\nFran Everist, director of sales and marketing at Hedsor House, says she has seen a \"shift in behaviours\" over the last couple of years, with more couples \"happy to get married on every day of the week\".\nBy opting for a cheaper weekday package, she says couples often use the money they saved to splash out on things like a big band or an expensive honeymoon.\nHazel says she did just this, by booking a luxury Rolls-Royce, while Sophie also says she booked more expensive entertainment as a result.\nWhile midweek dates are becoming more popular, wedding planner Holly Poulter says weekend weddings will still continue to work for the majority of couples despite the cost.\n\"These kind of decisions will always be a tricky balance between budget and obligations,\" she says.\n\"Couples are mindful of time commitments for their guests, having to take annual leave and possibly arrange childcare during the week.\"\nWhile acknowledging the potential inconvenience for some guests, Rachael Fletcher-Beaumont says they chose a day just before a bank holiday so that those who wanted to could take a long weekend.\nShe says she and her husband have \"no regrets\" about their non-traditional choice of day.\n\"Everything that happened because of the money we saved ended up making our wedding really personal.\"",
    "The Bank of England boss has said it needs to \"see more evidence\" that price rises have slowed further before cutting interest rates.\nAndrew Bailey said he was \"optimistic that things are moving in the right direction\" as rates were held at 5.25%.\nHe said the Bank expected inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at, would fall \"close\" to its target level in the next couple of months.\nIt paves the way for an interest rate cut as early as June.\nBut Mr Bailey warned a cut was \"not a fait accompli, it's not a done deal\".\nAugust or September appear to be the most likely timing, especially if inflation falls as expected. \nThe interest rate set by the Bank dictates the rates set by High Street banks and money lenders. Rates are currently at their highest level for 16 years which has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things such as mortgages and loans, but savers have also received better returns.\nMr Bailey said there had been \"encouraging news\" on inflation, currently at 3.2%, but said the Bank needed \"more evidence\" it would stay low before cutting rates.\nHowever, at the news conference following the Bank's decision, Mr Bailey said it was \"likely that we will need to cut bank rates over the coming quarters\" and by more than financial markets are currently predicting.\nThe nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee, which votes on rates, appeared to be edging closer towards a cut with two voting for reducing rates and the remaining seven for hold.\nThe Bank was more positive on the prospects for the UK economy in its latest forecast, predicting\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt said he would \"much rather\" policymakers \"wait until they are absolutely sure\" inflation was falling than \"rush into a decision that they had to reverse at a later stage\".\nBut he added that it was encouraging to see \"real optimism\" from Mr Bailey for the first time.\nBut Darren Jones, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said while it was the Bank of England's \"independent right\" to set interest rates, it was \"bad news for people at home having to reset their mortgages for the years ahead at a more expensive rate and people to have to pay rent for their homes\".\nThe health of UK economy has been in the spotlight with economic policies likely to be a key battleground in the quest for votes in the upcoming election, expected by the end of this year.\nAsked on Thursday if the economy had turned a corner, Mr Bailey said: \"All the evidence we see is that we have turned a corner from that.\" But he warned that it was not a \"strong recovery\".\nPaul Day, 62, from Felixstowe, says his mortgage is set to go up by \u00a3225 a month when his five-year fixed deal expires at the end of May.\nMr Day, who is retired, currently pays \u00a31,027 a month, but when his fixed rate of 1.89% ends, he will move on to his lender's standard variable rate of 7.99%.\n\"It's been a scary three months waiting for interest rates to go down and I'm getting closer and closer to my deadline, which is the 31st of May, and they're not,\" he says.\nHe is choosing to go on to a variable rate, because he doesn't want to be \"stuck\" on another fixed.\n\"I think things should settle down within the next six months. So it's a gamble,\" he says. \nFollowing the Bank's latest comments, financial markets now expect rates to be cut to 5% by August and then trimmed to 4.75% in November or December. More rate cuts are predicted for 2025.\nThe Bank started raising rates in December 2021 and has kept interest rates at 5.25% since last summer in an attempt to slow the pace at which consumer prices have been rising - and to ease the cost of living.\nPrices starting rising quickly as demand for goods increased when Covid-related restrictions were lifted. Energy and food prices then soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, leading to inflation rising over 11% in October 2022 - its highest rate in 40 years. \nElectricity and bills have since fallen but are not expected to fall further. \nBy making borrowing more expensive, the Bank hopes to encourage people to cut back on spending which in turn leads to demand for goods falling and price rises easing.\nBut it is a balancing act, as high interest rates can harm the economy and restrict growth, as businesses hold off on investing in production and jobs.\nThe UK fell into recession at the end of last year when the economy shrank for two consecutive three-month periods, but the Bank said it believed the downturn might already be over with official figures released on Friday expected to confirm this.\nThe Bank said it expected the economy to perform slightly better this year, partly due to the size of the population increasing and some measures in the government's spring Budget, such as the cut to National Insurance.\nTackling It Together: More tips to help you manage debt",

He\u2019s so smart.\"\nShe then went on to encourage the children to share their stories, saying that Lilibet once said to her: \u201cMama, I see me in you.\u201d\nEven though she meant literally, Meghan said she hung onto the words, saying she sees herself in her daughter but also all the students there. \n\u201cI believe in you\u201d, she told them.\nThe couple were also joined on stage by Brian, one of three Lightway Academy students who spoke on stage about mental health.\n\"Both boys and girls have feelings and emotions they bottle up because they can\u2019t really express it\u2026 it can lead to suicide,\" he said.\nHe went on to add that he hoped the summit would enlighten him and teach him more about mental health.\nLightway Academy's School Director, Joyce Agbese, told the BBC mental health is a topic not often talked about in Nigeria.\nShe praised Prince Harry's message to the students, which was to \"speak up and speak out, don\u2019t bottle things up\". \n\"He nailed it, basically yes. We want to encourage them to speak out, speak up, express their emotions in the right way,\" said Ms Agbese.\n\u201cWhen somebody this popular or this famous speaks about mental health it makes people realise that it\u2019s normal and so they don\u2019t have to be afraid to talk about it.\"\nOne of the students who watched the talk was 14-year-old Valeria Offia, a year 10 student who brought her copy of Prince Harry's Book Spare to be signed.\nThe prince wrote: \"Keep inspiring others, smashing stigma, and making a difference.\"\nShe told the BBC: \"I think it\u2019s very important because I personally go through some mental health issues; I have anxiety, I suffer from depression from now and then and it\u2019s really nice that people still don\u2019t really think it\u2019s a taboo anymore to speak on these things, and it\u2019s really nice that they were able to come here today and tell us that it\u2019s ok to not be ok.\"\nAfter launching the summit, the prince will head to a military rehabilitation centre in Kaduna.\nPrince Harry and Meghan were invited by Nigeria's chief of defence staff, General Christopher Musa, and will meet injured service personnel.\nThe duke and duchess will also visit Lagos.\nThe couple are set to attend a training session for Nigeria: Unconquered - a charity which collaborates with the Invictus Games - as well as a cultural reception and a polo fundraiser for the charity.\nMeghan is also due to co-host an event of Women in Leadership with Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, director-general of t",
    "Coventry University's vice-chancellor has said the city's economy could lose out on  tens of millions of pounds, due to a government clampdown on international student visas.\nIn January, the government introduced restrictions to prevent most international students bringing dependents with them.\nProf John Latham said the rules, coupled with political rhetoric, were discouraging students from coming to the UK.\nThe Home Office has been approached for a comment.\nIn introducing the new rules at the beginning the year, the department said it also wanted to stop student visas from being a \"backdoor route to work in the UK\".\nIt has asked a committee to review the visa changes, and a report is expected to be released on Tuesday.\n\nCoventry University said international students were worth more than \u00a3150m to the city and blamed politicians for a 40% year-on-year drop in international student recruitment at English universities in January's intake.\nProf Latham said it had had an \"enormous impact\" on the university\u2019s finances and wider economy.\n\"The government is causing significant economic harm to communities like Coventry for the sake of chasing a few misguided headlines,\" he said.\n\"There is a perception that international students are a burden on the economy but the opposite is true as they spend money here and do not use many public services.\"\nHe said the university was a major employer in the area and supported many more jobs either directly or indirectly, adding that international students spent a \"lot of money in the city\".\nAccording to the Migration Observatory, in 2021-22 the university had one of the highest number of international students on roll - 9,845 - with just University College London and the University of Edinburgh attracting more.\nProf Latham said that the higher fees paid by international students helped support the education of UK students.\nHe added the university had cash reserves, which enabled it to adjust, but that it was having to accelerate its move to teaching abroad.\nIt already has branches and campuses in Egypt, Morocco and China, and is negotiating over future campuses in Kazakhstan and India.\nWhen the changes were announced last year, then Home Secretary Suella Braverman said they struck \"the right balance\" between bringing down migration and \"protecting the economic benefits that students can bring to the UK\".  \nThere were 135,788 visas granted to dependants in 2022, a rise from 54,486 in 2021, and more than seven times the 19,139 granted in 2020.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Spying claims involving the police are gathering steam and a scandal is brewing.\nA drip-drip of courtroom revelations has widened the pool of \u201ctroublemaker\u201d journalists who have allegedly been subjected to covert phone surveillance.\nIt would appear this was routine practice - when it was ended, or if it even has, is not yet clear.\nIn 2018, two journalists, Barry McCaffrey and Trevor Birney, were arrested in an operation led by Durham Constabulary who had been tasked by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) to investigate how they obtained information for a documentary on the UVF Loughinisland massacre. \nThe following year, the pair won a court case which found the search warrants used had been \u201cinappropriate\u201d. \nThe judge said they had acted properly in protecting their sources in a lawful way and the police later paid damages amounting to \u00a3875,000. \nThe journalists then filed a case with the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) which examines complaints regarding covert surveillance and this has widened the story.\nMaterial has surfaced through legal disclosure which reveals details of surveillance against Mr McCaffrey, Mr Birney and other journalists. \nIt has emerged they were arrested in the hope of flushing out a source and that Mr McCaffrey was the subject of surveillance on multiple occasions, including in 2013 when his phone was accessed while he pursued allegations of police corruption.\nOther documents prompted the BBC to go to the IPT about one of its former journalists, Vincent Kearney, who believes his phone was monitored while he made a programme in 2011 involving the Police Ombudsman\u2019s Office. \nThis week \u2013 in perhaps the biggest development so far \u2013 a document came to light which stated eight journalists had their phone records checked as routine.\nIt is Durham Constabulary minutes of a meeting with PSNI officers in November 2017. \nIt states that the \u201cunlawful disclosure\u201d of police information had been a long-standing issue and that in 2007/2008 \u201ctelephone billing\u201d may have been applied for in an attempt to establish who was leaking to journalists who were \u201calways looking for a story\u201d. \nA PSNI officer is recorded as stating he is \u201cproactive\u201d in conducting \u201cdefensive operations\u201d by cross-referencing billing with police telephone numbers every six months. \nThe minutes list the names of eight people, all redacted, which were run through a \u201cstand alone intelligence system\u201d. \nThe lawyer representing Mr McCaffrey and Mr Birney described the group as being viewed by the police as \u201ctroublemaker journalists\u201d.\nThe journalists\u2019 lawyer argues the police have acted unlawfully, but this, ultimately, is the matter to be determined by the IPT which has scheduled the case for full hearing in October. \nThere is legislation governing legitimate use of covert surveillance, but evidence around what procedures were properly followed has not yet come to light. \nImportantly, as Mr McCaffrey has noted, the law prevents police from trying to identify journalists\u2019 sources without good reason.\nIt has created a barrage of negative headlines and raised significant issues the PSNI has not yet addressed substantively. \nBased on documents, surveillance of multiple journalists appears to have taken place between 2007 and 2018, but it is not clear what the situation has been since.\nA further issue is that Durham Constabulary are disclosing things to the IPT of which the PSNI seems, so far, to have provided no details. \nSeparately, it took the PSNI months for it to produce a report to the Policing Board which one member, Nuala McAllister, described as \u201cutterly vague\u201d. \nThe board asked how many journalists and lawyers had been subjected to surveillance. \nIt was told not more than ten in each category. \nA board advisor has been granted access to PSNI material and is due to report next month on whether policies and procedures were correctly adhered to.",
    "The father of pop singer Olly Alexander has said representing the UK at the Eurovision final in Sweden was something his son was \"born to do\". \nDavid Thornton, from Sheffield, said he was both \"thrilled and terrified\" ahead of Olly's performance. \nOlly, 33, will be singing \"Dizzy\" on Saturday night but, according to bookmakers, he has just a 1% chance of winning.\n\"But that's fine, it's better than zero,\" Mr Thornton said.\nMr Thornton said his son, who was born in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, wrote his first song when he was seven and developed the instinctive inflection in his voice from copying pop stars on TV in the early 2000s. \nOlly's first piano also came from Sheffield, he said.\n\"It was his great grandmother's and survived the Blitz after a bomb went off across the road. \n\"Olly was obsessed with it,\" he added. \nMr Thornton said Olly taught himself how to read music at 11 and bought the score from The Lord of the Rings to learn by himself. \nHe said: \"When you watch him, the joy and happiness he portrays when he sings... that's what he needs to do. \n\"Nothing will stop him until the whole world are singing his song.\"     \nOlly has described the intense Eurovision rehearsals as being like a \"military operation\" and said he was \"confused and stressed\" by a wardrobe malfunction at the semi-finals on Tuesday. \nHis mic pack fell off during the second chorus meaning he had to awkwardly carry it for the rest of the performance. \nThe former Years & Years singer also spoke about how pressurised the show was.\n\"One thing I maybe forgot was that it's a competition,\" he said. \"People are there to judge you. \n\"I'm used to being judged but it is so palpable. People are scrutinising every little detail. \n\"That's quite intense to experience.\"\nMeanwhile Mr Thornton is planning a big party with a marquee on Saturday night - complete with a cardboard cut-out of his son and a \"Dizzy\" T-shirt. \nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

    "Every parent in Northern Ireland should get the chance to vote to change their child's school to an integrated one.\nThat is according to the chair of the Integrated Education Fund (IEF) Peter Osborne.\nAnalysis from the Department of Education (DE) suggests there are not enough places at integrated post-primary schools to meet demand in several areas of Northern Ireland.\nThat means some parents face a struggle to get their child a place in an integrated post-primary.\nFiona McGinn works for the IEF, but could not get an integrated post-primary school place for her own teenage sons in Belfast when she returned to Northern Ireland in 2023 after working abroad.\n\"I applied to three different integrated schools,\" she said.\n\"All three said they were over-subscribed and had very long waiting lists and basically we had no chance of getting in.\"\nShe said that she had found the situation \"very difficult and very frustrating\".\n\"We are in a system where there is supposed to be choice for parents, but in my case what I found suggested that a lot of parents don't get that choice,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\"I think parents should have a choice about what type of school they want to send their child to, whether that's controlled, maintained, integrated or Irish speaking.\"\n\"Every parent and child should have that choice, but it just doesn't seem at the minute there is that choice available.\"\nFiona Taylor, whose three children attended Oakwood Primary School, also experienced difficulties in securing an integrated post-primary school place.\nFour years ago she had hoped to send her eldest son to Lagan College but missed out because it was oversubscribed.\nAt the time she wrote to the then education minister, the Education Authority, and the children's commissioner.\n\"I didn't get very far but I thought that my letters might help someone else in future.\"\nMs Taylor said many of her son's friends were accepted into Lagan based on the criteria set that year.\n\"They did have older siblings at the school so that meant they were higher up on the list for selection,\" she added.\n\"That was disappointing as well as he then went to a school where he didn\u2019t know anybody.\"\nMs Taylor said integrated education was important to her family because of the \"ethos\".\n\"I think really, in my personal opinion all schools should be integrated.\n\"There's a very high demand for integrated places and just not enough places to accommodate the children, forcing schools into a position where they have got to put some sort of selection criteria in place.\"\nThe Department of Education (DE) has published a progress report on the Integrated Education Act.\nThe act, which became law in 2022, means that DE has to \"encourage, facilitate and support\" integrated education, including growing the number of places in integrated schools.\nIn a number of areas the department said that \"there is demand for post-primary integrated education in excess of supply\".\nThat is the case in the council areas of Belfast, Lisburn and Castlereagh, Ards and North Down, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, and Newry and Mourne.\nBut the DE report said that there was not \"sufficient evidence\" in those areas \"to support the creation of integrated education provision by way of a new school.\"\nHowever it also said that schools like Hazelwood College, Lagan College, Strangford College, Parkhall Integrated College, Ulidia Integrated College, Slemish College, and Shimna Integrated College in those areas were over-subscribed.\nThe department, though, concluded that there were a \"broadly sufficient\" number of integrated primary schools in Northern Ireland.\n\u201cOur analysis of over subscription data suggests that while there is broadly sufficient provision of integrated education at the primary school level to meet parental preference, the same cannot be said for post-primary provision,\u201d the report said.\nThe DE report stated that while surveys suggested around two-thirds of people in Northern Ireland said they were \"open to considering integrated education\" that did not always lead to parents applying to send their children to integrated schools.\n\nMr Osborne was among those questioned on the matter at Stormont's Education Committee.\nHe is a former chair of the Parades Commission and now chairs the Integrated Education Fund which supports the growth of integrated education.\nExisting schools can change to become formally integrated as part of a process called transformation.\nThe process includes a vote by parents to see if a majority is in favour.\nMr Osborne told MLAs that there had been around 25 successful parental ballots for transformation over the past five years.\nBut he said that DE should enable parents in every school in Northern Ireland to vote on whether it should become integrated or not over the next ten years.\nHe said that each ballot would cost around \u00a33,000 per school.\n\"Let's give the parents the choice,\" he said.\n\"It's not a huge amount of money and I would roll it out over ten years if I wa",

Just some of the fierce enemies Doctor Who has encountered over the years.\nBut now Ncuti Gatwa's incarnation of the Time Lord is facing a new adversary and perhaps the most powerful villain yet.\nMaestro.\nAmerican drag queen Jinkx Monsoon, who plays the new nemesis, tells BBC Newsbeat her \"dreams have been granted in a wonderful way\".\nJinkx is known as the \"Queen of Queens\" after winning a regular and All Star season of RuPaul's Drag Race.\nAnd she says moving to the world's longest-running science fiction show felt like a natural progression for a self-described trans queer actor.\n\"Sci-fi has always been queer. Anyone who tells you otherwise is delusional,\" she says.\n\"There are prominent writers, directors, producers who are queer in these fields. And it just hasn't really been able to be talked about and a lot of them nowadays are done being silent.\"\nShe adds there has been \"so much queer progress\" in society, but feels in the entertainment industry \"there's still been this thing of queer people behind the cameras\".\n\"And only certain palatable society-approved queer people get to be in front of the camera.\n\"What I really love about this Doctor Who season is it saying: 'To hell with that'.\"\nJinkx praises the show and the crew for the way she was made to feel right at home.\n\"Being a trans feminine performer who's known as a drag queen, it's like they wanted me to feel comfortable and well-represented in all of the costumes.\"\nShe says she \"loved everything\" the design team came up with.\n\"They definitely took into account that when you're a drag performer, people look at your costumes with a magnifying glass.\n\"Because that's a big part of how we work - our presentation.\n\"So they knew that everyone was going to really have high hopes and expectations for this character, and they all really delivered.\"\nThat's not to say Jinkx was shy about putting her own stamp on the character's look.\nShe says: \"I did the actor thing of saying 'yes\u2026 and what if we added this?'\"\n\"And they were really receptive.\"\nWhen you think of a typical villain in TV shows, there can be a certain menace attached to evil characters.\nBut Doctor Who often does it differently.\n\"What's really exciting about this episode is that it's not jam-packed action, but it's zany and musical\u2026 almost like Doctor Who directed by Bugs Bunny.\n\"There's surprises and lots of music. It's a fun premise, the villain is over the top - just like everything you want in a powerful villain.\n\"We also see how important music is to our world. We get a glimpse at what life could be like without music and how sad and dreary that would be,\" she says.\nJinkx has come off a run on Broadway in the US, playing Matron \"Mama\" Morton in its longest-running show Chicago and breaking box office records in an extended eight-week run.\n\"As an actor, I had a list of things I wanted to do in my lifetime,\" she says.\n\"I wanted to play a Disney villain and have magical powers.\"\n\"Of course I know I've put in the work through the years. So it didn't happen out of nowhere, but the fact it's happening at all is just surreal and magical.\"\nDoctor Who may already have a passionate and dedicated fanbase, but Jinkx is excited about the possibility of bringing in new fans with this latest version of Doctor Who.\nIt's the first set of episodes since the show's partnership with Disney+ and a push to get more American viewers.\n\"One of the great things about the Doctor changing, is we get to see this character we love and know, but through different perspectives throughout their journey,\" says Jinkx.\n\"So I think the way we keep things fresh is by changing the perspective.\n\"For anyone new, it totally welcomes you in and gives you everything you need to know.\n\"The lore of Doctor Who is deepening, we're getting a whole new layer of the universe opening up to us. And anything's possible really.\"\nBack-to-back episodes of Doctor Who will air on BBC One on Saturday 11 May from 18:20\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",
    "A Post Office boss has denied deleting emails that would have shown a key report he wrote was inaccurate weeks after he wrote it.\nRod Ismay\u2019s 2010 internal report was widely cited by the Post Office as proof that Horizon was reliable.\nWhen Mr Ismay was told his conclusions were wrong, Mr Ismay didn\u2019t correct his report, the Horizon Inquiry heard today.\nIn fact he listed it as a \"highlight\" in his annual appraisal two years later.\nRod Ismay was the Post Office\u2019s head of product and branch accounting.\nHe wrote his report in two weeks in 2010, and in evidence to the Post Office Inquiry last year he accepted the suggestion that he had been asked to \u201cpresent one side of the coin\u201d rather than thoroughly investigate flaws in the system.\nHe was recalled to the inquiry for a further day of evidence today after new documents were disclosed.\nThe inquiry heard today that within weeks of filing the report, he was shown evidence that undermined one of its key assertions \u2013 that there was no \u2018back door\u2019 and no way for the data in Post Office branches to be changed without the sub-Postmasters\u2019 knowledge.\nIf the existence of back doors had been publicly known, the inquiry heard, it would have undermined all previous prosecutions which had relied on Horizon data to prove the guilt of sub-postmasters.\nWeeks after he circulated his report in 2010, Mr Ismay received an email which clearly indicated that Fujitsu could alter data at branches \u2013 a back door did exist.\nThis email has not been disclosed to the inquiry. Its contents are only known as a cut and pasted section in a different email.\nFlora Page, one of the lawyers acting for Horizon victims, said this was because Mr Ismay had deliberately deleted them, in an attempt to conceal the fact that he knew his 2010 report was wrong.\n\u201cYou knew that email had to be deleted, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mr Ismay replied.\n\u201cYou understood that it undermined the safety of all those past convictions. You knew that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Ms Page asked.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he replied again.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go round deleting my history of emails on this topic,\u201d he added.\nThe inquiry presented Mr Ismay with four occasions where documents showed he was made aware that there were back doors.\n\u201cWhy did you do nothing on each of those four occasions?\u201d counsel for the inquiry Jason Beer KC asked.\nMr Ismay replied \u201cWell, I am sorry, I think I\u2019ve just got so many things going on this hasn\u2019t registered with me either. And that\u2019s not good saying that. That\u2019s not a satisfactory thing, but it didn\u2019t.\u201d\nIt was one of many times during his evidence where Mr Ismay cited the pressures of work and the volume of emails he received for failing to draw attention to flaws in his report.\nBut the inquiry heard that far from correcting his 2010 report, Mr Ismay was still circulating it.\nHe forwarded the first part of it to colleagues as late as November 2013, saying it \u201cstill holds good\u201d \u2013 long after he was informed its conclusions were wrong.\nThe inquiry was also shown Mr Ismay\u2019s submission to own performance and development review \u2013 his annual appraisal assessing his work.\nIn a list of his \u2018highlights of the year\u2019 he mentioned \u201cPraise from Chairman [at the time, Alice Perkins] for \u201cThe Ismay Report\u201d and being able to continually rebut claims.\u201d\nThose were claims about flaws in the Horizon system, which led to hundreds of people being convicted.\nThe inquiry also saw how Mr Ismay had forwarded an email from Post Office boss David Smith greeting the conviction of Seema Misra as \u201cbrilliant news\u201d. She was the postmistress from West Byfleet in Surrey who was convicted of  theft and sent to jail while pregnant in 2010.\nHe added his own note, welcoming it as an \u201cexcellent result\u201d.\nMr Beer asked if he was regarded as a \u201c[safe] pair of hands who would always defend Horizon on behalf of the Post Office\u201d \u2013 which Mr Ismay denied.",

    "Up to 200 jobs could be at risk as Aberystwyth University tries to save \u00a315m, an MS has said.\nOn Thursday, the university announced there would be a \"significant change \" to the way it operates to save money after it was impacted by inflation and a \"collapse in international recruitment markets\". \nElin Jones, Member of the Senedd for Ceredigion, said between 150 and 200 jobs at the university could be under threat.\nCardiff University has also told staff its financial position is \"not good\" and warned it faced a \u00a335m deficit this year if action was not taken.\nThe university's vice-chancellor Prof Jon Timmis discussed the challenges facing the higher education sector throughout the UK in an announcement to staff.\nHe said the university - which has around 8,000 students and 2,000 staff - needed to make significant savings.\nHe said this a result of high inflation, domestic student fees that have not increased with inflation and a \"collapse\" in international recruitment markets.\n\"Like many other universities in Wales, as part of the plans to make savings, the institution will start a voluntary redundancy scheme which will help to reduce expenditure,\" the university said in a statement.\nThe university added that it was hoping to \"avoid compulsory redundancies as far as possible\".\nMs Jones told BBC Radio Cymru that the wider impact on Aberystwyth could be significant.\n\"Voluntary redundancies is an important first step, and hopefully we will not have to move to compulsory redundancies which is something completely different.\n\"The university is extremely important economically to the economic structure of the county.\"\nDeputy mayor of Aberystwyth, Maldwyn Pryse, said the news created \"uncertainty not only in the university but also in the town\".\nLast month, Swansea University announced a series of job cuts due to \"financial challenges\".\nA spokesman said 189 workers had successfully applied for voluntary redundancy since September.\nThe University of South Wales also announced that it was offering voluntary redundancies in order to make financial savings.\nThe Welsh government said it recognised \"the financial pressure on higher education institutions\", adding that \"the Cabinet Secretary for Education engages regularly and constructively with sector leaders on this\".\nMeanwhile, Cardiff University vice-chancellor Wendy Larner has emailed staff to warn there would be an immediate staff recruitment freeze.\nProf Larner said there were sufficient funds to \u201cweather the storm\u201d in the short-term, but it had to look for ways to cut costs.\nShe said there was \u201cno need for panic\u201d, but \u201cwe can\u2019t continue to make less money than we spend\u201d.\n\"Our financial position is not good. If we don\u2019t take further action, then this year we stand to experience a \u00a335m deficit, and we expect that deficit to be significantly higher next year,\" she wrote.\nAlongside cuts, she said the university would look at new ways to generate income.\nThe university said it could not rule out voluntary redundancies.\nCardiff University's branch of the University and College Union said there were \"mixed messages\" from the university about the financial position and it would \"enter into dispute\" if there were compulsory redundancies.",
    "A man accused of helping steal a statue of baseball player Jackie Robinson from a park in Kansas has pleaded guilty. \nRicky Alderete, a 45-year-old man from Wichita, told court that he helped swipe the statue from the park and loaded it in a pickup truck. \nThe bronze statue was cut off at the ankles before it was hauled away by the burglars in January.\nIts theft was met with outcry from community members, who have since raised money to replace it.\nMr Alderete is facing multiple charges including aggravated burglary, aggravated damage to property and theft, according to prosecutors. \nHe pleaded guilty to the charges on Thursday in the Sedgwick County District Court in Wichita, Kansas.\nDistrict Judge Tyler Roush told Mr Alderete that he faces a maximum prison sentence of over 19 years. \nHe also faces a fine of $41,500 (\u00a333,126) that would be paid to League 42, a youth baseball league that plays in McAdams Park, where the statue was stolen from. The league was named after Robinson's jersey number. \nSurveillance footage of the theft shows at least two people entering the park around midnight and stealing the statue, police had previously said.\nMr Alderete is the first to be arrested. He is scheduled to be sentenced on 1 July. \nRobinson, who played for the Brooklyn Dodgers, made history as the first black player in MLB, paving the way for generations of African American ball players.\nEarlier, authorities said there was no evidence to suggest the theft of the statue was a hate crime. Rather, the perpetrators were likely looking to make money.\n\"We believe this theft was motivated by the financial gain of scrapping common metal,\" Police lieutenant Aaron Moses said in February. \nAuthorities also said they believe the statue is no longer intact, and that it has been taken apart by the burglars and would need to be fully replaced.\nSince its theft, nearly $200,000 (\u00a3159,650) was raised by community members through an online fundraiser, and Major League Baseball (MLB), North America's professional baseball league, has since offered to replace it.\nThe new statue is expected to be erected by the summer, city officials have said.",
    "The weekend edition of the Financial Times is one of several papers to lead on the news that the UK is out of recession. It says Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is taking \"heart\" from the \"stronger than expected\" economic growth in the first three months of the year - and says it is a \"boost\" for him ahead of the general election. \nThe FT also highlights that Britain's growth beat the US and the Eurozone in the first quarter, but carries a Labour warning that the UK economy is \u201cstill \u00a3300 smaller per head\u201d than when Mr Sunak became prime minister in October 2022.\nThe \"economy's going gangbusters\" is the Daily Mail's headline after what it calls the \"shortest and shallowest recession on record\". \n\"That's positive!\" declares the Daily Express - adding that the UK economy is getting \"back to full strength\".\nMeanwhile, the i reports that the Treasury is working on plans for what it calls a \"2p Tory tax giveaway in September\". The paper says the chancellor is understood to be targeting a cut to National Insurance \"weeks ahead of the election\", if the economy allows.\nThe Daily Telegraph leads with the warning from former Labour leader Lord Kinnock - given to Radio 4's The Week in Westminster - that voters are not fully convinced by Sir Keir Starmer and his party. \nIt says Labour insiders fear that the general election could become a repeat of 1992, when Sir John Major's Conservative Party pulled off a shock victory. Anneliese Dodds - who chairs Labour - tells the paper: \u201cWe can be very good at losing elections people thought we would win.\"\nThe Guardian leads on the UN General Assembly backing a Palestinian bid for full membership of the UN. The paper says the \"highly charged gesture\" drew an immediate rebuke from Israel. But it says the vote signals what it calls \"Israel's growing isolation\" over the war in Gaza, and the extent of the humanitarian crisis.\nThe Times reports that private schools face a \"testing time\". It says the number of children being enrolled has dropped by the biggest proportion in more than a decade - with admissions falling by 2.7% this academic year. The paper says the independent schools' sector blames Labour\u2019s pledge to put VAT on fees if it wins power.\n\"Euro division\" is how the Sun sums up this year's song contest in Sweden. The paper says Eurovision has been plunged into crisis ahead of Saturday's final, with more than 20,000 pro-Palestinian protesters expected to turn out against the inclusion of Israel's contestant, Eden Golan. The Sun says some UK venues have also decided not to show the event - or face what it calls a \"mob backlash\".\nFinally, the Guardian reports that tennis fans at Wimbledon may be treated to the \"cream of the crop\" of strawberries this year. It says many farms have borne the brunt of the extreme, wet weather during the winter. But berry growers tell the paper that if it is cool, that means strawberries ripen more slowly - and are bigger and juicier.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "The 75-year-old ringleader of an armed robbery in which a police officer was shot dead almost 20 years ago has been jailed for life for her murder.\nPiran Ditta Khan spent nearly two decades evading justice for his part in the killing of PC Sharon Beshenivsky in Bradford on 18 November 2005.\nKhan, who was extradited from Pakistan last year, was convicted of murder following a trial at Leeds Crown Court.\nHe was told he would serve a minimum term of 40 years in prison.\nThe judge, the Honourable Mr Justice Hilliard, said that PC Beshenivsky's \"courage and commitment to her duty that day cost her her life\".\nHe told Khan: \"The sentence I pass is no measure of the value of the life that has been lost.\n\"That's beyond measure and no sentence I pass can put right what you've done wrong.\" \nPC Beshenivsky had been responding to reports of an armed robbery at the Universal Express travel agents on Morley Street in Bradford with her colleague, PC Teresa Milburn, when she was fatally attacked.\nThe two officers arrived at the scene about 15:30 GMT, but as they approached the entrance, three men burst out of the premises, shooting them both. \nPC Milburn was seriously injured.  \nKhan's trial heard that although he was eating sandwiches in a lookout car when the two officers were shot, he had played a \"pivotal\" role in planning the raid and knew loaded weapons would be used.\nProsecutors said this made him guilty of the officer's murder \"as surely as if he had pulled the trigger himself\". \nNot long after the officer's killing, Khan, who has previous convictions for violence, fled to Pakistan and remained there until he was arrested by Pakistani authorities in January 2020 and extradited to the UK in 2023.\nPassing sentence, the judge detailed how Khan had a number of health ailments, including heart disease and back trouble, and said his \"physical condition will make custody hard to serve\".\nHe added: \"You are responsible for the fact that you are being sentenced at the age of 75 and not at a younger age.\n\"You have had your younger and healthier years at liberty because you chose to leave the country when you feared you were about to be arrested.\"\nPeter Wright, defending, had earlier told the court that due to Khan's age, his \"final years, in all probability, are to be spent in custody with the forbidding prospect that he will die there\".\nDuring Khan's trial, the court had heard how PC Beshenivsky was discussing her daughter Lydia's family birthday party with PC Milburn when she heard the call for assistance.\nIn his sentencing remarks, the judge said: \"We can say with absolute certainty that her thoughts were with her family very shortly before she died.\"\nEarlier in the hearing, a victim impact statement was read out on behalf of Lydia, who described her mum as a \"hero\" who \"paid the ultimate sacrifice\".\n\"I have been told by others that when I was told my mum had died and was not coming home, I screamed my head off around the house,\" she added.\nLydia said in her statement that she had a memory of asking \"often when her mum was coming home\".\nShe said she also remembered seeing her older brother Paul crying, but not understanding why.\n\"Since that day and throughout my life there has always been a void, a void that should have been filled by my mum's presence,\" she said.\n\"But as a result of your actions, Khan, and your associates that day, you robbed me of a future and precious time with my mum.\"\nIn a statement read outside court after sentencing, PC Beshenivsky's family said: \"18 November 2005 is a date that will remain etched in our memories forever. \n\"What started as a happy, special day to celebrate Lydia's fourth birthday, was a day that ended in devastating, sad consequences due to the callous actions of Piran Ditta Khan and his associates.\n\"Since then, 18 November is no longer a birthday celebration - for Lydia and us all - but now a day of remembrance and memorial.\n\"That was the day the lives of our family and those close to Sharon changed forever. As well as Sharon's friend and colleague Teresa, and her family.\"\nThe court had also been told of the impact of the day on PC Milburn, who had since suffered post-traumatic stress disorder.\nIn her victim impact statement, she said: \"I've never grieved for anyone as I have for Sharon. It has taken over my life.\"\nSpeaking after Khan's sentencing, ACC Patrick Twiggs of West Yorkshire Police said: \"Two mums set out to work that day - two ordinary people doing extraordinary work for the public. One didn't return home and one didn't return home in the same way.  \n\"All those years ago we made a promise to hunt down every last member of this gang and today we achieved that.\n\"West Yorkshire Police will continue to honour Sharon's memory, we still mourn the loss, we still miss her, she will be forever in our thoughts.\"\nIt's almost 20 years since PC Sharon Beshenivsky answered the call for help on that fateful day in Bradford. \nThe new officer was 30 minutes away from heading home for her d",
    "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said that it will \"take time\" for people to \"really feel better\" as figures revealed the UK had emerged from recession. \nThe economy grew by 0.6% between January and March after shrinking in the second half of last year. \nMr Sunak told the BBC that the UK economy has \"real momentum\" but admitted there was \"more work to do\".  \nBoth Labour and the Liberal Democrats said there was little to celebrate. \"After 14 years of economic chaos, working people are still worse off,\" said Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves.\nGross domestic product (GDP) - which measures the amount of goods and services an economy produces - rose by more than expected in the first three months of the year. Analysts had forecast 0.4% growth.\nMr Sunak suggested that there was now some strength behind the UK economy, which saw the fastest pace of growth for two years between January and March.\nThe UK fell into recession at the end of last year after shrinking for two three-month periods in a row.\nMr Sunak said: \"Of course there's more work to do and I get that and that's why I'm keen to stick to our plan and keep delivering for people.\n\"But I think today's figures show that we now have momentum.\"\nHowever, Ms Reeves said: \"This is no time for Conservative ministers to be doing a victory lap and telling the British people that they have never had it so good.\"\nLib Dem Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney said it was the time to call a general election.\nThe economy will be a key battleground in the upcoming election, the date of which is yet to be revealed.\nMeanwhile, the FTSE 100 index closed on a fresh record high after the economic figures came out.\nIt closed 52.41 points, or 0.63% higher, at 8,433.76, with finance and industrial stocks among the biggest risers of the day.\nEarlier this week, the Bank of England's governor Andrew Bailey told the BBC that the UK was seeing a recovery, though not a strong one.\nThe Bank voted to hold interest rates at a 16-year high of 5.25%. It expects inflation - which measures the pace of price rises - to fall back to its 2% target in the next couple of months. \nThat had lifted forecasts of a rate cut next month. However, the stronger than expected GDP figures have dampened those expectations.\nRuth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said it showed \"the Bank of England doesn't need to rush to cut interest rates\".\nShe said the first rate cut would ultimately be determined by upcoming employment and inflation figures.\nMr Sunak said that the GDP figures show that the UK has the joint highest growth rate in the G7 developed nations, tying with Canada.\nHe added: \"Wages are going up, energy bills are coming down and taxes are going down.\"\nThe government has cut National Insurance by 4% since late last year.\nHowever, it has also kept income tax thresholds frozen so when a person's wage increases, they could be moving up into a higher tax bracket.

    "A woman whose husband was killed by their son who has schizophrenia, have called for an independent review into what happened.  \nDaniel Harrison, 37, fled from a secure mental health unit before fatally attacking his father, Dr Kim Harrison, at the family's home in Clydach, Swansea, in March 2022.\nAn inquest found failures in the care of Daniel had \"contributed\" to Dr Harrison's death.\nSwansea Bay University Health Board apologised for its failings and said it had put \"key actions\" in place for improvement.\nDaniel was detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act for manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility.\nHis mother, Dr Jane Harrison, said her son was let down at all stages of his mental health care.\n\"Our family has suffered immeasurable harm at the hands of managers and senior clinicians,\" she said.\n\"We are calling for an independent review of mental health services across Swansea Bay. \n\"Only through external scrutiny will the deep cultural issues that are clearly present be addressed and those responsible for the many professional and systemic failings be held to account.\"\nA prevention of future deaths report, written by the assistant coroner for south west Wales, detailed how a Swansea council mental health worker failed to access Daniel's full history before a formal assessment under the Mental Health Act in February 2021.\nDaniel's parents and brothers had repeatedly raised concerns with both the council and the health board about his behaviour, the report said, after Daniel stopped taking his medication and refused to engage with counselling services. \nThe assessment was also non-compliant, the report continued, because only one doctor was present.\nDaniel then became increasingly paranoid and aggressive towards his parents who, on two more occasions, tried and failed to get a mental health assessment before he was eventually detained in 2022.\nThe coroner's report said the history provided by the Harrison family \"was not afforded sufficient weight\", with \"reliance being placed solely on the records on the system which were out of date\".\nThe report also raised concerns about the health board's use of locum doctors, some of whom did not record notes of their interactions with Daniel.\n\"There is no system within Swansea Bay University Health Board (SBUHB) to ensure doctors are required to record the outcome of their assessment when there is a decision not to admit a patient to hospital,\" the report added.\nIt said the lack of a single medical records system created \"a risk that assessments may be flawed or may not detect that a person requires admission to hospital\".\nThe inquest found staff in the ward where Daniel was being held prior to his escape had no risk assessment training. \nThe report said that only 75% of staff were now trained,  \"which raises a concern that risk to self and others and the risk of absconding will not be properly identified... thus creating a risk that other deaths will occur\".\nThe report also raised concerns about Daniel's refusal to engage with mental health services when he was unwell.\nThe assistant coroner said authorities should refer such cases to \"assertive outreach\". \n\"I am concerned that if consent is required before a mentally unwell person in the community is able to receive assertive outreach then there may be a gap in the mental health services within SBUHB that creates a risk,\" the report stated.\nSwansea Bay health board \"unequivocally\" apologised for its failings and said it had put \"key actions\" in place for improvement, including additional security measures on the ward where Daniel Harrison was treated.\n\"We recognise that insights and information provided by family members about patients play a crucial role in planning and delivering care,\" a spokesperson said. \n\"We have strengthened our processes around ensuring this vital information is robustly recorded and shared with clinical teams.\"\nIt said it would be responding formally to the coroner's report in June. \nSwansea council said it again sent its \"sincere condolences\" to Dr Harrison's family and it would respond formally later to the coroner's report.\n\"We are in the process of reviewing our internal processes to determine what action is necessary in light of the concerns arising from the coroner's inquest and the subsequent report issued relating to the prevention of future deaths.\"",

I did love her, to be honest, and she said she loved me.\"\nHe said on one occasion Joynes turned up at a pub where he was with friends and was \"crying her eyes out\".\n\"Now I think about it, it was emotional abuse.\n\"She just basically mentally abused me, then I sacrificed 18 months for a paedophile.\"\nThey had unprotected sex as the teacher had told him she could not have a baby, but later revealed she was pregnant, the court heard.\n\"That was probably the lowest point. \n\"We were irresponsible. It's my own fault,\" Boy B said.\n\"I can't hide a kid. I had hid the relationship for 18 months from my parents.\"\nJoynes, who has been wearing a pink baby's bonnet tucked into her trousers during the trial, wiped away tears as the witness added: \"I have also thought about the future of my child.\n\"I want the best for my child as well.\"\nPreviously, the court heard how the teacher had become pregnant by Boy B while on bail for having sex with Boy A.\nJoynes denies six counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child, including two while being a person in a position of trust.\nThe trial was adjourned until Monday.\nListen to the best of\u00a0BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A security guard who pulled over a woman on an isolated country lane while impersonating a police officer has been convicted. \nChris Green, 32, of Nero Place, Peterborough, used a flashing blue light in his car to flag the driver down before informing her she had been \"driving dangerously\". \nSwindon Magistrates' Court heard he had been driving at 30mph in a 60mph zone in Wiltshire when she overtook him on 6 May 2023. However, he then overtook her and confronted her.\nWhen challenged, Green said he worked for a fictional undercover crime unit called \"The Brotherhood\" and was unable to produce a badge number. He denied impersonating a police officer but was found guilty on Thursday and is due to be sentenced on 28 June.\nThe court heard it was only after he noticed the victim's young son in the back of the car did he tell the victim he would \"let it go\". \nLater, officers found a blue LED light inside his car as well as police-style handcuffs, a dash cam and a baseball bat.\nOfficers were able to trace the car because the woman recorded his registration plate.\nGreen admitted in court he had illuminated the blue lights, but denied impersonating a police officer.\nSibylle Cheruvier, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"This was a wholly unnerving incident for the victim involved, who was in a vulnerable position as a lone female driver.\n\"I commend the victim for keeping her wits about her and recording Green's number plate, through which police were able to locate him shortly after.\"\n\nShe added: \"Impersonation of a police officer is clearly a cause of concern for the community, and we are pleased that the court has seen through Green's deception.\n\"I am very grateful to the victim for her support throughout this case, without which we would not have been able to prove Green's intentions.\n\"We urge anyone who is unsure if they have been stopped by a genuine police officer to contact the police immediately.\"\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A driver accused of murdering a pedestrian in a road rage fight struck out with a wheel brace in self defence, a court has heard.\nJake McIntyre, 28, said Andrew Peart was \"aggressive\" and \"bouncing\" for a fight when they confronted each other outside a shop in Guide Post, Northumberland, in August.\nMr Peart, 39, died in hospital from a head injury eight days later, Newcastle Crown Court has heard.\nMr McIntyre, an amateur martial artist, denies murder.\nMr McIntyre said he was driving his Mitsubishi Shogun to the Co-op in Guide Post on 22 August when he saw a man walking in the \"middle of the road\".\nHe said he beeped his horn and, when the man turned round, he realised it was Mr Peart who he knew of.\nMr McIntyre said Mr Peart came up to his open passenger window shouting something \"along the lines of what are you doing driving towards us like that\".\nMr Peart asked Mr McIntyre if he wanted to \"go\", which the driver took to mean have a fight, before the pedestrian took his shirt off and started \"bouncing\" like a boxer.\nMr McIntyre, of Stakeford Crescent in Ashington, said he drove away, but in his mirror he could see Mr Peart appearing to pick something up off the floor.\nHe said he was \"confused\" by the altercation but, knowing Mr Peart and his friends, he knew it was \"never just going to be left there\" and there would be \"repercussions\" from them.\nMr McIntyre said he parked and walked back to see Mr Peart as he wanted to \"squash it\" and \"say let bygones be bygones\".\nHe said he took a foot-long wheel brace with him as he thought Mr Peart may have armed himself and he \"didn't want to take any chances\".\nMr McIntyre said Mr Peart said \"sorry\" but it was in an \"aggressive manner\" and he didn't believe the apology was real.\nHe said Mr Peart walked towards him and he thought he was going to get punched, so he hit Mr Peart in the leg with the wheel brace.\nWhen asked by his barrister John Elvdige KC why he struck Mr Peart, Mr McIntyre replied: \"Because I felt he was coming towards me in a threatening manner and he was going to hit me.\"\nWhen asked if he intended to kill or cause really serious harm to Mr Peart, Mr McIntyre said: \"No I didn't.\"\n\nThe two men grappled, then Mr McIntyre turned and sent Mr Peart toppling over a bin to the ground, the court heard.\n\"He was on the floor and I just asked him 'why couldn't you just leave it',\" Mr McIntyre said.\nHe said Mr Peart continued to shout and make threats as Mr McIntyre returned to his car.\nWhen asked by Mr Elvidge what condition Mr Peart appeared to be in, Mr McIntyre replied: \"He was absolutely fine.\"\nThe court has heard Mr Peart initially appeared uninjured but fell ill later that night.\nMr McIntyre said he got a message from Mr Peart's partner, Sarah Gray, the following day to say he was in hospital in a coma and alleging he had hit Mr Peart in the head with a metal pole.\n\"I didn't believe it,\" Mr McIntyre said, adding he then called Ms Gray to tell her what had happened, claiming he hit Mr Peart in the leg with the wheel brace and \"punched him once\".\nThe court heard he sent a message in which he talked about hiding from police and changing his car after doling out \"street justice\" to a \"little crackhead\".\nMr McIntyre told jurors it was a \"private message between friends\" and he \"didn't believe the situation was as serious as it was\".\nHe also said another message in which he talked about \"wrapping a pole\" around Mr Peart's head was him \"literally just bigging up\" to his friends and was \"not accurate\".\nThe court heard Mr McIntyre was arrested at a hotel in Bowness-on-Windermere, Cumbria, three days later.\nHe said he had planned the break away with his girlfriend already but went a day earlier because he feared \"repercussions\" from Mr Peart's friends, had noticed cars following him and \"just wanted to get away\". \nThe trial continues.\nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "The family of Muriel McKay say they will travel back to Trinidad to thank her killer if her body is found, as they wait to hear whether police will carry out a further search. \nMetropolitan Police detectives went to the Caribbean in March to question Nizamodeen Hosein, one of two brothers convicted of murdering Mrs McKay at a Hertfordshire farm.\nMrs McKay was kidnapped for ransom in 1969 after being mistaken for the then-wife of Rupert Murdoch and was traced to Stocking Farm near Bishop\u2019s Stortford, although her body was never found.\nThe Metropolitan Police said detectives were \"still assessing all the information\u201d gathered from their trip and would \u201cupdate the family as soon as we can\u201d.\nMuriel McKay was the wife of Rupert Murdoch's deputy Alick McKay when she was abducted from her home in London on 29 December 1969.\nBrothers Arthur and Nizamodeen Hosein were convicted of her kidnap and murder.\nBut while Arthur died in prison in 2009, Nizamodeen was deported to Trinidad and Tobago after serving his sentence.\nMark Dyer, 59, and his mother Dianne McKay, 84, went to meet Nizamodeen in January, to look at maps and photos of Rooks Farm, which is now called Stocking Farm.\nHe said her body was buried there and told the BBC he was willing to come to England to show police the location.\nPolice searched Stocking Farm near Bishop's Stortford in 2022 and nothing new was found.\nHowever, Mr Dyer said the search should have continued.\n\"We have an awful tragedy here and we want to resolve it,\" Mr Dyer told BBC's Justin Dealey. \"Let us dig my grandmother up, because all I want to do is pick my grandmother up and take her home.\n\"If I find her and she is reburied, I will go to Trinidad again, I will go to Trinidad because I will thank Nizamodeen Hosein and that will be the end of it because then I know it is done and closed.\"\nAs the family awaits a police decision over a further search, Mr Dyer said it was like the force's \"watch has stopped\". \n\"Either the Metropolitan Police's watch has stopped or their clock has stopped... they [the police] don't seem to have any empathy whatsoever, any understanding of tragedy,\" Mr Dyer said.\nHe said his mother Diane McKay had been left \"devastated\". \n\"I want her to be able to see that we have actually found her mother and I want her to be alive for it.\"\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "News that residents in a market town had been told to complete a \u00a3165 safety course or hire a contractor to hang baskets on streetlights left many people blooming furious. But what is the issue and why has it been raised now?\nThe Cambridgeshire town of Chatteris knows a thing or two about floral displays.\nIn recent years, Chatteris in Bloom has won gold at Britain in Bloom and Anglia in Bloom.\nThe group's award-winning displays are usually adorned on 20 lampposts and put up with the help of a local farmer and a telehandler each May, before judging in July.\nBut this year, a problem emerged - Cambridgeshire County Council said the lamppost displays could only go up if at least one member went on a safety course.\nThe council said this was all because the streetlights were connected to the power grid and it needed to \"ensure everyone's safety\".\nThe council says its policy on fixing things to lampposts has been in place since 2019.\n\"We understand the issue has come up now as the Chatteris in Bloom display is due to be put up later in the month,\" a council spokesperson said.\n\"We discussed the need for training with the Chatteris Town Council and the Christmas Lights Committee last winter.\n\"Policy details have been shared with all parish and town councils in Cambridgeshire. It's also available on our website.\"\nThe council's safety concerns include people working at height and the fact streetlights are connected to the local power grid.\nData from the Health and Safety Executive shows three people were killed at work after coming into \"contact with electricity or electrical discharge\" and 40 died in \"falls from height\" during 2022-23.\nThe BBC was unable to find any examples of deaths or injuries caused by people putting displays up on lampposts.\nHowever, UK Power Networks, which supplies the power to streetlights across the east, south east and London, told the BBC it had \"not seen any power cuts or safety incidents as a result of items attached to lampposts\".\nThe company was keen to stress it welcomed the \"council's safety-first approach\".\nIf they don't use trained contractors, the county council wants somebody from Chatteris in Bloom to get themselves on the G39 Working in the Vicinity of DNO (distribution network operators) Equipment awareness course.\nIt is a one-day course run by providers across the UK, usually at a cost of about \u00a3165-\u00a3175.\nThe aim of the course is to give people better knowledge of electrical safety in terms of public lighting and other street furniture.\nParticipants learn about public lighting systems, the law and how to avoid dangers.\nChatteris in Bloom's president Sue Unwin, 64, initially feared \"bureaucracy was going to kill community spirit\".\n\"It has become impossible with the bureaucracy and red tape,\" Mrs Unwin said.\n\"There's some jobsworth in the county council who has made this decision... we have been doing this for over 18 years. None of us have that capability or the money - we give enough of our time.\n\"We do everything properly and this bureaucracy is going to kill community spirit because we are getting fed up with this. We work hard to make our town look nice. Why can't they leave us alone to get on with it?\"\nHowever, since the BBC reported on the episode, Mrs Unwin was contacted by people willing to pay for and sit on the course so they could put the baskets on electrical street furniture.\n\"We have so much support behind us and we are hoping for gold again this year,\" she said.\nThe council has maintained throughout that \"this is not red tape, it's about keeping people safe\".\n\"All we are asking is that any group wishing to create displays on our streetlights - which could involve putting heavy items overhead, on streetlights directly connected to the local power grid - is that they contact us first. \n\"This is so we can make sure essential independent safety training is completed for everyone's wellbeing.\n\"We have met with Chatteris Town Council and we understand they are looking into volunteer training. \n\"We gather there is already at least one trained volunteer in the area.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The family of a Leeds United legend has raised more than \u00a3110,000 to fund \"groundbreaking\" cancer research.\nNorman Hunter died from Covid in April 2020, after a seven-year battle with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).\nThe money raised in his memory has allowed a 62-year-old grandma, Cathy, also diagnosed with CLL, to take part in a clinical trial.\nShe feared she would never get to meet her future grandchildren - but six years on, she is grandma to two.\n\"When the doctors told me I had cancer, my first thought was, 'am I going to die?' and then, 'will I ever get to meet my future grandchildren?' I was terrified,\" Cathy said.\n\"But here I am, six years later, making special memories with my two grandchildren - all thanks to the incredible treatment I've had at Leeds Cancer Centre.\"\nThe 62 year old said she dreaded the thought of chemotherapy and \"possible gruelling side effects\". \nBut a University of Leeds-led FLAIR trial offered Cathy less invasive treatment options, which she has described as \"really smooth sailing\".\n\"Thanks to this, my life has remained as normal as it can be.\n\"I've been able to keep doing the things I love, like playing in my orchestra and spending time with the grandkids,\" she said.\n\"I feel incredibly lucky that this trial is giving me many more years to live my life to the fullest.\"\nA lecturer at the University of Leeds explained how fundraising by Mr Hunter's family was helping his team identify more tailored treatments. \nDr Darren Newton, lecturer in Haematology and Immunology, said: \"The money raised by the Hunter family has enabled us to support research into the more personalised treatments given to patients like Cathy. \n\"We have seen hugely promising results from these trials led by Dr Tahla Munir at St.James's Hospital.\"\nOver 1,500 patients in over 100 centres across the UK took part in the FLAIR trial, with 90% of patients treated with combination targeted therapies testing as completely negative for CLL in their blood.\nThe Hunter family recently visited the Leeds Cancer Centre to hear from researchers and clinicians working on the trials, as well as patients like Cathy.\nMr Hunter's wife, Sue, said: \"It has been absolutely fantastic so see how much progression there has been with this vital research since we last met with Darren and the team. \n\"To hear first hand how our fundraising is having an ongoing impact makes all of our efforts worthwhile.\"\nSince their first annual golf day in 2021, the family have raised an impressive \u00a3112,368, and they are hosting their fourth event in June. \n\"This is all only possible because of everyone who has come together to support the golf day,\" said Mrs Hunter. \n\"We never imagined the event would have raised so much money, and we know that Norman would be beaming with pride.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "The 68th Eurovision Song Contest final is taking place on Saturday in Malmo in Sweden.\nUK entrant Olly Alexander had an automatic place in the final and will perform his song Dizzy.\nThe grand final will be at the Malmo Arena on Saturday 11 May. \nIt will be broadcast live at 20:00 BST on BBC One, BBC Radio 2, BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds.\nGraham Norton will host the grand final for the BBC.\nYou can also follow the build up and live coverage here on the BBC News website.\nThe Eurovision Song Contest is an annual televised competition organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). \nThe theme of the 2024 contest is \"united by music\", and it features 37 performers chosen to represent their country.\nSongs must be original and no more than three minutes long. \nLead vocals must be live, and a maximum of six singers and dancers are allowed. \nMost Eurovision countries are European, but Australia takes part every year, after being invited to join Eurovision's 60th anniversary celebrations in 2015. However, Australia cannot host if it ever wins.\nOther non-European countries including Israel participate because they are members of the EBU.\nThe 2024 contest is being held in Malmo after Sweden's Loreen won in 2023 with her song Tattoo.\nShe became the first woman to win the contest twice after triumphing in 2012 with Euphoria.\nThis is the seventh time Sweden has staged the contest, and the third time it has been held in Malmo.\nAs 2024 is the 50th anniversary of Swedish group Abba's first Eurovision win with Waterloo, there had been speculation about the band's potential involvement. But Abba members told the BBC they would not perform.\nSweden will be the first country to perform, after a random draw.\nFrance, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK were also guaranteed a place in the final.\nAfter the first semi-final on Tuesday, the countries joining them were Serbia, Portugal, Slovenia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Finland, Cyprus, Croatia, Ireland and Luxembourg.\nThe second semi-final on Thursday saw a further 10 acts qualify, from Latvia, Austria, The Netherlands, Norway, Israel, Greece, Estonia, Switzerland, Georgia and Armenia.\nPopstar Olly Alexander is representing the UK at the 2024 contest.\nThe former Years and Years frontman is hoping to improve on the UK's disappointing performance in 2023, when Mae Muller came second to last.\nAlexander is well-known around Europe for hits including Desire, King and If You're Over Me.\nHe is also a Bafta-nominated actor, having played the lead role in Channel 4's hard-hitting Aids drama It's A Sin.\nIsrael's Eden Golan competed in Thursday's semi-final and won a place in the grand final. She had been booed in rehearsals.\nHer song Hurricane is a rewritten version of the country's original entry, October Rain, which was thought to reference the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel.\nThe revised lyrics tell the story of a woman experiencing a personal crisis, according to Israel's public broadcaster, Kan.\nKan initially said it would withdraw from the contest rather than change the lyrics.\nBut after the organisers barred the song for its political content, the country's president, Isaac Herzog, called for \"necessary adjustments\" to ensure Israel could compete.\nSeparately, musicians and organisations from a number of countries have called for Israel to be suspended over the war in Gaza.\nIceland's Association of Composers and Lyricists said Israel's military action made its participation incompatible with an event \"characterised by joy and optimism\".\nSimilar objections have been raised in Finland, Norway, Denmark and Sweden, with many pointing out that Russia has been disqualified since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nEurovision organisers have resisted calls for Israel's exclusion, saying the situations in Ukraine and Gaza are different.\nThe EBU has also said that abuse and harassment of artists over Israel's participation is \"unacceptable\".\nFor the final, every country which qualifies awards two sets of scores: one from a jury of experts and one by fans.\nEach of their 10 favourite songs is given points - but they cannot vote for their own country's song.\nTheir favourite act receives 12 points, their second-favourite 10 points, their third choice eight points, and then seven points, and so on, down to one point for their 10th favourite.\nEurovision was one of the first televised competitions to let viewers vote.\nFans in Austria, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK began voting by phone in 1997.\nThe rest of the world was allowed to vote in 2023, with points given to the 10 most popular songs worldwide.\nEach participating broadcaster pays an entrance fee to the EBU. \nFrance, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK pay the most, although the BBC does not make its contribution public.\nIt is thought staging the 2023 event in Liverpool cost the BBC between \u00a38m and \u00a317m. The UK government pledged \u00a310m, while local authorities in Liverpool committed \u00a34m. ",
    "The moment Alok Shukla first saw the forest in central India stretching out before him, he knew two things instantly.\nOne: that this forest - known as the lungs of Chhattisgarh, home to thousands of tribespeople, endangered animals and rare plants - was one of the most beautiful places he had ever seen.\nAnd two: that he would dedicate his life to stopping the multi-billion dollar companies hoping to uproot it in search of the coal beneath its soil.\nThe only question was, how?\nTwelve years later, Alok can smile at the memory. After all, what he has achieved in the intervening years has been impressive.\nOn Monday, the 43-year-old was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize, otherwise known as the green Nobel.\nBut it started with small steps.\nBack in 2012, the Hasdeo Aranya forest in Chhattisgarh state and its 657 bio-diversity rich square miles (1,071km sq) were under threat, thanks to its massive coal deposits - totalling an estimated 5.6 billion tonnes.\nIn India, the world's second largest consumer of coal after China, those deposits are a highly valuable commodity.\nBut the value to the tribespeople - known collectively as the Adivasi - and the animals like elephants, sloth bears, leopards and wolves, not to mention the tigers which use it as a corridor between habitats, or the birds which live in the trees, was incalculable to Alok.\nHe wasn't the only one to recognise the value of the land: local authorities had declared it protected a few years earlier - although this was never formal.\nDespite this, so-called coal blocks in the forest were put up for auction. The powerful multinational Adani group would apply to build five mines in the area between 2010 and 2015. More companies, and more mines, would follow.\n\"I still vividly remember the day I went there,\" Alok says. \"It's such a beautiful forest - and unfortunately that forest is going to be destroyed by coal mining.\n\"But much worse than that, the local tribal communities there who have been conserving the forest for centuries - they're not even aware of what the impacts of mining would be... or what the legal provisions and protections [are that would help them save it].\"\nThe loss of their traditional home, Alok feared, would be devastating.\n\"The Adivasis have been living there for several centuries. They know nothing else, but these forests. It's part of their identity.\"\nAnd they were already trying to fight back - the problem was, each village was fighting alone.\nAlok realised they were doomed to lose the battle unless everyone came together. Two mines had already begun production because the resistance had failed.\n\"It's not just a fight for one village in fact, it's a fight for the entire region,\" he says.\nOut of this, the Save Hasdeo Aranya Resistance Committee - an informal alliance of grassroots movements - grew, teaching people about the local laws and rights available. It also linked the different groups together effectively for the first time.\nBut it wasn't easy. In 2020, more coal mines were proposed. \nWith Covid racing across India, Alok once again began organising.\nCommunity pressure led to three of the mines being shelved that September. The next month, the community fought to have almost a million acres designated as an elephant reserve.\nThen central government stepped in to push forward plans to auction off 21 coal blocks under emergency provisions.\nIt would take another 18 months - along with an online campaign united under the hashtag #SaveHasdeo, a march on the state capital, and even a tree hugging sit-in - for the 21 coal blocks to finally be cancelled.\nNone of it has been easy. The 12-year battle, he admits, has taken a steely resolve on his part, and on the part of the forest communities.\n\"This is a fight in some sense between the people's lives and livelihoods and forests on the one hand, and the corporate profits on the other hand,\" he explains. \n\"Naturally any company whose profits and viability is at stake will try to do all kinds of steps to make sure that they get the land.\"\nAnd even now, there are still fights to be won - land which needs to be rejuvenated after being destroyed and trees which are still in danger.\nAlok hopes winning the Goldman prize, which recognises a handful of grassroots campaigners from around the world each year, will inspire other movements globally - and once again focus attention on the forest.  \n\"Any tree being cut in Hasdeo Aranya is wrong, and our effort will be to save every tree,\" he vows.",

    "The Northern Lights have made a rare appearance across the UK, delighting sky watchers up and down the country.\nExcited onlookers shared pictures of the lights, also known as aurora borealis, visible right across the country, including the south coast of England - and if you missed it you are likely to have a chance to see it again on Saturday night.\nThey could be seen after one of the strongest geomagnetic storms for years hit Earth, with the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issuing a rare solar storm warning.\nSuch storms increase people's chances of seeing the lights.\nThe extreme geomagnetic storm that happened on Friday was classed as the highest G5.\nStorms of this scale could potentially impact infrastructure, including satellites and the power grid, the NOAA warned. \nThe last big G5 storm caused a power outage in Sweden, but there have been no reports of disruption so far.\n\"The energy industry plans for a range of events far and wide - including into space,\u201d Ross Easton, a spokesperson for Energy Networks Association said, adding that space forecasts were being monitored carefully over the weekend.\nProf Carole Haswell, head of astronomy at the Open University, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a lot of satellites communicate using radio signals.\n\"All of these charged particles speeding around disrupt radio signals, particularly GPS which is used by planes.\"\nClear skies - like those on Friday evening - made sightings possible from almost everywhere in the UK.\nIn Thorngumbald, east Yorkshire, Sarah Sharp said seeing the lights was a \"dream come true\".\n\"It was truly spectacular, probably a once in a lifetime experience, it's certainly the first time I've seen them. We spent about an hour watching them move across the sky.\"\nAurora activity is expected again on Saturday and while the geomagnetic storm is still expected to be in the \"strong\" category, early indications are that it may not reach the extreme of Friday.\nWeather conditions are again expected to be ideal but it needs to be dark so you will need to wait until at least 22:30 BST.\n\nThe last time an extreme geomagnetic storm hit Earth was in 2003, so Friday's event was rare. We are much more used to seeing the Northern Lights limited to northern parts of the UK.\nThere have been more occasions in the last year or so where we\u2019ve had a weak showing of the aurora in southern parts of the UK.\nThis is because in its 11 year solar cycle, we are approaching the \u2018solar maximum\u2019 where there are naturally more sunspots on the Sun\u2019s surface.\nSunspots are like huge volcanos erupting charged particles in Coronal Mass Ejections (CME\u2019s).  With more of them at the moment, there\u2019s a greater chance of more frequent and strong auroral activity.\nIt is also worth pointing out that because we can forecast these events better and with most of us having a smart phone able to capture the bright lights of the aurora, there has been an increase in sightings over the last decade or two.\nHowever, as always, anywhere away from light pollution with a clear view of the night sky will give you the best chance of seeing them.\nIn the US, the NOAA said the lights could be seen as far south as Alabama and northern California.\nMany of Europe's northern countries were treated to the spectacle as well. \nCameras captured bright pink skies over Austria, and a purple wash over Germany, with watchers in Slovakia, Switzerland, Denmark and Poland among others who enjoyed the light show.\nThe lights were captured in China, too, with fuchsia skies photographed over the country's north.\n\nThe Northern Lights - or aurora borealis - appear as bright, swirling curtains of lights in the night sky and range in colour from green to pink and scarlet.\nIt is caused by charged particles from the sun hitting gases in the Earth's atmosphere.\nThe colours occur due to different gases in the Earth's atmosphere being energised by the charged particles. \nThe two most common gases in the Earth's atmosphere are nitrogen and oxygen. Oxygen atoms glow green - the colour most often seen in the Northern Lights, while nitrogen atoms emit purple, blue and pink.\nThe most impressive auroras occur when the Sun emits really large clouds of particles called \"coronal mass ejections\".",
    "Three decades ago, Chinese dissidents were being smuggled out of the country in a secret operation called Yellow Bird - but as one of them tells the BBC, Beijing is still pursuing them. \nJune 1992: It was the middle of the night on the South China Sea, and a Chinese patrol vessel was approaching a boat en route from the Communist mainland to the then-British colony of Hong Kong.\nAs border troops came on board to talk to the crew, their voices could be heard by a group of people packed into a secret compartment below deck.\nA few minutes earlier, when the patrol boat was spotted, these secret passengers had been given an urgent order.\n\u201cI was told to hide,\u201d one of them, Yan Xiong, recalls. \u201cDon\u2019t make any noise!\u201d\nMost of those hiding were economic migrants, hoping to find work in Hong Kong \u2013 but not Yan.\nHe was a political dissident, and if he was discovered, he would be in serious trouble.\nYan was being smuggled out of China as part of a secret operation code-named Yellow Bird.\nThe patrol eventually sailed away, and in the early hours Yan - who had never travelled in a boat before that night - arrived in Hong Kong.\nAfter a hearty breakfast, he was taken to a detention centre. This was, he was told, for his own safety. Walking the streets could be dangerous.\nShadow War: China and the West\n\nGordon Corera looks at the growing tensions between China and the West.\n\nListen now to the Radio 4 podcast on BBC Sounds\nBeing in detention was not new to Yan. He had already spent 19 months in a Chinese prison for his part in 1989\u2019s Tiananmen Square protests. Students had called for greater democracy and freedom, but the Communist Party sent in tanks to crush them.\nAt the end of June 1989, the Chinese government said that 200 civilians and several dozen security personnel had died. Other estimates have ranged from hundreds to many thousands.\nOn his release, Yan had made his way to southern China where, in scenes that could have been taken from a spy film, he was sent from one public phone booth to another, to be put in touch with the people who could get him out.\nHe was not the only dissident to undertake this risky journey.\nSpeaking to the BBC for a new series, Shadow War: China and the West, Chaohua Wang recalls her escape.\nDespite being number 14 on a list of the 21 most wanted people after the Tiananmen Square protests, she managed to evade capture, hiding in tiny rooms for months before heading south and becoming part of the Yellow Bird escape line.\n\u201cI was like a parcel moved from one [person] to another,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI didn't even know the name Yellow Bird for quite some years.\u201d \nYellow Bird may sound like a classic spy operation, and many believed that an intelligence service - MI6 or the CIA - had come up with the idea. But they had not.\nIn fact, it was a private enterprise undertaken by concerned groups of citizens in Hong Kong, motivated by a desire to help out those who were on the run. Among them were the local film and entertainment industry and (more usefully) organised crime, in the form of the triads.\n\u201cThey [the triads] had a lot of Chinese police in their pockets,\u201d says Nigel Inkster, who at that time was an intelligence officer based in Hong Kong. This was what enabled them to move people out of hiding in Beijing and smuggle them across the border.\nThe UK and US only became involved when those people who arrived in Hong Kong needed to work out where to go next.\nYan remembers being visited by what he described as an \u201cEnglish gentleman\u201d who never gave his name but helped him with the paperwork.\n\u201cIt is better for you to go to America, not England,\u201d the man told him. Within days Yan was in Los Angeles.\u202f Chaohua Wang also ended up in the US.\nWhy not England?\nFormer officials have told the BBC the UK was reluctant to take in Tiananmen protesters because it was desperate to avoid upsetting China in the run-up to the 1997 handover of Hong Kong.\nAn agreement had been signed by the UK in 1984, but the events of Tiananmen Square five years later raised difficult questions about Hong Kong\u2019s future.\nIn 1992, a few weeks after Yan\u2019s arrival in the colony, the former Conservative cabinet minister Chris Patten became the last governor of Hong Kong.\nHe says he was determined to embed greater democracy, in the hope it would endure after the handover, and he announced proposals for the democratic reform of Hong Kong's institutions, aimed at broadening the voting base in elections. \nThere was opposition to the reforms not just from China\u2019s leadership but also from those in London who did not want to antagonise Beijing.\n\u201cMy main responsibility was to try to give people in Hong Kong the best chance of continuing to live in freedom and prosperity, and to do so after 1997,\u201d the former governor, now Lord Patten, tells me. He says he also was aware of - but not involved in - Yellow Bird.\nThe reluctance to allow dissidents to come to the UK - and the anger in some quarters about Patten\u2019s reforms - speaks to a central question from th",
    "The UN General Assembly has enhanced Palestine's rights within the organisation and urged it be accepted as a member following heated debate.\nPalestine has had non-member observer state status since 2012, which allows some rights short of a full member.\nMembership can only be decided upon by the UN Security Council.\nFriday's vote can be seen as a gesture of support for the Palestinians by the full UN body, despite strident Israeli opposition.\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed the resolution, saying it supported Palestinian efforts for another vote on the issue by the Security Council.\n\"Palestine will continue its endeavour to obtain full membership in the UN,\" he said in a statement.\nIsrael's ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, said the body had welcomed a \"terror state\" into its ranks.\nAddressing the assembly Erdan shredded a copy of the UN Charter - accusing members of having metaphorically done just that by passing the resolution by 143 vote to 9. \n\"You are shredding the UN charter with your own hands,\" he said. \"Yes, yes, that's what you're doing. Shredding the UN charter. Shame on you.\"\nNations voting against the resolution were the US, Argentina, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Papua New Guinea. The UK was one of 25 nations to abstain.\nPalestinian envoy Riyad Mansour told the General Assembly before the vote that a \"yes\" vote was \"a vote for Palestinian existence, it is not against any state. It is an investment in peace\".\n\"We want peace, we want freedom,\" Mr Mansour told members.\nThe vote comes as several European countries reportedly plan to recognise a Palestinian state.\nEU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told Spanish broadcaster RTVE on Thursday that Spain would do so on 21 May. He has previously said Ireland, Slovenia and Malta would also take the step, without confirming the date.\nFriday's UN resolution confers additional rights on Palestine at the world body, allowing it to take part fully in debates, propose agenda items and have its representatives elected to committees.\nIt will still not, however, have the right to cast a vote - something the General Assembly does not have the power to grant and would have to be backed by the Security Council.\nThe issue of Palestinian statehood has vexed the international community for decades.\nIn 1988, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), the main representative of the Palestinians, first declared the establishment of the State of Palestine.\nAccording to the Reuters news agency, Palestinian statehood has been recognised by 139 out of 193 UN member states - although this is largely seen as symbolic.\nIn practice, the Palestinians have limited self-government through the Palestinian Authority (PA) in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The PA lost control of the Gaza Strip to Hamas in 2007. The UN considers both territories as occupied by Israel and comprising a single political entity.\nIsrael does not recognise Palestinian statehood and the current Israeli government opposes the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza. It argues such a state would be a threat to Israel's existence.\nThe US endorses the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel - the so-called two state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict - but says such a state should only come through direct negotiations between the two sides.\nLast month, the US used its veto as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council to block a widely backed Algerian resolution seeking Palestine's admittance as a state, calling it \"premature\". \nSecurity Council resolutions are legally binding, whereas General Assembly resolutions are not.",
    "A frog that has been cooked and eaten for decades on the Caribbean island of Dominica is on the verge of becoming extinct, but there is now a frantic push to try to save it.\nThe mountain chicken frog (Leptodactylus fallax) was once considered Dominica's unofficial national dish, according to locals.\n\"When I used to cook it, I would just cut it and put it into a broth,\" says Alain Mellow as he sits selling fruit and vegetables in Roseau, the bustling capital city of Dominica.\nIt tasted \"just like chicken\", according to Mr Mellow, who is now in his 70s, and believes the nutrients from the mountain chicken frog have contributed to his good health.\nAnother local name for the mountain chicken is \"crapaud\" (the French word for toad), a reminder of Dominica's past as a French colony.\nThere were different ways to cook the four-legged creature. Some preferred to include it in a stew, while others salivated over the golden-brown fried option.\nIn this country nicknamed \"the nature island\" because of a vast presence of varied flora and fauna, the frog's importance is highlighted by its presence on the national coat of arms.\nHowever, anyone visiting a restaurant on the Eastern Caribbean island now, or over the last two decades, may not have even heard of the mountain chicken frog as a delicacy.\nKenasher Valmond, who works at a caf\u00e9 near the sea port in Roseau, says she has never eaten mountain chicken.\n\"I've never seen it,\" says Ms Valmond, who is in her 20s. \"I just heard people speaking about it.\"\nAccording to experts, the main reason for the frog's disappearance from dining room tables and its decline in popularity among younger people is an infectious amphibian disease called chytridiomycosis.\n\"In a span of a year-and-a-half we lost almost 90% of the mountain chicken population in Dominica,\" Jeanelle Brisbane, a wildlife ecologist in Dominica, tells BBC News. \n\"It was one of the fastest amphibian declines on record in our history.\" That has led to the frog now being listed as critically endangered.\nOn a warm April night, BBC News journeyed into the forest with Ms Brisbane and her team from Dominica's forestry division and the non-governmental organisation Wild Dominique.\nWe set out to find one of the few surviving frogs in the wild, but were advised not to disclose the exact location to prevent poachers from targeting it.\nAs we made our way through the pitch dark area, Ms Brisbane alerted us to the distinct calling sound of a mountain chicken, prompting us to halt our trek and wait in silence, but we were unable to determine where the frog was located.\nAs we continued along a river bank - after a couple of false alarms, seeing other frog species - there, on the other side of the river, sat a mountain chicken frog, illuminated only by the light from our headlamps.\nThe frog is one of the largest in the world, and can grow up to 1kg (2.2lb) in weight according to the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), but it was no match for the deadly microscopic fungus.\nThe chytrid fungus began wreaking havoc in Dominica around 2002, according to researchers. \nThe frog is also battling for survival on another Caribbean island to the north.\n\"The disease got to Montserrat as well and completely wiped the species off the map,\" says Andrew Cunningham, the deputy director of science at the ZSL.\nProf Cunningham says that fortunately some of the frogs were put into captive breeding programmes in Montserrat before they disappeared completely.\nHe describes the disease as a massive problem, saying it has caused the probable extinction of over 90 species of amphibians globally.\nIn Dominica, before the fungus struck, harvesting the frog from the wild was a booming business, with studies finding up to 36,000 frogs being hunted each year, according to Ms Brisbane.\nAfter coming under attack by the chytrid fungus, the frog's population took a further hit by the passage of Tropical Storm Erika in 2015 and Hurricane Maria two years later.\n\"Our forests have essentially grown silent because of the absence of the mountain chicken voice, it was a huge part of our soundscape, of what put us to bed at night,\" Ms Brisbane says.\nSeveral partners, including ZSL and Dominica's forestry division, have come together as part of the Mountain Chicken Recovery Programme.\nDuring a population count conducted last year in parts of the island the frog was known to inhabit, only 21 frogs were found alive in the wild. \nResearchers at ZSL say that while the total number of mountain chicken frogs in Dominica's forest is probably higher than the 21 they located, it is unlikely to add up to more than 30.\n\"They were one of the apex predators on the island, so losing those has potential ripple effects in terms of pest control,\" says Benjamin Tapley, a Curator of Herpetology at ZSL.\nIn March, ZSL announced the appearance of six mountain chicken froglets at London Zoo, after two of the frogs that were brought from Montserrat successfully bred for the first time in five years.\nAno",
    "The Dutch artist Joost Klein has been disqualified from the Eurovision Song Contest after a backstage incident.\nAn allegation of intimidation was made to Swedish police by a female member of the production crew.\nThe Netherlands Songfestival said Klein had \"repeatedly indicated\" he did not want to be filmed and that he \"did not touch the camera woman\".\nMeanwhile, Ireland's entrant Bambie Thug missed their dress rehearsal, but hoped to be on stage for the show.\nOn their Instagram story, Bambie Thug explained that there had been a \"situation\" prior to the flag parade rehearsal \"which I felt needed urgent attention\" from the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).\nBambie Thug made no reference to Klein's exclusion and there is no suggestion the two incidents are related.\nSeparately, Norwegian media is reporting that their jury spokesman Allesandra Mele has pulled out, citing the \"inflamed situation\" in Malmo. She came fourth representing Norway last year with the song Queen of Kings.\nDutch broadcaster Avrotros called Klein's disqualification \"disproportionate\".\nIn a statement on social media, the company said it was \"shocked by the decision\" and would \"come back to this later\".\nThe contest organisers said \"it would not be appropriate\" for Klein to participate \"while the legal process takes place\".\nDutch broadcaster Avrotros, which sends acts to Eurovision, said: \"Against clearly made agreements, Joost was filmed when he had just gotten off stage and had to rush to the greenroom. At that moment, Joost repeatedly indicated that he did not want to be filmed. This wasn't respected.\n\"This led to a threatening movement from Joost towards the camera. Joost did not touch the camerawoman.\"\nThe statement said the body had \"consulted extensively\" with the EBU and \"proposed several solutions\" but the decision was still taken to disqualify Klein. \nKlein had been among the favourites to win this year's contest with his song, Europapa.\nA pro-Europe techno anthem, it was dedicated to his father, who he lost to cancer aged 12. \nNow 26, the singer had promised his father he would one day make it to the Eurovision stage.\nNews of his suspension emerged on Friday afternoon, during the first dress rehearsal for Saturday's televised grand final.\nKlein's props were being set up on stage inside the Malm\u00f6 Arena when a production manager indicated they should be removed.\nHis song was then skipped without explanation, and Israel's entrant Eden Golan, who was next in the running order, took his place.\nThe European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises the event, later issued a statement saying they were \"investigating an incident that was reported to us involving the Dutch artist\".\nOn Saturday, Swedish police confirmed that a man had been reported for making \"unlawful threats\" at Malm\u00f6 Arena, after Thursday's semi-final. \n\"The police have taken all essential investigative measures and questioned the suspect, plaintiff and witnesses,\" a spokesperson said. \n\"The investigation has been completed by the police... and the case will now go to the prosecutor within a few weeks.\"\nThe EBU subsequently confirmed Klein would not be taking part in Saturday's grand final.\n\"We maintain a zero-tolerance policy towards inappropriate behaviour at our event and are committed to providing a safe and secure working environment for all staff at the Contest,\" they said. \n\"In light of this, Joost Klein's behaviour towards a team member is deemed in breach of Contest rules.\"\nAlthough contestants have been disqualified from Eurovision in the past, none has ever lost their place this close to the final.\nMore commonly, songs are rejected at the selection stage. In 2021, the Belarusian entry was banned after refusing to change lyrics that the contest deemed to be political in nature; while in 2016, Romania was barred from participating due to outstanding debts owed to the EBU.\nSwedish and Dutch news outlets have said that the incident involved Klein and a member of the television production team.\nOrganisers stressed that \"contrary to some media reports and social media speculation, this incident did not involve any other performer or delegation member\".\nEarly reports suggested there had been antagonism between Klein and Israel's contestant, as feelings run high over the Israel-Gaza war.\nAt a Eurovision press conference on Thursday, Golan was asked whether she had \"ever thought that by being here you bring risk and danger for other participants and public?\"\nWhen the Israeli singer was told by the moderator that she did not have to answer the question, Klein chimed in: \"Why not?\"\nGolan replied: \"I think we're all here for one reason, and one reason only, and the EBU is taking all safety precautions to make this a safe and united place for everyone, and so I think it's safe for everyone and we wouldn't be here [if not].\"\nEarlier, when Klein was asked if his song could live up to the Eurovision slogan and unite people by music, he replied: \"I think that's a good question ",
    "Russian attacks in north-east Ukraine have prompted the evacuation of almost 1,800 people from the Kharkiv area, the regional head has said.\nHeavy fighting has continued in the border area following Russia's surprise incursions on Friday.\nKyiv has been expecting a Russian summer offensive for some time - including a possible attempt to capture Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city.\nBut Ukraine insists its forces are able to resist any attack. \nOn Saturday Russia said it had seized five villages near the town of Vovchansk in its latest offensive. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the claim.\nIt is still not clear how far the Russians will advance - whether this is a probing attack or the start of something bigger.\nUkrainian artillery guns are now firing back. The booms of exchanging fire echo loudly down the already bomb-damaged streets. \nA total of 1,775 people have been evacuated, Kharkiv regional head Oleh Syniehubov said on social media. Hundreds more remain in Vovchansk, just 6km (3.7 miles) from the Russian border.\nSerhii, a resident, told the BBC that his home and vehicles had been destroyed by a Russian glide bomb.\nHis wife had been rushed to hospital with more serious injuries. Small fires were still pouring smoke across the remnants of his home. \nSerhii said he did not want to leave because he was afraid of what might happen to their four goats.\nAs we surveyed the damage there was the screech of yet more glide bombs being released, followed by the heavy thud of the explosion.\nRussia's air force is having an increasingly deadly effect, and for now Ukraine has no answer.\nUkrainian officials say Russia had the capability to aggravate the situation in border areas but not to capture the city of Kharkiv itself.\nReports suggest Moscow is hoping to create a 10km (six-mile) buffer zone for its Belgorod region, after a series of Ukrainian cross-border attacks.\nIn his nightly address on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said fighting was continuing in seven border villages, Reuters reported.\n\"Our defensive operations continue in the Kharkiv region\", he said, adding the situation in Donetsk \"remains especially tense\".\nOn Friday, the US announced a new $400m (\u00a3319m; \u20ac371m) military aid package for Ukraine.\nIt will be Washington's third instalment of aid to the country after months of political deadlock - adding to the previous package worth a total of $7bn sent in late April.\nUS Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said the \"urgently needed\" aid would include air defence munitions, artillery rounds, anti-tank weapons and armoured vehicles.\nOn Friday, National Security Spokesman John Kirby told reporters that Russia would \"make further advances in the coming weeks to try and establish a buffer zone along the Ukrainian border\".\nMoscow has been looking to capitalise on the delayed arrival of US weaponry by continuing to push forwards in the eastern Donetsk region.\nThe return of heavy fighting in the north-east further illustrates Russia's growing ambitions.",
    "Thousands of Canadians have been ordered to leave their homes in Fort Nelson, British Columbia due to the threat of a wildfire. \nThe blaze began on Friday night and was described by officials as \"exhibiting extreme fire behaviour\".\nWildfires have also led to evacuation alerts and orders in the neighbouring province of Alberta. \nThe Canadian government has warned this year's weather conditions would mean a greater wildfire risk in the country.\nThe Parker Lake fire, as it's been called by the British Columbia Wildfire Service (BCWS), was 8sq km (3 sq miles) in size as of Saturday morning after growing rapidly overnight. \nSome 3,000 people in Fort Nelson - located in northeast BC about 1,600km (1,000 miles) from Vancouver - were ordered to evacuate.\nRob Fraser, mayor of the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality, told CBC News the fire began after high winds knocked a tree over and it crashed onto a power line and caught fire.  \n\"And then by the time our firefighters were able to get down there, the wind had whipped this up into a fire that they weren't able to handle with the apparatus that we had,\" Mr Fraser said.\nStrong winds and dry conditions are making the fire more difficult to fight, according to the BCWS.\nAs of Saturday, the fire was being fought by nine helicopters, as well as ground crews and a structure protection specialist, whose job it is to protect structures affected by wildfires. \nIn Alberta, people in the Grande Prairie region are under evacuation alerts and some have been asked to leave due to a blaze burning 4km east of the hamlet of TeePee Creek in the province's northwest. \nResidents of Fort McMurray, a town of about 68,000 people, have also been told to be ready to leave as an out-of-control blaze burns some 25km southwest of the city.\nIn parts of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan, Environment Canada issued Saturday air quality alerts due to wildfire smoke. \nLast year was a devastating year for Canadian wildfires, with 15 million hectares (37 million acres) of forest burned - the most destructive season in the country's history. \nEight firefighters died and some 230,000 people were displaced from their homes.\nAn update by Environment Canada this week predicted challenging weather conditions that could lead to another difficult wildfire season ahead. \nHigher temperatures in the spring and summer could \"exacerbate the risk and intensity of both natural and human-caused wildfires\", officials said.  \nA warmer-than-normal winter that left little snow on the ground also compounded droughts in several regions.\nGlobally, last year was the hottest on record. It was driven by human-caused warming, but also boosted by a natural weather system called El Ni\u00f1o.\nFires happen naturally in many parts of the world, including in Canada. \nBut climate change is making the weather conditions needed for wildfires to spread more likely, according to the UN's climate body.\nExtreme and long-lasting heat draws more and more moisture out of the ground and vegetation.",
    "If you woke up on Saturday morning well rested but filled with regret over missing the Northern Lights - don't worry. They're set to return tonight.\nOn Friday night, the lights dazzled the country, and the internet was awash with photos of bright pinks, purples and greens splashed across the night sky.\nHere is everything you need to know about how to catch them on Saturday night.\nJust as on Friday night, the Northern Lights are set to light up the skies all across the UK.\nThat means you have a chance to see it no matter where you are, as long as the skies are clear (which is looking likely).\nOn Friday, we saw pictures from Inverness to Kent, and Omagh to Anglesey to Norwich, so it truly is a nationwide spectacle.\nOrdinarily, somewhere away from light pollution with a clear view of the night sky has the best opportunity to see the lights, but based on Friday night, that didn't matter.\nFor Saturday night, the Met Office says there's a good chance of sightings across Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of northern England and Wales in particular. \nAurora activity is expected again across the UK and while the geomagnetic storm is still expected to be in the 'strong' category, early indications are that it may not reach the 'extreme' of last night with activity declining.\nWeather conditions are ideal with clear skies but it needs to be dark, so you'll need to wait until at least 22:30 BST.\nAt this time of year, when nights are shorter, 23:30 into the early hours of the morning is when the night is darkest.\nThe activity of the lights itself is more unpredictable, the Met Office says, so expect it to ebb and flow with different colours in different places at different times.\nCoincidentally, if you are tuning into Eurovision tonight, the winner is due to be crowned just before the best time to see the lights (even better if the contest runs over time, as it often does, and you peek outside later in the night).\nOn Friday night, our BBC Weather Watchers captured the magic with more than 3,000 photographs sent into us between 21:00 and 1:00 on Saturday morning. \nGiven the lights are not expected to be as bright as they were on Friday, you may need to employ some camera tricks to get the most out of your photo if you are heading out on Saturday night.\nAmateur photographer Anne Wilkie was among those who captured the lights on her iPhone on Friday night.\nHer tips for getting the best photo include:\n\"I found that the camera is very sensitive and picks up the colours so much more than the naked eye, so, if you think you see light in the sky, point the camera in the direction and the pinks, greens and purples should show on the screen, if you're lucky,\" Ms Wilkie said.\nAll phone users will want to play with the exposure to capture the best of the lights \u2013 most phones will bring up this option by tapping the screen when in the camera app.\nSome more recent phone models may have even more advanced camera settings, which allow for shutter speed and the length of exposure to be adjusted. \nSetting a long exposure time can capture the dance of the lights, but you will have to keep the phone still to avoid blurring.\nThe Northern Lights are caused by atoms with electric charges, called charged particles. \nThe lights appear when these charged particles are shot out from the sun and hit gases in the Earth's atmosphere.\nIn this instance, the Sun is experiencing an extreme geomagnetic storm, which is sending out solar winds with those particles into the solar system.\nWe see different colours in the sky when the various gases in the Earth's atmosphere are energised by the charged particles.\nThe two most common gases in the Earth's atmosphere are oxygen and nitrogen. Oxygen atoms glow green - the colour most often seen in the Northern Lights, while nitrogen atoms emit purple, blue and pink.\nThe last time we had an extreme geomagnetic storm hit Earth was in 2003, so Friday's event was rare. We are much more used to seeing the Northern Lights limited to northern parts of the UK.\nThere have been more occasions in the last year or so where we have seen a weak showing of the aurora in southern parts of the UK.\nThis is because in the Sun's 11 year solar cycle, we are approaching the 'solar maximum', where there are naturally more sunspots on the Sun's surface. \nSunspots are like huge volcanos erupting charged particles in Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs).  With more of them at the moment, there is a greater chance of more frequent and strong auroral activity.\nIt is also worth pointing out that because we can forecast these events better and with most of us having a smart phone able to capture the bright lights of the aurora, there has been an increase in sightings over the last decade or two.",

    "The Eurovision Song Contest has seen a chaotic build-up towards Saturday's grand final.\nThe Dutch entry has been disqualified, another has withdrawn from rehearsals and a third has broken rules with an on-stage speech, calling for peace.\nAnd two former contestants have pulled out of announcing the jury scores for their countries. \nThe drama is unfolding minute by minute against a backdrop of protests over Israel's participation in the show.\nAhead of the show, thousands of pro-Palestinian marchers gathered in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, where the contest is being held.\nSome chanted \"Eurovision, united by genocide,\" reflecting the strength of feeling over the humanitarian toll of Israel's military campaign in Gaza, which was triggered by the deadly Hamas attacks last October. \nEurovision, which has always billed itself as non-political, has resisted calls for Israel to be excluded from the contest. \nHowever, they did demand that the country's performer, Eden Golan, change the lyrics of her entry, titled Hurricane, to remove references to the 7 October attack. \nGolan, who is just 20 years old, is under armed guard as she prepares to sing at the contest, with heightened security throughout the host city.\nSeveral other competitors have stressed their opposition to the Israel-Gaza war, although none have pulled out - choosing to abide by Eurovision's slogan, \"united by music\".\nHowever, French contestant Slimane broke with protocol during the final dress rehearsal on Saturday afternoon, by interrupting his song to make an impassioned speech.\n\"Everybody, I just need to say something,\" he told the audience. \"Every artist here want[s] to sing about love and sing about peace. We need to be united by music, yes, but with love for peace. \n\"United by music, yes, but with love for peace,\" he repeated. \"Thank you so much. Thank you Europe.\"\nThe statement itself may have broken Eurovision's rules on making political statements. \nThe BBC has contacted the EBU, which organises the contest, to ascertain whether Slimane could be sanctioned. \nEarlier, the Irish contestant Bambie Thug withdrew entirely from the dress rehearsal, after raising a complaint about coverage of their performance on Israeli television. \nThe singer, who is non-binary, said comments made during coverage of their performance at Tuesday's semi-final breached the competition's rules. \nIsraeli TV station KAN referred to a \"controversy\" over Bambie Thug's song, whose lyrics reference witchcraft and the occult, then noted that the performer had \"spoken negatively about Israel\".\n\"But we can talk about that later,\" their commentator said. \"Prepare your curses.\"\nThe comment may have been a reference to a lyric in Bambie Thug's song, where they put a hex on an ex-boyfriend, but the singer felt it had crossed a line.\n\"I'm angry with other teams breaching their rules of the EBU, and still being allowed in,\" they told RT\u00c9 news in Ireland.\n\"I hope the EBU will address it correctly.\"\nIn a statement, the EBU said: \"We've spoken to KAN, the Israeli broadcaster, about this matter and reiterated the importance of all commentators respecting all the artists taking part in the competition and abiding by the rules and regulations of the event.\"\nIn a statement on Instagram, Bambie Thug said they were waiting \"patiently waiting to hear what action is set to be taken by the EBU following this rule break\" and that they \"hope to see you on the stage tonight\".\nIn response, a spokesperson for Israeli broadcaster Kan told the PA: \"We wish everyone the best of luck tonight.\"\nThe organisers of Eurovision said that the singer \"missed the dress rehearsal due to a situation that is currently being discussed with the EBU and song contest organisers\" and that they \"hope that this will be resolved shortly and Bambie Thug will appear in the Grand Final show as planned\". \nSeparately, the Dutch contestant, Joost Klein, has been removed from the competition after a backstage incident on Thursday.\nAn allegation of intimidation was made to Swedish police by a female member of the production crew. \nPolice said Klein had subsequently been interviewed for making \"unlawful threats\" and the case would \"go to the prosecutor within a few weeks\".\nEurovision organisers said \"it would not be appropriate for him to continue in the contest\" while the legal process takes place.\nIn a statement, the Dutch broadcaster Avrotros, said that Klein had been filmed backstage when he had \"repeatedly indicated\" that he did not want to be.\n\"This led to a threatening movement from Joost towards the camera. Joost did not touch the camerawoman,\" they added, calling the decision to disqualify him \"very heavy and disproportionate\".\nVideos have circulated on social media of Klein being surreptitiously filmed by the Israeli delegation - but the EBU stressed in their statement that the backstage incident  \"did not involve any other performer or delegation member\".\nNorwegian media is reporting that their jury spokesperson Allesandra Mele has pul",

For Eurovision fans, it seemed too good to be true.\nA likeable, chart-topping pop star, known around the world, with a track record of putting on elaborate performances and a lifelong love for Eurovision? \nHe couldn\u2019t have been a better fit.\n\"Having a bona fide pop star representing the UK this year is a great start,\u201d agreed Graham Norton in an interview earlier this week.\n\u201cOlly has already done all the things that it\u2019s impossible to prepare someone for - he has played to huge crowds, he can relate to the cameras, and he is used to high pressure situations.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great performer, and a great singer,\u201d agreed Neil Tennant, who duetted with Alexander on the 2020 Pet Shop Boys\u2019 song Dreamland.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great he\u2019s got the courage to do it because it\u2019s so high stakes, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nThe stakes got him in the end.\nIn Malm\u00f6 on Saturday, Alexander\u2019s song, Dizzy, stumbled into 18th place, out of 25.\nAll of his 46 points came from the jury. His score in the public televote was zero.\nEven so, it wasn\u2019t the worst result. The UK has had more embarrassing defeats. And Alexander has a career to go back to - unlike previous performers, whose musical ambitions have come to a screeching halt after Eurovision.\nBut the expectations were so high that this year's result feels particularly rough. \nIt's now 27 years since the UK last won the contest. \nSo what went wrong\u2026 and how can the country improve its chances?\nLook, Dizzy is a great radio track.\nCo-written by Danny L Harle (Charli XCX,  Dua Lipa) it pulses and throbs in all the right places. Musical nods to the Pet Shop Boys and London's church bells remind listeners of the UK's place at the epicenter of pop. \nAnd compositionally, it pulls a clever trick. The  constant chordal movement of the chorus prompts a feeling of dizziness. When Alexander sings that his lover \u201cpulls me back to the beginning\u201d, the chords resolve to the opening key of C minor.\nThat\u2019s why juries liked it. Songwriters in Sweden, another pop powerhouse, awarded Dizzy eight points out of a possible 12.\nBut audiences don\u2019t know or care about the nuts and bolts of songwriting. They sided with critics like the Guardian\u2019s Laura Snapes, who dismissed the song as \u201cperfectly fine\u201d or the Telegraph\u2019s Neil McCormick, who called it \u201cpleasantly unexceptional\u201d.\nDizzy wasn\u2019t a bad song. It just wasn\u2019t good enough to make people pick up the phone and vote.\nI'd like to think not. \nAfter years of sending untested, milquetoast reality show contestants to Eurovision, Alexander delivered a spectacular TV performance.\nWith computer-controlled cameras, synchronised to pin-sharp choreography, the star made it seem like he and his dancers were being flung around the interior of a spaceship plummeting through a black hole.\nFrom his commentary box, Graham Norton described the production as \u201cterrific\u201d but admitted it could suffer because it was \u201cso different to everything else in the contest tonight\u201d.\nThe performance drew a lukewarm reception inside the arena, as the complex staging meant Alexander was out of sight for the first two minutes.\nAnd at home, some viewers said they were put off by the sexual nature of the dancing.\nOthers said the physical demands affected Alexander\u2019s vocals. There were certainly a few wobbles - a bad look next to the powerhouse singers of France and Portugal and Switzerland.\nBut there were positive comments, too. \u201cOlly Alexander did an amazing job,\u201d tweeted journalist Emilia Kettle from inside the arena.\n\"Best performance of the night so far,\u201d added Craig Brown. \u201cMaybe not the best song. But the best live act.\"\nThat\u2019s a big step up. Eurovision performances have become increasingly elaborate and the UK needed to catch up. From here, things can only get better.\nI don\u2019t know what inspired Dizzy. It seems like an earnest and heartfelt declaration of love, but is that enough?\nListen to the acts who came in the top five, and you'll hear something -",
    "Rappers have been trading insults since the dawn of hip-hop. \nIt's part of the culture. A test of lyrical skill and a declaration of superiority that has produced hundreds of classic \"diss tracks\", from 2Pac's Hit 'Em Up to Jay-Z's Takeover.\nThe latest beef originally erupted between three of hip-hop's biggest stars - Drake, Kendrick Lamar and J Cole - all triggered by a seemingly innocuous lyric praising their respective careers.\nAs tensions grew, Cole dropped out of the fight. However, Drake and Kendrick continue to battle with increasing ferocity - levelling life-changing accusations against each other in a flurry of tracks.\nHere's a guide to the battle's history, its fire starters, flashpoints and future.\nDrake (above left) - the Canadian actor-turned-musician whose vulnerable blend of rap and R&B has made him the most commercially successful hip-hop artist of the 21st Century. Among his multi-platinum hits are tracks like Hotline Bling, One Dance and Hold On We're Going Home.\nKendrick Lamar (centre) - A Compton-born rapper whose compelling rhymes and conceptual vision have seen him named the best rapper of his generation. One of the most inventive lyricists in the game, he tackles big topics like police brutality, black self-worth and his own internal conflicts. In 2018, he became the first hip-hop artist to win the Pulitzer Prize for music.\nJ Cole (right) - Born in Germany and raised in North Carolina, J Cole was mentored by Jay-Z and went on to score hits with songs like Middle Child and Deja Vu. But he grew disenchanted with the trappings of commercial success and began to forge his own path with more introspective, analytical songs, resulting in some of the most popular and successful music of his career.\nWhen Kendrick Lamar was a young up-and-comer, Drake offered him a helping hand by inviting him onto his Take Care album, and giving him an opening spot on his 2012 Club Paradise Tour.\nBut in 2013, after the success of Lamar's debut record Good Kid, m.A.A.d City, he made his ambitions clear. \nDuring a guest verse on Big Sean's Control, he called out Drake, J Cole, Meek Mill, Mac Miller, Pusha T and a host of other rappers, warning them: \"I got love for you all, but I'm trying to murder you.\"\nAsked about the diss, Drake told Billboard Magazine: \"I didn't really have anything to say about it. It just sounded like an ambitious thought to me. That's all it was. \n\"I know good and well that [Lamar]'s not murdering me, at all, in any platform. So when that day presents itself, I guess we can revisit the topic.\"\nThe rappers traded a few jibes over the next few years (Lamar memorably boasted that he'd \"tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes\" during the BET hip-hop awards) but it never seemed particularly serious. \nThe initial spark was a gesture towards unity, rather than division.\nIn October last year, Drake released his eighth album For All The Dogs, which featured a collaboration with J Cole called First Person Shooter.\nIn one verse, Cole suggested that he, Drake and Kendrick were the \"big three\" of the current era of hip-hop.\n\"Love when they argue the hardest MC / Is it K. Dot [Kendrick]? Is it Aubrey [Drake]? Or me? / We the big three, like we started a league.\"\nThe song debuted at the top of the US singles chart, becoming Drake's 13th and Cole's first number-one song. \nThe achievement meant Drake tied with Michael Jackson for the most number one singles by a male solo artist. \nA week later, Taylor Swift's Cruel Summer replaced them at number one, and the moment seemed to have passed. But privately, Kendrick had taken note - and he wasn't happy.\nIn March 2024, producer Metro Boomin' and rapper Future released a collaborative album called We Don't Trust You.\nHidden in the tracklisting was a song called Like That with an uncredited verse by Kendrick Lamar... and it was explosive.\nWith a tightly-wound, expletive-laden delivery, he took aim at Cole's verse, claiming there was no \"big three - it's just big me\".\nHe went on to call Drake and Cole's best verses insubstantial - \"a light pack\" - and declared he was the Prince to Drake's Michael Jackson.\nThe power of the verse can't really be conveyed in print, but when it ends with Lamar promising to put all of Drake and J Cole's \"dogs\" in the \"pet sematary\" - the name of a Stephen King 1983 horror novel - you know a fuse has been lit.\n(NB: Lamar doesn't mean literal pet dogs, but the rappers' nearest and dearest. The lyric doubles up as a reference to Drake's album title, For All The Dogs)\nIt's worth noting that the placement of Lamar's verse is also significant, as Metro Boomin' is a former Drake collaborator who fell out with the Canadian star.\nMetro, whose real name is Leland Wayne (more on him later), produced the majority of Drake's 2015 album What A Time To Be Alive, but a promised sequel never materialised, allegedly leading to bad blood between the pair.\nIn 2022, the producer removed Drake from a song called Trance, and unfollowed him on I",
    "Keir Starmer's success was sketched across the map of England at the local elections last week. \nThe Labour leadership is bouncing from nabbing another of the Tories' MPs, Natalie Elphicke - and polling since the council results puts him further ahead than ever.\nWhat could possibly go wrong for him? \nA lot, actually. The general election is still months away and there are plenty of potential pitfalls between Starmer and the shiny black door of No 10. \nFirst, conversations across the Labour Party suggest the danger of taking victory for granted - being complacent - is the number one risk. \nA shadow minister warns: \"People sometimes act as if it's already happened\u2026 not realising the scale of effort required to do that.\" \nA source tells me holiday was cancelled at Labour HQ in December, until July, with all staff expected to be on standby for a general election. There's no taking it easy now: a similar edict is in place from September to December.\n\"We have to keep our discipline and keep on our message,\" says another insider. \nThat discipline is important in avoiding the kind of public sparring between colleagues that was all too common in the bruising Corbyn era, and which the public doesn't like. It's important in avoiding stray comments that would give opponents ammo to attack - just look at how the Conservatives played with Labour's wavering over its now retired vow to spend \u00a328bn a year on the economy going green.\nBut it's also important because if a Labour victory is hammered into people's expectations, that could affect how the election campaign is fought. \n\"If everyone thinks we are getting a thumping great majority, you end up with the campaign being a referendum on Labour,\" one source says. Instead, \"we want it to be about the threat of five more years of the Tories\".\nSign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.\nAnother senior figure tells me: \"What you hear is that people think they are voting Labour because they don't want the Tories - rather than enthusiastically voting for us.\" \nThe party would love there to be more excitement about them. But some insiders want the focus to stay on the Conservatives, who are struggling, and a choice between the two big parties.\nWith that in mind, Labour was only too happy for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to claim that the local election results suggested the country was on course for a hung parliament. They were pleased for the public to be reminded that a Labour victory is not a foregone conclusion.\nSecond, while the Tories have been stuck in the doldrums in the polls for months, Labour cannot predict or control much of what happens before the election. \nOn 6 October last year, the world didn't know what was about to happen in Israel. \nThe shocking events of 7 October and the intense conflict since then has unsettled many in the Labour Party. The local elections confirmed the leadership's attitude to war in Gaza affected votes in some areas, and unhappiness over foreign policy feels something of a proxy for general grumpiness on the left. \nThere is just no telling what other events could provoke further disagreement, or what unexpected events could shift the polls. \nThe better economic news of the last few days also helps the Conservatives to make their planned argument - that the country has turned a corner, and that Labour would put that at risk. And of course the Conservatives are looking for any Labour vulnerabilities to push.\nTory sources point to Labour's position on immigration, cancelling the government's Rwanda plan. They'll likely put pressure on Labour over the enhanced relationship it wants with the EU. Then there's Labour's plan for extra rights in the workplace, what Conservatives have dubbed \"French-style union laws\" - another pressure point.\nThere is no question that Keir Starmer's Labour Party is a very different beast to Jeremy Corbyn's tribe as they went into the last general election. But how able are they to shrug off Conservative attacks? \n\"We can rattle them quite easily,\" a Conservative source suggests, pointing to pressure they believe led to Labour ditching its \u00a328bn commitment. \nA Labour figure says Starmer's team needs to avoid \"being distracted by the madness\". Sometimes, \"they know it's a trap, but they feel they have no option but walk into it anyway\". \nPolitics is about how able you are to defend yourself, as well as how sharply you can attack. \nLast, Keir Starmer faces a classic political conundrum. \nTo win, it helps if you look like a winner - but overstretch yourself, and it could all go wrong. \nNot every eager young staffer in Labour these days was born when, in 1992, Neil Kinnock's Sheffield rally showed him prematurely triumphant, with all the crashing disappointment that followed. But the memory is present in plenty of Labour minds (Kinnock, incidentally, warned on BBC Radio 4's The Week in Westminster that voters are not full",
    "Hundreds of people are feared dead after flash flooding hit northern Afghanistan, with warnings the toll could rise after further storms across the region.\nTaliban officials say at least 150 have been killed, while the World Food Programme says more than 300 have died, after heavy rainfall hit five districts in Baghlan province on Friday night. \nPictures on social media showed torrents of water sweeping through houses in several villages, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.\nThe country has been hit by unusually heavy rainfall over the last few weeks, with floods killing scores of people since mid-April. \nAbdul Mateen Qani, a spokesman for Afghanistan's interior ministry, told the BBC that at least 131 people had died in Baghlan province and 20 in Takhar.\nMeanwhile, Rana Deraz, from the UN's World Food Programme, told the AFP news agency there had been 311 deaths in Baghlan.\nMs Deraz said 2,011 houses had been destroyed and an additional 2,800 damaged.\nThree mosques, and four schools were also affected.\nMany of those who had died came from the province's Borka district where more than 200 people had been trapped inside their homes. \nThere are also reports of severe damage in the provinces of Badakhshan, Ghor and western Herat.\nLocal official Hedayatullah Hamdard told AFP news agency emergency personnel including the army were \"searching for any possible victims under the mud and rubble\".\nTents, blankets and food were provided to some families who had lost their homes, the official added.\nThe main road connecting Kabul to northern Afghanistan is closed. \nIt comes after flooding last month in the west of the country killed dozens of people, leaving thousands requiring humanitarian aid. \nFlash flooding happens when rain falls so heavily that normal drainage cannot cope.\nExperts say a relatively dry winter has made it more difficult for the soil to absorb rainfall. Vast areas of farmland have also been submerged.\nTorrential rain and flooding kill people every year in Afghanistan, where badly built houses in isolated rural areas are particularly vulnerable.\nAfghanistan is among the globe's most at risk nations from the effects of climate change, according to experts. \nThe nation is one of the poorest in the world, having been ravaged by decades of war which culminated in the withdrawal of a US-led coalition and the Taliban retaking control in 2021.\nMany factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely.\nThe world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.",
    "Protest groups such as Just Stop Oil and Palestine Action could be banned in a similar way to terrorist organisations, under a proposal from the government\u2019s adviser on political violence.\nAn upcoming report from Lord Walney, which BBC News has seen extracts of, will recommend a new category for proscribing \"extreme protest groups\".\nIt defines these as those which routinely use criminal tactics to try to achieve their aims. \nThe sanctions could restrict a group's ability to fundraise and its right to assembly in the UK.\nThe Home Office said ministers would consider the recommendations.\n\"Militant groups like Palestine Action and Just Stop Oil are using criminal tactics to create mayhem and hold the public and workers to ransom without fear of consequence,\" Lord Walney said.\n\"Banning terror groups has made it harder for their activists to plan crimes - that approach should be extended to extreme protest groups too.\"\nJust Stop Oil said the government were the \u201cdangerous radicals that are endangering all of us\u201d through their climate policies.\nPalestine Action claimed its actions were in line with most of the British public who want an arms embargo between the UK and Israel, and the proposals would not deter their campaign.\nThe new restriction orders \"would be distinct from proscription on terrorism grounds\", the report will say.\nBut the mechanism could limit the activities of organisations that have a policy of using criminal offences or causing serious disruption to influence government or public debate.\nIf a group\u2019s actions were persistent, and used to promote a political or ideological cause, that would count against them, according to the recommendation.\nIt will come as part of a review into tackling political violence by Lord Walney - the former Labour MP John Woodcock - which was commissioned three years ago, but is yet to be published.\nA government source said ministers shared Lord Walney\u2019s objectives and would consider implementing his recommendations once the review was published.\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cExtremism of any kind has no place in our society and we will not tolerate tactics that set out to intimidate, threaten or cause disruption to the law-abiding majority. \n\"In recent months, we have also witnessed a small number of protesters display violent and hateful behaviour, and the police have our full support in tackling extremism and hate crime.\n\u201cWe are considering the report's recommendations extremely carefully and will respond in due course.\u201d",
    "President Joe Biden upended part of one of the world\u2019s most significant strategic relationships this week.\nIt happened in a TV interview, when Mr Biden was asked what would happen if Israel went ahead with a planned invasion of Rafah. \u201cI\u2019m not supplying the weapons,\u201d he replied.\nArms shipments are the bedrock of the US-Israel alliance. For the first time in four decades, a crack appeared.\nMr Biden has been under sustained pressure at home and abroad to help prevent further major civilian casualties and a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\nHe finally crossed the threshold of withholding arms shipments to Israel, American\u2019s closest strategic ally in the region - a move not seen since President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.\nSince the start of the war, Mr Biden has been caught in a political divide between an unquestioningly pro-Israel Republican party, and his own deeply divided Democratic Party, says Aaron David Miller, a former State Department analyst and veteran Middle East peace negotiator.\nUntil now, the president has appeared reluctant to do anything seen to damage the US-Israel relationship, Mr Miller says.\nWhat changed was Mr Biden\u2019s view that the Israelis were close to a decision to invade Rafah.\nOn Monday, Israel said its ground forces were starting \"targeted activity\" in the east of the city, with Israeli tanks said to be massed close to built-up areas. Residents reported the constant sound of shelling and said barely functioning hospitals were overwhelmed with the wounded.\nThe UN says more than 100,000 people have fled the fighting, and are facing dire shortages of shelter, food, water and sanitation services.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly vowed to launch a full ground invasion of the city, home to more than a million displaced Palestinians. He says a major operation is required to destroy four remaining Hamas battalions hiding there, and will be carried out regardless of whether any ceasefire talks succeed.\nWashington has repeatedly urged him not to, pressing for a more \u201ctargeted operation\u201d in Rafah against Hamas. Mr Miller says the president fears a Rafah invasion \u201cwould fundamentally undermine any chance of de-escalating the war and freeing hostages\u201d.\nThe former official, who spent years advising administrations in which Mr Biden served, says the president also wants to avoid a crisis with neighbouring Egypt. There is also the risk that an invasion would spark more angst and divisions in the Democratic Party, he says.\n\u201cSo he sent a signal,\u201d says Mr Miller.\nIn the run up to Mr Biden\u2019s TV interview on Wednesday, the US put a \u201cpause\u201d on an arms shipment to Israel - just one consignment of 2,000-pound and 500-pound bombs.\nA senior administration official told me there was particular concern on the \u201cend use\u201d of the high payload weapons and the impact they could have in dense urban settings, \u201cas we have seen in other parts of Gaza\u201d.\nThe 2,000 pound bombs are among the most destructive munitions in Israel\u2019s arsenal. Its military argues such munitions are necessary to eliminate Hamas. Also under review were shipments of Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) kits which convert unguided bombs into guided ones, the US official said.\nOn Friday, the state department issued a report ordered by Mr Biden earlier this year, which said Israel may have used American-supplied weapons in breach of international humanitarian law in some instances during the war in Gaza.\nBut the report said that it did not have \"complete information\" in its assessment, meaning military aid could continue.\nColonel Joe Buccino, a former US army artilleryman who rose to become a senior official at Centcom, the US military command in the Middle East, points out that the Israeli military could \u201clevel\u201d Rafah with the munitions it already has.\nWashington supplies Israel with $3.8bn of military assistance a year. Congress recently added to that a further $17bn worth of weapons and defence systems - Israel is cumulatively the world\u2019s largest ever recipient of US lethal aid.\nCol Buccino says the paused shipment is \u201csomewhat inconsequential\u201d to any assault assault on Rafah.\n\u201cIt's like a little bit of a political play for people in the United States who are\u2026 concerned about this,\u201d he says.\nWhether that is the case or not, it has not blunted the political fallout from Mr Biden\u2019s move. In the halls of the US Senate, Republicans were seething.\n\u201cI think that pause is absolutely outrageous,\u201d said US Senator Pete Ricketts, speaking to me outside a meeting of the Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cThe president really has no business doing this.\u201d\nWhen I put it to him that Israel still has the means to carry out its stated planned assault, he replied: \u201cThis is about supporting our ally Israel against a terrorist organisation.\u201d\nAnother Republican Senator, John Barrasso, said that Israel had a right to \u201cdo what they want to do to protect their sovereignty\u201d. For him Mr Biden\u2019s move demonstrated one thing: \u201cA weakness of this president.\u201d\nBut ",
    "The UN General Assembly has enhanced Palestine's rights within the organisation and urged it be accepted as a member following heated debate.\nPalestine has had non-member observer state status since 2012, which allows some rights short of a full member.\nMembership can only be decided upon by the UN Security Council.\nFriday's vote can be seen as a gesture of support for the Palestinians by the full UN body, despite strident Israeli opposition.\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed the resolution, saying it supported Palestinian efforts for another vote on the issue by the Security Council.\n\"Palestine will continue its endeavour to obtain full membership in the UN,\" he said in a statement.\nIsrael's ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, said the body had welcomed a \"terror state\" into its ranks.\nAddressing the assembly Erdan shredded a copy of the UN Charter - accusing members of having metaphorically done just that by passing the resolution by 143 vote to 9. \n\"You are shredding the UN charter with your own hands,\" he said. \"Yes, yes, that's what you're doing. Shredding the UN charter. Shame on you.\"\nNations voting against the resolution were the US, Argentina, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Papua New Guinea. The UK was one of 25 nations to abstain.\nPalestinian envoy Riyad Mansour told the General Assembly before the vote that a \"yes\" vote was \"a vote for Palestinian existence, it is not against any state. It is an investment in peace\".\n\"We want peace, we want freedom,\" Mr Mansour told members.\nThe vote comes as several European countries reportedly plan to recognise a Palestinian state.\nEU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told Spanish broadcaster RTVE on Thursday that Spain would do so on 21 May. He has previously said Ireland, Slovenia and Malta would also take the step, without confirming the date.\nFriday's UN resolution confers additional rights on Palestine at the world body, allowing it to take part fully in debates, propose agenda items and have its representatives elected to committees.\nIt will still not, however, have the right to cast a vote - something the General Assembly does not have the power to grant and would have to be backed by the Security Council.\nThe issue of Palestinian statehood has vexed the international community for decades.\nIn 1988, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), the main representative of the Palestinians, first declared the establishment of the State of Palestine.\nAccording to the Reuters news agency, Palestinian statehood has been recognised by 139 out of 193 UN member states - although this is largely seen as symbolic.\nIn practice, the Palestinians have limited self-government through the Palestinian Authority (PA) in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The PA lost control of the Gaza Strip to Hamas in 2007. The UN considers both territories as occupied by Israel and comprising a single political entity.\nIsrael does not recognise Palestinian statehood and the current Israeli government opposes the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza. It argues such a state would be a threat to Israel's existence.\nThe US endorses the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel - the so-called two state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict - but says such a state should only come through direct negotiations between the two sides.\nLast month, the US used its veto as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council to block a widely backed Algerian resolution seeking Palestine's admittance as a state, calling it \"premature\". \nSecurity Council resolutions are legally binding, whereas General Assembly resolutions are not.",
    "OK, it's time to confess - I have subscribed to Elon Musk's social network X (formerly Twitter).\n\"Why are you giving money to the world's richest man?\" shouted my friend.\nAdmittedly, she had a point, but I did it for two reasons. Firstly, because I was aware of a few fake profiles of me floating around, and subscribing offers verification of sorts.\nAnd secondly, because I wanted access to X's AI chatbot, Grok, and this was the simplest way to get it. I paid for it myself - it wasn't a BBC expense.\nThe reputation of subscribers is so mixed on X that there is an option to hide the \"blue tick\" that appears by your name once you subscribe.\nThere's a profound sense of distaste among some established users about \"buying your way in\" - gaining extra visibility and profile by paying for it, rather than getting it on merit by posting good content.\nI didn't really expect much to change in terms of my own experience of using the platform. But there are improvements.\nThe obvious perks are being able to write longer posts and edit them - and I've appreciated the reduction in ads. On the other hand, now I'm paying for the service with cold hard cash, I get even more annoyed about the spam and the bots which blight it. \nJohnny Ryan, a former advertising executive who now challenges the industry as a senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, says that in some ways advertisers are easier pay lords to please than subscribers.\n\"The advertiser in general doesn't give a damn about what the content is,\" he says. \"Every now and then there's a scandal, but in general they're not that political.\" \nThere is an old adage \"if you're not paying for the product, you ARE the product\" - meaning, if you are using something for free, then the company which owns it is taking the data you put on it and charging firms to advertise at you instead. \nIt's an established and lucrative business model. \"Data is the new oil!\" was a bold catchphrase I heard a lot in the tech industry, a few years ago.\nBut perhaps that oil well is running a little low on reserves, because tech firms are increasingly looking at subscriptions as an alternative offer.\nSix months ago, Meta introduced an ad-free subscription model for Facebook and Instagram in Europe. It is \u20ac13 ($14; \u00a311) per month on mobile devices, which is about average for an online service fee. The tech giant declined to tell me how many people have signed up so far.\nNow, this was ostensibly in order to conform with new EU legislation about consumer choice. However it's backfired: Meta now finds itself under investigation because the EU Commission says that the binary decision of either handing over money OR data may not be good enough.\nSnapchat Plus, which includes an ad-free option that's still rolling out, hit one million subscribers within just a few weeks of its launch in June 2022. And in 2023 YouTube's premium service, which offers ad-free streaming, reached 100 million users. \n\"The hassle-free experience of simply being able to enjoy content, without the fear of 'when will the adverts come' is something that I need in my life,\" says James Hacking, founder of the media agency Socially Powerful, and a long-term YouTube subscriber.\nNetflix, on the other hand, launched a cheaper subscription deal that includes ads, and Amazon Prime introduced adverts to its video platform, and now charges users (who are already subscribers) an extra fee to remove them again.\nJohnny Ryan argues that this hybrid model represents the worst of both worlds.

    "A mental health nurse who fled war as a teenager says he will \u201cnever forget the kindness and support\u201d he was shown by communities in the UK and Africa.\nJohn Kasensa, ward manager at Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust (NSFT), lost his family in the war that ravaged the Democratic Republic of Congo more than 20 years ago.\nHe was just 16 when he and a friend made it to a refugee camp in Zambia, where he saw \u201cthe trauma of war and people struggling with their mental health\u201d.\nThose experiences eventually led him to train as a mental health nurse.\nHe said he entered the career \u201cout of a deep-seated passion for supporting people in their journey towards wellness\u201d.\nAt the refugee camp, run by the United Nations, Mr Kasena experienced the kindness of strangers who took him in.\n\u201cThey became my family,\u201d he said, adding that he saw \u201cthe transformative impact of compassionate care\u201d on his own mental health.\nHe said suicide was common in the camps, and people tried to support one another as best they could.\nIn 2007, he was granted asylum in Britain and came to Norwich at the age of 22.\n\u201cIt was January, and I just remember how very cold it was,\u201d said Mr Kasena, who spoke fluent French and Swahili but no English at the time.\nHe was given a place to stay, sharing with another refugee from the DRC, and assigned a case worker and mentor. \nMr Kasena volunteered at a lunch club, joined the local church and the football club.\n\u201cI will never forget the kindness I was shown and the support I got. It helped me to get back on my feet and see hope and purpose in life. \n\"It taught me the importance of having strong support networks,\u201d he said.\nHe started work in the Post Office, but while volunteering as a first aider with the British Red Cross at football matches, someone suggested a career in healthcare.\nIt was during training sessions at Hellesdon Hospital in Norwich that Mr Kasena became curious about mental health and later took on shifts at Norvic Clinic (now Northside House).\n\u201cI started recognising some of the symptoms of trauma that I had seen in the camps,\u201d he said. \n\u201cI wanted to do more to help and saw how my own experience of trauma - and of the compassion and kindness I was shown, which supported my recovery - could be valuable.\u201d\nIn 2013, he joined NSFT as a clinical support worker and has now progressed to ward manager.\n\u201cI enjoy looking at each person as an individual, exploring what is most effective for them.

    "On a balmy February evening in Sydney, a figure disguised in a black hoodie stole up to a row of iconic trees, drill in hand.\nUnder the cover of darkness, the man allegedly tried to kill nine of the beloved figs which have watched over Balmoral Beach for over a century.\n\"I get quite emotional actually,\" local mayor Carolyn Corrigan says, recounting the attack.\n\"I close my eyes and I just can't imagine Balmoral without those figs.\"\nIn recent months, a string of similar incidents in some of Sydney's leafiest and wealthiest suburbs has baffled a nation rather attached to its bushland.\nHundreds of trees have been ruthlessly cut down, drilled and laced with poison, or stripped bare - conveniently exposing the kind of harbour views that drastically increase property values. \n\"It's selfishness and greed, there's no other way to describe it,\" says John Moratelli, who runs an environmental protection group.\n\"It's just the worst of human nature really.\"\nIn Australia, laws enforced by local governments dictate how and when trees can be removed on private property.\nThose breaking the rules are usually clearing land for agriculture or development. Otherwise, it's a tree here or there in a suburban backyard or two.\nBut recently, Sydney councils have noticed an increasing trend of what they call \"tree vandalism\" - much of it on public land. More than 1000 reports of trees being damaged or killed were made last year, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.\nThe most shocking, a brutal mass clearing in Castle Cove.\nThe suburb is a slice of paradise just 10km (6.2 miles) from the heart of Sydney - sea eagles soar overhead, peckish swamp wallabies mow the grass on your front lawn, and everything from bandicoots to snakes are regular visitors.\nOne resident tells the BBC that he once even spotted a whale from his balcony.\nLast July, a pair of walkers heard a chainsaw at work inside a steep reserve sandwiched between multi-million-dollar mansions and the shore. They reported it to authorities, but it was weeks before the council discovered the carnage.\nSome 265 trees and plants, the equivalent of 14 tennis courts, had been razed - cut down or pierced with a drill and injected with poison, sometimes both. So much chemical was used that, initially, there were fears the run-off could wipe out the harbour's marine life.\nThe culprits left behind little evidence: just a pair of green gloves, a bottle of herbicide, and an old sign warning against tree vandalism which they'd apparently ripped out and tossed down the slope.\nA local was so stunned by the rumoured scale of the damage that he drove to the other side of the harbour to see it for himself.\n\"I thought: 'That can't possibly be right',\" said the man, who has asked to be called Bill - not his real name - because tensions in the community are so high.\n\"It was astounding\u2026 They'd really done a number on it.\"\nWilloughby Mayor Tanya Taylor was similarly \"gobsmacked\" when she heard about the destruction.\n\"It was actually, ironically enough, around National Tree Day that I found out,\" she says, gazing out over the bushland, which is still scorched brown nine months on.\nFaded pink ribbons marking vandalised plants shudder in the breeze as the sun beats down on the sparkling - now exposed - water below.\nThe natural environment here is \"invaluable\" and this loss unquantifiable, Ms Taylor says.\n\"That tree down in front of us here,\" she points to an iconic Sydney red gum, which is now skeletal, \"it's 100 years old, 20m (65ft) high.\"\n\"You cannot replace that. That's generations worth of growth.\"\nIn November, in nearby Longueville, authorities discovered a similar cull. This time, almost 300 trees and plants had been downed - again, next to harbourfront homes.\nA couple of peninsulas away, signs around the scenic Bay Run mark where mangroves have been ripped from the banks of Iron Cove. Behind the walkway sit what Canada Bay Mayor Michael Megna calls \"McMansions\".\nHe says even the new trees that his council plants often aren't safe from view-hungry vandals.\n\"It's been two steps forward and one step back.\"\nTo many, the killings are confusing because Australians famously love bushland.\nThe poetry of Banjo Patterson and Henry Lawson, quasi-national anthem Home Among the Gum Trees, the adventures of Skippy the Bush Kangaroo: an admiration and wary respect for the bush has long defined the country's culture and identity.\n\"It's in Australia's DNA,\" says Mr Megna.\nUrban bushland is a haven for wildlife, beautifies suburbs and has marked mental health benefits. And as climate change and pollution increasingly heat the nation's cities, it acts as both their lungs and their shade.\nAll the locations where these dramatic tree culls have occurred are coveted precisely for these reasons.\nSome people suggest the fire risk that thick bushland poses could be driving the behaviour.\nBut the councillors the BBC spoke to are unanimous: \"We should call a spade a spade\u2026 It's an increased sense of personal entitlement,\"",
    "Dozens of Virginia Commonwealth University students walked out of their graduation ceremony on Saturday, partly over a speaker's response - the state governor - to campus protests.  \nIt comes as US school officials brace for possible disruptions of commencement events over Israel-Gaza war protests. \nDozens of colleges roiled by protests are holding graduations this weekend.\nMore than 2,000 people have been arrested since protest began mid-April.\nSocial media posts on Saturday showed Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) students in caps and gowns leaving the room as Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin began his commencement address. \nSome students had criticised the selection of Mr Youngkin as that year's speaker, both for his opposition to a racial literacy requirement being considered by VCU as well as for saying that encampments on college campuses should not be allowed. \nVideo posted online show some of the VCU protesters chanting \"disclose, divest - we will not stop we will not rest\". \nMany students protesters in the US are demanding that their schools, many with massive endowments, financially cut ties from Israel.\nPeople were clapping so loudly, members of the audience couldn't hear Mr Youngkin speak, Sereen Haddad, a second-year VCU student who helped organise the protest, told the BBC on Saturday evening.\nMs Haddad said some 150 people marched outside the ceremony, including students who walked out.\nThirteen people, including six students, were arrested at VCU when the encampment there was cleared by police on 29 April. \nMr Youngkin's speech went on as planned despite the walk-out. He later posted a message on social media congratulating graduates and did not comment on the protest.\nAt another commencement on Saturday, the University of California Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ opened the ceremony by acknowledging the weeks of demonstrations from protesters. \n\"I'm saddened by how this conflict has divided students, faculty and staff,\" she said, according to the LA Times.\nThe remarks drew some applause as well as chants of: \"Hey hey, ho ho, the occupation has got to go\".\nSome 20 students stood up and began waving signs, Palestinian flags and chanting, \"Free Palestine\" as during another speech, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, and they were later joined in chants by more graduates.\nIn a statement, UC Berkeley said that the event continued despite being \"unfortunately disrupted\" and that protesters who left the ceremony did so voluntarily. No one was arrested. \nThe protest came a day after eight students wore shirts spelling out \"UC divest\" during the law school graduation ceremony.\nIn the past month, the BBC has counted more than 130 US colleges and universities with protests against the ongoing war in Gaza. \nCampus protests have led to some graduation ceremonies being cancelled, including at New York's Columbia University, which said last week it was ditching its 15 May commencement in favour of smaller celebrations to focus on keeping students \"safe\". \nMany schools have brought in additional measures for the graduation events, such as requiring identification, instituting clear bag policies, and issuing warnings that people causing a disruption will be removed.\nSome commencement speakers have also withdrawn, like author Colson Whitehead, who said he would no longer be the keynote speaker at the University of Massachusetts Amherst event after police cleared an encampment there. \nOthers have had their speeches cancelled. \nThe University of Vermont and Xavier University of Louisiana recently rescinded invitations to have the US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, speak under students pressure to drop the Biden administration official from the line-up. \nSome universities, including University of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had police clear encampments and arrest protesters on Friday ahead of graduation ceremonies. \nAt the University of Arizona, police used \"loud munitions\" and \"chemical munitions\" to clear remaining protesters from an encampment, the university said. \nWhile some universities have avoided clearing the protest camps, others have brought in police to help remove demonstrators. \nEarlier this week, the chief of police at Arizona State University was placed on paid administrative leave \"pending a review\" after the school received a number of complaints about his handling of the campus protests in late April, ASU said on Friday.

    "Britain's coasts - once some of the most dangerous in the world to navigate for shipping - are littered with shipwrecks. This deadly legacy has left thousands of haunting artefacts and in some cases - lucrative treasure - resting on the sea floor. From time to time these relics re-emerge, found by divers on wrecks, walkers on beaches or they are mistakenly hauled up by fishermen or dredgers. A BBC Freedom of Information request has revealed the hundreds of fascinating items recovered in the last year alone. \nA 200-year-old elephant tusk, coins from the Spanish Armada, plane parts, iron swords and a jar of Marmite were among the items found and reported to the Receiver of Wreck last year. \nHuman bones, mammoth bones and a French-made 2.5 tonne 17th Century bronze cannon were also on the list.\nMore than 300 items were declared in the 2023 report and with no details of the locations or finders shared with the BBC due to data laws, the task of tracking down the items was tricky and in some cases, impossible. \nSome of the custodians of the items did not wish to share details of their finds but others like Ian Goodban, who stumbled across an elephant tusk on a beach were happy to share their stories.\nIn the receiver's 2023 report the elephant tusk is listed as 3.5ft (1.1m) long and \"blackened by mud\". \nMr Goodban was beachcombing in Sandwich Bay, Kent when he \"just saw something poking out the mud\".\n\"I put my hand down... and I thought, 'I think I know what this is' and then the sand cracked in a big semi-circle and that's when I realised I had an elephant tusk,\" he said.\nMr Goodban said finding something that's lain undiscovered for many years was \"always a real thrill\".\n\"I was walking back to my car, had the tusk over my shoulder because of the curvature of the tusk, it sort of lends itself to being carried over the shoulder, and I... just thought to myself, 200 years ago there would have probably been an African porter walking out the interior with one of these on each shoulder, taking it down to the coast for export to England.\"\nSurprisingly Mr Goodban's is not the only elephant tusk to have been found. \nAnother was found off Falmouth in 2019, 110m (361ft) underwater on a Royal African Company trader wreck.\nThe ship was believed to have been involved in the West Africa slave trade in the 1680s but sunk off Cornwall.\nThe 350-year-old tusk is now in Plymouth in the care of Peter Holt, a director of the Ships Project, a non profit that researches and explores maritime historical sites.\nHe said: \"It needs to go into a museum but because it is ivory and because it's been associated with the slave trade, finding a home for it has been difficult.\"\nPartly eaten by wildlife, the tusk has spent much of its time above surface desalinating in fresh water.\n\"You have to get the salt out of them, if the object is allowed to dry, salt crystals will form on the inside and quite often the object will fall apart,\" Mr Holt added.\nOther finds included ship's bells, crockery and ejector seat parts.\nRecoveries at sea, within territorial waters, or up to the high tide water mark, have to be reported to the Receiver of Wreck within 28 days. \nFinders who do not follow the rules can face a \u00a32,500 fine or even court action.\nStephen White, the Receiver of Wreck, said he had one year to decide what happened to items.\n\"What we do is we negotiate between the owner and the finder for potentially a salvage fee,\" he said.\n\"About 85% of finders get to keep the items, but sometimes the items have extreme historical value and we try to find homes for them in museums.\"\nMr White said there was a backlog in dealing with reported items from the last few years due to understaffing and Covid.\nOne of those waiting to hear an outcome is Brixham fisherman, Richard Fowler, whose boat, the Rebecca caught a two-tonne anchor in October 2021 while fishing off Lyme Bay. \n\"I\u2019d like to know, I\u2019d like to recover some of the money for the broken nets and storage but once I can pass it on I think it would look good in a pub,\" Mr Fowler said.\nOver the years fishing he said he had hauled up a whole cow, a sheep and a pre-prepared fish.\n\"We had a kipper in a bag once, complete with a knob of butter. The cow was dead, it was very wet, it had probably been washed down a river with heavy rain or dumped off the side of a ship carrying it. \n\"The sea is a mysterious place.\"\nIn the marine aggregate industry, where sand and gravel is brought up from the seabed, workers have been given training to identify culturally important items that end up in the dredged material.\nLast year workers found mammoth bones, an American submarine badge and a bomb shackle.\nAndrea Hamel, from Wessex Archaeology, who works as an adviser to the dredging industry, said: \"We have had some really amazing finds dating back to the Middle Palaeolithic period.\n\"So everything from hand axes to mammoth teeth, it's just really incredible to be the first person to touch something in say 300,000 years.\n\"There's",
    "Striking historical treasures discovered at a nature reserve have returned home after being hidden away in a store 150 miles away.\nThe artefacts, including a frog figurine and a sculpture of a barbarian, have been transferred to a new archaeological resource centre at Chester House Estate in Northamptonshire.\nThe archive filled 3,000 boxes and included 2.5 tonnes of pottery and 3,750 coins.\nSome of the items are expected to go on display to the public next year.\nThe objects in the archive were excavated between 1984 and 1991 at Stanwick Lakes near Rushden.\nThey were then taken to Historic England's store in Portsmouth.\nThe return of the artefacts was funded by a grant from Historic England and is the result of a three-year project which involved teams from both the Northamptonshire Archaeological Resource Centre (Arc) and Historic England.\nThe finds included 16 partially reconstructed pieces of Roman mosaic and 280 large pieces of Roman sculpture.\nAlso found during the excavations were prehistoric beaker pots and jets and a pristine example of a flint dagger which research has shown was unused before it was buried within a grave.\nThe finds will now be accessible to researchers and some are expected to be displayed at the museum at Stanwick Lakes next year, while others may be put on show at Rushden Lakes.\nHelen Howell, deputy leader of North Northamptonshire Council, said: \"It is fantastic news that these historically important items have been able to return to the county and their new home is so close to where the items were originally excavated - it truly is a 'full circle' moment.\nBecky Gill, heritage manager at Stanwick Lakes, said: \u201cBeing able to display items in our Heritage Museum, on the site on which they were found, is a wonderful and engaging way for us to be able to tell the story of the area\u2019s rich heritage and history.\"\nFollow Northamptonshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Day two of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's Nigeria visit began with a game of sitting volleyball.\nIn Abuja, the couple spent time with Nigeria Unconquered, which compiles the country's Invictus Games team. \nHarry and Meghan are to speak at a reception hosted by the Nigerian military's chief of defence staff.\nThe duchess will later co-host a Women in Leadership event with Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, director general of the World Trade Organization.\nAfter arriving at the Armed Forces' Officers Mess and being given scarves in the green and white colours of Nigeria, Harry and Meghan watched a game of sitting volleyball, before Harry was invited to play with the team. \nThe Duke participated in a few rounds of the game, which were played by 'Team Harry' and 'Team CDS' - referring to the military's chief of defence staff who is behind the couple's visit to Nigeria. \nThe other players were army veterans, most wounded in battle against the country's Islamist insurgency. \nOn the duke's team was former Nigerian soldier Peacemaker Azuegbulam, who lost his leg in combat against Boko Haram. He became the first African to win gold at the Invictus Games in Germany last year.\nThe Duke then joined in the team's war cry before speaking with families and friends of the athletes. \nLast year, Nigeria became the first African country to take part in the Invictus Games, a sporting competition for wounded military personnel and veterans, co-founded by Prince Harry in 2014. \nOn the first day of the mini-tour on Friday, Harry spoke about the joy the Nigeria team brought to the games in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. \nThe charity Nigeria Unconquered, which will put together Nigeria's team for next year's Invictus Games in Canada, helps wounded, sick and injured service personnel to \"find new purpose\" through sport.\nOn Saturday, Meghan was presented with a bouquet of roses by six-year-old Royalty Ojeh, daughter of the founder of Nigeria Unconquered, Bobby Ojeh. Touched by the gesture, the duchess offered Royalty one of the roses to keep.\nAfter the sit-down volleyball game, the duke and duchess attended a reception which included performances from drummers and traditional dancers as well as remarks from various officials. \nDr Abike Dabiri-Erewa, chairwoman of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, shared her delight at the duchess's Nigerian heritage, telling Meghan she was too beautiful not to have been Nigerian. \nShe presented Meghan and Harry with an outfit made of aso oke, a hand-woven cloth from south-west Nigeria. \nIn an address, Harry shared a story from his trip to a military rehabilitation centre in Kaduna on Friday, where he met 50 wounded service personnel who were in hospital. \n\"There were two of the 50 that were a little different,\" he said. \"They had smiles on faces. One of them was doing push-ups. I was intrigued.\" \nHe added: \"They knew their life wasn't defined from the injuries of their past - that is what Invictus is all about and that is what your new centre will be about.\" \nThe audience was shown a video of a 3D render of a \"state-of-the-art\" Invictus Centre authorities hope to build in Abuja soon. \nBefore arriving in Nigeria, Prince Harry visited London as part of celebrations for the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, and attended a service of thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral. \nMeanwhile, the King, whose cancer treatment is ongoing, met members of the public at a Buckingham Palace garden party a little over two miles away.\nA spokesperson for the duke confirmed he would not see his father during his time in the UK due to the King's \"full programme\" but that he \"hopes to see him soon\". \nHarry had last been in the UK in February to visit the King soon after he was diagnosed with cancer.",
    "Protest groups such as Just Stop Oil and Palestine Action could be banned in a similar way to terrorist organisations, under a proposal from the government\u2019s adviser on political violence.\nAn upcoming report from Lord Walney, which BBC News has seen extracts of, will recommend a new category for proscribing \"extreme protest groups\".\nIt defines these as those which routinely use criminal tactics to try to achieve their aims. \nThe sanctions could restrict a group's ability to fundraise and its right to assembly in the UK.\nThe Home Office said ministers would consider the recommendations.\n\"Militant groups like Palestine Action and Just Stop Oil are using criminal tactics to create mayhem and hold the public and workers to ransom without fear of consequence,\" Lord Walney said.\n\"Banning terror groups has made it harder for their activists to plan crimes - that approach should be extended to extreme protest groups too.\"\nJust Stop Oil said the government were the \u201cdangerous radicals that are endangering all of us\u201d through their climate policies.\nPalestine Action claimed its actions were in line with most of the British public who want an arms embargo between the UK and Israel, and the proposals would not deter their campaign.\nThe new restriction orders \"would be distinct from proscription on terrorism grounds\", the report will say.\nBut the mechanism could limit the activities of organisations that have a policy of using criminal offences or causing serious disruption to influence government or public debate.\nIf a group\u2019s actions were persistent, and used to promote a political or ideological cause, that would count against them, according to the recommendation.\nIt will come as part of a review into tackling political violence by Lord Walney - the former Labour MP John Woodcock - which was commissioned three years ago, but is yet to be published.\nA government source said ministers shared Lord Walney\u2019s objectives and would consider implementing his recommendations once the review was published.\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cExtremism of any kind has no place in our society and we will not tolerate tactics that set out to intimidate, threaten or cause disruption to the law-abiding majority. \n\"In recent months, we have also witnessed a small number of protesters display violent and hateful behaviour, and the police have our full support in tackling extremism and hate crime.\n\u201cWe are considering the report's recommendations extremely carefully and will respond in due course.\u201d",
    "Israel has told tens of thousands more Palestinians to leave Rafah, as it intensifies military operations in southern Gaza.\nFlyers dropped from the air and posts on social media told residents in the city's eastern districts to go to al-Mawasi - a narrow coastal area which Israel calls an \"expanded humanitarian zone\".\nParts of Rafah where the streets were packed with locals and displaced people just days ago, now look like a ghost town.\nIsrael has said it will proceed with planned operations in Rafah despite the US and other allies warning that a ground offensive could lead to mass civilian casualties and a humanitarian crisis.\nOn Saturday, US President Joe Biden said a ceasefire in Gaza was possible as soon as the next day if Hamas released its hostages.\n\"Israel said it's up to Hamas, if they wanted to do it, we could end it tomorrow. And the ceasefire would begin tomorrow,\" he told a fund-raising event in Seattle.\nIsrael says 128 people taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October are unaccounted for, 36 of whom are presumed dead.\nImages showed smoke rising over Rafah on Saturday and witnesses quoted by AFP reported air strikes near the crossing with Egypt.\nPosting on X, formerly Twitter, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that during the past day troops had been engaged in \"face-to-face battles\" with Hamas fighters in Rafah.\nThe IDF added that soldiers had found \"a number of underground shafts\" in the area.\nIn the past day, there have been dozens of Israeli air strikes across the length of the Gaza Strip, with the Israeli military saying it\u2019s targeting what it calls terrorists and terrorist infrastructure.\nOn Saturday evening the IDF said it was \"currently striking Hamas terror targets in the Jabaliya area\", in the far north of the Gaza Strip. \nEarlier it instructed residents to leave some areas of northern Gaza. It said they should \"temporarily evacuate to shelters in western Gaza City\".\nIsraeli media report that several Hamas rockets were fired at Ashkelon overnight, a port city about 10km (six miles) north of the Gaza border. The Times of Israel says three people were lightly injured when one rocket hit their home.\nIsrael's plans to extend its ground offensive to the southern tip of the Gaza Strip - where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have sought refuge from fighting elsewhere in the territory, has sparked international concern.\nLast week, President Biden said the US would not supply heavy weapons to Israel which could be used in a major assault on Rafah.\nIn an interview with CNN, Biden said America would continue to give Israel the weapons it needed to defend itself, including interceptors for its \u201cIron Dome\u201d air defence system.\nBut he said US-supplied heavy weapons had already killed civilians in Gaza, and warned Israel would not keep Washington's support if it carried out military operations in those population centres.\nUK Foreign Secretary David Cameron has said Britain is opposed to the military operation in Rafah, but is unlikely to follow America in delaying arms sales to Israel.\nOn Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he hopes to overcome his differences with Mr Biden - but vowed to press ahead with its military assault on Rafah.\n\"If we need to... we will stand alone. I have said that if necessary we will fight with our fingernails,\" Mr Netanyahu said.\nSaturday's evacuation order comes hours after a US state department report said Israel may have used American-supplied weapons in breach of international humanitarian law in some instances during the war in Gaza.\nIt is \"reasonable to assess\" that those arms have been used in ways \"inconsistent\" with Israel's obligations, the report said, but added the US did not have complete information in its assessment and that shipments could continue.\nAid agencies have warned that the continuing Israeli military operation in southern Gaza means Palestinians will be left without any places of safety.\nKhitam Al-Khatib, a Rafah resident who said she had lost at least 10 of her relatives in an airstrike on a family house earlier on Saturday, told Reuters there was \"no safe place in Gaza\".\n\"They threw fliers on Rafah and said, from Rafah to al-Zawayda is safe, people should evacuate there, and they did, and what has become of them? Dismembered bodies?\" she was quoted as saying.\nThe charity Oxfam has said that the area has no functioning hospitals and aid supplies are extremely limited.\nThe largest of Rafah's three partially functioning hospitals, Abu Youssef al-Najjar, had to be hastily abandoned the following day after staff received an evacuation order and there was fighting nearby.\nThe UN's agency for Palestinian refugees has also expressed concerns about the conditions in the al-Mawasi encampment where people are being told to go.\nSam Rose from UNRWA told BBC News that the area had virtually no facilities for the numbers being sent there.\n\"It's people living in shacks, people living in tents by the side of a sandy beach road.

    "Tens of thousands of Georgians have taken to the streets of the capital Tbilisi on Saturday evening to protest a controversial \"foreign influence\" bill backed by the government.\nProtesters marched to the capital's Europe Square holding Georgian and EU flags, chanting \u201cno to the Russian law\u201d.\nThe law would target civil society organisations and independent media that receive foreign funding.\nMassive rallies have gripped the Black Sea Caucasus country for nearly a month after the ruling Georgian Dream party reintroduced the bill.\nDespite a campaign of intimidation ahead of Saturday's rally - in which dozens of NGO workers, activists and opposition politicians received threats or were physically assaulted - protesters turned up in their thousands undeterred by the pouring rain.\nOpposition parties say the bill - coined \"Russian law\" after Russia's passing of similar legislation in 2012 - will be used by the government to clamp down on dissent.\nThe US has said the bill threatens free speech. \nIn neighbouring Russia, the law has since been used to marginalise voices challenging the Kremlin - including prominent cultural figures, media organisations and civil society groups.\nMany Georgians in the rally do not want Russia's authoritarian-style leadership crossing into their country.\n\"We don't need to return to the Soviet Union,\" 38-year-old Georgian-language teacher Lela Tsiklauri, said.\n\"We are protecting our European future and our freedom,\" said another protester, Mariam Meunrgia, 39, who works for a German company.\nThe law, if passed, could harm Georgia's attempt to join the EU, which has given it candidate status.\nOn Friday, foreign ministers of Nordic and Baltic states issued a joint statement urging the government in Tbilisi to reconsider the bill\nLast week, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the Georgian people want a \"European future\".   \n\"Georgia is at a crossroads. It should stay the course on the road to Europe,\" she posted on X.\nBut the Georgian Dream government has defended the bill, saying it will \"boost transparency\" over NGOs' foreign funding. It aims to sign the measure into law by mid-May.\nIf adopted, the law would require that any independent NGO and media organisation receiving more than 20% of its funding from abroad to register as an \"organisation pursuing the interests of a foreign power\".\nBut the protesters fear it could be used to crush critical voices ahead of parliamentary elections later this year.\nThe bill cleared its second parliamentary stage by a margin of 83 votes to 23. After a third reading, it has to be signed by President Salome Zurabishvili, who has vowed to veto it - although Georgian Dream has sufficient numbers in parliament to overrule her.\nIn 2023, mass street protests forced Georgian Dream to drop plans for similar measures.",

But despite their differences, nearly all provided the same reason for being there: to catch a glimpse of history. \n\"The truth is, when you come and sit in this [court]room, you're not really expressing your support for any side,\" said Shmuel Munkis, a Brooklyn resident. \"It's just about being here, just to witness history.\" \nMr Munkis is among dozens of people who waited in line for the second day of testimony from Stormy Daniels, an adult film star who has alleged having sex with Mr Trump, who has denied this. \nMr Trump is accused of illegally covering up a reimbursement he made to his former lawyer who gave Ms Daniels the hush-money payment. \nThe adult film star's first day of questioning on Tuesday featured a series of salacious details about an evening she alleges she spent in Mr Trump's hotel suite. The testimony prompted the former president to curse and shake his head across the courtroom.  \nIt also sparked a frenzy outside the courthouse, with an even longer line on a brisk spring morning for a chance at a seat. \nMr Munkis arrived at 00:30 EDT (05:30 BST) on Thursday to help his chances of being one of only six people from the public in the main courtroom for Ms Daniels' last day of testimony. \n\"Some people were telling me that there was some inappropriate things being discussed. But I absolutely did not come for that,\" said Mr Munkis, a supporter of Mr Trump who believes the trial is \"a joke\". \nJoe Waldbaum, a semi-retired 77-year-old criminal defence attorney, took a week off and a plane from Massachusetts to come to the New York trial. \nCarrying memes depicting Mr Trump in prison while sitting in a foldable chair for the hours-long wait, Mr Waldbaum said the trial itself was the punishment for the former president. \n\"It's a spectacle,\" he said. \"He's got to be convicted.\" \nOthers travelled even farther. \nClare Gallagher, from Scotland, decided to spend her vacation visiting cousin Frances Graham in New York waiting in line at the courthouse. Ms Graham's sister, Barbara Anne Crowley, joined them from San Diego.  \n\"When I go home, I can tell my kids that we were there,\" Ms Gallagher said. \nIn Scotland, Mr Trump has a poor reputation because of controversies related to his golf courses there, the women said. \n\"We're looking at it and wondering how anyone like that could get to a position so high in the country,\" Ms Graham said. \nNia Fields, a 32-year-old marketing director, has long been exposed to Mr Trump and his real estate ventures, growing up in the New York City area. \nShe's been following the trial closely. \n\"This is like my real-life reality show,\" she said, adding that she had been waiting to come to the trial, but made an extra effort when she heard Ms Daniels was the witness. \n\"I'll be keeping my eyes on scene, on the body language with Trump and his team,\" she said. \nMina, a 33-year-old who is a frequent pro-Trump protester outside and an observer inside the court, was bothered by Ms Daniels' first day of testimony. \nShe noted that even Justice Juan Merchan said some details the adult film star shared would have been \"better left unsaid\". \n\"I found that her testimony was not consistent,\" she said. \"I don't feel [Mr Trump] is guilty at all.\" \nOn the other side of the political aisle was Rose Brennan, who carried a puppet resembling Mr Trump nicknamed \"Donald J Puppet\". \nIt comes with her to women's marches and other protests. \nBut once inside, it's all business. \nIn the main courtroom and the media overflow section, members of the public cannot speak, check their cell phones, or eat or drink anything besides water for hours at a time. \nFor Mason Kidd, a 22-year-old freelance film producer, those are small discomforts worth bearing to watch history. He took advantage of a day of no meetings, waking up at 05:00 EDT and biking over from New York's Hell's Kitchen neighbourhood.\nHis friends didn't understand why he was so motivated, he said. \n\"Nobody goes to these things, especially our age,\" Mr Kidd said. \"It just seems like a moment that I will want to remember that I went to, like 30 years from now.\"",
    "They have been blasted from car stereos on the streets of New York City, played by DJs at nightclubs across the US, dubbed into Chinese on TikTok and inspired merengue songs among Spanish-speaking audiences. \nA series of diss tracks from hip-hop's two biggest stars, Drake and Kendrick Lamar, has animated the most high-profile rap beef in a generation, drawing global attention and an avalanche of online discussion and dissection. \nThe two men's status in the rap world transcends that of the typical artist: Drake owns a record label and has collaborated with the Toronto Raptors and Nike, while Lamar was the first rapper to win a Pulitzer Prize for his level of artistry and produced an award-winning record for the Marvel film Black Panther. \nThat these two powerhouses would have such a public and angry spat has fascinated not just hip-hop fans but others around the globe - particularly as Drake and Lamar are castigating each other lyrically at such a sudden and blistering pace. \nThe rap rivals have released nine solo diss tracks aimed at one another in fewer than four weeks, but there are other collaborations and songs produced by other artists that stretch back to Drake and North Carolina rapper J. Cole's collaboration on the track First Person Shooter in October 2023.\nJ. Cole said on First Person Shooter that he, Drake and Lamar were the \"big three\" of hip hop. Lamar would reject that idea by rapping that \"it's just big me\" on record producer Metro Boomin and rapper Future's collaboration on the song Like That. \nIn the early days of rap, you might only catch diss tracks on a copied cassette, from an in-the-know radio station, or by seeing a performance at a club. Lamar and Drake's super-charged rap beef made it clear that this has now changed forever. \n\"I think when you look at this battle, it is going to surpass every other battle because of how it was able to crossover to pop culture so quickly,\" said Carl Lamarre, Billboard's deputy director of R&B and Hip-Hop.\nEven in the recent past, audiences might have had to wait months to hear a feud play out. Jay-Z released the diss track, Takeover, in September 2001 to ridicule fellow New Yorker, Nas. It took his target three months to reply on Ether. \nAt one time, releasing a diss was an element of performative competition within the hip-hop community. It was used to claim a hip-hop throne, often by rappers who were trying to grow their platform at a local level and to hustle for another show or record contract. \nAudiences, in turn, would have to put in work to follow if a rap beef progressed past a night at the club, Bill Stephney, a former executive at Def Jam Records, recalled. \nWhen he was coming up in New York City in the 1980s, Mr Stephney said fans would capture diss tracks on tape, and those who were interested were lucky to get a version that could be listened to. They were often copied hundreds of times from one cassette to another, each iteration decreasing the sound quality until the track was hardly audible. \nMr Stephney said he worked hard to obtain a prized cassette of Roxanne Shante, a female rapper who helped popularise the diss track at 14 years old in New York. She led a series of well-known rap feuds and rivalries called the Roxanne Wars in the 1980s.\nThe immediacy with which artists are now able to release songs directly on social media, even before they hit digital streaming platforms, means the two rappers can speak directly to each other and to their audiences. Their fans can also then react and respond in real time, and it can rapidly be picked up by popular culture\n\"Fast forward 40 years [from the Roxanne Wars], and now Kendrick and Drake can create something and rather than having it be dubbed 200 times for New York-area fans to check it out, they can just simply upload it within seconds,\" Mr Stephney said. \n\"That 100 million people can consume that so quickly is just such a profound technological change. It's hard to even fathom it.\" \nThe two men's diss tracks have produced countless Reddit forums, YouTube explainers and media think-pieces. And the songs that stem from their feud have led the streaming charts in recent weeks. \nLamar's most recent release, Not Like Us, is among the most streamed song in the world at the moment, coming in at #1 on Apple Music in 40 countries earlier this week, and it is expected to debut at #1 on the Billboard charts in the coming days. \nNot Like Us has also been played on US television during an NBA playoff game, it's been heard blasting from the speakers at the Los Angeles Dodgers' stadium and tennis star Naomi Osaka said she listened to it before taking the court at the Italian Open.\nLamar's other diss track Euphoria, meanwhile, was used by President Joe Biden's campaign in a video attempting to throw shade at Republican contender and former president Donald Trump.\n\"At one time, it was really those people who were really part of the subculture who would know about [rap beefs], and they followed it fer",
    "Three fathers who have walked 500 miles (805km) to raise awareness of suicide have crossed the finish line in Norwich.\nThe Three Dads Walking - Andy Airey, Mike Palmer and Tim Owen - have all experienced the loss of a daughter through suicide.\nThe trio left Stirling, Scotland on 17 April and were greeted by crowds of well-wishers in Norwich on Saturday as they ended their walk, each holding a photo of their daughters.\nMr Owen, from Shouldham, Norfolk, said it felt \"incredible\" to complete the challenge for young suicide prevention charity Papyrus.\n\"We've got lots of people locally here, but also people have travelled nationally to be with us,\" he said.\nMr Owen's daughter Emily took her own life in 2020 during lockdown when she was 19. \nMr Owen met the other fathers through the charity Papyrus.\nIt is dedicated to the prevention of suicide and the promotion of positive mental health and emotional wellbeing in young people.\nThe Three Dads have stumbled into a wedding, walked past some of the country's best-known landmarks and also met Labour leader Keir Starmer to discuss why they believe suicide prevention should be put on the national curriculum.\nMr Palmer, from Greater Manchester and who walked for his late daughter Beth, said in Norwich: \"We believe so many families don't have to go through this terrible grief.\n\"It is difficult but that is why we walk, in memory of our girls, and all those who have been lost.\n\"Sadly, if we don't don't do something positive, we are going to lose more and more children.\"\nBBC Breakfast was among those to welcome the dads across the finish line and hear their fundraising feat had made \u00a3110,000 so far, and a further \u00a315,000 in bucket collections.\nMr Airey, from Cumbria, said: \"After we lost Sophie we didn't know what to do. \n\"We were looking for a charity to support at her funeral and we were introduced to Papyrus.  \n\"Once you realise what great work they do, I couldn't help but get stuck in, and here I am five years later.\"\nIn total, the Three Dads have now raised more than \u00a31m for the charity. \nPapyrus chief executive Ged Flynn paid tribute to them as they completed the equivalent of a marathon a day on their Walk of Hope. \nHe said their achievement had been a \"transformation of tragedy to hope\".\nIt had enabled the charity to go \"from having five offices to having 20 hubs around the country, from having a part-time helpline staffed by professionals there every day around the clock now, because of these guys,\" he said.\nFollow Norfolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A police officer was shot in the leg with a crossbow and a man was stabbed in what was described as a \"serious assault and weapons incident\".\nPolice attended School Close in Downley near High Wycombe on Friday after a man in his 60s suffered a stab wound.\nThe suspected attacker was shot by armed police and has potentially life-changing injuries.\nBoth the officer and the stab victim have now been released from hospital, police said.\nThe suspect, a 54-year-old man from High Wycombe, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and remains under police guard in hospital.\nAssistant Chief Constable Tim Metcalfe, from Thames Valley Police, said the police officer who was shot was in \"good spirits given the circumstances\".\n\"It is very fortunate no-one suffered life-threatening injuries.\"\nHe praised the \"incredible bravery\" of the officers who responded to the incident, and added: \"We are giving all the support we can to the officer who was injured during the incident.\"\nACC Metcalfe added: \"We are not looking for anyone else in relation to the incident at this time.\"\nBuckinghamshire commander Ch Supt Emma Burroughs said the incident had been \"hugely challenging and unsettling\" for the local community.\n\"We do not underestimate the impact it has had on the community so we are doing all we can to support people, such as the patrols in the area over the coming day and engagement with stakeholders such as councillors, the MP and our independent advisory group,\" she said.\nNeil, who lives in the area and did not wish to give his last name, told the BBC he had seen an armed police officer crouching in a nearby bush. \n\"I was playing in the park with my son and my partner and I knew something was about to go down. I grabbed my son and told my partner to get home, and within minutes it was kicking off and pandemonium everywhere, then gunshots.\n\"It happened so quickly. It was peaceful to mayhem.\"\n\"It escalated so quickly.\"\nFellow resident Andy Gupta told PA Media: \"We saw three or four armed police through our window.

    "Senior Conservatives tell the Observer that Natalie Elphicke defected to Labour because she was never made a minister. An unnamed cabinet source claims the former Conservative MP had become bitter about being passed over for a senior role, first by former Prime Minister Liz Truss, then Rishi Sunak. \nThere is no response from Ms Elphicke but the paper comments that the Conservative Party is looking for ways to undermine the MP for Dover.\nDescribing Ms Elphicke as a \"turncoat MP\", the Mail on Sunday says allegations that she asked former justice secretary Robert Buckland to pull strings for her ex-husband could prove embarrassing for her new party leader, Sir Keir Starmer. As the paper points out, he is a former director of public prosecutions.\nThe Sunday Telegraph has more details on the reported crackdown on Civil Service positions devoted solely to diversity. Senior managers will be ordered not to hire staff dedicated to boosting diversity, equality and inclusion. Staff already there whose jobs are focussed only on diversity will be moved to Human Resources teams and given broader job specs, it reports. \nCabinet Office Minister Esther McVey tells the paper she is concerned Whitehall managers are becoming distracted by what she calls \"woke hobby horses\" rather than delivering their core function.\nThe Telegraph also reports that Russia is recruiting far-right extremists to carry out attacks in the UK and other Nato countries. Intelligence sources have told it that undercover agents of the GRU - the Russian military intelligence service - and members of the Russian mercenary group Wagner have got people to carry out a number of attacks in western Europe and the US over the past six months. \nIt is thought the Kremlin is copying Iran's lead and encouraging criminal gangs to carry out proxy terrorist attacks, the paper reports.\nThe Sun on Sunday welcomes proposals which could see extreme protest groups banned. In an editorial, the paper says that although the plans will \"provoke howls\" of outrage from civil liberties groups, they are not an attack on freedom but a defence of it.\nUnnamed friends of the King tell the Sunday Times that he agreed to a request from the Duke of Sussex to let him stay in a royal residence during last week's trip to London, because he no longer has an official UK home. In the end, he is thought to have chosen to stay in a hotel. \nThe King and his youngest son did not meet during Prince Harry's visit. Friends of the King say that if Harry had stayed in a royal residence, it would have made a meeting logistically easier.\nFinally, the Sunday Telegraph reports that dog walkers who allow their animals to attack livestock could have their pets seized by police. New laws being drawn up by the government will give officers \"beefed up\" powers to detain dogs they believe have attacked or worried livestock. \nThe paper says farmers believe the problem has been made worse by \"lockdown puppies\" - dogs bought during the pandemic, which are less socialised than normal because of Covid restrictions when they were young.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "Belfast\u2019s city centre railway station closed on Friday to make way for the opening of a new public transport hub later this year.\nThe last train left Great Victoria Street station at 23:32 BST.\nThe new transport hub, Belfast Grand Central Station, is not due to open until the autumn.\nEssential infrastructure work is required to link the rail network to the new hub, which explains the imminent closure of the nearby Great Victoria Street station.\nThe adjoining Europa bus station will remain open as will other Belfast train stations, including Botanic and Lanyon Place.\nRail services in Great Victoria Street in Belfast date back almost 200 years.\nThe new station is being built nearby and will combine rail and bus services.\nFrom Saturday, Translink is introducing a revised train timetable which will operate until the autumn.\nLater in the summer, the rail line will close between Lanyon Place and Lisburn.\nDuring this time, bus substitution services will operate.\nStewart Hamilton was on the platform on Friday night for the arrival and departure of the final train out of Great Victoria Street. \n\"My son and I have an interest in trains and we always have. We Go to Dublin a lot but use great Victoria St. I remember the old historic building and the fascinating architecture,\" he said.\nHe said that their was a \"lovely atmosphere\" on the platform \"with so many train enthusiasts young and old.\"\n\"The new hub will be brilliant. It'll be a real boost for the city,\" he added.\nChris Hunter, Yvonne Belle and James Hunter met on the platform on Friday to wave off the final train.\n\"We are train fanatics and we are delighted to see this before things are modernised even more,\" Chris said.\n\"A new timetable might cause some confusion for a while but we will get used to it. It'll be worth it for this new hub. Good to see a positive development for a change,\" he added.\nAdrian Collen took the journey from Lurgan, County Armagh, into Great Victoria Street to mark the historic day with his son.\n\"Back in 1966, I used to come into the old station once a week for work.\n\"Today feels like a bit of history,\" Adrian said. \nHis son Ian Collen commutes into Belfast every day and said he had no concerns about disruption to his journey.\n\"I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll do what they can to accommodate us,\" he said.\nIan added that making the journey with his dad was a \"lovely thing to do\".\nThe gap between the closure of Great Victoria Street and the opening of the new hub will inconvenience many regular passengers.\nOne commuter who spoke to BBC News NI on Friday morning said she will have to leave home nearly an hour earlier to get work five days a week. \n\"I've now to get a bus and I can't use my train ticket on the buses because they say the trains are still running.\n\"But they don't run in time for me to get to work on time, so I'd have to get multiple trains and multiple buses,\" she explained.\n\"I understand that the work needs done and it is to better the services and that's all fine, but they should have better things implemented for people who can't go into work later.\"\nTaylor Lemon, who commutes into Great Victoria Street from Lambeg, said she does not know how she will navigate her new route.\n\"I\u2019m still trying to figure it all out,\" she said. \n\"My main concern is later in the summer when the trains to Lisburn are disrupted.\n\"With the cost of fuel, and car parking charges somewhere secure, it\u2019s going to be expensive.\"\nIn a message to passengers, the chief executive of Translink, Chris Conway, said: \u201cWe recognise this will cause disruption, but Belfast Grand Central is coming very close (to completion).\u201d\nTrains will run as normal on Friday and the last departure from Belfast's Great Victoria Street station will be the 23:32 BST service to Bangor.\nThe final service is likely to be popular with rail enthusiasts and historians, as well as regular travellers.\nHilton Parr, head of rail customer services at Translink, said the closure was a landmark moment.\nHe said: \u201cIt has been a key rail station for the region for some 185 years.\n\"It played a significant role in several key moments in history including both World Wars, facilitating ambulance trains in the first and American troops in training for D-Day during the second.\u201d\nThe first railway terminus in the area was called Glengall Place and opened in August 1839 providing a service to Lisburn.\nIt was renamed Belfast Victoria Street in 1852 and then, in 1856, Belfast Great Victoria Street.\nPart of the original station was demolished to make way for the new Europa Hotel, which opened in 1971. \nThe remaining parts of the station were then damaged by two separate bombings in 1972.\nFour years later, the station was closed with all rail services moving to the newly-built Belfast Central Station, now renamed Lanyon Place.\nIn 1991 came the new Europa Bus Centre and Great Northern Mall shopping area. Great Victoria Street Station re-opened in September 1995.\nThere is no exact date yet for the opening of the new bus and rail ",
    "Beach yoga is perhaps not something you would associate with Scotland.\nThe rain, wind and unpredictable weather might just put most people off.\nBut for Paula McGuire, it was a lifeline in her recovery from a mental health struggle. \nIn an effort to swap drinking alcohol for more wholesome activities, she set up a class on Irvine Beach, on the west coast, with her friend, personal trainer Kimberly McPhail.\nPaula, from Maryhill in Glasgow, started yoga when she was struggling with her mental health.\nShe faced lots of major life changes and lost her self-esteem after she went through a long-term relationship break-up.\nPaula decided she needed to put herself out there, otherwise she would continue down a \"dark hole\" of no confidence and anxiety.\nAt the time she couldn't find activities to improve her situation that did not involve drinking alcohol.\nShe said she had never seen herself as a \"yoga person\" - but after attending a couple of outdoor sessions she decided to set up her own venture with her friend Kimberley.\n\"In Maryhill there\u2019s nothing like that, there\u2019s nothing wholesome out there,\" she said.\nA qualified yoga teacher since June last year, Paula wants to help other people through exercise, particularly woman who have experience similar struggles to her.\nSoulfit is a combination of a workout and yoga on the beach.\nAnd Paula's goal is to make the class as inclusive as possible, to create a space where woman can feel empowered and supported.\nShe admitted the support of strong woman in her life allowed her to keep going.\n\"Sometimes I think the fitness industry in general can be a bit unwelcoming for people,\" she said.\n\"You might feel like if I\u2019m not fit enough, I can\u2019t go to that or, if I don\u2019t look a certain way, I can\u2019t do that.\"\nPaula said 80% of classes spent on the beach had been \"gorgeous, sunny mornings\".\n\"I think the weather doesn\u2019t put people off when the views are so good.\"\nShe added that the group often endure blustery conditions but face the opposite direction of the wind to make it bearable. \nPaula said: \"It also adds to the sound of the waves during the relaxation which is amazing. \n\"Even when you\u2019d typically think of the weather being 'rubbish', when you\u2019re there experiencing it, you actually embrace it.\"\nPaula feels social media has been a big help in increasing the popularity of outdoor activities.\nShe said: \"For girls, especially meeting new people, they kept having the conversation with me saying their boyfriend will go and do a hill walk with his pals or go to football and he has loads of friends.\n\"I thought it was a shame that there wasn\u2019t as many things out there for girls. I felt like it's harder to actually meet new people.\"\nPaula also believes that more coverage of women's sport in media has helped encourage women to exercise.\nDuring summer months she said beaches in Ayrshire can be a draw for underage drinkers.\nBut she chose the location for its views.\nShe said: \"I feel like Irvine beach is absolutely stunning.\n\"I think when you\u2019re from Glasgow or even the west, these beaches can be associated with people going there for a wild day out drinking.\n\"Whereas actually, if you go in the morning or night and you see the sunrise, you actually appreciate how beautiful it is. I just always feel so good when I\u2019m there.\"\nMikaela Sansone-Pollock is a counselling psychologist, based in Edinburgh.\nFor the last four years, her work has focused on the intersection of physical activity and mental health.\nBefore she studied psychology, Mikaela was a person trainer and yoga instructor.\nShe believes yoga is a great form of exercise for both the mind and body.\n\"That\u2019s why I wanted to marry the two because I found that physical activity, yoga in particular, helped me slow down and pay more attention to being present and to my thought and my mood,\" Mikaela  said.\nRecently, she came across a study which discussed the comparison between outdoor and indoor exercise. \nAlthough it is hard to tell which is more beneficial to your mental health, the findings nodded towards outdoor exercise.\nMikaela added: \"I think any sort of movement, any sort of mindfulness is going to be beneficial and if you combine that with something intentional like yoga, something where you get the benefit of green spaces and outdoors and fresh air, it\u2019s all the better really.\"",

    "A protest has been held near a former Roman settlement where plans have been approved for an 800-home development.\nCampaigners want the site at Longbeck Road in Marske, Teesside, to be protected because of its history. \nArchaeologist Kendra Quinn said it was \"significant\" as there were signs the area had been occupied for thousands of years.\nDevelopers Taylor Wimpey and Miller Homes said their archaeological investigations had been approved by the local authority and the site was being protected from poor weather. \nRomano-British pottery, animal bones and flint tools were unearthed at the site earlier this year. \nCampaigners applied to Historic England to make an order to protect the plot.\nA ministerial decision is expected later this year.\nDr Tristan Learoyd, a councillor at Redcar and Cleveland Council, who attended the protest on Saturday said the site was important as people in the area \"don't have much information\" about their history.\n\"Many of the people of Marske have lived here for generations and generations. This is probably our only opportunity to learn how we came to be here,\" he said. \n\"This area, we suspect, has archaeological remains from the Bronze Age, Iron Age and Roman period.\"\nDr Quinn said she believed the area needed preserving because of the scale of the settlement uncovered, estimated to be about the size of 71 football pitches.\n\"The size of it is unprecedented.

    "There were times when musician Vince Freeman's dream of finishing his debut album seemed impossible. The platinum-selling artist suffered six years of debilitating pain due to a spinal injury which left him unable to hold his baby son and then the Covid pandemic happened. But after successful treatment he has finally completed his first UK tour and finished his album.\nVince's career was at a high after competing in The Voice 2012 and releasing a hit single.\nThe singer, who lives in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, said he was \"just going out and doing as many gigs as possible\", averaging about 300 shows a year.\nHe had won the UK Indie Awards in 2008, beating the likes of Jamie Woon, Newton Faulkner and Ed Sheeran. \nThen, four years later, he was asked to go on the first ever series of The Voice, which he followed up with single The Singer, which charted at number two in Germany.\n\"I finally sort of felt like I was starting to get somewhere,\" he said.\nBut around 2015, aged 37, two severely prolapsed discs and an osteo-degenerative condition left him unable to do the most basic of daily tasks, let alone organise a tour. \n\"I just found that over a period of time I was more frequently coming home and saying to my wife, 'my back hurts',\" said Vince.\n\"It got to a point where it was more than just moaning.\"\nHe collapsed one morning and ended up in hospital.\nVince's injuries left him on morphine \"24/7\" and \"a whole cocktail of drugs\", as well as needing regular surgery.\n\"You kind of become your worst version of yourself,\" he said.\nThe musician could not drive or carry his equipment to gigs, so he had to hire someone to do this for him. He also had to walk with a stick at times.\n\"Day to day was awful,\" he said.\n\"I couldn't even carry Rory [his son] for the first 12 months of his life.\"\nAfter six years and a period of osteopathy, Vince finally started recovering and one day the pain was gone.\n\"I just was sobbing,\" he said.\nThings were looking up. Vince received a platinum disc for performing vocals on Sun is Shining by Lost Frequencies.\nHe said: \"I got asked to do a writing session for Alicia Keys' team before the Brits, and I remember saying to my wife, 'I've made it. I've done it. I finally got my toe in'.\n\"And then, like literally two weeks later, the whole world shut down. I feel like I lost 10 years.\"\nThe Covid pandemic left Vince, like many musicians, unable to play gigs.\nUndeterred, the artist bought a coffee truck and travelled around local events.\nOne day, at a festival, by luck he ended up selling coffee to an entertainment lawyer.\nThis led Vince to finding his manager and writing his debut album, Scars, Ghosts and Glory, which explores his journey over the years, including his six years spent in severe pain.\n\"I've never been prouder of anything that I've ever done,\" he said.\nThe album is due out in the summer.\nNow, he has a team in the US and one in the UK and has just completed his first country-wide tour - something he had been waiting so long to do.\n\"I just loved every single minute of it,\" he said, adding he was \"thrilled to be back out on the road\".\nVince said: \"It's wonderful to be able to sit at the table with my kids.

    "Thirty thousand rare oysters are being reintroduced to the Firth of Forth having been wiped out by overfishing and pollution.\nOnce native to Scotland, it has been estimated that 30 million European flat oysters were being harvested towards the end of the 1800s.\nBut by 1957 they were declared extinct in the area.\nSo far, 14,000 oysters have been reintroduced with plans for the rest to be added by the end of the year.\nThe project is part of efforts to increase biodiversity in Scottish waters.\nIt is being led by Edinburgh's Heriot-Watt University and WWF Scotland, along with other partners.\nIt has so far involved 128 people, a team of marine biologists and a skipper who have put in 500 hours of manual labour.\nThey also aim to restore four hectares of seagrass as there is a synergistic relationship between the species.\nIn 2009, a scientist from Stirling University believed she had discovered some of the oysters in the Forth.\nHowever, WWF Scotland said the information had been incorrect and there were no verified records of oysters in the Forth since 1957.\nLoch Ryan in Dumfries and Galloway has retained a population of oysters but numbers have vastly reduced everywhere since the 1800s.\nOysters are known as filter feeders and each oyster can filter about 200 litres of water per day. As they filter, they feed on different particles in the water column.\nAs well as improving water quality, oysters increase biodiversity, which means a surface for seaweeds and other animals to settle on.\nNaomi Kennon, Restoration Forth\u2019s research assistant at Heriot-Watt University, said: \"They can clean water at an incredible rate compared to some other shellfish so that means if there\u2019s something like an algal bloom, they\u2019ll eat all the algae and the water will be clearer for it.\"\nThe oysters can also feed on organic particles, which could potentially come from untreated sewage outflow into the Firth of Forth.\nMs Kennon said that although it was not clear if the oysters would have an impact on an area the size of the Firth of Forth, even a small difference would be beneficial and could improve water quality.\nShe said oysters and seagrass had \"synergistic ecosystem services\", as the oysters clear the water as they feed and allow more light to reach the seagrass.\n\"It would seem sensible to assume there is a connection there, but we don\u2019t know for sure as they are both incredibly rare,\" she said.\nOyster beds once existed along the east coast of Scotland, including the Firth of Forth and on to the River Dee.\nEdinburgh\u2019s connection to oysters are embedded in local songs and stories.\nThere are tales of the Fishwives of Newhaven and oyster wars where people ventured into each other\u2019s territories.\nEcologist Leoni Anderson is a volunteer from Project Shoreline which partnered with Restoration Forth and wanted to maintain the tradition.\nShe said: \"There are choirs now who keep those memories alive and sing the old songs and when the oyster fishermen went out, they would sing or say incantations.\n\"The fishermen believed it\u2019s good to sing to the oysters and they would catch them so there was a kind of partnership thing going on, a bit of magical stuff.\"\nThe oysters being reintroduced begin their journey at Little Loch Broom in Ullapool, where they travel more than 200 miles to Heriot-Watt University to be processed through biosecurity.\nThey are scrubbed clean by volunteers to remove any disease before moving to their news homes in the Firth of Forth.\nMs Kennon  said: \"The volunteer turnout we\u2019ve had has been absolutely incredible, whether that\u2019s been physically cleaning the oysters, sticking oysters to string or to each other.\n\"It's just been fantastic because we know these oysters will benefit communities and to see that the volunteers so encouraged by what we\u2019re doing and want to help us.\"\nMelanie McAinsh, who has helped to scrub boxes of oysters, said: \"I\u2019m a year-round outdoor swimmer, I\u2019ve been in the water all my life, and I\u2019ve had the chance to improve the water in my lifetime, so I had to jump at it. \n\"It just makes me feel really hopeful.\"\nMs Arnold added: \"We\u2019ve wiped those beds out of existence because of things like overfishing so I think in part we have a responsibility to put them back but will also benefit from the ecosystem services they provide.\"",
    "A UK ban on selling arms to Israel would only strengthen Hamas, the foreign secretary has told the BBC.\nLord Cameron said while he would not support a major ground offensive in the Gazan city of Rafah, the UK would not copy US plans to stop some arms sales.\nHe said the UK supplies just 1% of Israel's weapons and warned Israel must do more to protect civilians and allow humanitarian aid through.\nLabour's Jonathan Ashworth said he did not want UK-made arms used in Rafah.\nThis week US President Joe Biden upended part of one of the world's most significant strategic relationships by saying the US are \"not supplying the weapons \" if Israel went ahead with a planned invasion of Rafah - the southern Gazan city where about 1.4 million people have been sheltering. \nThe UN says more than 80,000 people have fled Rafah since Monday, with Israeli tanks reportedly massed close to built-up areas.\nIsrael has said it will proceed with planned operations in Rafah despite the US and other allies warning that a ground offensive could lead to mass civilian casualties and a humanitarian crisis.\nIts prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has pledged to eliminate Hamas battalions he claims are based in Rafah.\nSpeaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Lord Cameron said he would not support a full-scale offensive on Rafah until he saw Israel's \"plan to protect people\".\nBut he argued the US, which he called \"a massive state supplier of weaponry\", is in \"a totally different position\" to the UK.\nThe UK government does not directly sell arms to Israel but grants licenses to weapons companies based on legal advice. In contrast, the US uses a less restrictive government-to-government deals to sell arms.\nLord Cameron said the last time he was urged to end weapons sales to Israel, when three Britons were killed in an air strike on aid workers in Gaza, \"a few days later there was a brutal attack by Iran on Israel\".\n\"Just to simply announce today that we will change our approach on arms exports, it would make Hamas stronger and it would make a hostage deal less likely,\" he adds.\nHe said he wanted instead to focus on \"hammering away every day\" on getting humanitarian aid into Gaza.\nOn Friday, the US State Department released an investigation which found Israel may have used American-supplied weapons in breach of international humanitarian law during the war in Gaza.\nPressed on whether he agreed with the findings, Lord Cameron said Israel's \"performance is not good enough\", arguing \"Israel has not had a clean bill of health\" on allowing humanitarian aid into the country. \nBut the UK \"has a different approach\" and Lord Cameron said he was \"not really interested in message sending\" through political moves like ending weapons sales.\nLord Cameron said: \"I'm interested in what can we do to maximise the British pressure and the outcome that will help people in their lives - including getting the hostages, including British nationals, released.\"\nHe dismissed the idea of British boots on the ground in Gaza, saying it was \"a risk that we should not take\".\nIt comes after the BBC last month reported the government was considering sending British troops into Gaza to help deliver aid via a new sea route.\nLabour MP Zarah Sultana accused the government of not following its own rules by supplying weapons to Israel.\nThe government's Strategic Export Licensing Criteria prevents weapons sales \"if there is a clear risk that the items might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law\".\nMs Sultana said the scale of arms sales to Israel \"does not matter\".\n\"We are aiding and abetting what are war crimes happening on a daily basis\" she told the BBC.\nLabour's position on Gaza has shifted since the 7 October Hamas attacks, in which 252 people were kidnapped and about 1,200 killed, sparked a full-blown Israeli military operation in the area.\nSince then more than 35,000 people have been killed and 78,000 others wounded in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nLast year, 10 Labour frontbenchers quit over the party's failure to call for a ceasefire in Gaza as it instead backed a \"humanitarian pause\" to allow aid to flood into the country. \nBut in February, Labour began calling for an \"immediate ceasefire\" after the situation in Gaza \"evolved\".\nMr Ashworth, a senior member of the shadow cabinet, said he did not \"want to see British-made weapons used\" in an invasion in Rafah.\n\"A full-scale offensive into Rafah will be a catastrophe beyond description,\" he said.\nHe called on the government to publish the legal advice it has been given on arms sales to Israel.",
    "A pioneering project is making an eco-friendly concrete from crushed shells that would otherwise be set for landfill - and could help prevent flooding.\nA team at the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) have developed the sustainable concrete which is made from crushed scallop and whelk shells sourced from Fleetwood.\nBy using the shells, which would usually be discarded by fishmongers, the concrete would allow water to drain through it, and could be used for footpaths, car parks and gardens to alleviate flooding. \nIt is being tested in the garden of People's Pantry, a community food initiative, in Blackpool, which is prone to flooding.\nScallops and whelks are often removed from their shells by fishmongers before they are sold.\nUsually, these shells are then crushed and sent to landfill, but the project would give them another use.\nProf Karl Williams, who is leading the project, said: \"When it rains, the water will permeate through and then will dissipate into ground so stopping flooding and this particular garden area was very prone to flooding.\"\n\"We have to wash them and crush them and then we have to sieve them to the right size, so that they can go into the concrete.\"\nUCLan wants companies to look at using this as a way of preventing flooding and  also stop millions of tonnes of shells discarded by the seafood industry going into landfill.\nAs well as the community garden at the People's Pantry in the Bostonway area of Blackpool, extensive trials are being done at the university in test tanks.\nArts company Leftcoast designed and built the People's Pantry which has a community pantry and garden space where residents can grow their own produce.\n\"We needed a flooring that would be something which would be slip and trip proof,\" Helen Jones of Leftcoast said.\n\"We've also got waterlogging locally, or was prior to sorting out the garden now, so it needed to tick that box as well.\"\nShe said they also needed a ramp for accessibility.\n\"The fact that it also takes shells from a local fishing industry and stops it going to landfill and repurposes it fits with everything else we've been doing inside.\" \nMaggie Gregson, a Bostonway resident, said the shells had made a big difference to the community garden.\n\"It was bad before because it kept flooding - we were walking about in mud.\n\"We were doing some tests the other week and we were pouring water in... and it works.\n\"I think it's an absolutely brilliant idea.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds\u00a0and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram?

He was 22.\nOver the years, his relatives have visited his Commonwealth War grave in Stavanger's Eiganes Cemetery, and also the mountain where his glider came down.\nHis family says the renewed interest in remembering Freshman's servicemen was heart-warming, and provided new information on the operation.\nArthur \"Tom\" Thomas, 32, was navigator on Halifax B, which crashed near Helleland in Norway.\nWith his wife Joan, Flt Lt Thomas had a young family and he ran a large building firm in Woolwich before enlisting in the RAF Volunteer Reserve and then joining the RAF in 1940.\nHis family had to wait until early May 1945 to discover his fate.\nBy chance that month, Flt Lt Thomas' best friend and best man at his wedding, Lt Tony Agutter, had arrived in Stavanger on the Royal Navy ship HMS Wolsey shortly after VE Day. \nIn a Stavanger pub, Agutter asked locals if they knew of any British aircraft crashes in the surrounding area.\nTold of the one near Helleland, he took a taxi to the area and met farmers who had gone to the crash site in 1942.\nThe farmers still had some of Flt Lt Thomas' belongings including his flight jacket and his wallet. In the wallet was a photograph of Flt Lt Thomas\u2019 wife taken on a skiing holiday in the 1930s.\nAgutter was able to get a message from his ship to the Thomas' family home in Whitchurch, Herefordshire.\nFlt Lt Thomas' son Robin, who just two years old when his father died, says: \"Tony was able to tell my mother he was dead.\n\"It was better to find out that way than in a bland note from the War Office.\"\nFlt Lt Thomas' body was initially thrown into a pit on the mountain where his Halifax crashed, by order of the Germans.\nAfter WW2 he was re-buried in one of seven war graves at Helleland Church, Norway.  His wife's ashes were buried nearby after she died in March 1993.\nFlt Sgt Jim Falconer was born in Kirriemuir and raised in Edzell, and was the oldest of five brothers.\nThe 20 year-old was a flight engineer on Halifax B and died on impact when the aircraft crashed.\nHis nephew Philip Falconer says: \"My dad made sure he was remembered and talked about him regularly. \n\"All the brothers were in the forces which must have caused great heartache for their mum.\"\nPhilip has visited Skitten and Norway.\n\"I am delighted with all the current efforts to make sure their bravery is remembered,\" he says.",
    "A teenage gamer with half a million YouTube followers says social media changed his life after he was sent \u00a310,000 by world-renowned content creator MrBeast.\nTom Gardiner - known as ReniDrag on YouTube - began streaming videos of himself gaming in 2017.\nBut the 18-year-old from Aberdare, Rhondda Cynon Taf, was inspired to make it a full-time career when he was set a series of gaming challenges by MrBeast in a \"surreal\" streaming experience.\nHe now earns up to \u00a325,000 a month and has been able to treat his family to holidays, a hot tub, and buy himself a car.\nMrBeast, who has more than 250 million YouTube subscribers, is the platform\u2019s current highest earner, and famous for hosting large giveaways and competitions.\n\"I felt so lucky,\" said Tom. \"Honestly, YouTube has changed my life.\"\nTom was initially inspired by his favourite content creators, such as PewDiePie, DanTDM and DougDoug.\nHe said: \"I had so much passion for editing and making videos. Even if no-one watched it - I didn't care.\n\"It was just a hobby at that point and I was really enjoying it.\"\nThe \"incredible turning point\" came in March 2021, as he was finishing Year 11 and getting ready to start sixth form.\nHe was streaming every day, and people would watch and donate to his account.\n\"Anyone can be in your chat box, people are watching you play, and they can donate, like a tip jar,\" he explained.\n\"But MrBeast is crazy, he takes that to the extreme.\"\nThe YouTube star \"jumped into my live stream randomly\", Tom said, and initially donated \u00a3700.\n\"Minecraft is all about mining, and the challenge was to find a diamond,\" he continued.\n\"I think I had a minute against the clock.\n\"He then donated another \u00a32,000 and set me the challenge to create a portal and I was able to do that too.\"\nIn total, MrBeast gave Tom $14,000 - then about \u00a310,000. \nHe was featured as part of one of MrBeast\u2019s videos, in a series where he gave fellow gamers extravagant donations and recorded their reactions - a video which has had 70 million views.\n\"The whole thing really inspired me to knuckle down and work hard to try and become a YouTuber full-time,\" Tom said.\n\"Before then, it was pocket money, something to do on the side. MrBeast\u2019s connection didn\u2019t give me much exposure, but it gave me the boost. And it snowballed from there.\"\nTom said his most profitable month so far saw him earn about \u00a325,000, but people he knew were earning as much as \u00a3300,000 a month.\n\"I like to think I\u2019ve been responsible and put most of it away. You never know what the future holds and I could never take this for granted,\" he said.\nBut he has splashed out on an upcoming family holiday to Florida, bought himself a car, and invested in a hot tub for his family home.\n\"That was probably my biggest purchase, and something my parents were like \u2018wink wink, nudge nudge\u2019.\"\nBut with the rewards come challenges, and Tom said a big one was having to stay \"relevant\" and \"trendy\" on YouTube.\n\"Trying to stay fresh is a massive thing because you are on this YouTube treadmill,\" he said.\nGav Murphy, from Maesycwmmer, Caerphilly county, produces videos and podcasts for his own film company.\nHe said people \"underestimate the amount of work that goes on behind the scenes\" of a YouTube career, and finding a niche was important, as well as \"making something you care about\".\n\"I think the worst thing possible is to go chasing subscribers or make content that other people are doing, because you think it will do well. The audience will see through that.\"\nTom\u2019s next goal is to hit a million subscribers, as well as travel more and meet other gamers at conventions.\n\"When people ask me why you\u2019d want to watch other people play games, I always compare it to sport. Why do we watch other people play sports? It\u2019s very similar in that sense,\" he said.\nHis love for games started with just an Xbox, and he said people should not be put off by lack of equipment.\n\u201cWhen it progressed into more of a career, I bought more stuff, but you don\u2019t need an over-the-top super set-up.\n\u201cHonestly, just a computer and a microphone and the sky's the limit.\"",
    "Internet access and use is consistently associated with positive wellbeing, a new study of data from 168 countries by the Oxford Internet Institute (OII) suggests.\nIn many parts of the world, including the EU and UK, concerns about online harms have prompted new laws.\nThe OII says some of its findings are \"consistent\" with reported links between social media use and depressive symptoms among young women.\nBut it concludes the overall benefits of being online show regulators contemplating tougher laws should rely on data and not be \"guided by anecdote.\"\n\"I anticipate that this work will be in some ways seen in contrast to the kind of the current social conversation surrounding tech,\" said professor Andrew Przybylski, of Oxford University, who led the research. \n\"If we\u2019re going to make the online world safe for young people, we can\u2019t just go in guns blazing with strong beliefs and a one size fits all solution -  we really need to make sure that we\u2019re sensitive to having our minds changed by data,\" he said.\nThe study did not look specifically at social media - which is what much of the most heated debate around online safety is focussed on - but took a broader approach to assessing access to the internet. \nResearchers analysed data gathered between 2006 and 2021 from two million individuals aged 15 to 99 worldwide, including from countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa\nThey found that people who had internet access or actively used the internet reported greater levels of life satisfaction and social wellbeing.\nStatistician professor Kevin McConway said it was very \"broad brush\" research, but useful nonetheless. \n\"It\u2019s a starting point, and if nothing else it casts very serious doubt on the view, held by some people, that the Internet is bad for us all,\" he wrote.\nThe researchers studied eight indicators of wellbeing including life satisfaction, daily negative and positive experiences and community wellbeing.\nThey looked at a \"multiverse\" of nearly 34,000 different statistical models and subsets of data.\nIn 85% of cases these showed associations between internet connectivity and wellbeing that were positive and statistically significant.\nBut 5% of associations linking internet use and community wellbeing were negative, with most of those observed among young women aged 15 to 24.\nWhile this does not prove that internet access causes them unhappiness, the paper notes that it is \"consistent with previous reports of increased cyberbullying and more negative associations between social media use and depressive symptoms among young women\".\nDr Ruth Plackett, Senior Research Fellow at University College London, said it was important to understand the limitations in what the research could reveal - for example the fact it looked at the \"average\" person about in a given country.\n\"For instance it doesn't isolate social media use\", she told the BBC.\n\"We do know young people can be exposed to harmful content on these platforms which may give more negative associations with internet use\".\nHowever, she told the BBC she welcomed calls for a more nuanced discussion about the use of the internet.\nSimone Vibert, head of policy and research at Internet Matters, which offers online safety advice, said their research similarly showed that being online came with many benefits but there were also negatives.\n\"There is a clear need for an evidence-based approach, making evidence such as this and further research vital.\"\nThe researchers also acknowledge the study has limits, notably not being able to prove cause and effect. \nFor example, the authors could not entirely discount the possibility that increases in incomes, which were also linked to rises in internet access, were behind people feeling better.\nBut it had clear lessons for policy makers looking at increasing protections for young people online, Prof Przybylski said.\nHe pointed to a lack of peer-reviewed studies on the subject, and the fact the majority of the research that had been carried out focussed on English-speaking, wealthier nations.\n\u201cWe really do want the best for our kids,\" he explained, but said that meant following the data.\n\"If our policy and if our resources are guided by anecdote we\u2019re going to be letting a lot of families down\u201d.\nPrevious OII work carried out by Prof Przybylski found there was no evidence that the global spread of Facebook was linked to widespread psychological harm.\nLike Prof Przybylsk's earlier research, this work, carried out with co-author Professor Matti Vuorre, is based on information from the Gallup World Poll, a survey of millions of people around the world.\nThe study will be published in the peer-reviewed journal Technology, Mind and Behavior.

    "Two professional skydivers have completed the first wingsuit flight through Tower Bridge, saying it was a \"dream come true\".\nRed Bull skydivers Marco F\u00fcrst, 33, and Marco Waltenspiel, 39, leapt from a helicopter hovering at 3,000ft (914m) above London on Sunday morning.\nDuring the flight the pair went through Tower Bridge, reaching speeds of up to 153mph (246km/h), and completed a complex manoeuvre known as a \"flare\".\nThe bridge was closed for the jump.\nWingsuit flying allows jumpers to glide horizontally at high speeds before landing on the ground using a parachute.\nThe Austrian skydivers' flight lasted 45 seconds, with them diving down to 115ft (35m) above the River Thames, before soaring up through the air and releasing their parachutes.\nMr F\u00fcrst said the journey was \"intense from the beginning\", adding the experience was \"incredible, a dream come true for sure\".\nMr Waltenspiel added when they flew into London, \"the sunrise was amazing, the city looked so good\".\nThe pair, who are members of the Red Bull Skydive Team, have completed more than 22,000 jumps between them, including in Croatia's heart-shaped island of Galesnjak and at a downhill ski run in Kitzbuhel, Austria. known as The Streif.\nTo prepare for their challenge, they completed more than 200 practice jumps and trained at a ground in Oxfordshire, which featured two cranes to simulate the dimensions of Tower Bridge.\nThe day before the jump, Mr F\u00fcrst said he felt nervous excitement and found it hard to sleep, getting just \"four to five hours\", but added: \"Once we were in the helicopter, we prepared everything and we both knew, 'OK, now it's time to shine, right', and everything was calm.\"\n\"I just feel amazing. The jump was beautiful and everything worked out really good,\" he said.\n\"I really enjoyed the journey.\"\nMr Waltenspiel added: \"We are super happy, super stoked, everything went well and everyone is happy.\"\nMr F\u00fcrst explained the \"pure freedom\" of skydiving is what appeals to him, \"because if you jump out of a helicopter, you can basically do what you want - you can fly to the left, to the right, up, down\".\nA spokesperson for Red Bull said Tower Bridge was closed specifically for the jump, adding: \"Red Bull worked closely with all the relevant authorities, had all authorisations in place for this world first and ensured that the jump was carried out to the highest safety standards.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The Foreign Office is investigating a claim by Hamas that a British-Israeli hostage has died in Gaza.\nHamas, proscribed as a terrorist group by the UK government, claims Nadav Popplewell died of wounds sustained in an Israeli airstrike more than a month ago. \nMr Popplewell, 51, was seized with his mother Channah Peri on 7 October when fighters crossed the border fence and launched deadly attacks in Israel.\nThe Israeli military is yet to comment.\nA Foreign Office spokesperson said it was urgently seeking more information on the matter.\nIt added that the department's thoughts \"are with his family at this extremely distressing time.\"\nIn a brief statement via the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the family of Mr Popplewell asked media organisations not to publish footage of him released by Hamas on Saturday, which shows him in captivity with a black eye.\nSpeaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday morning, Foreign Secretary David Cameron confirmed that he had seen the video, but gave no further updates on the investigations.\n\"We don't want to say anything until we have better information,\" Lord Cameron said.\nHe described Hamas as \"callous\", to release the video and \"play with the family's emotions in that way\".\nMr Popplewell's sister Ayelet Svatitzky told the BBC last October how gunmen had attacked the kibbutz in southern Israel where they lived, killing her older brother Roi.\nOn the day of the attack, Ms Svatitzky said she received two pictures, sent by the attackers from her mother's phone, showing the pair sitting in her mother's living room. Underneath was written \"Hamas\" in English.\nHours later, a third picture was posted on her mother's Facebook showing them with an armed Hamas gunman in the corner.\nMs Svatitzky's mother was released last November during a temporary ceasefire agreed between Hamas and Israel.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities.\nMore than 34,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nIsrael says 128 hostages are unaccounted for.",
    "The Socialists of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez have won Catalonia's regional election as pro-independence parties lost ground.\nThe Catalan Socialist Party (PSC), under former Spanish health minister Salvador Illa, made substantial gains to emerge as the clear winner.\nWith 99% of votes counted, it has secured 42 seats.\nSupport for independence has dropped to 42%, from 49% in 2017, says the Catalan government's statistics institute. \nIn the campaign ahead of this election, the issue of Catalonia's relationship with the rest of Spain was pushed into the background by other challenges, such as the region's drought and housing crisis.\nThe hardline Together for Catalonia (JxCat) party of the former regional president Carles Puigdemont was second, with 35 seats, recovering its status as the primary pro-independence force in the region ahead of the Catalan Republican Left (ERC). \nBut overall, nationalist parties lost support, meaning they no longer control the regional parliament, in a blow for the independence movement.\nEven so, pro-independence parties have wrung substantial concessions from the central government in recent years and continue to demand a referendum on independence.\nThe minority ERC government of Pere Aragon\u00e8s called the snap election after failing to gather enough support to pass the region's annual budget.\nMr S\u00e1nchez will see this result as vindication of his policies in Catalonia - in particular, a controversial amnesty law benefiting nationalists who face legal action for separatist activity. \nThe amnesty, which is concluding its passage through the Spanish parliament, has drawn a fierce backlash from opponents on the right.\nMr Illa hailed the result as \"a new era for Catalonia\". He said that among the factors which had secured the result \"were the policies implemented by the Spanish government and its prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, to whom I send my acknowledgement and thanks\".\nThe amnesty law was a condition of the parliamentary support that JxCat and ERC gave to Mr S\u00e1nchez in his investiture, allowing him to form a new central government last November. \nMr Puigdemont, who fled abroad in 2017 after leading a failed secession bid, is expected to benefit from the amnesty and return to Spain. He campaigned ahead of this election from the south of France.\nDespite the Socialist win, it will not be easy for Mr Illa to form a government, given that he is likely to need the support of ERC and the far-left Comuns Sumar alliance.\nMr Puigdemont called for ERC not to be part of a coalition that included the unionist PSC. Instead, he suggested the two main pro-independence parties should try to form an administration, as they had done in the past before their relationship broke down.\n\"If ERC is willing to rebuild bridges, so are we,\" Mr Puigdemont said.\nHowever, the fragmented nature of the Catalan parliament, which is split by unionist-separatist allegiances as well as a left-right division, is likely to make post-election negotiations lengthy. If a new administration is not formed, there will be a repeat election.\nThe conservative People's Party (PP) made substantial gains to become the fourth party in Catalonia, followed by the far-right Vox. By contrast, the self-styled centrists of Ciudadanos lost their representation in the parliament, just seven years after becoming the region's primary force.\nMeanwhile, a new far-right party, Catalan Alliance, won two seats on the back of its uncompromising platform based on separatism and anti-immigrant policies.",
    "Roadworks on the M25 in Surrey are \"progressing well\" as the motorway remains shut in both directions between junctions nine and 10, National Highways has said.\nThe planned closure from the A243 Leatherhead to the A3 Wisley started at 21:00 BST on Friday and will be in place until 06:00 on Monday.\nOn Sunday, National Highways said on X, formerly Twitter, \"work is progressing well\" but urged drivers to follow official diversion routes.\nAt about 13:30 BST, Surrey Highways said there were major delays in West Byfleet along the Parvis Road.\nIt said there was also congestion in Leatherhead, Oxshott and surrounding areas, including Weybridge, Cobham and Walton On Thames.\nThe road is shut so a new bridge consisting of 68 beams, each weighing 16 tonnes, and a further four beams weighing 40 tonnes can be installed.\nNational Highways said on Saturday it was \"all looking good\" on the first full day of the weekend closure.\nIt said good progress had been made, with a number of beams that will form the new bridge having been lifted into place.\nFour diversion routes are in place between Gatwick and Heathrow. Two in either direction for regular traffic and two for over-height vehicles.\nNational Highways had told drivers earlier to \"continue to come to Surrey\" as the impact of the M25 closure was expected to be \"fairly limited to certain areas\".\nSurrey County Council said the diversion and roads around the closure had been busy on Saturday.\nDiversion routes take cars on a 19-mile journey on A roads, crossing from Surrey into London's Ulez area, but National Highways has assured drivers \"no enforcement action will be taken\".\nHowever, it warned people they could receive penalty charges under Ulez rules if they stray off official diversion routes over the weekend.\nThe highways agency said it had seen an increasing number of motorists on Saturday choosing to ignore the diversion route - starting at junction eight - and instead continuing on the motorway to the next junction.\nThe M25 works are part of a project to improve safety and reduce pollution.\nA five-mile (8km) stretch of the M25 was shut in March between junctions 10 and 11 - it was the first time there had been a scheduled daytime shutdown of all lanes since the motorway opened in 1986.\nThe improvement scheme, which is part of a \u00a3317m upgrade to the motorway, will see an increase in the number of lanes to attempt to make journeys safer and a new junction layout to improve traffic flow.\nThree more closures are planned before the end of 2024, with the next one organised for August.\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, and on X.

    "Georgian opposition leaders have called on the UK to do more to oppose what they say is a crackdown on civil society in the former Soviet country.\nThey urged the foreign secretary to show the governing party that the international community was united against the proposals.\nThe Transparency of Foreign Influence Bill is expected to pass its final parliamentary hurdles in coming days. \nOpponents have staged mass protests in the capital Tbilisi against the law.\nThe legislation would force non-governmental groups and media to register as \"organisations serving the interest of a foreign power\" if more than 20% of their funding comes from overseas. \nThe governing Georgian Dream party says the measure would increase transparency and defend Georgia's sovereignty.\nBut opponents say it will be used by the government to crush opposition voices and parties ahead of a general election in October. \nThey say it is also designed to disrupt Georgia's ambition to join the European Union, which could not accept the new law. \nThe legislation has been dubbed \"the Russian law\" because it is similar legislation used by the Kremlin to silence its own critics. \nThe proposal has brought tens of thousands of people out onto the streets in the small country on the eastern coast of the Black Sea. \nThe US has been vocal in attacking the bill, with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan writing on X at the weekend that the US was \"deeply alarmed about democratic backsliding in Georgia\". \nHe said MPs had to choose between \"the Georgian people's Euro-Atlantic aspirations or pass a Kremlin-style foreign agents' law that runs counter to democratic values... we stand with the Georgian people\".\nIn contrast, the UK has been more discreet in expressing its opposition. \nIn a written parliamentary answer published quietly last week, the Minister for Europe, Nusrat Ghani, said the UK's ambassador in Tbilisi had \"consistently voiced our concerns about the proposed law\" in recent meetings with the prime minister and president. \nShe said she had discussed the issue herself with the Georgian ambassador in London last month. \nHer only other public remarks came 10 days ago, in a post on social media warning against \"excessive use of force by police against peaceful protestors in Tbilisi\", which she said was \"not in line with democratic values and risks Georgia's Euro-Atlantic aspirations\".\nBut Georgian opposition MPs want Ms Ghani and Foreign Secretary David Cameron to go much further.  \nGiorgi Vashadze, an MP and leader of the Strategy Builder party, said: \"Lord Cameron was one of the leading international supporters of Georgia when we were invaded in 2008. \n\"We were thankful for his support, which did so much to raise the country's spirits. \n\"As foreign secretary, I ask him to please do the same to highlight the government's attempts to clamp down on opposition during an election year.\" \nTina Bokuchava, Georgian MP and parliamentary leader of the United National Movement, said: \"These written answers show that the UK government has been privately concerned about the situation in Georgia. \n\"We now need these concerns to be made public, so that the ruling party understands that the international community is united in opposition to such authoritarian actions.\"\nA spokesperson for the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office told the BBC the UK is \"gravely concerned\" about the foreign influence bill.\n\"The accompanying rhetoric and excessive force used by police against protesters are deeply concerning,\" they said. \n\"We urge the Georgian authorities to show restraint in policing peaceful demonstrations.\"\n\"The UK continues to engage with the Georgian government and civil society groups in Tbilisi, and our ambassador has consistently made our concerns about the proposed law known to the Georgian government, most recently to the prime minister on 22 April.\"",
    "Internet users in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda have been complaining about poor connectivity as service providers across East Africa acknowledge there has been a problem.\nThey have said they are working to fix it.\nThe patchy service was a result of faults in the under-sea cables that connect the region to the rest of the world through South Africa, industry expert Ben Roberts  told the BBC. \nA similar outage was experienced in parts of West and Southern Africa in March.\nOn Monday, some East Africans were still experiencing slow internet speeds with some telecom providers indicating that the issue was yet to be fully resolved and asking subscribers to be patient.\n\u201cWe are still working with undersea fibre cable team to have them resolve the issue,\u201d Airtel Kenya responded to a Kenyan user concerned about the problem. \nVodacom Tanzania  sent a similar message on social media to such queries.\nCloudflare Radar, which monitors internet connectivity, on Sunday said that Tanzania was one of the worst-affected countries with traffic falling to 30% of expected levels. \nTanzania's Citizen newspaper described what has happened as an \"internet blackout [that] has affected major network channels\".\nOn X, formerly known as Twitter, service providers have been fielding queries from frustrated customers.\nIn response to one Kenyan user who wanted to know if they would be able to watch Sunday's Manchester United versus Arsenal English Premier League match, Airtel Kenya said its team was working on the \"network issue\" and apologised.\nSafaricom, also in Kenya, said it was \"experiencing a challenge\".\nAirtel Ugandan has said it was aware of the \"intermittent internet service\".  And MTN Rwanda said there was \"an issue of degradation of international links\".\nMalawi, Mozambique and Madagascar have also been affected according to Cloudflare Radar.\nMr Roberts, from the pan-Africa company Liquid Intelligent Technologies, said that he had confirmed that one cable that runs alongside the coast of East Africa, known as Eassy, had been cut earlier on Sunday some 45km (28 miles) north of the South African port city of Durban.\nAnother cable was also cut. He ruled out the idea that it could be sabotage and said it was rather an unhappy coincidence.\nOther cables linking East Africa to Europe are also available and gradually the service should improve as data is re-routed. But as a lot of big companies have data centres in South Africa the damage to the vital link that Eassy provides had a big impact.\nIn March, widespread outages were reported in countries including South Africa, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Benin, Ghana and Burkina Faso.\nThis was also put down to cable failures. The cause was not clear but led to the  frustration of millions of customers around the continent.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",
    "At the end of the play-offs, one team will walk away being the first to have won the inaugural Walter Cup championship trophy - but for the Professional Women's Hockey League, their inaugural season was already a victory.\nBy the time the buzzer rang at Montreal's Bell Centre, sports history had been made: a record 21,105 people had attended a professional women's ice hockey game. \nThe April game - between Montreal and Toronto - marked the crowning achievement of the six-team Professional Women's Hockey League's (PWHL) inaugural season. \nThe initial success of the league, which spans both the US and Canada, comes as interest in women's sports soars - and after previous attempts to establish a professional women's league sputtered and ultimately failed, due to low attendance and financial woes. \nIn total, nearly 393,000 fans attended the league's regular season games at venues in Boston, New York, Minnesota, Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa. \n\"This season has been a series of firsts, with a number of records broken,\" Jayna Hefford, the league's senior VP of hockey operations, told the BBC. \"We continue to be excited and surprised.\" \nMs Hefford, a Hall of Fame former professional player and five-time Olympian, credited the league's initial success, in part, to a dedicated and diverse fanbase that in many cases were often not previously exposed to women's hockey. \n\"It's a welcoming environment,\" she said. \"We're also finding an older generation of women that never had this opportunity to do something like this and are now becoming big fans of the league.\" \nAmong those who say they have discovered a new-found love of hockey through the PWHL is Treena Grevatt, a native of Gloucestershire in England who emigrated to Canada in 2000. \nSpeaking to the BBC from her home in Ottawa, Ms Grevatt said that hockey and the men's National Hockey League, or NHL, \"never really resonated with her\". \n\"I'd go to be social, if I got a free ticket,\" she said. \nThat all changed, she recalls, when a friend told her that a PWHL team was headed to Canada's capital. \n\"I want to support pro women's sports... this is really the first opportunity I had to put my money where my mouth is,\" she said. \nChoking back tears, Ms Grevatt said that her first game was \"ridiculously emotional\" and that she felt moved by her peers in the audience, who ranged from former athletes to young children, boys and girls alike.\n\"There were a lot of former women athletes who never had this chance, and there were little kids holding signs like 'thank you for giving me something to dream for',\" she added. \"The atmosphere was phenomenal. It's hard to keep your composure, I'd put it that way.\" \nUnlike previous attempts at establishing a professional women's league, the PWHL enjoys considerable financial backing, with the league and all six teams owned by the Mark Walter Group, headed by the billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers and part owner of Chelsea Football Club. \nThe league is also backed by tennis icon and activist Billie Jean King and has enjoyed statements of support from US lawmakers.\nUnlike previous women's hockey leagues - in which players sometimes had to take second jobs to compensate for low salaries - an agreement between the PWHL and its union means that players receive wages of between $35,000 (\u00a328,000) and $80,000, excluding bonuses. The figure will go up 3% annually for the duration of the eight-year agreement. \nWhile the figures, and the league's salary cap of $1.26m, are low compared to the multi-million dollar contracts frequent in the NHL, they have proven a notable draw for fans of the league who feel strongly about equality in the game.\n\"It sends a signal to the rest of the hockey community,\" said Heidi Van Regan, a Montreal-based PWHL season ticket holder. \"It's breaking the glass ceiling. It's not just players either - it's also women who want to be broadcasters, or have a blog, or podcast to talk about hockey all day.\" \n\"Of course, we're not at equality yet,\" Ms Van Regan added. \"But when you're at games and watching the broadcast, you see that there's a big effort to get women in many different roles. Players are sort of leading the way.\" \nThe league, however, is not without its challenges. \nIn some markets - particularly Boston and New York in the US - the PWHL has met a more muted response and must compete with a range of other professional teams in crowded markets. \n\"It's either going to grow or it's going to flop,\" said Jim DeLise, a lifelong hockey fan from New York. \nUsing New York as an example, Mr DeLise said that the league \"has got to work a little bit more\" to attract attention in some sports markets. \n\"They [the PWHL] didn't get the proper exposure that they needed at the beginning. Nobody even really knew there was a team in New York. I think they dropped the ball with that,\" he said. \"Where's the advertisement? I don't see any.\" \nFor now, the league is rapidly approaching the end of its inaugural season, with the start o",
    "Russia is blaming a Ukrainian strike after an entire section of an apartment building collapsed following an explosion in Belgorod. \nCCTV from the scene shows a large blast near the base of the 10-storey block and then the building falling in. \nThe regional governor said two bodies had been pulled from the rubble. At least 19 people have been injured.\nThe Russian city is near the border with Kharkiv in Ukraine, where Moscow's troops launched an offensive on Friday.\nThe Belgorod region has often been targeted by Ukrainian forces since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but previously Ukrainian officials have said cross-border strikes do not target civilians.\nThe regional governor of Belgorod, Vyacheslav Gladkov, accused Ukraine of bombarding the region, describing the cause of the explosion as a Ukrainian shell.\nKyiv has cast doubt on that account, with one official suggesting it may have been a guided bomb dropped by a Russian plane, intended for Ukraine, but whose glide wings hadn't opened. \nPictures from the scene show rescuers removing debris by hand in a search for survivors. Surrounding apartments have been evacuated due to fears of the main building collapsing further. \nMr Gladkov added that people are believed to be trapped in the rubble.\nOne resident told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti her husband was in their bedroom in the building when the blast went off and was injured in the head and face. \"He did not have the time\" to escape, she said.\nA spokesperson for the Russian Investigative Committee said a criminal case has been launched.\nThe incident comes as \"intense battles\" continue just across the border in north-eastern Ukraine, where Russian forces have made incursions into the Kharkiv region.\nIn his evening address on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Russian offensive has displaced thousands. \n\"The idea behind the attacks in the Kharkiv region is to stretch our forces and undermine the morale and motivation of the Ukrainians' ability to defend themselves,\" he added.\nThe defence ministry in Moscow claims its forces have captured a number of villages there, while Kyiv says it has been carrying out counter-attacks.",

    "Natalie Elphicke, the new Labour MP for Dover, has been accused of lobbying ministers over her then-husband Charlie's sexual assault case.\nMs Elphicke is accused of asking Sir Robert Buckland, the then justice secretary, to help move the date of the case, apparently to avoid publicity.\nA spokesman for Ms Elphicke, who defected from the Conservatives last week, said the claims were \"nonsense\". \nLabour questioned why they were not raised earlier.\nSir Robert told the Sunday Times: \"She was told in no uncertain terms that it would have been completely inappropriate to speak to the judge about the trial at all.\"\nThe BBC has confirmed Sir Robert's account with him. \nLabour MP Jonathan Ashworth questioned the timing of the accusations on the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme.\n\"I don't understand why the Lord Chancellor at the time did not raise this and why he's raised it now,\" Mr Ashworth said.\nForeign Secretary Lord Cameron was also asked about Ms Elphicke on the programme.\nHe said he had not examined the story closely, but was of the opinion that the fact that Labour welcomed in a person with little affiliation for the party spoke volumes about party.\n\"All I know is that Natalie Elphicke's defection said a little bit about Natalie Elphicke, but I think it said rather a lot more about the Labour Party,\" he said.\nCharlie Elphicke's trial was due to be one of the first cases after Covid restrictions were lifted in courts which, potentially, could have meant a greater focus on the case. \nHe was jailed in 2020 at Southwark Crown Court for two years for sexually assaulting two women.\nMs Elphicke replaced her ex-husband as MP for Dover after he was charged, and announced that their marriage was ending after he was convicted.\nMs Elphicke and four other Conservative MPs were also found to have breached parliament's code of conduct by attempting to influence legal proceedings.\nThey had written to senior members of the judiciary raising concerns that a more junior judge was considering publishing character references provided for Ms Elphicke's husband.\nAt the time, Labour's shadow leader of the Commons, Thangam Debbonaire, said the incident showed the Conservatives \"think it is one rule for them and another for everyone else\".\nMs Elphicke surprised Westminster last week when she defected from the Conservatives to Labour.\nShe had been seen as being on the right of the Conservative Party - and her being welcomed into Labour has been criticised by some.\nLabour MP Zarah Sultana told Laura Kuenssberg's show that she had questions about Ms Elphicke's defection.\n\"Unless she has had the biggest Damascene conversion ever, I just don't buy it,\" Ms Sultana said.\nMs Elphicke apologised on Thursday after an interview re-emerged, in which she said her ex-husband was \"an easy target\" for false allegations because he was \"attractive\". \nResponding to the latest allegations, a spokesman for Natalie Elphicke said: \"This is nonsense. It's certainly true that Mr Elphicke continued to be supported after his imprisonment by a large number of Conservative MPs who had known him for a long time, including some who visited him and independently lobbied on his behalf, which was nothing to do with Natalie.\"\nA Labour Party spokesman had said: \"Natalie Elphicke totally rejects that characterisation of the meeting. \n\"If Robert Buckland had any genuine concerns about the meeting, then he should have raised them at the time, rather than making claims to the newspapers now Natalie has chosen to join the Labour Party.\"",
    "Residents living near an illegal waste site on the Isle of Sheppey coast say it will take many years to clean up the rubbish-strewn beaches.\nThey say dumped waste, ranging from tyres and shredded fabrics to asbestos and different types of plastics, has washed around the coast \u201clike a giant soup\u201d from the site known locally as Eastchurch Gap.\nA court order was issued last year banning anyone from entering or tipping waste in the area, but large quantities of waste had already built up on the cliff base, with weeds and grass now beginning to grow over much of it.\nThe Environment Agency said it was determined to stop such \u201corganised criminality\u201d.\nBelinda Lamb, from Medway Swale Estuary partnership, which organises monthly beach cleans, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of shredded carpet, material, fake grass, fake Christmas trees, work wear, hard plastics, very industrial stuff. It\u2019s all been dumped off the cliffs in recent years and it all comes in on the big tides.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be continuous beach cleans that will do it because so much has come off the cliffs into the sea. It\u2019s all just floating out there like a giant soup. So it\u2019s just going to be a continuous job for many, many years.\u201d\nThe local MP Gordon Henderson said tipping began in 2020 after a series of cliff collapses due to erosion caused a family home to slide down the cliff-face.\nHe said: \u201cAt one time, people living in Warden Road were seeing up to 50 lorries a day going up and 50 lorries a day going down. It wasn\u2019t all about tipping rubbish off a cliff, it was the destruction of the local environment.\u201d\nSwale Borough Council said it was part of a multi-agency group working on the issue.\nIt said it \"took advice from a range of agencies, and it was determined the best course of action was to leave the tipped material where it is, due to the complexity of the coastal erosion in the area\u201d.\nA council spokesperson added: \u201cWe appreciate the efforts that the local community are making.\"\nIt comes as investigations continue into other illegal waste sites elsewhere in Kent.\nThe Environment Agency said it was compiling a file for prosecutors over a long-running site at Borstal near Rochester.\nMeanwhile, a site at Hoads Wood, near Ashford, has also been closed, and last month another large site came to light at Iwade, near Sittingbourne.\nThe Environment Agency said: \u201cWaste crime spoils the natural environment, and we are aware of the impact this organised criminality has on communities and people\u2019s enjoyment of their environment.\n\u201cWe are steadfast in our fight against waste criminals.

    "\nA number of the front pages feature Rishi Sunak's speech, due to take place on Monday. The Daily Telegraph focuses on the prime minister's claim that - as the world enters one of its most dangerous eras - Britain would be safer under the Conservatives than under Labour over the next Parliament. The paper says Mr Sunak will highlight \"dividing lines\" between the two parties, including what he sees as Labour's \"failure\" to match his commitment to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by the end of the decade. \n\nThe Times concentrates on Mr Sunak's warning about autocratic states. He is expected to say collusion between China, Russia, North Korea and Iran poses the most dangerous threat since the end of the Cold War - and the West must face up to these adversaries. \nThe Daily Mail says it will be a \"landmark\" speech, highlighting the challenges of AI, migration and \"authoritarian states\".\nThe Guardian carries a warning from England's former chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, that Covid-19 will \"look minor\" compared with increasingly drug-resistant superbugs. Dame Sally - who is now the UK's special envoy on antimicrobial resistance - says the issue is more \"acute\" than climate change. It would be a \"disastrous picture,\" she says, if the world fails to tackle the problem. The paper says drug resistant infections already kill at least 1.2 million people a year.\n\nThe main story in the Times is a new study of workers across Europe which shows that people take more sick days the heavier they are. The research - carried out by academics in Austria - looked at data from more than 122,000 people across 26 European countries. It found that those who were obese were twice as likely to take time off than people who were a healthy weight. \n\nThe paper argues that with 2.8 million people signed off work in the UK, absenteeism among people who are overweight is fuelling a \"worklessness crisis\" in Britain which is stifling economic growth. The government has announced measures to encourage people back to work.\n\nAccording to the Guardian, Sir Keir Starmer is under pressure from the Trades Union Congress (TUC) over Natalie Elphicke's defection from the Conservatives. The union's president Matt Wrack is reported to have written to the Labour leader at the weekend, saying Ms Elphicke's support for anti-strike laws - seen as recently as March - should be \"incompatible\" with the party whip.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph says it understands that the Lib Dems have been reported to the equalities watchdog for allegedly deselecting a candidate because of his Christian faith. David Campanale, an Anglican former BBC journalist, is set to be replaced as the prospective MP candidate for Sutton and Cheam after allegations he did not sufficiently disclose his faith during the selection process - a claim which he denies. A Lib Dem spokesman said the party was home to people of all faiths, and none.\n\nAnd the i cites new data revealing that more than a million people have taken out mortgages in the past three years, which will \"last into their late 60s\". A former pensions minister tells the paper borrowers are at risk of poverty in old age.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "Increasing the number of Senedd members is a \"full stop\" that will future proof Welsh devolution for the next 100 years, according to its presiding officer.\nMembers of the Senedd (MSs) voted last week to increase their numbers from 60 to 96 from the next Welsh election, in 2026.\nElin Jones said the reforms which were backed by a cross-party majority of MSs but opposed by the Conservatives, made the Senedd a \"fit for purpose\" parliament, even if Wales were to become independent.\nSpeaking to the BBC Walescast podcast, Ms Jones said the vote, which coincided with the 25th anniversary of the first elections to Cardiff Bay, was \"hugely significant - and a long time in coming\".\n\"It rectifies, probably, the wrong of 1999, where we were too few members in that very first assembly.\n\"We should have had a higher number of members then so we've had to wait and develop the argument and rectify that wrong.\n\"And now, finally, in the same week as we celebrate our 25 years of existence as a parliament, we are also taking the next step to make this a fit for purpose parliament for the next 25 years - I'd even say the next 100 years.\"\nShe added: \"I don't think that there will need to be a significant change to the numbers of people elected to this parliament.\n\"Even if the parliament becomes a parliament of an independent Wales or a parliament with far greater powers that today.\"\nSpeaking ahead of the expected return of a Senedd politician suspended after complaints about his behaviour, Ms Jones said the case had prompted reflection on whether the system was working properly or needed to be changed.\nRhys ab Owen was banned from the Senedd for six weeks in March after an investigation found he inappropriately touched and swore at two women while drunk on a night out in June 2021.\nIn a statement at the time, Mr ab Owen said his behaviour was \"not up to the standard the public expects of a member of the Senedd, and for that I apologise unreservedly\".\nThe case led former Plaid Cymru MS Nerys Evans - who in 2023 led a review which found a \"culture of harassment, bullying and misogyny\" within Plaid which eventually led to the resignation of leader Adam Price - to claim that victims did not feel confident raising issues through the Senedd's complaints system. \nIn response, Ms Jones told Walescast the complaint against Mr ab Owen had been taken seriously but that it was \"a proper question to ask\" whether the system could be improved.\n\"The Senedd has dealt with that.\n\"Whether it dealt with it as quickly, as appropriately as it should have, is something now that our standards committee has to reflect on,\" she said.\n\"I'm not saying that everything is perfect.\n\"I think we need to think about how we've had experience of looking at this in the past and whether we need to make any changes.\n\"And we're perfectly open to doing that and doing things better.\"",
    "Hundreds of people have turned out to welcome home Wales\u2019 first female world champion boxer, Lauren Price.\nThe street outside her grandmother's home in Ystrad Mynach, Caerphilly county, was packed with friends and well-wishers.\nPrice became this country's 14th world champion in front of a large crowd at Cardiff's Utilita Arena on Saturday night.\nShe said she wanted to \"keep on creating a legacy for Wales\".\nAnd, as excitement and pride reached fever pitch, Price's nan Linda Jones said she was \"over the moon\" about the win.\n\"I think she deserves every minute of her glory,\" she added.\nLinda,  who brought up the fighter alongside late husband Derek, prepared the new champion a Sunday dinner - with pigs in blankets on the menu as per Price's request.\nWaiting out on the street was Ffion Perry, who had been at the fight.\n\"The atmosphere was absolutely incredible,\" she said. \n\n\"I've known Lauren since she was little, we used to kickbox together. \n\"There was no doubt in my mind she would hit it out of the park,\" she added.\nJess Jenkins, who watched with friends from home, added:  \"She really showed us Welsh people how to do it. \n\"It was a very, very good fight and we're all really proud of her.\"\nPrice said she was \"overwhelmed\" at the turn out.\n\"I'll be honest I didn't think I would get a crowd like this today. \n\"But they've blown me out the park once again - there's nothing quite like Welsh fans.\"\nNo stranger to success, by the age of 12 Price was already a kickboxing champion, has won international football caps for Wales and won gold in boxing at the previous Olympics in Tokyo. \nNevertheless, she described her fight against the USA's Jessica McCaskill as \"one of the best nights of my career\".\nWalking out to Dafydd Iwan's Yma O Hyd, she said the atmosphere had been electric.\n\"I thought coming out to that, with Welsh fans singing along, would be insane and it certainly lived up to my expectations,\" she said.\nRegarding what comes next, Lauren said: \"I believe I've got many more big fights to come. \n\"Welsh boxing is only  just getting started and I'm excited for the future.\"",
    "When Emma Marshall's children urged her to jump into a cold river on a hot spring day in 2020, her first instinct was a resounding no.\n\"My friends, my family will all tell you, 'Emma hates cold water'. I'd do anything to avoid it,\" she says.\nSo how is it the Bangor University head of development and alumni relations has gone from cold water-phobic to an author of a book about wild swims? \nThat day, in the beautiful environs of her native Eryri, or Snowdonia, she had a road to Damascus moment.\nOn their daily lockdown walk to the Afon (River) Ogwen near her home in Bethesda, Gwynedd, \"my kids forced me to go in basically\", she laughs.\nAnd far from hating it, she says: \"As soon as I got in, I thought, 'oh my god, this is amazing'. I just got hooked straight away.\n\"The Afon Ogwen is beautiful and it changes throughout its course, but near us it's very wooded, and quite wide and rocky, and it's just divine.\n\"It was a very good place to start.  You couldn't help but love that. Snowdonia, Eryri, it is a paradise for wild swimming.\"\nEmma was already a keen runner and hiker, and as a consequence knew many routes around Eryri already. But now the focus of her outings changed to incorporate a mountainside dip wherever she went.\n\"I would think about all those places I could remember from my walks and just started doing walks or runs into the mountainside to get to those places,\" she explains.\nAlthough she is happy to swim anywhere, her favourite type of dip is one that involves a waterfall.\n\"Hands down, always waterfall pools,\" she says. \n\"I think they're just so exciting.\"\nThere is \"a little bit of science\" behind the attraction too, she says. \nEmma added: \"It's something to do with running, crashing water. Apparently there are negative ions created by that but that is a good thing.\n\"It's why you get that feelgood factor. It's that sharpening of the brain as a result of that rushing water.\n\"I think that might be why I love waterfalls so much, but also, they're just so pretty.\"\nDespite her commitment to year round immersion, Emma does not think of herself as a stereotypically good swimmer, and has plenty of safety tips in the book.\n\"I never stay in long. I'm not really a strong swimmer. I'm a good dipper,\" she explains. \n\"But in the winter particularly it is sometimes a case of dunking and coming straight out again.\n\"It still gives you that dopamine hit. It's a good drug to have.\"\nAnd as her joy in taking a dip increased over time, the idea of sharing some of her knowledge began to form. \nBut she was conscious she also wanted to protect the environment she loved.\n\"I love doing it so much, you know, and I post a lot of pictures on Instagram of my swims and my walks,\" Emma adds. \n\"I never actually say where they are though because I think that sort of responsibility you have - it's too easy on Instagram for people just to go 'right I'm going there', no research.\"\nBut even spots Emma considered to be well-known attracted curiosity and it occurred to her to see if there was a wild swimming walks book available.\nWhen she saw there were some covering other parts of the country but not Eryri, she started to think she might just be the person to fill the gap.\nShe added: \"This book is going to be written by somebody else if I don't do it, and I know I can do it properly.\n\"I can do it in a way which talks about the importance of how you treat your environment, and choosing the places carefully about where I take people to.\"\nShe has deliberately not shared all the places she goes to, as she considers the delicate balance of nature in some areas could get overwhelmed by too many visitors.\nThe book, Wild Swim Walks Eryri has just been released, and details 28 routes across the national park.\nAnd while she says the last swim she has done is always her favourite while it is in her head, if she had to pick one it involves a walk in the Glyderau mountains, to the north-east of Yr Wyddfa, or Snowdon.\n\"This is one of the more challenging walks in the book. It's more of a pool than a lake,\" she says.\n\"It's called Llyn Caseg-Ffraith, which means the lake of the speckled mare.\n\"It's just the most perfect mountain pool. It's backdrop is Tryfan [mountain]. I've swum there quite a number of times at sunrise, and the sun rises and is reflected on to Tryfan and it glows pink.\n\"Then we go over to Llyn Bochlwyd and the topography changes; it gets a bit busier and the topography changes. There's a really tumbling stream which comes down into Llyn Ogwen.\n\"It's such a treat for the senses.\"",
    "Detectives investigating the SNP's finances will report their findings to prosecutors within \"a matter of weeks\", according to Police Scotland's chief constable.\nJo Farrell declined to say whether anyone else will face charges alongside the party's former chief executive Peter Murrell, who has been accused of embezzling SNP funds.\nIn a wide ranging interview, her first since taking the post last October, the chief constable said she wanted her officers to stop carrying out welfare checks on people with mental health issues.\nMs Farrell also repeated an apology to a former police officer who was sexually assaulted by a colleague.\nAnd she defended the force\u2019s refusal to speak to the media when Scotland's controversial hate crime legislation was introduced on 1 April.\nOperation Branchform, the investigation into the SNP's funding and finances, was launched in July 2021.\nLast April it led to the arrests of Mr Murrell and the party's former treasurer Colin Beattie.\nAnd in June former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who is married to Mr Murrell, was also arrested.\nAll three were later released without charge.\nBut last month Mr Murrell was charged in connection with the embezzlement of funds from the SNP.\nDetectives based at the Scottish Crime Campus at Gartcosh have been working on the case in consultation with prosecutors from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS).\nOfficers are finalising what's known as a standard prosecution report, detailing their findings and laying out their evidence.\nAsked when the report will be sent to the Crown Office, the chief constable said: \"I anticipate that will happen in a matter of weeks.\"\nLawyers at the Crown Office will then decide whether the case should go to court.\nJo Farrell became commanding officer at the UK\u2019s second largest police force last October after four years in charge of one of the smallest, Durham Constabulary.\nShe had no previous experience of policing in Scotland and her appointment surprised many.\nWithin weeks of taking up the post it emerged that she had used a police car to get her home to the North of England during Storm Babet.\nThe chief had to issue a public apology at her first appearance before the board of the Scottish Police Authority, the body which had just given her the job.\nIt was painful to watch and a distraction from the chief's main message that day, which was an argument for increased funding from the Scottish government.\nFaced with a recruitment freeze, a shrinking workforce and growing operational pressures, Ms Farrell asked for a \u00a3128m budget uplift and succeeded in getting an extra \u00a3104m.\nRecruitment restarted but the force still has the lowest number of officers for 15 years.\nSeven months after taking the top job, carrying out a round of media interviews in a Glasgow police station, the new chief\u2019s central message was that officers must be allowed to concentrate on policing.\nPolice Scotland say that every year, they respond to more than 100,000 mental health incidents - only 13% of which involve a crime.\nOn busy days, a call related to mental health comes in every two or three minutes.\nIn England, many forces have adopted a new approach and are only responding to mental health incidents when a crime has been committed or there is an immediate threat to life.\nMs Farrell says she does not want to go that far but argues that Police Scotland must no longer be asked to carry out the routine work of other agencies.\nAsked if she wanted her officers to stop carrying out welfare checks on people with mental health problems, she replied: \"Absolutely.\"\n\"Our involvement in mental health incidents and supporting vulnerable people has a significant impact on this organisation and is way beyond where policing should be.\n\"We're the ones who have to deal with house breaking, online sexual abuse, fraud, cyber crime, domestic abuse, serious and organised crime. We're the only ones who do that.\"\nMs Farrell also wants to reduce the time officers spend in courts, waiting to be called for trials which don't go ahead.\n\"Mental health and the courts are the two big issues that are drawing officers away from frontline policing.\n\"I would say roughly a third of the officers who're called to court are on a rest day or annual leave and that impacts on their well being and their work life balance.\n\"My conservative estimate is that only 15% end up giving evidence.\"\nWork is underway to reduce the demand on the police from mental health calls and the amount of time they spend in courts.\nWhen she took charge last year, Ms Farrell said she supported the statement of her predecessor, Sir Iain Livingstone, that the force was institutionally discriminatory.\nOn the day she spoke to the media, BBC Scotland News had revealed that a former officer had accepted a \u00a3431,968 payout from Police Scotland.\nGemma MacRae had been sexually assaulted by a colleague and had complained about bullying and misogyny at Forres police station in Moray.\nShe first made the allegatio",
    "Scotland's health secretary is \"open to ideas\" about NHS reform but vowed it would remain in public hands and free at the point of delivery.\nNeil Gray also told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show John Swinney's leadership was an opportunity for the Scottish government to \"refocus\" its priorities.\nEarlier, Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes said she wanted to boost the Scottish economy and pledged to get it \"firing on all cylinders\".\nBut Labour's Jackie Baillie said John Swinney's new cabinet offered continuity rather than change and warned NHS patients and staff were continuing to be let down.\nAnd Scottish Conservative health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane called on Mr Gray to be \"honest\" about the scale of the challenge facing the health service.\nMr Gray said he had briefed cabinet colleagues on the future of the NHS and hoped to lead a Holyrood debate on the subject later this month.\nHe told the programme: \"I am relatively open to ideas as long as they don't cross the red lines that I have - but also that I think the people of Scotland have - around making sure that our NHS remains in public hands and free at the point of use.\n\"Aside from that I am relatively pragmatic around what else we can do to drive that improvement and sustainability for our health service.\" \nThe health secretary said he wanted to harness innovation and technology from the private sector to benefit the NHS.\nMr Gray, who succeeded Michael Matheson in February, added the government was investing in reducing waiting list times. \nHe said: \"I acknowledge that for too many people they are waiting too long and that is unacceptable.\"\nThe minister also said he wanted to continue to work with the British Medical Association to reach a \"sustainable pay offer\" for junior doctors.\nAnd Mr Gray pledged to reflect on the recommendations of Dr Hilary Cass, who last week said Scotland could benefit from adopting a more \"holistic\" approach to gender services in relation to children.\nMr Swinney was elected SNP leader unopposed last week following the resignation of Humza Yousaf.\nHe was formally sworn in as Scotland's seventh first minister on Wednesday but later confirmed a largely unchanged cabinet, with the exception of Ms Forbes.\nWriting in the Sunday Times, the ex-finance secretary said she left the backbenches and returned to government \"to get stuff done\".\nShe said: \"Everything is an economic policy - tackling poverty, reaching net zero, raising the revenue to invest in our public services.\n\"The plan is simple. Get the economy firing on all cylinders, and it will power a better future.\"\nMr Gray also said ministers would seek to build consensus following the collapse of the Bute House Agreement with the Greens.\nHe said: \"John Swinney's leadership is an opportunity for us to refocus, for us to make sure that we are focused in on the priorities of the people of Scotland.\n\"That's what minority government also does by making sure that we are reaching out across the parliament and finding consensus.\" \nScottish Labour's deputy leader Jackie Baillie later criticised the government's health record.\nShe told The Sunday Show: \"I don't doubt people\u2019s ambition to bring down waiting lists, but the fact is they\u2019ve failed.\n\"We\u2019ve had the SNP in charge for 17 years - what we\u2019ve got now is a continuity first minister, a continuity cabinet, because it\u2019s largely the same faces sitting round the table.\n\"The people who have been in charge of the NHS are still the same party and the same people.\"\nDame Jackie, who is also the party's health spokeswoman, called for greater investment in primary and social care, including hiring more GPs, and better workforce planning.\nShe added: \"We\u2019re letting down patients across Scotland, but we\u2019re also letting down the staff who do such a tremendous job but without the support and resources that they require.\n\"It isn't just about throwing more money at it, we need to drive efficiency through the NHS and the staff are the very ones who actually have the ideas about how to do that.\"\nDr Gulhane, of the Scottish Conservatives, said: \"If Neil Gray is going to fix the mess the SNP has made of the NHS, he needs to be honest about the scale of the challenge.\n\"His claim that waiting times are coming down is fooling no one. \n\"On A&E, cancer treatment, delayed discharge and cancelled ops things are getting worse, which is a damning indictment of both the SNP\u2019s dire workforce planning and Humza Yousaf\u2019s flimsy Covid recovery plan.\"\nThe practising GP also warned the higher taxes imposed by the SNP were an obstacle to recruiting and retaining more medics.\nAnd he urged ministers to follow the Cass review on gender care rather than \"ignorant ideology\".",
    "A Gloucestershire art centre is fundraising to provide free art classes to vulnerable people.\nNew Brewery Arts in Cirencester is aiming to raise \u00a312,000 by 1 July to provide 1,200 free classes to people in need of support.\nThey have named the movement New Brewery Hearts and aspire to give joy to people who are unable to access creativity.\nWorking with local charities, the arts centre hopes to offer fully-funded places on classes, courses and workshops.\n\"There\u2019s lots of evidence that doing something creative and working in a group can be really beneficial for wellbeing in loads of different ways,\" said CEO Beth Alden.\nLast year, the arts centre were able to offer about 300 hours of free classes to vulnerable people.\nClients are referred to the scheme via local charities including Cirencester Foodbank, The Churn Project and Cirencester Housing for Young People.\nThe centre specialises in various forms of craft, such as ceramics, stone carving, printing, basket making, sewing, drawing and painting, stained glass and textiles.\n\"We want to have more people have access to those moments of joy and wellbeing,\" said Ms Alden.\n\"There are so many people who are really struggling with the cost of living and sometimes you need a moment to feel like you have achieved something and a creative class can do that,\" she continued.\n\"But if you\u2019re struggling financially, you may be unable to access that.\"\nArts and crafts can have a range of wellbeing benefits, said Ms Alden, including lifting mood, alleviating stress and anxiety and helping with isolation.\nOne person who was referred to the scheme, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \"As a disabled person on benefits, I could never have afforded this experience, it\u2019s made me feel worthy of something special.

    "A school said its book club is \"thriving\" after a fuselage of a plane was transformed into a library.\nSt Helen's Primary School, in Alveston near Bristol, saved up to buy the unique space which arrived in January 2023. It also doubles as an outdoor classroom.\nRichard Adams, deputy head teacher, said the students get a \"real sense of pleasure\" from reading there.\nThe official opening was held on World Book Day, earlier this year.\nMr Adams said the idea came about after the school ran a competition for the children to choose new house names and the pupils came up with a \"marvellous idea to name them after planes\". \nThere is a great history in the area with the link to planes and after a school trip, they came up with a \"great idea to rescue a plane that had finished its useful service from a plane graveyard,\" he added.\nAs a large part of the fuselage was built in nearby Filton - where Concorde was designed and built - it was very much in keeping with their local plane angle too, he said.\n\"Originally it was decaying slightly so a previous head teacher and the local community got a project together to buy it and renovate it then move it the school.\n\"It's been completely redone inside as a library,\" he said. \nThe fuselage was then pulled to the school on a big crane and lifted onto the school field. \n\"It was a lot of work but we're really grateful to the community for raising the money for that,\" he added.\n\"We have more than 30 children in our book club now\" and being able to learn on the plane is the \"highlight of their week\", he added.\nCatherine, a student at the school, said: \"I really enjoy reading... [and] the library has been really amazing.\n\"You get to be inside a plane, in your school, with books, which is really cool.\" \nCharlotte, another student, said: \"I really like reading... and it's really amazing to have a plane with the cockpit and be able to sit down on a bean bag and read a book.\"\nBeing able to come on the plane has also encouraged lots of younger children to come and read, she added.\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A company redeveloping a former oil and gas fabrication yard has secured a \u00a3100m business loan from UK and Scottish government-backed banks.\nHaventus has started construction of a port to support offshore wind farms at Ardersier near Inverness.\nThe 450-acre (182ha) site is part of the Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport, and is to have 650 metres (2,132ft) of new quayside.\nHaventus has secured a joint credit facility from the Scottish National Investment Bank and UK Infrastructure Bank.\nIn total Haventus has secured \u00a3400m for the construction of new port facilities that it said will underpin the creation of a \"nationally significant facility\" for the industrial-scale deployment of new offshore wind turbines.\nWork has already begun on the new quay wall and associated quayside, and the completed site is set to open in 2025.\nIn 2023 the project received \u00a3300m from energy investment firm Quantum Capital Group.\nThe Scottish National Investment Bank (SNIB) and UK Infrastructure Bank (UKIB) have now each invested a further \u00a350m.\nHaventus chief executive Lewis Gillies said: \"We are delighted to have secured the support of the two banks as important partners in this nationally significant project.\n\"With their support, and that of Quantum, Ardersier Port is poised to become a critical offshore wind hub and an important job creator and enabler.\n\"It will play a crucial role in helping the country meet its net zero ambitions.\"\nIn the 1970s the McDermott Yard opened at the location on the Moray Firth for the fabrication and construction of offshore platforms for the then newly-established North Sea gas and oil industry.\nAt its height the yard employed about 4,500 people but it closed in 2001 as demand dropped.\nLast year, investment firm Quantum Capital Group committed \u00a3300m of investment towards the redevelopment project.\nThe work is one of the largest industrial regeneration projects in the Highlands in decades.\nFirst Minister John Swinney said the development would help deliver a \"fairer, greener future for everyone\".\nHe said: \"Scotland's growing offshore wind capabilities present an era-defining opportunity - not only to achieve a just transition to net zero, but to harness the skills which lie across our energy sector and wider supply chain to create thousands of green jobs and transform our regional and national economies.\n\"The Ardersier Port redevelopment, which is central to the ambitions of the ground-breaking Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport, exemplifies this opportunity.\"\nAndrew Bowie, UK government minister for nuclear and renewables, described Scotland as a \"pioneer\" in offshore wind technology.\n\"The UK has a record on offshore wind it can be truly proud of, with the most installed capacity in Europe and home to the five largest operational windfarms off our shores,\" he said.",
    "Swimmers have welcomed the news that three sites in the East of England are getting designated bathing water status.\nManningtree beach in Essex, the River Cam at Sheep's Green in Cambridge and the River Stour at Sudbury in Suffolk are among 27 new sites in England.\nThe Environment Agency (EA) will monitor them during the bathing season.\n\"We are absolutely delighted,\" said Helen Whitehead, from the Manningtree Mermaids group.\n\"The River Stour is the heart of our town and we want to protect it for generations to come.\"\nThe EA would investigate pollution sources and identify steps to be taken in response, which could include actions by water companies, farmers and others. \nSwimmers at all three sites have experienced problems with sewage.\nTests previously carried out at the River Stour, on the Essex-Suffolk border near the Sudbury water treatment works, showed \"very high\" levels of E. coli bacteria.\nA Cambridge City Council report recently indicated people swimming in the Cam were being exposed to \"significant health risks\".\nAnne Miller, a member of Cam Valley Forum, said it involved a huge amount of work to get the status.\n\"It's a huge relief, it won't solve all our problems but it will certainly help.\n\"From our own water testing we know the water quality is almost certainly going to be rated as poor.\n\"That will trigger action to find out where the source of the problem is. We think it is likely to be the sewage works about four miles upstream (6.4km) and hopefully something will be done about it.\"  \nThe Manningtree Mermaids held several protests at the beach, which has three sewer storm overflow outlets in the vicinity, and organised a mass swim.\nCatherine Arnold from the group said: \"We are so thrilled our hard work has paid off. Now we can start to understand a little more about whether there is a risk for us to swim or not.\"\nThe new sites will take the total number of bathing waters to 451 across England.\nConservative Water Minister Robbie Moore said: \"These popular swimming spots will now undergo regular monitoring to ensure bathers have up-to-date information on the quality of the water and enable action to be taken if minimum standards aren't being met.\n\"I am fully committed to seeing the quality of our coastal waters, rivers and lakes rise further for the benefit of the environment and everyone who uses them.\" \n Got a story?

    "Work is under way to restore a British car that broke the land speed record almost 100 years ago.\nRestoration to the Sunbeam 1000hp is being carried out at The National Motor Museum in Beaulieu, Hampshire.\nNicknamed The Slug, it was the first car to exceed 200mph in 1927 along Daytona beach in Florida, USA, with Maj Henry Segrave at the wheel.\nThe car, which was built in Wolverhampton, has not been run since the 1930s.\nIt is powered by two aircraft engines, but over time oil in the engines, brakes and chains have hardened and formed a glue-like substance that now needs to be removed by laser.\u00a0\nSenior engineer Ian Stanfield said: \"Oils of this period were vegetable-based, rather than mineral-based.\n\"Once they've gone through a heat cycle, they tend to solidify, very much like cooking fat.\n\"The oils in this engine and gearbox have been left for 80-odd years. So they're not only solid, they're almost like glue.\"\nEngineers at the motor museum sprayed a solution with magnetic particles onto the metal which, when viewed in ultraviolet light, reveals any cracks.\u00a0\nThey also found a spanner which had been \"glued\" to the chassis by oil since the world record run.\u00a0\nMr Stanfield said the car has completed fewer than 70 miles in its 97 years. \nThe restoration work comes after a museum in Wolverhampton launched an initiative to track down relatives of workers who helped build the car.\nThe National Motor Museum is now campaigning to raise \u00a3300,000 to complete the work, with \u00a350,000 raised so far.\nChief engineer Doug Hill said: \"The best way to preserve a motor vehicle is to have it in running order. \n\"The ambition is to take this car to Daytona three years from now, and run it down the same part of the beach, 100 years to the day after Segrave took it and won the land speed record at 203 miles an hour.\"\nThe car's chassis is currently on display in the Beaulieu museum, with only the wooden steering wheel still in place.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

    "Eurovision Song contest organisers have defended disqualifying Dutch contestant Joost Klein from the competition.\nKlein was removed hours before Saturday's final after an allegation of intimidation was made to Swedish police by a female member of the production crew.\nDutch organisers The Netherlands Songfestival said on Saturday that they \"were shocked by the decision\" and called it \"disproportionate\".\nBut the Eurovision Broadcasting Union (EBU) said in a statement on Tuesday: \"The version of events released in some public comments and on social media does not correspond with the statements shared with us and the Swedish Police by staff and witnesses.\"\nThe statement continued: \"Joost\u2019s behaviour was in clear breach of contest rules which are designed to ensure there is a safe working environment for all staff and to protect the production. \n\"We are not pre-judging the legal process but, given the circumstances of what occurred and the fact that the police case will shortly be handed to the prosecutor, it would not have been appropriate for Joost to participate in the grand final.\"\nIt added that the decision to exclude him was backed by the contest\u2019s governing body and unanimously supported by the EBU executive board, \"following a thorough internal investigation\".\n\"We have a zero-tolerance policy towards inappropriate behaviour at our events and will always take necessary action to address threats to staff \u2013 no matter who they come from,\" the statement concluded.\nIn a statement posted on X on Sunday, Dutch broadcaster Avrotros said it was \"very disappointed and upset for the millions of fans who were excited\" about seeing the Netherlands entry.\nMany fans had also taken to social media to voice their dismay.\nThe latest statement from the EBU follows a turbulent Eurovision season, which culminated with Switzerland's Nemo picking up the coveted winners' trophy in Sweden on Saturday.\nOn Monday, the EBU issued another statement, responding to complaints of bad behaviour during the competition's run.\nThe organisers said they \"regret\" that some delegations \"didn't respect the spirit of the rules\" in Sweden.\nItaly's Angelina Mango and Ireland's Bambie Thug were among the contestants who complained of a \"tense\" and \"horrible\" atmosphere backstage.\nThe EBU said it would review events in Sweden's Malmo, adding that individual cases would be discussed at a later date.\nPortugal's national broadcaster RTP also complained to the EBU after there was a delay in posting its performance to YouTube after the final.\nThe EBU responded that the delay had been due to their contestant, Iolanda, who had painted designs inspired by the keffiyeh - traditional Palestinian scarves used to show support for the country - on her nails.\n",
    "OpenAI has unveiled the latest version of the tech which underpins its AI chatbot ChatGPT.\nIt\u2019s called GPT-4o, and it will be rolled out to all users of ChatGPT, including non-subscribers.\nIt is faster than earlier models and has been programmed to sound chatty and sometimes even flirtatious in its responses to prompts.\nThe new version can read and discuss images, translate languages, and identify emotions from visual expressions. There is also memory so it can recall previous prompts.\nIt can be interrupted and it has an easier conversational rhythm - there was no delay between asking it a question and receiving an answer.\nDuring a live demo using the voice version of GPT-4o, it provided helpful suggestions for how to go about solving a simple equation written on a piece of paper - rather than simply solving it.  It analysed some computer code, translating between Italian and English and interpreted the emotions in a selfie of a smiling man.\nUsing a warm American female voice, it greeted its prompters by asking them how they were doing. When paid a compliment, it responded: \u201cStop it, you\u2019re making me blush!\u201d.\nIt wasn\u2019t perfect \u2013 at one point it mistook the smiling man for a wooden surface, and it started to solve an equation that it hadn\u2019t yet been shown. This unintentionally demonstrated that there\u2019s still some way to go before the glitches and hallucinations which make chatbots unreliable and potentially unsafe, can be ironed out.\nBut what it does show us is the direction of travel for OpenAI, which I think intends  GPT-4o to become the next generation of AI digital assistant, a kind of turbo-charged Siri or Hey, Google which remembers what it\u2019s been told in the past and can interact beyond voice or text.\nIf there was an elephant in the room, alongside the enthusiastic off-camera audience whooping and applauding, it was the environmental price tag of this technology.\nWe know that AI is more power-hungry than traditional computing tasks, and that the more sophisticated it becomes, the more computing power it requires. There was no mention of sustainability during the evening.\nWe have seen chatbots like Elon Musk\u2019s Grok and Pi, from DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, prioritise the \u201cpersonality\u201d of their products, but the way in which GPT-4o seamlessly handled the combination of text, audio and images with an instant response appears to put OpenAI ahead of the competition.\nOf course, at the moment we only have the firm\u2019s word for it \u2013 it was their demo, carefully curated and managed by them. It will be interesting to see how GPT-4o copes at scale with the millions of people who already use ChatGPT as it rolls out.\nOpenAI's chief technology officer Mira Murati described GPT-4o as \u201cmagical\u201d but added that the firm would \u201cremove that mysticism\u201d with the product\u2019s roll-out.\nAn interesting and emotive choice of words: while this tech is rapidly becoming more sophisticated and increasingly convincing as a companion \u2013 it is not sentient or magic, it is complex programming and machine learning.\nThere have been rumours about a partnership between OpenAI and Apple and while this has not yet been confirmed, it was telling during the presentation that Apple products were used throughout. \nAnother shot across the bows was the timing of this event, 24 hours before its rival Google is due to show off its latest AI developments at its annual conference, Google IO.",
    "Concern about sexual content in children's online games is growing. Ofcom, the regulator for online safety, has told tech firms to hide \"toxic\" content from children and published draft codes of practice. \"James\" shared his experience of being approached on Roblox and being asked for sexual images.\nEight-year-old James is sat in his bedroom playing on Roblox - a game aimed at children that allows them access to \"the ultimate virtual universe\". \nA message pops up: \"Do you want to be friends?\"\nJust a couple of weeks later, this person will ask James for intimate, sexual photos of himself.\n\"I was young and I thought these people were my friends,\" James, not his real name, said.\n\"It started off very innocent... then it was like, 'let's take this conversation to Kik [a mobile chat app]'.\n\"They asked for sexual pictures, they wanted to see my naked body, that was the words they used, and they tried to portray it as being OK and normal.\"\nFor those unfamiliar with the platform, Roblox allows people to play and create a variety of games in a 3D world. \nThere are no age restrictions, allowing adults and children to play and communicate together.\nPolice forces across the country count it as one of a number of children's gaming sites where grooming is a growing problem. \nIf you have been affected by issues in this story you can find help and support at the BBC Action Line. \nJames, who is from Gloucestershire and now in his 20s, is one of thousands of children who have been asked for sexual photos online by someone pretending to be their own age. \n\"At a young age, all you want is friends, so I spoke to that person,\" James said.\n\"They asked questions like how old am I, where am I from, my name, which I answered because at a young age you don't think anything of that information, you don't think people will use that maliciously against you. \n\"It was a kids game, I didn't think any adults would play it.\"\nAsking for intimate or sexual photos of a child is an offence under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 - even if the photos are not sent.\nJames said he knew this was wrong even aged eight and quickly blocked the person he now believes to have been an adult man. \nBut that was not the end of it.\n\"They were persistent in trying to communicate with me back on Roblox,\" James said.\n\"They would come on the account I originally met them on... they would then harass me by following me into the games I was playing and continuously talking to me to the point I couldn't play for a while.\n\"I felt vulnerable because I was constantly being followed by this person who was just horrible. It was terrifying.\"\nFeeling embarrassed about what happened, James did not tell anyone.\n\"I wanted to lock it away,\" he said.\n\"You think 'how did I let that happen', 'why did I do that', but I do now realise that none of it was in my control.\n\"You get told as a kid don't talk to strangers, but when you're online you think everyone is your friend.\n\"They knew what they were doing, they knew how to work around it.\"\nDespite what happened, James did not feel turning away from Roblox was an option. \nIt was where his real-life friends were and he did not want to miss out. Although he felt pressured and uncomfortable, he kept on using the game until he was about 13.\nIn its purest form, Roblox has a lot to offer. There are more than 4.4 million \"active immersive experiences\", from gaming to social hangouts, to sports, education, and entertainment.\nRoblox said: \"The wellbeing of the Roblox community is our first priority, and we are deeply saddened to hear about this case.\n\"We are continually investing in and evolving the safety tools, teams and policies we dedicate to catching and preventing attempts at malicious or harmful activity on our platform to protect members of the community.\"\nBeing online is part of everyday life for the majority of children. \nData from Ofcom shows nearly all children (99%) spend time online, and that nine in 10 own a mobile phone by the time they reach 11. \nOfcom also found three in five secondary-school-aged children (11-18 years) have been contacted online in a way that potentially made them feel uncomfortable. \nSome 30% have received an unwanted friend or follow request. Around one in six secondary students (16%) have either been sent naked or half-dressed photos, or been asked to share these themselves.\nAvon and Somerset Police is one of many forces proactively reaching out to help.\nIt said there were 93 reported offences of sexual grooming in the past 12 months that carried a \"cyber flag\". \nOf those, four were also identified as involving child abuse, and a further 39 included reference to child sexual exploitation. \nThe force has been holding workshops at schools for children and parents in an effort to raise awareness of risks varying from online grooming to bullying and financial loss.\nIn the past year, more than 150 schools were visited, reaching more than 25,000 people.\nThe BBC was invited to Bailey's Court Primary School in Bradley S",
    "Eurovision Song Contest organisers have said they \"regret\" that some delegations \"didn't respect the spirit of the rules\" in Sweden. \nItaly's Angelina Mango and Ireland's Bambie Thug are among contestants who complained of a \"tense\" and \"horrible\" atmosphere backstage. \nThe Dutch singer Joost Klein was also sent home after being accused of intimidating behaviour by a female member of the production crew.\nIn a statement on Monday, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which runs Eurovision, acknowledged that several contestants had lodged complaints.\n\"We spoke to a number of delegations during the event regarding various issues that were brought to our attention,\" it said. \n\"The EBU\u2019s governing bodies will, together with the heads of delegations, review the events surrounding the ESC in Malm\u00f6 to move forward in a positive way and to ensure the values of the event are respected by everyone.\"\nIt added that individual cases will be discussed at a later date. \nThe contest was overshadowed by protests over Israel's participation, due to the humanitarian cost of its war on Hamas.\nThousands of people protested on the streets of Malm\u00f6, and the country's representative, Eden Golan, received a mixture of boos and cheers from the audience.\nAfter the grand final, Bambie Thug, who has been outspoken in their pro-Palestinian views, also accused Israel's national broadcaster, Kan, of \"inciting violence\" against them during its coverage.\nDuring the first semi-final, one of the station's commentators noted that the performer had \"spoken negatively about Israel\".\n\"But we can talk about that later,\" the commentator added. \"Prepare your curses.\"\nThe comment might have been a reference to a lyric in Bambie Thug's song, which involves placing a hex on an ex-partner, but the singer felt it crossed a line.\n\"The broadcaster [Kan] has disobeyed the rules and I hope next year they won\u2019t be able to compete because of that,\" they told reporters after the contest.\nOther participants accused the Israeli delegation of filming them and posting clips online without their permission.\n\nGolan, who ultimately came fifth in the contest, also acknowledged the controversy over her appearance had taken a toll.\n\"To say it was easy would be a lie,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"But with your support and love it gave me the strength to continue and put on the absolute best performance I knew I can do.\"\nSeveral entrants, including the UK's Olly Alexander, signed a joint statement calling for a ceasefire in Gaza in the run-up to the contest. \nAnd Golan appeared to face criticisms from her fellow contestants during a press conference on Thursday night.\nGreek singer Marina Satti was seen yawning and pretending to fall asleep while Golan spoke.\nAnd when the Israeli singer was told she did not have to answer a question about whether her presence \"posed a risk\", Joost Klein interrupted to ask: \"Why not?\"\n\nTwo days later, Klein was disqualified from the contest over an alleged run-in with a female member of the production crew, who made a complaint to Swedish police. \nDutch organisers The Netherlands Songfestival said Klein had \"repeatedly indicated\" he did not want to be filmed and that he \"did not touch the camera woman\".\nAt the time, the EBU felt it necessary to clarify that the incident \"did not involve any other performer or delegation member\".\nLithuania's entrant Silvester Belt, meanwhile, said he regretted taking part in the grand final altogether.\n\"Going after that country, with the crowd being so intense, was one of the worst things I had to go through,\" he wrote on social media, referring to the fact that his performance followed Israel's. \n\"I really did the best that I could in this situation,\" he added, calling the contest a \"traumatic experience\" and adding: \"[I] wish it all ended after the first semi.\"\nSwiss singer Nemo won the

    "Protests in Georgia have continued in a last-ditch effort to prevent the passing of a controversial law.\nAfter an overnight standoff with protesters outside parliament in Tbilisi, security forces pulled out from the main square on Monday morning.\nCritics of the governing Georgian Dream party say the foreign influence bill - which they describe as the \"Russia law\" - could be used to stifle dissent.\nThe final voting on the proposed legislation is scheduled for Tuesday. \nOn Monday morning, Georgian Dream lawmakers rushed it through a committee vote, approving it in 67 seconds.\nThe bill - now due to go for its third and final reading - targets civil society organisations and independent media that receive foreign funding.\nProtesters are concerned that it would be used by the government to clamp down on opponents, and would harm Georgia's hopes of joining the European Union.\nTens of thousands of demonstrators spent the night outside Tbilisi's parliament building, dancing as it rained through the dark hours. \nOnce the sun rose on Monday, MPs from the governing party arriving ahead of the session were met with shouts and chants of \"slaves\" and \"Russians\".\nRanks of police with shields and water cannon were stationed to allow legislators to get into the parliament building.\nPhotos and footage online appeared to show violent altercations between protesters and police.\nTwo US citizens and one Russian were among 20 people arrested at protests, Russian state news reported, citing the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs.\nProtesters plan to continue their noise through the parliamentary session in the hopes the sound will encourage MPs to reconsider voting for the bill.\nOpponents of the bill say the measures are inspired by Russian legislation passed in 2012, which they say has been used since then to crack down on critics of the Kremlin.\nThis proposed law would force non-governmental groups and media to register as \"organisations serving the interest of a foreign power\" if more than 20% of their funding comes from overseas.\nGeorgian Dream says the measure would increase transparency and defend Georgia's sovereignty.\nOn Sunday, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze vowed that his party would successfully pass it into law, despite the massive demonstrations that began nearly a month ago.\nThe country's opposition leaders have asked the UK to do more to oppose the bill, calling on Foreign Secretary David Cameron to speak out against it.\nLast week, the US said it was \"deeply troubled\" by the treatment of protesters and called for an independent investigation into reports of \"harassment and physical assault\".\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said the Georgian people want a \"European future\" and has called on legislators to \"stay the course on the road to Europe\".\nThe EU granted Georgia candidate status in December, but has warned the bill could jeopardise further progress within the bloc.\nGeorgian Dream has been in power since 2012, when it defeated a pro-Western government and vowed to normalise relations with Russia.\nThe party last won re-election in 2020. The opposition accused it of fraud and voter intimidation, but international observers - while criticising aspects of the process - said it had been competitive.\nThe next general election is due in October.",
    "Dozens of pro-Palestinian students at a US university commencement ceremony staged a walk-out ahead of a speech by veteran comedian Jerry Seinfeld.\nFootage on social media showed some robed graduates at Duke University, North Carolina, chanting and waving Palestinian flags in protest as the actor received an honorary degree on Sunday. \nSeinfeld has been a vocal supporter of Israel since the 7 October Hamas attacks and throughout the course of the war in Gaza.\nMany of the students at the ceremony stayed to listen to his speech, with several chanting words of support.\nThe incident happened as the 70-year-old was introduced on stage at the university's football stadium by the institution's president, Vincent Price. \nLoud booing and chants of \"Free Palestine\" could be heard in videos posted on social media.\nSome people sat in the surrounding rows could also be seen leaving as the actor began his speech. \nSeinfeld, who is a Jewish actor and among 700 entertainment industry figures who signed an open letter in support of Israel's right to defend itself following Hamas's attack, managed to deliver his speech without further interruption. \nSeveral in the crowd chanted \"Jerry, Jerry\" as he received his degree.\n\"A lot of you are thinking, 'I can't believe they invited this guy.' Too late,\" he said on Sunday, after pledging to \"defend\" the concept of privilege.\n\"I say, use your privilege. I grew up a Jewish boy from New York. That is a privilege if you want to be a comedian,\" he told the graduates.\nSeinfeld, who is the father of two students at Duke, visited a kibbutz in Israel in December and met with some of the families of hostages taken into Gaza by Hamas. \nIn a statement to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, following the ceremony, Duke University's vice president for communications, Frank Tramble, said: \"We understand the depth of feeling in our community, and as we have all year, we respect the right of everyone at Duke to express their views peacefully, without preventing graduates and their families from celebrating their achievement.\"\nThe demonstration was the latest in a series of pro-Palestinian protests that have rocked campuses across the US over the last few weeks.\nStudents have been calling for universities to boycott companies and individuals with ties to Israel amid the ongoing war.\nNational politicians called on colleges to take action, highlighting disorder and reports of antisemitism at some of the protests, and police have been used to clear encampments.\nColumbia University and the University of Southern California are among several to have cancelled or restructured their main graduation ceremonies.\nWaves of Hamas gunmen stormed across Gaza's border into Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people.\nMore than 34,900 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\n",
    "River levels are on the rise again in the flood-stricken Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul after more heavy rains on the weekend. \nThe Taquari and Ca\u00ed rivers have burst their banks and are causing fresh flooding in the interior of the state.\nMore than half a million people have been displaced from their homes and 147 are confirmed to have died in the floods.\nRescue workers continue to search for people who are missing. \nThe rise in the water levels of the Taquari and Ca\u00ed is particularly worrying because the two rivers flow into the Gua\u00edba, which has already caused severe flooding in the state capital, Porto Alegre.\nLarge parts of the city, which is home to 1.5m people, remain under water, with the historic centre particularly badly hit. \nSoldiers have been patrolling flooded neighbourhoods in boats after reports of lootings. \nBrazil's President, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, has delayed his planned visit to Chile to co-ordinate the government's response.\nThe president said that emergency funds would be made available to rebuild damaged infrastructure.\nUS President Joe Biden on Saturday said that his government had been in touch with his Brazilian counterpart to provide assistance.\nLocally, residents who have access to boats have been helping rescue people stranded by the rising water.\nIvan Brizola told BBC News Brasil that he had rescued hundreds of people by kayak, even though he cannot swim. \n\nThe 59-year-old from Porto Alegre said he had borrowed the kayak to help people in nearby Canoas \"as the water started to flood their neighbourhoods\".\nHe estimated that the water in the streets of Canoas was between eight to 10m (26-33ft) deep in places.\nTogether with other volunteers, Mr Brizola managed to ferry people from areas which were hard to access to bigger boats.\nHis son estimates that Mr Brizola has rescued more than 300 people and countless pets over the past week.\nThe flooding has been caused by torrential rains which started at the end of April.\nMeteorologists say that the beginning of May has been the wettest that Porto Alegre has experienced in the past 63 years.\nResearchers at ClimaMeter, who study weather extremes, have said that the cyclical rains this area is prone to have become more intense due to climate change. \nThe world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.\n",
    "A year after undergoing a world-first treatment for glioblastoma, Australian doctor Richard Scolyer remains cancer-free.\nThe esteemed pathologist's experimental therapy is based on his own pioneering research on melanoma.\nProf Scolyer's subtype of glioblastoma is so aggressive most patients survive less than a year.\nBut on Tuesday the 57-year-old announced his latest MRI scan had again showed no recurrence of the tumour.\n\"To be honest, I was more nervous than I have been for any previous scan,\" he told the BBC.\n\"I'm just thrilled and delighted... couldn't be happier.\"\nProf Scolyer is one of the country's most respected medical minds, and was this year named Australian of the Year alongside his colleague and friend Georgina Long, in recognition of their life-changing work on melanoma.\nAs co-directors of the Melanoma Institute Australia, over the past decade the pair's research on immunotherapy, which uses the body's immune system to attack cancer cells, has dramatically improved outcomes for advanced melanoma patients globally. Half are now essentially cured, up from less than 10%.\nIt's that research that Prof Long, alongside a team of doctors, is using to treat Prof Scolyer - in the hope of finding a cure for his cancer too.\nIn melanoma, Prof Long - herself a renowned medical oncologist - and her team discovered that immunotherapy works better when a combination of drugs is used, and when they are administered before any surgery to remove a tumour. And so, Prof Scolyer last year became the first brain cancer patient to ever have combination, pre-surgery immunotherapy.\nHe is also the first to be administered a vaccine personalised to his tumour's characteristics, which boosts the cancer-detecting powers of the drugs.\nAfter a tough couple of months of treatment at the start of the year - spent dealing with epileptic seizures, liver issues and pneumonia - Prof Scolyer says he is feeling healthier.\n\"I'm the best I have felt for yonks,\" he said, adding that he's back to exercising every day - which for him often means a casual 15km (9.3 mile) jog.\n\"It certainly doesn't mean that my brain cancer is cured... but it's just nice to know that it hasn't come back yet, so I've still got some more time to enjoy my life with my wife Katie and my three wonderful kids.\"\nThe results so far have generated huge excitement that the duo may be on the cusp of a discovery which could one day help the roughly 300,000 people diagnosed with brain cancer globally each year.\nProf Scolyer and Prof Long have previously said the odds of a cure are \"minuscule\", but they hope the experimental treatment will prolong Prof Scolyer's life and will soon translate into clinical trials for glioblastoma patients.\nThey currently have a scientific paper under review, which details results from the first weeks of Prof Scolyer's treatment, but Prof Long stresses that they are still a long way off developing an approved and regulated course of treatment. \n\"We've generated a whole heap of data, to then make a foundation for that next step, so that we can help more people,\" she said.\n\"We're not there yet. What we have to really focus on is showing that this pre-surgery, combination immunotherapy type of approach works in a large number of people.\"\nRoger Stupp - the doctor after whom the current protocol for treating glioblastomas is named - earlier this year told the BBC Prof Scolyer's prognosis was \"grim\", and that it was too early to tell if the treatment is working.\nHe added that while Mr Scolyer's earlier results were \"encouraging\", he wanted to see him reach 12 months, even 18, without recurrence before getting excited.\nProf Scoyler said he's already proud of the data his treatment has generated and grateful to his family and his medical team for supporting \"this experiment\".\n\"I feel proud of the team that I work with. I feel proud that they're willing to take the risk in going down this path.\"\n\"[It] provides some hope that maybe this is a direction that's worth investigating more formally.\"",
    "At least 41 people were killed after flash floods and \"cold lava\" flowing from a volcano hit the western Indonesian island of Sumatra.\nHours of heavy rain on Saturday swept torrents of ash and rocks down Mount Marapi, the most active volcano in Sumatra.\nThe mudslides inundated two districts, swept people to their deaths and damaged more than 100 homes, mosques and public facilities.\nSeventeen people are still missing.\nSurvivors recounted how they fled as the \"cold lava\" - a mixture of volcanic material and pebbles that flow down a volcano's slopes in the rain - flowed towards their homes.\n\"I heard the thunder and the sound similar to boiling water. It was the sound of big rocks falling from Mount Marapi,\u201d Rina Devina, a 43-year-old housewife from the Agam district told AFP news agency.\n\u201cIt was pitch black, so I used my cellphone as a torch. The road was muddy, so I chanted \u2018God, have mercy\u2019 over and over again,\u201d Ms Devina said.\nThe mother of three added that a neighbour's house had been \"flattened by big rocks\" and four of her neighbours died.\nThe phrase cold lava is a translation of the term \"lahar\" in Indonesian and Tagalog. Temperatures range between 0\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C, according to how they are formed, but are typically below 50\u00b0C, according to several academic reports on the phenomenon.\nA moving lahar resembles a \"roiling slurry of wet concrete\" that can grow in volume as it incorporates other debris in its path, said the US Geological Survey.\nBy Sunday afternoon, rescuers had found 19 bodies in the worst-hit village of Canduang in Agam district and recovered nine other bodies in the neighbouring district of Tanah Datar, according to the National Search and Rescue Agency.\nBerliana Reskyka, another Agam resident, spoke of his experiences helping his injured neighbours.\n\"There were some who were crying, hysterical, because some of their family members were not yet accounted for. There were also those who discovered their loved ones have died,\" Berliana told BBC Indonesian.\nThe deluge is the latest in a series of natural disasters that have resulted, at least in part, from human activities, environment experts told BBC Indonesian.\n\"Flash floods and cold lava mudslides continue to recur and increase in intensity due to excessive exploitation of natural resources and haphazard development,\" said Wengki Purwanto, the director of the West Sumatra branch of the Indonesian Forum for Environment.\n\"As a result, disasters repeat themselves every year. In fact, they increase in frequency every year. The distance between one disaster and the next becomes closer,\" he said.\nThe area around Mount Marapi has seen several similar disasters in the past six months. \nLast 5 December, 23 hikers were killed when the volcano erupted while in February this year, flash floods damaged dozens of homes in the Tanah Datar.\nJust last month, days of eruption threw huge clouds of ash - up to a height of 2km - into the sky. Flights in the region were disrupted, roads closed, and more than 11,000 people were told to evacuate.\nMarapi translates from the local Minang language to \"Mountain of Fire\".",
    "Russia has said its forces have entered the north-eastern border town of Vovchansk, near Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv.\nUkraine's military said it had \"pushed the enemy back\" from the northern outskirts of the town, adding it had \"tactical successes\" in several areas.\nRussia has intensified its attacks on the region following Friday's surprise incursions across the border, seizing at least nine villages and settlements in one of the most significant ground attacks since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.\nThousands of civilians have fled towards Kharkiv.\nThere are concerns among Ukrainian commanders about what could happen if Russian troops get within artillery-range of the city.\nUkraine's army has said that Russia has deployed \"significant forces\" - up to five battalions - in its latest offensive and has acknowledged Moscow's troops have had some \"tactical success\".\nBut in an evening statement, the army said Russia had lost more than 100 soldiers since the start of the day, adding that Ukrainian forces were restoring old positions.\nIt said fighting was ongoing in 12 areas and had spread to the settlement of Staritsa, to the west of Vochansk.\nEarlier, it had said reserve forces were being moved to the Kharkiv region to reinforce its defences.\nSeparately, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced in his evening address that a new commander had taken charge of forces in Kharkiv.\nHe did not say when Brig Gen Mykhailo Drapatyi took over from his predecessor, Yuriy Halushkin.\nVovchansk, located 74km (45 miles) from Kharkiv, has been heavily bombed in recent days and officials in the surrounding region say Russia is now targeting settlements with glide bombs.\nWhile it is a significant town in the region, Vovchansk is not of specific military importance, though its capture would be a blow to Ukrainian morale.\nKharkiv regional head Oleh Syniehubov said Russia was deliberately trying to stretch the front line by attacking in small groups in new directions.\nHe told local TV that Ukrainian forces were holding Russian troops back but warned that fighting could spread to new settlements, according to Reuters. \nOn Telegram he described the situation as \"quite complicated\" with Russia continuing to advance.\nNearly 6,000 people having already been evacuated, he said, adding that 30 settlements had been struck by mortar or artillery shelling.\nSome 200-300 people remain in Vovchansk itself, he added.\nWhile it is thought this Russian cross-border incursion is unlikely to result in Kharkiv being captured, their gradual approach on this new, north-eastern front line only increases the anxiety for those living there. \nResidents fleeing towns and villages close to the fighting have been arriving in their hundreds at an aid hub in Kharkiv city. \nThey are being given food, and registering for shelter after leaving their homes.\nVeniamin, an 87-year-old resident of Vovchansk told the BBC he had left the besieged town by bicycle on Sunday \u2013 cycling 15km to safety. \nHe said as well as heavy shelling \"machine gun fire could be heard from both sides\".\n\"I had to run because it was impossible to be there,\u201d he said, adding the town had been cut off from electricity and water supplies.\nLiuda, another resident of Vovchansk, fled the town with her family, who lived in a village nearby. \n\"We escaped when we heard machine guns, the fire was coming close,\" she said. \nLiuda had remained in Vovchansk when the Russians first invaded in early 2022.\n\"We survived and got used to it,\" she said. \nLife improved when Ukrainian forces returned later that year, but she said this new Russian offensive \"was very scary\".\nNadia, her husband and mother had fled the village of Liptsy \u2013 near to where Russian forces have also made another incursion across the border. \nThey packed their belongings, including two dogs, into an old rusting Lada car and made the journey to Kharkiv. \nHer husband had wanted to stay \u201cbecause everything we had would be lost\u201d if they left. \nHowever, she said they were told by the local administration to leave or risk being stranded. \nNadia said: \"We lived under occupation in 2022, I don\u2019t want to be under occupation again.\"\nKostyantyn Tymchenko, who has also left Vovchansk, said he was shocked by how close the fighting was.\n\"On the one side [of the Vovcha River] are [Russians], on the other - ours,\" he said.\n\"Tanks are constantly approaching, shooting back and then leaving. I thought it would be okay. I was shocked. I wish I had known in advance.\"\nAway from Kharkiv, two people were killed by shelling in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, the Moscow-installed mayor has claimed. \nAnd at least three people were killed by a strike on an industrial zone in Krasnodon, known as Sorokyne in Ukrainian, a Russian-held part of eastern Ukraine, the Moscow-backed local governor said.\nSeparately, a Ukrainian security source said Ukrainian forces had struck an oil terminal and electrical substat",
    "The whereabouts of a Chinese citizen journalist jailed for covering the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic is still unknown a day after she was expected to have been released, having served her four year sentence.\nSupporters say they are unclear if Zhang Zhan had actually been freed - although rights groups had said authorities were likely to keep tight-lipped on her status.\nThe 40-year-old former lawyer is one of several activists who had run into trouble with Chinese authorities for their Covid-19 reporting. Some have been detained while others have gone missing.\nShe was found guilty of \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble\", a frequent charge against activists in China.\nMedia watchdogs and human rights groups had said that Ms Zhang was wrongfully prosecuted. They had called for her release because of her deteriorating health.\nThere is \"huge concern\" about the safety of Ms Zhang after she is released, Reporters Without Borders advocacy officer Aleksandra Bielakowska said.\n\"In China, journalists detained for their work often remain under detention or surveillance even upon completion of their prison terms,\" she said.\n\"I honestly think we will have no updates soon. They will probably try to detain her in secret location, or keep her out of the eye sight for some time.\"\nOne of Ms Zhang's lawyers told BBC Chinese that her \"personal freedom will still be restricted\", adding that she will now live with her parents in Shanghai.\nFrom her base in Shanghai, Ms Zhang travelled to Wuhan in February 2020 to document what she saw on the streets and in hospitals. \nHer livestreams and essays were widely viewed on social media, and she continued to produce them despite threats from authorities. \nOne of her livestreamed clips showed how she kept her camera rolling while an official warned her to \"stop filming or [he would] get mad\".\n\"Maybe I have a rebellious soul... I'm just documenting the truth. Why can't I show the truth?\" she said in an interview with an independent filmmaker, a clip of which was obtained by the BBC. \n\"I won't stop what I'm doing, because this country can't go backwards.\"\nThis was thought to be her last interview before she was detained.\nMs Zhang had posted more than 100 videos on her YouTube Channel, WeChat and Twitter, before being reported missing on 14 May 2020. \nThe next day, authorities announced that she was detained by police in Shanghai. She was charged in November that year and was sentenced the following month.\nMs Zhang went on a hunger strike in the first few months of detention, and her lawyer had said then that she was being force-fed through a tube.\nShe remained on partial strike until July 2023, when her weight had reportedly plummeted to just 37kg - half of what it was before her detention.\nShe was also suffering from severe malnutrition, gastrointestinal disease, and low white blood cell count, RSF said.\n\"Journalist Zhang Zhan, who courageously risked her life by informing the public on the outbreak of Covid-19 in Wuhan, is at risk of dying if she does not receive extensive medical treatment,\" the organisation said in a statement in September last year.\nThe significance of Ms Zhang's case will rest on what happens after she is released, said Jerome Cohen, an expert in Chinese law.\n\"Most released human rights advocates are kept quiet through informal means of suppression. Some try to leave the country and are successful in continuing to report on human rights violations in China but they are exceptions,\" said Prof Cohen.\nA lawyer for Ms Zhang said her family had been \"frequently approached\" by the police during her detention, and they were instructed not to discuss the case with others.\n\"Citizen journalists were the only source of uncensored, first-hand information about the Covid-19 outbreak in China. \n\"Because they work independently of state-controlled media, citizen journalists face constant harassment for exposing information the government would rather keep quiet,\" Amnesty International said in a statement.\nWhen the pandemic first struck in early 2020, the Chinese internet - despite being heavily censored - was inundated with messages describing government cover-ups and failures in the healthcare system. \nBut the state's censorship machine doubled down to suppress the unprecedented online anger. \nSeveral channels went quiet, posts were swiftly erased and some activists like Ms Zhang received explicit warnings from the authorities.\nAmong the most well-known internationally was the case of whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang, who had tried to warn his colleagues about a \"Sars-like virus\". \nDr Li died in February 2020 after contracting Covid-19. It was later revealed that he had been under investigation for \"disturbing social order\" by \"making false comments\". His death sparked an outpouring of support on social media, but the posts were periodically scrubbed.\nThe Communist Party filled state media with positive stories about its Covid-19 response.

She said no.\nAsked if Oliver had any previous history of choking, her response was again no.\nMrs Steeper said: \"The majority of his food at home was purees.\"\nThe inquest heard Oliver, who only had two front teeth, had been eating pureed meals at home, and his parents had been assured by nursery workers that solids could be blended before being fed to him.\nShe said: \"We assumed that food would be pureed. He wasn't able to chew. That made us extra cautious.\"\nThe inquest heard how Mrs Steeper intended to speak with staff at the nursery after finding the pineapple chunks in her son\u2019s vomit.\nShe said: \"He had been given fruit salad at nursery. It was clear it wasn't pureed. I said I was going to speak to the nursery the following week.\"\nJurors heard Mrs Steeper considered emailing the nursery immediately, but did not want to \"rock the boat\" or make staff feel she was \"being pushy\".\nOliver then spent some time off nursery with tonsillitis.\nMrs Steeper said she tried to raise the issue with staff in person when she dropped him off on 23 September, but said: \"I felt rushed because I was dropping him off late.

    "Prosecutors in Tunisia have arrested seven more sport officials over the failure to display the national flag at a swimming competition on Friday. \nThe heads of the Tunisian swimming federation and the national anti-doping agency were detained on Saturday after President Kais Saied reacted with fury to its absence.\nSeven other officials were summoned on Monday. \nIn response to sanctions by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), which had banned the Tunisian flag from competitions, it was covered on Friday during a championship organised by the national swimming federation at the Rad\u00e8s Olympic pool.\nHours after the incident,  Mr Saied visited the pool, raised the flag and sang the national anthem. \nCalling the flag-covering an \"act of aggression\", he declared: \"Tunisia cannot tolerate this.\"\nIn a meeting with Prime Minister Ahmed Hachani and other cabinet members, Mr Saied said \"Tunisia comes before the Olympic Committee and before any other committees\".\nIn a statement issued in the early hours of Saturday, the Tunisian youth and sports ministry announced the dissolution of the swimming federation board, as well as the dismissal of the head of the Tunisian anti-doping agency Anad and a sports official based in Ben Arous, near Tunis.\nThe decision followed \"instructions\" by President Saied \"to take immediate measures... against those responsible for the incident of hiding the national flag\", the statement said.\nMr Saied controls almost all levers of power in Tunisia.\nAnnouncing the ban on 30 April, Wada said Tunisia would not host major sporting events and is barred from flying its flag at sporting events, including the upcoming Paris Olympics and Paralympic Games in Paris in July and August, until it complied with the revised global anti-doping code introduced in 2021. \nOn 3 May the Tunisian sports ministry announced that it had issued a decree mandating adherence to the new code, in response to the sanctions, and urged \"expedited procedures\" to ensure sanctions were lifted ahead of the Olympic and Paralympic games. \nThe sanctions have not yet been lifted. \nTunisia has one defending Olympic swimming champion, the 2021 400m freestyle gold medallist Ahmed Hafnaoui.\nThe 21-year-old said on 8 May that he was suffering from an unspecified injury and might not compete in Paris.\nPresident Kais Saied came to power in 2019 and in July 2022 Tunisians voted to give him sweeping new powers in a move critics say risked the return of authoritarian rule to the country.\nMr Saied has justified his actions by saying he needed new powers to break a cycle of political paralysis and economic decay.\n\n",
    "This year's Cannes Film Festival gets under way on Tuesday, with events off screen likely to be as dramatic as the storylines in the selection of star-studded film premieres.\nThe hotly-anticipated films in the line-up include director Francis Ford Coppola's self-financed project Megalopolis, while attendees will get a glimpse of Sebastian Stan as a young Donald Trump in The Apprentice.\nThe fortnight's biggest films will also include the latest instalment of George Miller's Mad Max franchise.\nBut there are rumours that a string of actors and film-makers could be publicly accused of sexual abuse; there's a threat of strike by festival workers; and an Iranian director is expected to attend days after fleeing his home country after receiving a prison sentence.\nHere are some things to look out for as Cannes rolls out its red carpet.\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga is a prequel to the Oscar-winning Mad Max: Fury Road, which was incredibly well received when it premiered at Cannes in 2015.\nGeorge Miller returns as director, with Anya Taylor-Joy taking over from Charlize Theron as a younger Imperator Furiosa.\nChris Hemsworth and Tom Burke also star in this apocalyptic, all-action thriller.\nIf you thought your hobbies were expensive, spare a thought for veteran director Francis Ford Coppola, who has spent $120m (\u00a395m) making Megalopolis.\nStarring Adam Driver as an architect rebuilding a city hit by tragedy, Laurence Fishburne and Dustin Hoffman also feature.\nAfter winning the top Cannes award, the Palme d'Or, in the 1970s for The Conversation and Apocalypse Now,  the 85-year-old could get his hands on the accolade once again.\nIf you thought Cannes might provide a bit of respite from the build-up to the US presidential election, then you were mistaken.\nThat's because the story of a young Donald Trump's route into politics has been documented in the film The Apprentice.\nDirector Ali Abbasi has cast Sebastian Stan as a young Trump and Maria Bakalova as his first wife, Ivana.\nCritics have also expressed their interest in seeing Succession star Jeremy Strong's take on Trump's mentor Roy Cohn.\nThe Palme d'Or is the biggest prize at Cannes, and once again there's stiff competition.\nHeading the jury is Barbie director Greta Gerwig, who is joined by stars including French actor Eva Green and Oscar nominee Lily Gladstone.\nThe jury is an international affair, with Spanish director JA Bayona, Turkish screenwriter Ebru Ceylan and Italian actor and producer Pierfrancesco Favino also on the panel.\nAs well as The Apprentice and Megalopolis, the films in contention include Payal Kapadia\u2019s All We Imagine as Light, and British director Andrea Arnold's latest feature Bird.\nEmma Stone, who won best actress at this year's Oscars for Poor Things, is reunited with director Yorgos Lanthimos for their new film, Kinds of Kindness.\nAlso in competition is The Seed of the Sacred Fig by Iranian director Mohammad Rasoulof, who was sentenced to eight years in jail last week for \"collusion against national security\".\nHowever, his lawyer said on Monday that he had secretly left the country and would be in Cannes for the film's premiere.\nThree-time Oscar winner Meryl Streep and Star Wars creator George Lucas are also set to receive honorary awards at the festival.\nPast Cannes festivals have been rocked by the MeToo movement, and once again it could be in the spotlight.\nIt's thought that new allegations could be made by women about abuse in the European entertainment industry.\nThere are rumours in the French media of a secret list of alleged abusive leading actors and directors, which could be published during the event.\nFrench director and actor Judith Godr\u00e8che also has a short film, Moi Aussi, debuting at the festival, about victims of sexual violence.\nShe is seen as one of the key figures in the French MeToo movement and accused two directors of abusing her as a teenager in the 1980s.\nMeanwhile, the event could grind to a halt altogether if a threatened strike by the festival's freelance workers goes ahead over proposed changes to French labour law.",
    "Prince Harry and Meghan's charitable Archewell Foundation has been listed as \"delinquent\" by US authorities, after a cheque for registration failed to arrive.\nA spokesman for the couple says all the charity documents were filed on time, but the required cheque appears not to have been received.\nIt has been re-sent so the issue will be \"quickly resolved\", says Archewell.\nUntil then Archewell is not allowed to operate as a charity.\nThe letter from the State of California Department of Justice, sent on 3 May, gives a \"delinquency notice\" to the Archewell Foundation.\nIt warns that the process for being on the \"registry of charities and fundraisers\" has not been completed and as such Archewell cannot carry out charitable activities, such as \"soliciting or disbursing charitable funds\".\nThe charity, which gave grants of $1.2m (\u00a3960,000) last year, says that a cheque sent alongside registration information was not received by the California authorities, triggering the \"delinquency\" notice.\nA spokesman for Prince Harry and Meghan said that once Archewell had been notified, a \"new cheque has been mailed\".\nThis registration problem was not about tax filings, which a spokesman said had been submitted in full and paid on time.\nTax filings for 2022, published last year, showed Archewell had holdings of $11m (\u00a39m) and made donations including $100,000 (\u00a380,000) for the Halo Trust, a mine-clearing charity once supported by Princess Diana.\nOther funded projects included $200,000 (\u00a3160,000) for a \"gender justice\" project in Washington, $125,000 (\u00a3100,000) for a civil-rights charity and $100,000 (\u00a380,000) for a project promoting responsible use of technology.\nArchewell was founded when Prince Harry and Meghan moved to the US and stepped down from being working royals.\nEarlier this year there was an overhaul of the couple's operation, with a new sussex.com website, under the title of the Office of Prince Harry and Meghan.\nThe couple have just completed a visit to Nigeria, following celebrations in the UK to mark the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games.",
    "People claiming universal credit and working fewer than 18 hours a week will be expected to look for more work, after a change to the welfare system that starts on Monday.\nBefore now, claimants only had to work 15 hours.\nThe new rule is part of broader reforms to the welfare system that the government announced last month.\nThe Department for Work and Pensions said the rule change meant 180,000 people would have to work more.\nThe government was also \"radically expanding\" the support available to help people \"on their journey off benefits\", said Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride.\nBut the charity Turn2Us urged the government to reconsider the policy, which it said could have a \"drastic impact\" on people with long-term health conditions, caring responsibilities or with irregular incomes.\nThe 18 hours a week - which is around half a full-time working week - applies to people earning the minimum wage. Someone earning more per hour can work fewer hours, as long as their total earnings meet the Administrative Earnings Threshold (AET) set by the government.\nFrom Monday the AET will be \u00a3892, which is what you would earn in a month if you worked for 18 hours a week at the minimum wage.\nIf a claimant is earning less than the threshold they will be asked to look for more, or better paid, work.\nIf a couple is earning less than \u00a31,437 between them, they will be expected to try to increase their earnings.\nClaimants who earn less than the threshold will be given more \"intensive\" Jobcentre support, the DWP said, including more frequent meetings with a work coach.\nIf someone does not engage with the process, or take work that is available, they could lose some of their benefits. \nThe prime minister said the changes to the minimum hours requirement would help people on universal credit \"progress towards financial independence, which is better for them and for economic growth\".\nHowever, Michael Clarke, from Turn2Us, a charity which supports people in financial difficulty, expressed \"serious concern\" over the change.\n\"It\u2019s vital that the support system truly supports, rather than penalises those it's meant to help,\" he said.\n\"These changes severely challenge those managing jobs with irregular or fluctuating incomes and carefully balanced responsibilities like childcare.\nHe said the system failed to allow for \"the reality of those on the financial edge\".\n\"For single mothers and others on razor-thin margins, these adjustments risk tipping them into crisis, exacerbating financial instability and mental stress as they struggle to meet these new demands,\" he said.\nLast month Mr Sunak outlined his plans to reform the welfare system further, if the Conservatives win the next election.\nHe said welfare should not be \"a lifestyle choice\". He plans to change the rules so that welfare recipients who do not take work, or try  to meet the conditions set out, for a year would lose all of their benefits.\nMr Sunak also wants to tackle what he called the \"sick note culture\", by changing the process for being certified as too ill to work. He plans to reform the payments system for people unable to work due to long-term physical or mental illness or disability.\nDisability charities described the plans as \"a full-on assault on disabled people\".",
    "The European Union has lodged an official complaint with the organisers of the Eurovision Song Contest over its refusal to let participants wave the bloc's flag at last Saturday's final. \n\"Such actions cast a shadow over what is meant to be a joyous occasion for peoples across Europe,\" European Commission Vice-President Margaritis Schinas wrote to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).\nThe complaint comes after politician Dorin Frasineanu from the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party said he had been \"denied entry to Eurovision with the EU flag\".\nAccording to EBU rules only flags of \"participating countries and the rainbow/pride flags\" are allowed inside the contest venue. \nA spokesperson for the EBU said the flag policy this year was \"the same as 2023\". \n\"With the EU being targeted by malicious and authoritarian actors, EBU's decision contributed to discrediting a symbol that brings together all Europeans,\" said Mr Schinas in his complaint.\nHe demanded the broadcaster \"explain the rationale behind this decision and attribute responsibility where it is due\".\n\"The incoherence in the EBU's stance left myself and millions of viewers wondering for what and for whom the Eurovision Song Contest stands,\" Mr Schinas added.\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday afternoon, European Commission spokesperson Eric Mamer said it was \"completely regrettable that the flag of all the EU members taking part in the competition... could not be shown\".\nThe European Commission will \"make the point very clearly that there's no reason not to allow this flag, in fact we would encourage the EBU to allow and ensure it is shown\", Mr Mamer said. \nHe also clarified that as the Eurovision Song Contest was not organised by the EU, they could only make their views known and encourage the EBU to \"understand it was a mistake\".\nIn an interview with Politico, Mr Schinas said the EBU's decision to ban EU flags during Saturday's Eurovision final was a gift to \"the enemies of Europe\". \n\u201cWho wins from banning the EU flag from Eurovision?\u201d the commissioner added. \u201cOnly the Eurosceptics and the enemies of Europe.\u201d\nIn a statement to the BBC, the EBU said the flag policy had been agreed with SVT, the Swedish broadcaster and host of this year's contest, but stressed this did not feature an explicit provision to ban EU flags. \n\"As in previous years such as 2023, SVT's policy was to allow the flags of the participating countries and the rainbow flags. \n\"There has never been an express ban on the EU flag in the written policy,\" an EBU spokesperson said. \n\"Due to heightened geopolitical tensions, the flag policy was more rigorously enforced by security at this year's event.\"\nMEP and former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt wrote on X: \"As the EU flag is banned from Eurovision, people risk being beaten to demand a European path for Georgia. \n\"Freedom, democracy can never be taken for granted!\"\nThe row follows a string of controversies that marred this year's song contest, including the last-minute expulsion of Dutch entrant Joost Klein, the withdrawal of a contestant from rehearsals and another contestant breaking the rules with an on-stage speech calling for peace. \nThere were also tensions over Israel's presence in the competition and pro-Palestinian protests outside the venue.\nThe EU flag was not the only one under scrutiny, with the contest's winner Nemo - a 24-year-old Swiss musician who uses they/them pronouns - said they had to smuggle their own non-binary flag into the venue because Eurovision had refused to allow it.\nNemo said they \"did it anyway\", before calling out the \"double standards\" of the organisers who were reported to have forced some fans to throw away their non-binary flags before being allowed in.

    "The close relationship between a Saudi-backed football club and a local authority  has been criticised by human rights campaigners.\nBBC File on 4 has discovered a senior Newcastle City Council officer wrote to Newcastle United (NUFC) co-owner Amanda Staveley asking her to lobby government ministers over repairs to the Tyne Bridge when funding from the Department for Transport stalled.\nSaudi Arabia's human rights record was raised when the club was taken over in 2021, but there are concerns it is being ignored by a council desperate for investment.\nNUFC declined to comment. The Saudi Embassy in the UK and Ms Staveley have not responded. The council said close co-operation with the football club was beneficial for the city. \nA spokesman for the local authority said the investment it brought to the city \"ultimately puts money in the pockets of all our residents\".\n\nLast year, Ms Staveley, a minority shareholder who has become the face of the club\u2019s Saudi ownership, asked senior council officer Michelle Percy to prepare a briefing ahead of a meeting she was having with Lord Dominic Johnson, a UK investment minister.\nThe briefing concentrated on attracting Saudi investment to the north-east of England.\nEmails obtained through a Freedom of Information (FOI) request by the campaign group NUFC Fans Against Sportswashing, and seen by File on 4, reveal Ms Percy then wrote to Ms Staveley in January.\nShe complained a grant for the restoration of the Tyne Bridge had not been signed off by the government and asked for help in \"reaching out to the PM and ministers at a high level\".\nMs Staveley then wrote to two figures in government, whose names have been redacted, asking for help to \"expedite the process of releasing this vital funding\".\nWithin three weeks, the government confirmed it was awarding the council \u00a335m to help restore the bridge.\nThe Department for Transport (DfT) said, by the time Ms Staveley\u2019s email was received, the business case for the Tyne Bridge was already in the final stages of approval and the email played no part in the release of the funding.\nFile on 4 has discovered the council backtracked on plans to create a forum to discuss human rights with supporters and campaigners, which it proposed when the football club was bought by the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) in October 2021.\nAt the time, the Premier League received \"legally binding assurances\" from the PIF, which provided 80% of funds for the deal, that the Saudi state would not control Newcastle United.\nHowever, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed Bin Salman, is the chairman of the PIF and its governor is Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the director of Newcastle United.\nSaudi Arabia has been widely criticised for human rights abuses, including the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Embassy in Istanbul in 2018. \nIt was accused last week of ordering the killing of villagers who stood in the way of a futuristic city under construction in the desert called NEOM.\nThe council said it \"shares\" concerns about human rights across the world but argued it was up to the UK government to address these issues.\nResults from another FOI submitted by the campaign group suggest the council asked the club for \u00a323m to help fund a free meal for every child in the city every day for a year.\nThe local authority has had to cut \u00a3369m from its budget since 2010.\nDirector of human rights research group Fair Square, Nick McGeehan, said: \"I think it's a huge problem when a cash-strapped local council has very strong links to a capital rich, very wealthy foreign state, particularly when that foreign state is deeply autocratic and anti-democratic.\n\"That poses a risk to the council because it means, in certain situations, the council is not going to stand up for local values or principles, but will keep quiet in order to satisfy the commercial interests of its foreign partner.\"\nFollow BBC Newcastle on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Billionaire philanthropist Melinda French Gates has said she will resign as a co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\"This is not a decision I came to lightly,\" Ms Gates wrote in a statement posted to X on Monday. \nHer last day of work will be 7 June. \nMs Gates started the foundation - the largest private body of its kind - in 2000 with her then-husband Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder.\nIn 2021, after 27 years of marriage, the pair announced their separation, but pledged to carry on with their joint philanthropic work. At the time of their split, the former couple said they would remain co-chairs and trustees of the organisation and that no changes to the foundation's structure were expected. \nThe Gates Foundation is among the most powerful groups in public health, with an endowment of more than $75bn (\u00a359.7bn) as of December. It spends billions of dollars every year on initiatives aimed at eradicating infectious diseases, reducing poverty and combatting climate change.\nAccording to the foundation's website, the couple donated more than $36bn (\u00a328bn) of their own wealth to it from 1994 to 2018.\n\"I am immensely proud of the foundation that Bill and I built together,\" Ms Gates wrote in her statement adding that under an agreement with Mr Gates, she will now have an additional $12.5bn for her own charitable work on women and families. \nIn 2015, Ms Gates founded investment company Pivotal Ventures, a separate entity from the Gates Foundation, which focuses on removing barriers to opportunity for women and minority groups. \n\"This is a critical moment for women and girls in the US and around the world - and those fighting to protect and advance equality are in urgent need of support,\" she wrote in Monday's statement. \nMr Gates said he was \"sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work\".\nThe Microsoft founder remains one of the world's richest men, with a net worth of more than $130.3bn, according to Forbes.

    "Shares in GameStop, the video game retailer whose popularity among pandemic-era traders helped coin the idea of a meme stock, are surging again. \nTheir rise follows the online reappearance of Keith Gill, known as \"Roaring Kitty\", who was credited with helping the struggling firm's shares explode in January 2021, contrary to the bets of many professional Wall Street firms. \nGameStop shares jumped more than 70% in morning trade on Monday, to more than $30, as investors piled into the stock.\nThough the price later fell a bit, it marked their highest level since 2022.\nMr Gill was one of the most high-profile figures among the swarm of independent traders who swapped investment tips online and drove a buying frenzy for Gamestop and other firms, putting pressure on hedge funds who had been expecting the shares to fall.\nShares in GameStop crashed back to earth within weeks. \nThey have spent much of this year trading for less than $15 apiece, after the firm announced job cuts and a decline in sales at the end of last year.\nThe story of the surprise rise in GameStop shares, which led to similar moves for other companies including Odeon Cinemas-owner AMC, sparked congressional hearings about market manipulation and inspired the 2023 movie \"Dumb Money\", which starred Paul Dano and Seth Rogen.\nMr Gill told Congress he used social media for fun and called the idea he was pushing the shares on unwitting investors \"preposterous\".\nHe has not posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, since mid 2021. \nThen on Sunday Mr Gill posted a drawing of a man leaning forward in a chair, as if gearing up for action.\nHe later followed up with two posts on Monday morning, which appeared to allude to his return.\nThe meme-stock phenomenon has been part of a wider increase in trading by retail investors - people not working for investment houses or other private firms.\nAnalysts had argued the original rise of meme stocks was driven by the surge in savings and time many households had during the pandemic, thanks to government support programmes and the shutdown of many in-person activities.\nHowever with markets rising again this year, trading firms such as Charles Schwab and Robinhood have reported another uptick in new accounts and activity by retail investors.",
    "A group of young people from County Tyrone are helping to keep a centuries-old skill alive.\nEvidence of glassmaking in Tyrone dates to early medieval Ireland and the first Irish glass cutting factory was founded in the county in 1771.\nNow a group of teenage apprentices are learning the craft.\nIt comes almost 15 years after Northern Ireland's largest glass cutting factory, Tyrone Crystal, closed in 2010.\nAt the time, many feared the art would be lost in Northern Ireland in the process.\nBut in 2021 a community-based glassworks was set up in Coalisland.\nInitially, Tyrone Crafted Glass consisted of only former master cutters from the old Tyrone Crystal factory.\nBut the group recently opened a new workshop in Dungannon that has a focus on training the next generation of glass cutters.\nJames Finnegan is 14 years old and lives in Dungannon. \nHe is one of three current glass cutting apprentices.\n\"I've cut wine glasses, tumblers, pint glasses, any kind of glass, I've basically cut it,\" he said.\nHe added: \"I really enjoy it because it's something different, you can make your own designs, you can be unique about it.\n\"I would love to be doing this kind of work the rest of my life and eventually train new apprentices myself.\"\nApprentice Gracie Carberry, 16, from Coalisland, said: \"I was so surprised about how therapeutic glass cutting was, you just get in the zone and you're not aware of people around you.\n\"I've done a good few of my own designs that are on display in the workshop that I'm really proud of.\"\nLiatriz Morais lives in Dungannon.\nThe 15 year old became a glass cutting apprentice as a result of doing research for her art coursework.  \n\"I first came across glass cutting during a school trip to the workshop and I was hooked,\" she said.\nShe added: \"I was cutting some designs and one day I saw a glass that had some wheat cuttings on it and got inspired.\n\"Mine ended up looking like a feather and I just went with it and thought it was pretty cool.\"\nArchaeological excavations in the mid 1980s discovered that Dunmisk fort in County Tyrone was discovered to have some of the earliest evidence of glass making in early medieval Europe.\nCormac McAleer is from the local historical society where the site was discovered.\nHe said: \"People from this area are proud of this site, it's really significant to have one of the earliest glass making sites on the island, especially when the material would go on to be so important to the area.\"\nArchaeologists found that Dunmisk had some of the first evidence for glass-making to be produced in Early Christian Ireland. \nIt proved that both glass-making and glass-working occurred and that not all glass was imported in Ireland during this period.\nDr Patrick Gleeson is a senior lecturer in archaeology at Queen's University Belfast.\nHe said: \"Dunmisk is a very rare site and it's very important, because glass making is very unusual for the period from the 5th to the 11th century AD.\n\"I'd say there are only a very small handful of sites, elsewhere in western Europe during the medieval period that could parallel it.\"\nOne of the first glass and crystal-cutting factories in Ireland can also be tracked back to County Tyrone.\nIn 1771 a glassworks was opened in the townland of Drumreagh on the outskirts of Coalisland.\nThe next major development in the local industry came in 1971 when Tyrone Crystal was created.\nThe company was founded by Catholic priest Fr Austin Eustace, who was a nuclear physicist as well as an expert on glass production.\nHe started the business as a solution to rising unemployment in the area at the time.\nThe Dungannon-based business was a success as crystal became popular for wedding and retirement gifts in the 1970s and 1980s.\nIts glass and crystal products were shipped across the world.\nHowever, the company experienced a downturn as a demand for its products decreased. \nThe Tyrone Crystal factory closed in 2010 and this saw the glass-cutting craft virtually disappear from the county.\nAlmost 15 years later, ex-workers from Tyrone Crystal have been working on a project introducing glass cutting skills to a whole new generation.\nTyrone Crafted Glass is a community-based glassworks that is based out of Dungannon Enterprise Centre.\nIt is the brainchild of husband and wife team Gary and Ciara Currie.\nGary said: \"The reality is we aren't getting any younger, so it takes the youth to come in and carry on the craft.\n\"Our three current apprentices will be fully qualified in the next couple of years, so that in 20 or 30 years' time, they can pass their skills onto the next generation.\"\nPaul McBride worked in Tyrone Crystal for decades and is training them on the practical skills involved in glass cutting.\nHe said: \"It's about building the young people's confidence, you start off with easy cuts and work from there, but they are really coming on at it.\n\"It's just great to see young people interested in something I did for most of my life and it means it won't die away.\"\nTyrone Crafted Glass",

    "Welcome to the Sunak and Starmer show and welcome to the next four, five, six or seven months of your life.\nEven if you pay only fleeting attention to the goings-on in UK politics, you have probably spotted we are seeing rather a lot more of the prime minister and the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.\nThis could begin to feel, perhaps it already feels, like a very, very long general election campaign.\nOn Friday, Rishi Sunak was talking to economics journalists while Sir Keir was talking to political journalists. Today, Mr Sunak is in London while his opponent is in the West Midlands.\nIn big picture terms, we are seeing a classic dynamic being road-tested by either side.\n\nBetter the devil you know and be careful what you wish for, from the long time incumbent party of government.\nTime for change, say the opposition.\nRishi Sunak, who was 44 yesterday and is the best part of 20 years younger than Keir Starmer, is attempting to personify the future.\n\u201cMore will change in the next five years than in the last 30,\u201d he claims.\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced that the next few years will be some of the most dangerous yet most transformational our country has ever known.\u201d\nThe pitch is that he is the man \u201cfluent in the industries of the future\u201d as one senior figure put it to me.\nThey are thinking of artificial intelligence, and also the commitment a few weeks back to spend 2.5% of national income on defence by 2030, a promise that outflanked Labour on the topic.\nBut the challenge he has got, to state the obvious, is the evidence piling up is plenty of the electorate, whatever people make of Labour, is fed up with the Conservatives.\nThose around Sir Keir say the chaos and division within the Tory party is illustrated by the fact that, on the same day the prime minister is speaking, the former Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick is too.\nMany see that as part of a fledgling leadership bid to replace Mr Sunak after an anticipated general election loss.\n\nSir Keir is aiming to look like a winner today, by surrounding himself with his newly elected mayors on the soil of Labour\u2019s most eye catching victory, in the West Midlands, where Richard Parker beat the Conservative Andy Street.\nHe will return to his central critique of the near decade and a half of Conservative government: the absence of sustained economic growth.\nLabour want to emphasise what they call the \u2018politics of place\u2019, and the role of \u2018an active state', including greater powers for directly elected mayors, to drive better and more even economic growth across the country.\nPerhaps easier said than done.\nAnd they will return to what they think is their most powerful observation about the Conservatives \u2013 that people, on average, are poorer on the eve of this forthcoming general election, than they were immediately after the last one in 2019.",
    "A council has blamed a drafting error after a non-league football club was told women would be banned from playing at the ground.\nReal Bedford was granted a 15-year lease in April but said new terms from Bedford Council, which include a rent increase, were unreasonable.\nClub chairman Peter McCormack said he would cease negotiations and called on Bedford mayor Tom Wootton to resign.\nThe council said it was an error and its new terms did not reference gender.\nThe club claimed the council asked for \u00a310,000 per annum in rent for a period of three years.\nThat rent would then increase by a further \u00a310,000 every year after the third annual anniversary of the agreement.\nMr McCormack said the council threatened to terminate the club's lease if the ground was used for anything other than \"senior men's first-team football\".\nThe chairman called it a \"direct attack\" on the women's team and said the terms were \"not only unreasonable but discriminatory\".\nHe said there were also \"vague termination clauses that give the council undue power to evict us\". \nHe called on the mayor to resign immediately due to \"his unacceptable handling of this matter, specifically with the effective ban he wants to place on women's football\".\nA council spokesperson confirmed the authority had given a 15-year lease at McMullen Park to Real Bedford with a break clause at three years.\n\"This decision was made in accordance with our procedure for lease renewals. There was a drafting error which was rectified within half an hour of the initial issue being raised to include all football.

    "Scientists say they have identified the biggest climate change threats to one of Scotland's most fragile environments.\nSt Kilda more than 40 miles (64km) west of the Western Isles is home to thousands of sea birds, and also unique sub-species of mouse and wren.\nA new study suggests rising temperatures, more frequent and severe storms and changes to ocean currents pose the greatest risks to the archipelago.\nNational Trust for Scotland (NTS), which manages St Kilda, said it was already seeing the impact of warmer seas on the food chain that supports the islands' birds.\nSt Kilda, a group of small islands and rocky sea stacks, were abandoned by its last 36 islanders in 1930.\nThe main island of Hirta is inhabited on a temporary basis by visiting NTS workers and also volunteers, scientists and contractors who work at small Ministry of Defence site.\nThe archipelago is a Unesco dual World Heritage Site, the status recognising its cultural and natural qualities.\nScientists looked for climate change threats using an assessment tool called the Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI).\nSusan Bain, NTS manager for St Kilda, said the study warned that in the future the trust would face increasingly difficult challenges managing the archipelago.\nShe said: \"Warming sea temperatures are already impacting on the food chain for the hundreds of thousands of seabirds who breed here each summer, and some species are at risk of disappearing from St Kilda forever. \n\"Changing currents could compound this even further, fundamentally changing the habitats and with that the types of birds that can thrive here.\"\nA 2023 count of four seabird species suggested numbers had declined overall by 61%.\nMs Bain said stormier weather could damage historic properties on Hirta and make it harder for staff, volunteers and tourists to visit the islands.\nCVI assessments have been applied to world heritage properties in 15 countries.\nIn Scotland, Historic Environment Scotland (HES) and Australia's James Cook University have used the tool to examine the vulnerability of Neolithic heritage in Orkney, Edinburgh's Old and New Towns and the Roman Antonine Wall.\nCVI co-developer Prof Scott Heron said: \u201cPreparations continue for additional CVI applications, including analyses for... two other [Scottish] world heritage sites, New Lanark and the Forth Bridge.\"",
    "Keir Starmer would make the UK less safe, Rishi Sunak has claimed in a wide-ranging speech which previewed issues likely to come up in the election expected this year. \nThe PM said Labour would not match his pledges on defence including a commitment to boost defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2030. \nLabour has said it would meet the same target when conditions allow.\nAsked about the remarks, Sir Keir said security would be his \"first priority\".\nHe accused the Conservatives of \"hollowing out\" the armed forces and \"wasting billions of pounds on procurement\", adding that voters at the next election faced a choice between Labour \"or continuing with this government of chaos and division\". \nThe government has said it would meet its 2.5% pledge by shrinking the size of the civil service.\nThink tanks including the Royal Untied Services Institute and the Institute for Fiscal Studies have said the extra spending would also have to come from cuts to other departments. \nThe Conservatives are currently behind Labour in the polls and Mr Sunak faces an uphill struggle to turn things around before the next general election.\nIn his 30 minute speech - which sounded like the opening salvo in an election campaign and included a personal attack on the Labour leader - Mr Sunak described a future that was both a time of danger but also of transformation.\nHe warned of threats from an \"axis of authoritarian powers\" such as Russia, Iran, North Korea and China and spoke of the challenges to cyber security.\nHowever, he also argued there were reasons for optimism citing the potential of artificial intelligence to improve education and health. \nIn contrast to his conference speech last autumn, which had the theme of change, he also sought to defend the Conservatives' time in government, while attempting to personify the future.\nHe admitted that the party's record was not \"perfect\" and that he understood some people felt their \"confidence and pride\" in the country had been \"knocked\". \n\"I understand that, I accept it, I want to change it,\" he said.\n\"What I cannot accept is Labour saying all the worries you have are because of 14 years of Conservative government, that all you need to do is change the people in office and all these problems will magically disappear.\"\nHe argued that in difficult circumstances - including economic shocks and the Covid pandemic - the Conservatives had delivered in a number of areas such as restoring financial security, delivering Covid vaccines, reforming welfare and legalising equal marriage. \nHe accused Labour of trying to \"depress their way to victory\".\nHe also sought to define himself as a man of conviction in contrast to Sir Keir, who he said was \"trying to be everything to everyone\". \nReferencing last week's defection he said the Labour leader had gone from \"embracing Jeremy Corbyn to embracing Natalie Elphicke\".\nHe added that when challenging for the Conservative leadership in 2022 he had opposed Liz Truss's policies \"that imperilled our financial stability\".\n\"I was sooner prepared to lose than abandon what I believe so deeply is right for our country.\"\nAsked if he believed the Labour leader would make the country more unsafe, Mr Sunak said: \"We will keep this country safe and Keir Starmer's actions demonstrate he won't be able to do that.\"\nHe argued Labour had been \"crystal clear\" they would not match his pledge to increase defence spending to 2.5% by 2030. \nSir Keir Starmer told reporters that Mr Sunak's speech was his \"seventh reset in 18 months\". \nSpeaking as he met newly-elected Labour mayors in the West Midlands, he said the choice going into the election was \"between a changed Labour Party that puts the country first and party second or continuing with this government of chaos and division\".\n\"The first duty of any government is national security.

    "A group of current and former politicians from nine countries have demanded to be called as witnesses in the trial of Hong Kong\u2019s imprisoned media mogul and democracy activist, Jimmy Lai.\nThe group, including former UK Conservative party leader Iain Duncan Smith and Japan\u2019s former defence minister Gen Nakatani, say that they have been cited dozens of times in evidence presented during Mr Lai\u2019s national security case.\nDespite this, they have not formally been contacted about the trial - which the letter says \"undermines the integrity of the investigation\".\nMr Lai has been accused of colluding with foreign forces under the Beijing imposed national security law.\nIf found guilty, the 76-year-old founder of the now defunct pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily, is facing possible life in prison.\nHis case, which began last December after a year-long delay, has sparked an international outcry and is widely seen as a test of Hong Kong's judicial independence.\nIn a joint letter - seen exclusively by the BBC - the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance (IPAC) on China say its members have been cited more than 50 times in Jimmy Lai\u2019s national security trial, and have requested to submit evidence to the court.\n\u201cThe fact that IPAC as 'witnesses' or 'accomplices' to an alleged crime have never been approached by the Hong Kong authorities is revelatory of the degree to which the integrity of this trial is in question,\" said Luke De Pulford, the executive director of the IPAC.\n\"This case was never about the truth,\" Sir Iain added. \"But we now have an opportunity to see how far English common law used in Hong Kong, respected by the world over, has been traduced by the national security law of China.\"\nHong Kong insists it is still underpinned by the rule of law, upheld by a common law legal system inherited from the British.\nBeijing has also previously dismissed IPAC as being \"anti-China\".

    "MPs arrested for serious sexual or violent offences could be banned from attending Parliament under new plans approved on Monday. \nIt comes despite the government putting forward a motion that recommended MPs are only barred if they are charged. \nMPs voted 170 to 169 - a majority of one - for the threshold to be arrest instead. \nA union representing workers in Parliament said the move was an \"overdue victory for common sense\". \nHowever, some MPs had raised concerns it was unconstitutional and would deny constituents the right to representation in Parliament on the basis of the decision of a committee. \nCurrently, if an MP is accused of sexual wrongdoing, parliamentary authorities have no power to ban them. There have been cases where MPs have stayed away voluntarily pending investigation. \nA cross-party group of senior MPs worked on a plan to introduce new rules which initially proposed that a risk assessment would take place, determining whether an MP should be prevented from attending the parliamentary estate if they were arrested on suspicion of committing a violent or sexual offence. \nCommons leader Penny Mordaunt instead tabled a plan focusing on those who had been charged - a much higher bar.\nThe government said the policy had been revised following feedback from MPs, to take into consideration the \"detrimental impact that having no voice in Parliament can have on communities\".\nThe risk assessment would be carried out by a panel, appointed by the Commons Speaker, who would decide on appropriate measures, including exclusion from Parliament or from domestic or foreign travel funds.\nAny decision would remain confidential and an excluded MP could still apply for a proxy vote, meaning another MP could cast a vote in Parliament on their behalf. \nLiberal Democrat MP Wendy Chamberlain, who proposed the amendment to change the threshold to arrest, said this would align Parliament with other workplaces. \n\"As a former police officer\u2026 arrest on suspicion doesn't just take place on basis of an allegation,\" she told the Commons. \n\"Yes, some vexatious complaints do occur but what message do we send from this place if we say that our concern for this is actually more important than safeguarding?\"\nHer proposal was supported by other opposition MPs, as well as eight Conservatives, including former prime minister Theresa May, Laura Farris, the victims and safeguarding minister, and chairwoman of the Women and Equalities Committee Caroline Nokes.\nFormer shadow domestic violence minister Jess Phillips, who also supported the move, said she had spoken to victims of sexual assault by MPs who had told her they wanted the threshold to be arrest.\nReading out remarks from one victim, the Labour MP said: \"Exclusion at the point of charge sends a clear message to victims that not only will we not investigate unless a victim goes to the police but we won't act unless they're charged, which happens in less than 1% of cases. 'So what's the point?' was essentially what this victim said to me.\"\nShadow Commons leader Lucy Powell said the policy was \"long overdue\" and \"the bare minimum of what is required in the interests of safeguarding good working practices\". \nHowever, other MPs had argued for the threshold to be when an MP is charged with an offence. \nConservative MP Dame Karen Bradley, who chairs the Commons Procedure Committee, pointed out that \"charge is a public point, arrest is not public\". \nShe added that excluding the voice of MPs from the Commons was \"a very severe punishment for constituents\". \nFormer Conservative minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said it was \"unconstitutional\" that a small committee would have the power \"to deny constituents representation\" in Parliament. \nAnother former Tory minister David Davis also raised concerns that \"the people being penalised by this are our constituents, not us\". \nMike Clancy, general secretary of the Prospect union, which represents many workers in Parliament, said the proposals must be implemented as soon as possible. \n\"This should represent the end of MPs arrested for sexual or violent offences - and those sharing a workplace with them - receiving different treatment from everyone else in the country,\" he added.

    "Health Minister Robin Swann has said executive meetings in November 2020 on Covid rules were the \"lowest days\" he's ever experienced in politics.\nHe told the UK Covid-19 inquiry the behaviour at and leaking of the meetings in \"live time\" was wrong.\nThe meetings happened on 9-12 November 2020 when NI was experiencing a second surge in Covid cases.\nMr Swann criticised the DUP for deploying a cross-community vote to block some restrictions being extended.\nHe told the Covid inquiry: \"From my time in politics there have been some highs and lows - but those four days were the lowest I've ever experienced in politics, in regards to the behaviour... and how those meetings were actually portrayed.\"\nHe said that while the deployment of a cross-community vote was a legal tool available to parties at the executive, he questioned whether it was \"morally right\".\nIt is a mechanism that can be deployed on any issue in the executive, if three or more ministers ask for a vote to be taken on that basis.\nIt was originally designed to protect minority rights, but effectively gives parties with enough ministers a veto.\n\"The fact I, as a unionist minister, was bringing forward a recommendation that was then subject to a vote by another unionist party steps outside the rationale as to what that mechanism was created for,\" said Mr Swann.\nHe said the period was particularly challenging and that it allowed people who were looking an excuse not to follow Covid rules a reason, as the executive was not \"joined up\".\nHe also told the inquiry that the attendance of senior Sinn F\u00e9in politicians at the controversial funeral of republican Bobby Storey in June 2020 meant the executive lost confidence of the public.\nBut he welcomed an acceptance from Sinn F\u00e9in MLA Car\u00e1l N\u00ed Chuil\u00edn that she should not have attended the funeral in her capacity as a minister.\nEarlier Mr Swann told the inquiry the leaking of information from executive meetings during the Covid pandemic was \"tolerated rather than challenged\".\nHe said it was frustrating that information was often leaked \"in real time\" to the media.\nHe often felt it was a \"deliberate\" attempt to condition how the conversation about restrictions would go when the executive met, the minister said in evidence on Monday.\nHe said papers were often shared late with executive colleagues and would be leaked to the media, allowing a \"narrative\" to be established.\nHe added there were various attempts to stop the leaking of information, which became \"so endemic that it became tolerated rather than challenged\".\n\"At times there was a live feed from the meetings, which left it extremely challenging at times for ministers to be open\", Mr Swann said.\nInquiry chair Baroness Hallett asked him if banning electronic devices was ever discussed as an option, to which the minister responded that various attempts to stop leaking were made.\nMr Swann said there was one attempt at a leak inquiry undertaken by the then permanent secretary of the Department of Finance, Sue Gray.\nHe said he did not believe a finding ever came from that.\nMr Swann went on to describe how \"opportunities were lost\" during the pandemic as there had been no government in place for three years prior. \n\"Green sites could have been up and running to deal with cancer cases\" while simultaneously dealing with Covid, he said. \nHe added that social care was reduced to a \"Cinderella service\" due to the mounting pressure on the healthcare system. \nThe health minister said it was a \"lonely and challenging position\" as the sole Ulster Unionist minister in the executive during the pandemic. \nMr Swann was appointed health minister in January 2020 when power sharing at Stormont returned.\nBut he added that on recollection it was also a \"strength\" as he did not have to answer to party political colleagues.  \nHe said that during the pandemic, he believed he did have support from other parties.\nFirst Minister Michelle O'Neill is due to give evidence on Tuesday, with her former partner in the Executive Office, Baroness Foster, due to appear on Wednesday.\nDuring the pandemic Ms O'Neill was deputy first minister from January 2020 until February 2022, while Baroness Foster was first minister from January 2020 until June 2021.\nThe inquiry is due to conclude sitting in Belfast on Thursday, when Sue Gray, who is now chief of staff to Sir Keir Starmer, is due to give evidence.",
    "A UK aircraft has tested ground-breaking quantum technology that could pave the way for an unjammable back-up for GPS navigation systems.\nThe government, which helped fund the research, said it was the first test of its kind to be publicly acknowledged.\nWhile GPS is satellite-based, the new system is quantum-based - a term used to describe tech that is reliant on the properties of matter at very small scales.\nScience minister Andrew Griffith said the test flights were \"further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum\".\nGPS is a critically important system, used on planes ships and road vehicles and by the militarily, as well as helping your smartphone determine your location.\nBut signals from GPS satellites can be  jammed, or \"spoofed\" to give misleading location data.\nIn March, an RAF plane carrying UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory.\nFinland's flag carrier Finnair even had to suspend daily flights to Estonia's second largest city, Tartu, for a month, after two of its aircraft suffered GPS interference.\nExperts have accused Russia of causing disruption to satellite navigation systems affecting thousands of civilian flights. \nMany military technologies, including drones and missiles, use GPS.\nBut GPS jamming can also be carried out on a small scale, for example by people driving vehicles their employers have fitted with GPS trackers.\nGPS relies on receiving signals from space, but a GPS satellite emits no more power than a car headlight, meaning it can easily be jammed, experts say.\nThe new system uses a group of atoms, cooled to -273C, almost as cold as its possible to get. Because they are carried on the plane itself, they can't be interfered with by spoofing or jamming.\nThe aim is to use these atoms to measure the direction the plane is pointing in and its acceleration.\nAll of that combined could be used to determine where the plane is with a high degree of accuracy.\nIt is called a quantum system because that is the name of the science of very small particles.\nIndividual atoms are mind-boggling small - a hair is about a million atoms wide - and working on this scale is difficult enough on the ground.\nThe flight demonstrated that these atoms could be used in the very limited space, and generally challenging, environment of an aircraft.\n\nAccording to the government, this is the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and \"the first such flights worldwide that have been publicly acknowledged\".\nThe trials, which concluded earlier this month, involved quantum tech firm Infleqtion, in collaboration with aerospace companies BAE Systems and QinetiQ.\nBut at present, despite the tiny scale of quantum technology, the equipment itself is large. Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the project, said for that reason he thought the first application could be aboard ships, \"where there's a bit more space\".\nHowever, he told the BBC that in five to ten years it could be the size of a shoebox, and a thousand times more accurate than comparable systems.\nThere has been concern about the vulnerability of shipping to attacks on satellite navigation.\nMr White sees the system primarily as a back-up to GPS.\n\"You're not going to get rid of your satellite systems, they are very convenient,\" he said.\nSignals from GPS satellites can also be used as an extremely accurate way of telling the time.  The test flight also took a quantum clock on board to see if it could work as a backup if GPS were blocked. In the lab, Mr White said the best quantum clocks can be incredibly accurate.\n\"If you started them at the beginning of the universe, they may have lost a second by now,\" he said.\nMr White believes the test is a \"major milestone\" but acknowledges it will take time before the technology is in active use.\nKen Munro of Pen Test Partners, a cybersecurity firm that works in aviation, said the test was a \"big step in the right direction\", but added \"it would still be 10 to 20 years before we see any practical implementation\", in commercial aviation in the UK.",
    "Large parts of the UK government's Illegal Migration Act should not apply in Northern Ireland because they breach human rights laws, a judge has ruled in a major defeat for ministers. \nThe judge at NI's High Court said the law breaches the Windsor Framework.\nIt is the revised post-Brexit deal agreed between the UK and EU last year.\nThe ruling raises significant questions about the long-term viability of the plan to refuse some asylum seekers a hearing and send them to Rwanda.  \nIn his ruling, Mr Justice Humphreys also declared parts of the act to be incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights - an ultimate sanction from a UK court which sends unworkable legislation back to UK Parliament to be rethought. \nThe 2023 Illegal Migration Act (IMA) is a key part of the UK government's plan to stop English Channel crossings by people seeking asylum without prior permission to arrive. \nIt created laws that mean the Home Secretary must detain and remove anyone who arrives by that route and the plan had been to send them to Rwanda. That was until the Supreme Court ruled last year that the country was unsafe. \nParliament has since passed a law designating Rwanda as a safe country.\nThis key part of the IMA has been in limbo since then but is widely expected to come into action because it would make it easier to transfer people to the African nation. \nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said the NI court decision would not change the government's plan to send illegal migrants to Rwanda.\nThe Windsor Framework deals mostly with trade issues but also includes a human rights element.It commits the UK not to water down the human rights provisions that flow from the Good Friday Agreement, the 1998 deal which brought an end to 30 years of conflict in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles.\nThe judge found that several elements of the act do cause a \"significant\" diminution of the rights enjoyed by asylum seekers residing in Northern Ireland under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.\n\"I have found that there is a relevant diminution of right in each of the areas relied upon by the applicants,\" he said.\nDr Tony McGleenan KC, representing the government, indicated that an appeal may be considered.\n\"We'll be taking our instructions on the judgment and the position in terms of any further litigation will become clear,\" he said.\nThe legal challenge was brought by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and a 16-year-old asylum seeker from Iran who is residing in Northern Ireland.\nThe commission has welcomed the judgement.\nIt said it issued the legal challenge in \"its own name due to the significant concerns it has with the Illegal Migration Act and the effect on asylum seekers in Northern Ireland\".\nIt said it would now be \"considering the judgment in full and its implications\".\nMr Sunak said the court decision changes nothing about the government's plan to send illegal migrants to Rwanda.\nHe said the government is working to get flights off the ground to Rwanda soon and \"nothing will distract us from that or delivering to the timetable I set out\". \nHe added: \"We must start the flights to stop the boats.\"\nMr Sunak also said the government has been clear that its commitment to the Good Friday Agreement should not be interpreted as expanding to cover issues such as illegal migration.\n\"We will take all steps to defend that position, including through appeal,\" he said.\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Gavin Robinson said that the judgement \"does not come as a surprise\" but does \"blow the government's irrational claims that the Rwanda scheme could extend equally to Northern Ireland completely out of the water\". \nHe said that the government must \"prevent a fracture in immigration policy\" between different regions of the United Kingdom.\nMr Robinson said the UK Parliament should have the ability to make decisions on immigration that are \"applicable on a national basis\".\n\"If that were not the case, it would not only be a constitutional affront but would make Northern Ireland a magnet for asylum seekers seeking to escape enforcement,\" he said.\nThe teenage asylum seeker was represented by Phoenix Law.\nIts head of immigration and asylum, Sinead Marmion, welcomed Monday's ruling.\n\"The Good Friday Agreement has always been a beacon of human rights protections and hope,\" she said. \n\"Today, the court, through the Northern Ireland Protocol, has ensured those rights apply to the whole community - including asylum seekers.\"\nWhile the judgement covers specific issues in NI, it raises questions about how the courts will deal with what are likely to be a major assault on the wider Rwanda plan in the coming months. \nIt is likely to form part of a wider attack from critics who say ministers have created a series of laws as part of the Rwanda strategy that breach basic safeguards for all refugees in the UK.  \nThe First Division Association, the union representing senior officials in government, is already asking judges to rule whether the R",
    "Obesity jabs could cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes in people even if they fail to lose much weight, according to an analysis of a study funded by a drug manufacturer.\nResearchers looked at semaglutide - a prescription drug offered by the NHS - that supresses appetite and is sold under the brand names Wegovy and Ozempic.\nThey said the weekly shots could also benefit the cardiovascular health of millions of adults.\nThe latest results are not in a journal yet but have been showcased at a conference.\nProf John Deanfield, who led the work, said semaglutide could have a positive impact on blood sugar, blood pressure or inflammation, as well as direct effects on the heart muscle and vessels.\nThe study, run by University College London (UCL) with 17,604 over-44s from 41 countries, had already shown heart benefits.\nNow, some data from the same Select trial, funded by Novo Nordisk, suggests there are benefits irrespective of a person's starting weight and how much they lose.\nSpeaking ahead of presenting the study at the European Congress on Obesity (ECO) in Italy, Prof Deanfield said the findings had \"important clinical implications\".\nHe said it was an important discovery - likening it to when cholesterol-fighting tablets called statins were introduced in the 1990s.\n\"We finally figured out that there was a drug class that would change the biology of this disease to benefit a lot of people. That was a major breakthrough and it's transformed cardiology practice.\u00a0 \n\"We now have this class of drugs which could equally transform many chronic diseases of ageing,\" he claimed.\nWegovy has the same ingredient as Ozempic - a diabetes medicine said to be Hollywood's \"skinny jab\" of choice.\nHowever, experts have previously warned it is not a quick fix or a replacement for eating well and exercising, and should only be offered under medical supervision.\nCommon side effects include nausea or an upset stomach, bloating and gas.\nAnd people may put weight back on once they stop the treatment, trials suggest.\nSemaglutide mimics the hormone GLP-1, which makes people feel fuller and less hungry.\nIt must be prescribed by a doctor - to  overweight or obese patients, who then inject themselves once a week, using pre-filled pens.\nThe analysis examined the amount of time before patients suffered major cardiovascular events - such as heart attack or stroke - or whether they developed heart failure.\nAfter 20 weeks on the drug, 62% of patients had lost more than 5% of their bodyweight compared with 10% in a placebo group.\nHowever, the risk reduction of heart attacks, stroke or heart failure was similar in patients who lost more than 5% of their bodyweight and in those who lost less than 5%, or gained weight.\nProf Deanfield said: \"Around half of the patients that I see in my cardiovascular practice have levels of weight equivalent to those in the Select trial and are likely to derive benefit.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Prof Deanfield said the drug has a \u201cpotentially important place\u201d in the treatment for obesity.\n\u201cThere are many people living overweight or with obesity, who have struggled to improve their weight, and these drugs, for that reason alone, produce an important clinical opportunity,\" he said. \n\u201cBut these are drugs that will also improve their background medical problems. That really is quite exciting.\"\nHowever, Prof Rameen Shakur, an expert in cardiovascular medicine at the University of Brighton, who was not involved in the research, said caution was needed. \n\"We are unclear on the mechanism and biological process by which semaglutide might reduce cardiac mortality per se.  \n\"I don\u2019t think it is commercially realistic to put whole populations on a medical therapy until you know how the biological system works.   \n\"Interestingly, there remains a risk of pancreatitis and some rare thyroid cancers which is often not stated and this should also be monitored during the course of patient use.\"",
    "A life-saving anti-overdose drug is to be made available for use at home in England without a prescription.\nThe medicine, known as naloxone, will be given to addicts at risk of an opioid overdose for use in an emergency.\nPolice officers, social workers and probation officers are among those who will be allowed to distribute the medicine.\nThe measure was a key recommendation in a 2020 review of drug services.\nOpioid-related deaths \u2013 for example from heroin or powerful synthetic opioids like fentanyl - make up the biggest proportion of drug fatalities across the UK.\nThere is an average of 40 deaths a week across the country.\nBut administering the drug naloxone to someone who is overdosing can be life-saving, by easing potentially fatal breathing difficulties.\nMany police officers and ambulance crews already have supplies for emergency use.\nUntil now, only drug and alcohol treatment services could provide naloxone for home use.\nIn March I reported on the efforts of the Blackpool-based charity Empowerment to help people come off drugs like heroin.\nThe \"Lived Experience\" team in Blackpool is made up of former drug addicts, many of whom told me that Naloxone had saved their lives, sometimes on multiple occasions.\nThe staff at Empowerment were among those who could give doses of the drug to their clients, knowing that if an overdose was to occur at home, this could be a lifesaving intervention.\nThe law is being changed to allow paramedics, the police, social workers, probation officers and those working with the homeless to provide take-home supplies.\nEngland's Health Secretary Victoria Atkins said the aim was to reduce annual drug-related deaths by 1,000 by 2025.\n\u201cOpioid addiction can ruin lives and is responsible for the largest proportion of drug-related deaths across the UK,\" she said.\n\u201cWe are working hard to reduce those numbers by expanding access to naloxone to save the lives of the most vulnerable.\u201d\nThe measure was a key recommendation in a 2020 review of drug services by Prof Dame Carol Black, who welcomed Tuesday\u2019s announcement.\n\u201cWhen I did my independent review of drugs, I heard first hand what a life-saving intervention naloxone is,\" she said.\n\u201cWidening access to naloxone is key to reducing the number of lives lost to overdose and will help support the government's ambition to prevent nearly 1,000 deaths in England by the end of 2025.\n\"I am pleased to see such a strong positive response to the consultation and welcome the government moving forward with these important changes.\u201d\nThe Black report also called for changes to the recruitment and training of the workforce that specialises in helping those struggling with drug and alcohol addiction.\n\nThe government has now revealed what it says is a 10-year plan to transform the workforce, including funding for 800 more medical and mental health drug workers, 950 additional drug and alcohol and criminal justice workers, and more posts to organise and co-ordinate teams in local councils.\nThere will also be improved and more formalised training and accreditation for drug workers.\nClare Taylor, chief operating officer at Turning Point, a social enterprise that works with those struggling with drink and drug addiction, said the workforce plan should help to improve the services that are available.\n\u201cThe new workforce plan sets out a clear set of actions to increase capacity in the system and the quality of services,\" she said.\n\u201cIt recognises the need for the right mix of medical and mental health professionals working alongside key workers and peer support workers, and should help strengthen clinical governance to enable the best possible outcomes for the people we support.\n\u201cWorking in this sector can be incredibly rewarding, and formalising training routes and developing better opportunities for career progression will help ensure it\u2019s a sector people want to join.\n\u201cContinued funding of the drug strategy beyond March 2025 is now essential in ensuring these plans can come to fruition and we as a sector are able to reach more people.\"\n",
    "A whistleblower who helped expose allegations of Australian war crimes in Afghanistan has been sentenced to five years and eight months in jail.\nDavid McBride pleaded guilty to stealing and sharing military secrets on the eve of his trial last year, after legal rulings sank his defence.\nAn ex-military lawyer, McBride said he felt a moral duty to speak up.\nA landmark inquiry later found evidence that Australian forces had unlawfully killed 39 Afghans during the war.\nMcBride's case has sparked uproar in Australia, putting a spotlight on what some say are flimsy whistleblower protections and slow progress towards prosecuting soldiers alleged to have killed with impunity under its flag. \nMcBride, 60, admits he gave troves of document to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), saying he was concerned about the attitudes of commanders and what he then thought was the \"over-investigation\" of troops, the court heard.\nBut instead the information he provided underpinned a series of reports in 2017 called The Afghan Files, which gave unprecedented insight into the operations of Australia's elite special forces in Afghanistan, and contained allegations of war crimes.\nProsecutors argued McBride was motivated by \"personal vindication\", and that the way he gathered, stored and then leaked the documents endangered Australia's national security and foreign policy.\nBut McBride's lawyers asked for leniency, saying he shared the information with \"honourable\" intentions and out of a sense of personal duty.\nDuring sentencing in the nation's capital on Tuesday, Justice David Mossop agreed McBride was of \"good character\" but said that he seemed to have become obsessed with the correctness of his own opinions. Sharing military secrets was \"a gross breach of trust\" for which he has shown \"no contrition\", he added.\nMcBride will be eligible for release on parole after 27 months.\nAfter the sentence was read out, some in the public gallery shouted \"shame on you\" towards the judge as he left the bench.\nHis support dog nearby, McBride hugged his friends and family before being led off into custody.\nHe has maintained that his leak was justified as it had ultimately exposed wrongdoing.\n\"I did not break my oath to the people of Australia and the soldiers that keep us safe,\" he said on Tuesday ahead of his sentencing, addressing a crowd of supporters which included relatives of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and fellow whistleblower Jeff Morris.\nEven before he became one of Australia's most high-profile whistleblowers, McBride led a colourful life.\nAfter graduating from Oxford University with a law degree, he started his career with a stint in the British army. Leaving after reaching the rank of captain, he then tried his hand at everything from private security to reality TV and politics, before coming full circle and joining the Australian Defence Force (ADF). \nAs a legal officer, he did two tours of Afghanistan in 2011 and 2013, the latter with the special forces. It was then that he began to form the impression that \"a line had been crossed\" by commanders.\nOver the next few years, while suffering from undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and abusing drugs and alcohol, McBride said he became more and more convinced he needed to speak up.\nWorking late into the night at an army base near Canberra, he started covertly copying hundreds of sensitive documents, smuggling them home in a backpack over 18 months.\nHe tried an internal complaint first. When that failed, he went to the police and the defence minister, before turning to the press.\nHe believed the dossier he compiled would show the ADF's chain of command was so concerned about the perception of unlawful killings that they were scapegoating soldiers and undermining special forces' confidence to do their work.\nInstead, ABC journalist Dan Oakes found they contained evidence that Australian forces had committed war crimes and lied to conceal them.\n\"The more I looked into it, I couldn't conceive how anyone would think these guys were being too tightly monitored. It was precisely the opposite,\" he recently told the Four Corners programme.\n\"What happened out in the field stayed in the field.\"\nThe Afghan Files included revelations military leaders themselves had concerns about a \"warrior culture\" within the force, and details of how soldiers were allegedly covering up the unlawful killings of unarmed men and children - including a six-year-old boy who was allegedly shot in his sleep in 2013.\nUntil that point, there had been very little reported about allegations of war crimes.\nMcBride was quickly fingered as the man behind the leak and he fled to Spain shortly before the Australian Federal Police (AFP) descended on his apartment. There officers found four plastic tubs filled with classified documents stashed in a cupboard.\nAfter a year in hiding, McBride returned to Australia and was charged with stealing Commonwealth property, breaching the Defence Act and disclosing conf",
    "Part of a collapsed bridge in Baltimore has been deliberately destroyed, clearing the way for the eventual full return of shipping through one of the busiest sea routes in the US. \nA ship struck the Francis Scott Key Bridge on 26 March, causing it to collapse and killing six construction workers.\nMonday's demolition broke apart chunks of the collapsed bridge. \nThe operation was delayed over the weekend due to bad weather. \nThe Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed after it was hit by a cargo ship, the Dali, which lost power and veered off course. \nThe collision sent around 4,000 tonnes of debris into the Patapsco River.\nThe 948ft (289m) ship has remained at the scene since the accident and is covered in scrap metal from the bridge. A total of 21 crew members, most of them Indian, are still on board the Dali, maintaining the vessel. Crew members sheltered aboard the ship while Monday's controlled explosion took place.\nAuthorities said the demolition went according to plan. It took place after the body of the sixth and last victim of the incident was recovered last week.\nA loud explosion was heard shortly after 17:00 Eastern time (21:00 GMT), and pieces of the bridge fell into the water.\nOfficials said they used the controlled detonation to make precision cuts, hoping to free the Dali, which will return to the Port of Baltimore.\nThe port, which handles a variety of goods and is the busiest in the country for car shipments, was closed after the collapse, although some shipping has resumed through temporary channels. The US Army Corps of Engineers said it aims to restore full capacity by the end of May.\nAt a news conference earlier Monday, officials said they hoped to move the ship within two days. \n\"After we do the precision cutting, we will then go back and resurvey the channel as well as survey around the Dali to make sure there are no obstructions that come from that precision cutting that would interfere with traffic,\" said US Coast Guard Rear Adm Shannon Gilreath. \"Then we will reopen the limited-access channel to traffic at that particular time.\"\nAuthorities in the state of Maryland estimate it will cost up to $1.9bn (\u00a31.5bn) and take more than four years to rebuild the bridge.\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told the BBC last week the closure of the channel has \"certainly\" impacted supply chains.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the collapse.\nThe city of Baltimore has sued the ship's owners, Grace Ocean Private Limited, and its manager, Synergy Marine Private Limited, alleging gross negligence and recklessness. The companies have asked a court to limit their liability for the incident. ",
    "A group of current and former politicians from nine countries have demanded to be called as witnesses in the trial of Hong Kong\u2019s imprisoned media mogul and democracy activist, Jimmy Lai.\nThe group, including former UK Conservative party leader Iain Duncan Smith and Japan\u2019s former defence minister Gen Nakatani, say that they have been cited dozens of times in evidence presented during Mr Lai\u2019s national security case.\nDespite this, they have not formally been contacted about the trial - which the letter says \"undermines the integrity of the investigation\".\nMr Lai has been accused of colluding with foreign forces under the Beijing imposed national security law.\nIf found guilty, the 76-year-old founder of the now defunct pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily, is facing possible life in prison.\nHis case, which began last December after a year-long delay, has sparked an international outcry and is widely seen as a test of Hong Kong's judicial independence.\nIn a joint letter - seen exclusively by the BBC - the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance (IPAC) on China say its members have been cited more than 50 times in Jimmy Lai\u2019s national security trial, and have requested to submit evidence to the court.\n\u201cThe fact that IPAC as 'witnesses' or 'accomplices' to an alleged crime have never been approached by the Hong Kong authorities is revelatory of the degree to which the integrity of this trial is in question,\" said Luke De Pulford, the executive director of the IPAC.\n\"This case was never about the truth,\" Sir Iain added. \"But we now have an opportunity to see how far English common law used in Hong Kong, respected by the world over, has been traduced by the national security law of China.\"\nHong Kong insists it is still underpinned by the rule of law, upheld by a common law legal system inherited from the British.\nBeijing has also previously dismissed IPAC as being \"anti-China\". Its members include individuals known to be highly critical of China's Communist rulers, including US Senator Marco Rubio.\nFounded in 2020, IPAC is formed of lawmakers from 34 legislatures and parliamentary bodies who are pushing for a coordinated policy from democratic countries towards China on issues such as trade, security and human rights. \nThe alliance has vigorously opposed the implementation of Hong Kong\u2019s National Security law, declaring that it made \u201cHong Kong one of the most dangerous places in the world to disagree with the government\u201d.\nThe BBC has contacted the Hong Kong Department of Justice for comment.",
    "Before the dazzling Northern Lights array lit up UK skies on Friday, there were warnings that the solar storm might cause disruption to technology on Earth. \nAnd the prediction proved true for the equipment at belonging to one team at Lancaster University.\nBut it was not geomagnetic activity that caused the problem - rather the sudden surge interest in all things aurora borealis.\nJim Wild, a professor in Space Physics who runs the AuroraWatch UK website and app from the university, said it nearly buckled under the strain of the increased traffic it received on Saturday. \n\"The servers were working hard during and after to keep up\", he said.\nSocial media was awash with photos of bright pinks, purples and greens splashed across the night sky when the aurora was visible across most parts of the UK on Friday night.\nAuroraWatch UK monitors space weather and delivers automated alerts via social media when the lights appear.\nThat meant it, and other sites of its kind, suddenly became very popular as people clamoured to see whether the display would be repeated on Saturday.\n\"There are similar sites around the world and all of them were really struggling to keep with demand,\" Prof Wild said. \nWhile critics have suggested the service delivers out-of-date information, as the alerts are delivered in real time, Prof Wild said it is almost impossible to accurately predict when the lights will appear.\n\"Predicting space weather is really challenging,\" Prof Wild said.\n\"The geo-storm was activated by an eruption on the sun and the discharge from that eruption takes two days to get to the earth.\n\"You can get make measurements as it passes satellites but some of the factors are impossible predict.\n\"In terms of providing an accurate forecast, no one has that capability.\"\nProf Wild said the Northern Lights were a beautiful result of geomagnetic storms in space, but these storms can be damaging to technology and people on earth.\n\"The Met Office runs a space weather forecast on behalf of the government and that\u2019s quite a big operation, they have a team monitoring it 24 hours a day,\" he said.\n\"They have to keep an eye on it because some of our human tech,  like satellites and power grids, can be interfered with by space weather.\n\"The biggest geo-storm recorded happened in 1859 and it pushed the northern lights down to the Caribbean.\n\"But the geo-activity impacted the telegraph system which lead to operators being electrocuted.\n\"As society become more reliant on technology, the prediction are going to become more important.\"\nThe Northern Lights are caused by atoms with electric charges, called charged particles.\nThe lights appear when these charged particles are shot out from the sun and hit gases in the Earth's atmosphere.\nWe see different colours in the sky when the various gases in the Earth's atmosphere are energised by the charged particles.\nThe two most common gases in the Earth's atmosphere are oxygen and nitrogen.

As the peak holiday season approaches, parents faced with that dilemma explain the reasons behind their decisions.\nRachel Smith, from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, says she will continue to illegally take her children on holiday during term time - despite the increase in financial penalties.\nThe mother-of-two estimates she has saved more than \u00a310,000 by getting cheaper deals during off-peak dates.\n\"This way my children don't miss out on all the different cuisines, cultures and languages we otherwise couldn't afford,\" she told the BBC.\nFailure to ensure school attendance can result in a prosecution, a fine of up to \u00a32,500, a community order and even a jail sentence of up to three months.\nIn the autumn term of the current school year, 24% of secondary pupils were classed as persistently absent, compared with 15% in 2019 - according to government figures.\nHowever, Ms Smith, 34, says she will continue to take her children - aged 12 and 10 - away.\n\"It is just so much cheaper compared to during term time, which has got to a point where parents can't afford it,\" she continues.\n\"I've been a single mum with two kids for quite a long time and I couldn't give my kids these kind of experiences if it was during the holidays.\"\nShe says she has been fined several times in the past, but they only served as small deductions from the savings she had made.\nThe family has travelled to Magaluf and Ibiza in Spain during term time.\n\"I don\u2019t do it recklessly, I take the kids out of school after their exams,\" she adds.\nLaura Gray, from King's Lynn, Norfolk, was prosecuted for taking her son out of school for holidays abroad.\n\"Work commitments\" were the reason the 33-year-old gave for booking trips away to Croatia, Dubai and Tenerife.\nMrs Gray, 33, thought that missing 15 school days in total would leave her with just a fine as her then six-year-old still had an attendance rate of 91%.\nBut instead she was prosecuted and taken to court after her son's third unauthorised absence in an academic year.\nShe tells the BBC she felt a \"huge wave of guilt and shame\" and \"struggled mentally\" knowing she had to appear before a court.\n\"I've never stepped foot in a courtroom before...I was very emotional,\" Mrs Gray adds.\nShe pleaded guilty and says the ordeal cost the family more than \u00a33,000.\nKatrin Oldridge, from Norwich, is a literacy specialist in schools and once worked as a teacher.\nShe says the age-old issue of taking youngsters away during term-time is very much a topic that teachers understand.\nThe 39-year-old admits she herself has not been able to holiday as much as she used to since having her children - who are now aged nine, seven and five - because it is too expensive for her.\n\"As a mum I want my children to go on holidays and try new things,\" she says.\n\"It's not something I'm completely averse to, but I do know the impact of having a longer amount of time off school.\"\nMs Oldridge explains that families who take their children temporarily out of the education environment must be prepared to help them play catch-up at home.\n\"You've got to weigh up the benefits to the holiday you're going on,\" she adds.\n\"Holidays are lovely and learning about other cultures is lovely, but also being able to read is one of the biggest indicators [of a pupil\u2019s future prospects].\"\nThere is a consistent theme among the authorities the BBC approached for comment on the issue.\nTony Ball, head of education at Essex County Council, says pupils' prospects are \"diminished\" when they miss school.\nHe says he understands \"the temptation\" of holidaying during term time.\n\"But just think about the possible impact and the message it\u2019s sending your children, that it's OK not to go to school,\" he says.\nNorfolk County Council pledges to issue a fixed penalty notice in the event of a child missing school for a holiday.\nTeachers have pointed to poor child mental health and a lack of places for pupils with special educational needs.\nEducation Secretary Gillian Keegan, meanwhile, took aim in The Times at parents who pull their children out during term time.\nThe minimum fines for parents removing children without permission will rise from \u00a360 to \u00a380 in September.\nThe Department of Education says term-time holidays caused \"unnecessary disruption\" to learning.\nIt adds they are \"disruptive\" to other pupils in the class.\nHowever, Paul Whiteman, of the school leaders' union - the NAHT - says fines have proven to be \"too blunt a tool and largely ineffective\" at tackling prolonged absences.\n\"What is really needed to tackle poor attendance is more targeted resources to find out the reasons behind absence,\" he says.\n\"Without that work, higher fines could just be further punishing already struggling families and children.\"\nFollow Essex news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Every day, with bare hands, Rukmini Baburao Kumbhar, collects around 50kg (eight stone) of fresh cow dung.\nShe is part of a spiritual group that runs a small ashram (a religious retreat) in a village in the north-western Indian state of Maharashtra.\nCollecting cow dung is not, primarily, an effort to keep the place tidy. Instead, the cow dung is used to make biomethane.\n\"Fuel has become extremely expensive. Biogas was a good option. The only requirement was space and cows. We had both,\u201d explains Ms Kumbhar.\nOnce collected, the cow dung is mixed with water and put in the bioreactor, where it produces enough methane for the ashram's kitchen.\nInstalled in March, it has replaced the 20 litres of natural gas that Ms Kumbhar used to buy every month.\nIt does involve collecting the cow dung, but she doesn't mind.\n\"In most of the rural parts of India, agriculture is the main occupation. So, touching the cow dung is not a big deal,\" she says.\nSome of her guests are less enthusiastic, at least at first.\n\"Some women who come to stay with us from the city are repulsed by the smell, or if they are made to touch the cow dung. But we don\u2019t force them. They eventually get used to it and start helping. The cows are of good quality, so the cow dung does not smell,\" she says.\nIndian cattle produce around three-million tonnes of cow dung a day, according to data from the government' s policy body NITI Aayog.\nThe government wants more of that dung, and other agriculture waste, to be made into methane.\nBiogas plants do that using a process known as anaerobic digestion, which involves feeding waste into airtight tanks where naturally occurring bacteria break down the organic matter.\nThe process produces a mixture of gases, primarily methane (around 60%) and carbon dioxide.\nAt the moment, India imports around half of its natural gas needs - money flowing abroad, which the government would rather see spent at home. And as the economy grows, India's demand for energy is only going to rise.\nTo spur the biogas industry, from 2025 the government has ordered gas suppliers to blend natural gas with 1% biomethane, rising to 5% by 2028.\nAs well as reducing India's imports of gas, biogas can also cut air pollution, as stubble that was previously burnt, can instead be sent to bioreactors.\nIn addition, the material left after the bioreactor has done its work can be used as fertiliser.\nWith state and federal government support, bigger and bigger bioreactors are being built. \nGas produced by such commercial facilities is compressed, making it easier to transport or use as a fuel in vehicles. \nAsia's biggest compressed biogas (CBG) plant is in Lehragaga, in the northern Indian state of Punjab. \nOpened in late 2022, it can turn 300 tonnes of paddy straw into 33 tonnes of biogas every day. \nAt the moment it is only producing eight tonnes a day, as there's not enough demand for the fuel. \nThat's partly due to its location - far from any big towns and major roads.\nLocation presents a different problem in Ludhiana, Punjab, where cow dung is a menace. With around 6,000 cows in the surrounding area, the city is a centre of dairy production, but dairy owners have been dumping waste straight into the public sewers, causing river pollution.\nThe situation would probably be worse, if dung was not being diverted to a large biogas reactor at the Haibowal Dairy Complex, which can process 225 tonnes of dung a day. \nIt was built in 2004, but demand is such that there are plans to more than double the output of the biogas facility.\nRajiv Kumar is responsible for collecting cow dung from the surrounding area. He remembers the early days when farmers could not really understand why he wanted  the waste.\n\"It was hard to convince them to sell cow dung to us. They used to look at us with suspicion. But now waste has created a source of income for them and they don\u2019t have to do anything, so its win-win situation for them,\u201d he says.\nThe work is difficult, but valuable to the local community.\n\u201cThis cow dung is a mix of cows and buffalos, so, the smell is repulsive, but we all need money at the end of the day to survive.\u201d\nBaljit Singh is one of those who has embraced the opportunities in biogas.\nHe comes from a family of farmers in Punjab, growing wheat and rice. When he saw the biogas plants being built he realised that there was an opportunity. Mr Singh started by collecting the stubble left over from his family's harvest and selling it to the plant. \nThen he went and tried to persuade other farmers to give him their husk.\n\"It was not an easy journey. As the pressure on farmers is high to clear the land for the next sowing, they preferred burning the husk. I convinced them that it is a money-making opportunity for them,\" he explains.\nBut it has become a sizeable business. Today Mr Singh has around 200 people working from him collecting farming waste from 10 villages.\n\"It\u2019s a labour-intensive job. Before the harvest begins, I visit most of the villages to convince the far",
    "A court in Austria has ruled that the country\u2019s most notorious criminal, Josef Fritzl, can be moved to a normal prison.\nFritzl, who has since changed his name, kept his daughter captive for 24 years in a dungeon he built beneath his home, and fathered seven children with her.\nHe has been held in an institution for mentally disturbed prisoners since 2009, after his conviction for rape, enslavement, incest and murder by neglect of his newborn son.\nThe statement from the court in Krems an der Donau said Fritzl, 89, no longer posed a danger that required him to be kept in a prison psychiatric unit.\nIt said that due to his \"progressive dementia\" and physical frailty, he was \"no longer likely to commit a criminal offence with serious consequences\".\nIn theory, the transfer to normal prison could pave the way for his eventual release. His lawyer, Astrid Wagner, has said she would apply for this, a year after his transfer.\nHowever the court statement said a release or a conditional release from prison would not be possible, for \"special preventative reasons\".\nGiven Fritzl\u2019s \"unprecedented criminal energy\", the statement said such a step was not to be expected.\nThe ruling can be appealed.\nThe Fritzl case, which emerged in 2008 in the town of Amstetten west of Vienna, has been described as one of the worst in Austria's criminal history.\nFritzl lived a double life. A qualified electrician, he imprisoned his daughter Elisabeth in his cellar in 1984. He raped her repeatedly and had seven children with her.\nThree of the children lived in the cellar with Elisabeth, trapped in windowless, soundproofed rooms behind a reinforced concrete door, where they never saw the light of day.\nFritzl raised three others in the house above with his wife Rosemarie,  who was unaware of the crimes.\nA seventh child died at birth. Fritzl was said to have burned the body in an incinerator and scattered the ashes in the garden of his house.\nThe case came to light when the eldest of the children, Kerstin, became seriously ill and had to be taken out of the cellar to hospital.\nFritzl initially denied the murder and slavery counts but reversed his plea after watching videotaped testimony from his daughter in court.\nElisabeth Fritzl and her children have taken on new identities.",
    "Looming mass job cuts at the UK\u2019s largest steel plant in Port Talbot are forcing workers to look for employment outside Wales.\nHinkley Point nuclear power station in Somerset is one of the sites which is attracting steelworks contractors.\nThere is concern that the loss of almost 2,000 jobs, as well as many contractor and supply chain roles, could have a \u201cprofound effect\u201d on community life as families consider moving from the area.\nAberavon Harlequins is one of several local rugby clubs fearing an exodus of workers will hit its future.\nHarlequins player Jon Bamsey said he knew of people \"of all ages trying to find jobs within a 20 or 30 mile radius\". \n\"It\u2019s going to be difficult.

Are they going to move out of Port Talbot or Wales even just to find regular work?\" he said.\n\"It\u2019s going to be huge.

    "He is the Welsh poet and writer name dropped by Taylor Swift in her new album, The Tortured Poets Department.\nAnd on International Dylan Thomas Day, a new play for voices about his final years, will be premiered in New York on Tuesday evening.\nIt will be on the same stage that Under Milk Wood was performed for the first time in 1953 by the poet himself.\nIn the new play, Dear Mr Thomas: A New Play for Voices, Dylan will be portrayed by Welsh actor Matthew Rhys, who admitted he has a \"giddy obsession\" with the poet.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Wales' Lucy Owen, Rhys said he hopes the music icon namechecking Thomas in the chorus of the title track from her album, will introduce the poet's work to a new generation.\n\"There was a 12-year-old girl in our household and when the album dropped, there was great reverence on that day when we're all told to be quiet so that lyrics can be listened to.\n\"So when I heard Dylan mentioned I went 'woohoo' and was told to be quiet straightaway.\n\"Then what happened was the greatest gift to me, a 12-year-old went 'well, who is Dylan Thomas?' and wow did she ever regret asking that question.\n\"Eight hours later, I was still orating some of his greatest poems,\" he said.\nRhys said he was \"incredibly happy\" that Taylor Swift did that.\n\"What I hope is, as the way you know, she mentioned the Chelsea Hotel, and the Chelsea Hotel has now exploded in Manhattan, I just hope that a number of people Google Dylan Thomas, and an entirely new generation have their eyes open to this incredible poet.\n\"I'm thankful for the fact she's hopefully opened up an entirely new generation to his work.\"\nOn playing the poet, Rhys said he could not quite believe he would be on the very stage 71 years to the minute, reading some incredible lines from Under Milk Wood.\nHe will be starring alongside his partner, actor Keri Russell, who he also starred with in the hit TV spy drama The Americans.\n\"She's playing the part of Liz Reitell who was very influential on Dylan, especially in the last months of his life, and incredibly influential in getting that first production of Under Milk Wood on at the 92NY stage.\n\"And obviously it was rumoured that they did have an affair,\" he said.\nRhys said Russell had told him that one of the first things he started to talk with her about was Dylan Thomas, and on her first visit to Wales he had insisted the first place she came to was Laugharne, and to see Dylan's writing shed and drink at Brown's hotel.\n\"I really couldn't believe I did this,\" he added.\nDear Mr Thomas is written by Christopher Monger, from Taffs Well in Rhondda Cynon Taf.\nThe premier of his new play will also be read by Kate Burton, daughter of renowned Pontrhydyfen actor, Richard Burton.\nHe was First Voice in a recording Under Milk Wood for BBC Radio in 1954, delivering those immortal opening words: \"To begin at the beginning.\"\nBut the journey leading to the very first performance of Under Milk Wood in America with Dylan himself as First Voice was a long and arduous one.\nIt was a letter from 92NY Poetry Centre Director John Malcolm Brinnin, who first brought Thomas to the states in 1950.\nThe play has been commissioned to make 150th anniversary of 92NY, and Rhys was instrumental in getting the work commissioned.\n\"It's been a remarkable journey to get this production to this moment.\n\"This incredible art and culture institution in New York was solely responsible for bringing Dylan to New York.\n\"The poetry director at the time was so obsessed with Thomas and hell bent on bringing him to New York that he arranged everything for him to come,\" he said.\nThe title of this play is taken from all those letters that Brennin wrote to Dylan imploring him to come.\nThe poet arrived in New York determined to finish Under Milk Wood, the play follows a day in the life of the characters in a fictional Welsh fishing village, Llareggub, and had been rattling around in his head for some time.\nBut right up to that first performance at 92NY, Thomas was still working on it, and Rhys said it is only by chance there is a recording of him reading the work.\n\"It was really so last minute, Dylan was scribbling the final words up until the very end and somebody just had this idea which put a microphone on stage and record this.\nThomas died months later, in November 1953, but stories of his tours of America remain to this day, and Rhys said he was treated like a rock star by fans when he performed in New York.\n\"The first trip and consequently the other two kind of exploded him onto the scene and turned him into this rockstar poet.\n\"There were people standing in the aisles and chanting his name and chanting the names of poems that he hadn't read.\n\"It was the remarkable moment where a kind of lyric poet never experienced, I don't think has experienced since, it's reserved now for the kind of rock stars and pop stars.\n\"That kind of stature that he had, it was an early Beatlemania really.\"",
    "Testimony from the star witness in Donald Trump's Manhattan trial has repeatedly tied a 2016 hush-money arrangement back to the ex-president.\nMr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen said he spoke to him immediately after wiring the $130,000 (\u00a3104,000) payment to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels.\nIt was one of many times he operated \"at the direction of and for the benefit\" of Mr Trump, he testified.\nThe former president has pleaded not guilty to felony charges against him.\nAltogether, Mr Trump faces 34 counts of business fraud for allegedly reimbursing Cohen for the payment through transactions masked as legal expenses.\nMs Daniels had, in exchange for the money, agreed to keep quiet about allegedly having sex with Mr Trump while he was married. He has denied ever having sex with Ms Daniels.\nProsecutors charge that the payment, made in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign, and the subsequent attempt to conceal it by falsifying records qualifies as election interference. \nAs the former president sat back in his chair, listening with his eyes closed, Cohen told the court on Monday that Mr Trump had \"approved\" the repayment plan.\nWhen the then-personal fixer met with Mr Trump and his top financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, between the presidential election and inauguration, the latter did the talking, Cohen said.\nWeisselberg explained to Cohen in front of their boss that he would be paid back in 12 instalments of $35,000, which would be accounted for as a retainer for legal services. Cohen said he got the sense the two had already discussed the arrangement before inviting him in to meet.\nMr Trump \"approved it\", Cohen said, and then told him: \"This is gonna be one heck of a ride in DC.\"\nThe total would be far larger than what Cohen originally paid because he would be taxed on the payments, he testified.\nBBC News reporters are in the Manhattan courtroom covering the historic first criminal trial of a former US president. You'll find their updates and analysis on the BBC news website and app, and across TV, radio and podcasts.\nFor weeks, the spectre of Cohen's testimony has hovered over the trial, his name repeatedly invoked as prosecutors walked jurors down a trail of wheeling and dealing in bank statements, text messages, witness testimony, emails and recordings of crucial conversations. \nSixteen days into the trial, he finally appeared on the witness stand, the most significant day of testimony in the first-ever criminal trial of a former US president.\nWhat he had to say about events and conversations from eight years ago could come back to haunt Mr Trump as he seeks to return to the White House.\nCohen, who served time in prison for crimes related to the payment, is one of the few witnesses who could help prosecutors establish that Mr Trump knew about the alleged reimbursement scheme. He could also testify about reasons why Mr Trump allegedly committed fraud. Prosecutors have said it was to interfere in the 2016 election.\nOn Monday Cohen also testified that Mr Trump told him to \"be prepared\" for negative publicity after announcing his 2016 presidential bid, \n\"There's going to be a lot of women coming forward,\" he allegedly said. \nHe said Mr Trump instructed him to \"handle\" several hush-money payments, as well as liaise with tabloid media to thwart negative stories that could threaten his political goals. \nHe recalled Mr Trump being \"really angry\" for what he perceived as a failure to keep Ms Daniels from shopping her story to the media.\nHe said Mr Trump told him to \"just take care of it\", calling the story a potential disaster for his presidential campaign. \n\"Women will hate me,\" he told Cohen, according to Monday's testimony.\nCohen also testified that he worked with the National Enquirer tabloid to buy and bury a story about an alleged affair between Mr Trump and Playboy model Karen McDougal. \nCohen said he was present for a call in which Mr Trump asked National Enquirer publisher David Pecker about a payment to Ms McDougal. \n\"Pecker said 'we have this under control, we'll take care of this,'\" Cohen testified. \nSpeaking to reporters later outside the court, Mr Trump complained that the case was politically motivated and an attempt to derail his presidential campaign. \nThough Mr Trump is prohibited from publicly commenting on witness testimony, Republican senators Tommy Tuberville of Alabama and JD Vance of Ohio appeared in a show of support, assailing Cohen and defending the former president. \n\"The thing that the president is prevented from saying, which is a disgrace, is that every single person involved in this prosecution is practically a Democratic political operative,\" Mr Vance said. \nNorm Eisen, an attorney who interviewed Cohen in 2019 while assisting the House of Representatives, told the BBC that Cohen's testimony so far had boosted the prosecution's case. \n\"Given disparaging references others have made to Cohen, I am sure the jury is surprised by the sober, well-spoken, candid individua",

    "A man whose mother vanished 50 years ago said the mystery of a woman's body found in a cellar was the \"catalyst\" for their reunion. \nThe man, who asked to be identified only as Matthew, said his mother had left him and his two siblings in 1974 and \"dropped off the face of the Earth\".\nIt was listening to a podcast about the discovery of a partially mummified body at a house in Bolton that prompted him to contact police. \nAnd he would quickly learn that his mother - whom he feared might have been the dead woman - was actually alive and well. \nDetectives still do not know the identity of the woman, whose remains were discovered in a cellar in Bolton in 1982, wrapped in an old newspaper from 1966.\nThe case gained national attention in 1983 as the first time a ground-breaking facial recognition technique was used in a public appeal by a British police force.\nForensic artist Richard Neave created a likeness of Mary Ellen's face using scientific measurements of her skull and strips of modelling clay.\nA BBC Radio Manchester investigation, The Forgotten Dead, re-examined the case in 2022 in an effort to solve the mystery. \nMatthew, who now lives in mid Wales and was three when his mother disappeared, said he knew it had been a \"long shot\" that it might be her, but he contacted Greater Manchester Police to raise his fears after hearing the series. \nHis mother was 27, had three children and was living in Bolton when she disappeared without a trace in about 1974, he said.\nMatthew, now 53, said his mother had a \"tempestuous\" relationship with a married man, who was \"quite a violent person\", in the early 1970s.\nHe said his mother, who was herself divorced, frequently hid at her mother's house to avoid him.\nOne day she took him and his siblings to his grandmother's house telling her she needed to back to her flat \"because she had the gas man coming round\".\n\u201cAnd that was it. She's never seen again.

    "Fierce fighting has been reported in Jabalia in northern Gaza, after the Israeli military went back into areas where it said Hamas had regrouped.\nResidents who fled said they had seen tanks advancing towards Jabalia's refugee camp, which has come under heavy bombardment since Saturday.\nPalestinian armed groups also said they were battling troops in the camp.\nMeanwhile, the UN has said 360,000 people have fled Rafah, in the south, since an offensive began a week ago.\nThe Israeli military has ordered the evacuation of the eastern third of the city, which is swollen with more than a million Palestinians taking refuge.\nOn Sunday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Israel that a full-scale offensive in Rafah might provoke \"anarchy\" without eliminating Hamas.\nHis comments echoed briefings to Israeli media by unnamed senior Israeli military figures, who said Hamas's resurgence in northern Gaza was due to a lack of a specific plan from Israel's government for the \"day after\" the war.\nThe military scaled down operations in the north in January after declaring that it had \"dismantled\" Hamas's battalions there. But that left a power vacuum in which the group has been able to rebuild.\nAn estimated 300,000 people trapped in the devastated region are also experiencing a \"full-blown famine\" due to a lack of aid deliveries, according to the head of the World Food Programme. \nResidents who were filmed fleeing Jabalia on foot on Monday morning said they had decided to leave after seeing tanks advance into the area.  \n\"We don't know where to go. We have been displaced from one place to the next,\" one woman told Reuters news agency. \"We are running in the streets. I saw it with my own eyes. I saw the tank and the bulldozer.\"\nThe military wings of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad - which are both proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK, US and other countries - said their fighters were targeting Israeli forces in and around Jabalia camp with mortars, anti-tank missiles and machine-guns.\nHamas-affiliated Safa news agency also reported clashes between Palestinian armed groups and Israeli tanks east of Jabalia camp's market, near several UN-run schools which were being used as shelters by civilians.\nThe official Palestinian news agency Wafa meanwhile reported that two people were killed in Israeli strikes on homes in Jabalia camp on Monday and that a number of other people were killed in a strike in Jabalia town.\nIt also cited ambulance crews as saying the bodies of 20 civilians had so far been recovered in Jabalia and taken to Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahia.\nThere was no immediate comment from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).  \nOn Sunday, the IDF said troops had begun an operation in Jabalia the previous evening \"based on intelligence information regarding attempts by Hamas to reassemble its terrorist infrastructure and operatives in the area\".\nIt came after civilians there were told to evacuate to western Gaza City.\nThe IDF also said it was operating in the Zeitoun area, in eastern Gaza City, to \"eliminate terrorists and dismantle terrorist infrastructure\".\nSafa reported that Zeitoun was hit by Israeli shellfire on Monday morning.\nThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said the bombardment and evacuation orders had \"created more displacement and fear for thousands of families\" in northern Gaza.\nUnrwa also warned that the civilians affected, like the estimated 360,000 who have fled Rafah in the past week, had \"nowhere safe to go\".\nAfter seven months of war in Gaza, Israel has insisted victory is impossible without taking Rafah and eliminating the last remaining Hamas battalions. But UN and Western powers have warned that an all-out assault could lead to mass civilian casualties and a humanitarian catastrophe.\nThere have been desperate scenes in Rafah since the IDF said last Monday that it was beginning a \"precise operation against Hamas\" in eastern Rafah.\nOn Saturday, flyers were dropped ordering residents to evacuate more eastern neighbourhoods, including those close to the city centre.\nUnrwa's deputy Gaza director Scott Anderson, who is based in western Rafah, told the BBC on Monday that the Israeli operation now extended \"about a third of the way across Rafah\" and encompassed the old town.\nHe said he could hear explosions and air strikes, and that the fighting had affected the operations of hospitals and many of Unrwa's facilities in Rafah refugee camp, including a primary healthcare facility.\nPalestinian media reported that four people, including a child, were killed on Monday in an Israeli air strike on a home in the Brazil neighbourhood, which is just south-east of the camp. \nHamas's military wing also said it had targeted Israeli forces east of Rafah.\nMany people sheltering in central and western areas that are not subject to evacuation orders have also been leaving out of fear that the Israeli operation will soon expand into a large-scale offensive.\nGhada el-Kurd, a mother-of-two, t",

It is up to Ofcom to hold the BBC to account in meeting its obligations.\n\"In the recent Mid-Term Review, we recommended that the BBC take steps to engage more effectively with competitors and fulfill its obligation to work collaboratively.\"\nIn March, the BBC said the plan would \"generate more revenue to support the BBC, licence-fee payers our suppliers and rights holders\".\nThe corporation has said its income effectively fell by around 30% between 2010 and 2020, and that it must find annual savings target of \u00a3700m by 2028.",

    "Russian President Vladimir Putin is to remove his long-standing ally Sergei Shoigu as defence minister, the Kremlin has announced.\nThe 68-year-old had been in the role since 2012 and will be replaced by Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov, an economist with little military experience. \nMr Shoigu is to be appointed secretary of Russia's Security Council.\nThe Kremlin said the defence ministry needed to stay \"innovative\". \nReshuffles in Russia don't happen very often so this is a big moment at the top of Russian politics.\nBut Vladimir Putin remains the person who ultimately calls the shots. It was his decision to start the war in Ukraine and all the big decisions are taken by him.\nThe appointment of Mr Belousov as defence minister will come as a surprise to many, given his previous experience. \nBut analysts suggest President Putin is seeking to align the Russian economy more closely with the war effort.\nThe decision to put an economist in charge of the Ministry of Defence reflects the changing priorities of the Kremlin and the huge amounts of money the Russian authorities are now pouring into the war in Ukraine - and Russia's need to boost efficiency in the armed forces. \nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the proposed appointment of a civilian showed the role of defence minister called for \"innovation\".\nHe said Russia was becoming more like the Soviet Union in the mid-1980s, when a high proportion of GDP went on military spending.\nAs a result, it was necessary to make sure that military expenditure was better integrated into Russia's overall economy, he added.\n\"The one who is more open to innovations is the one who will be victorious on the battlefield,\" he said.\nIn recent months, there had been rumours that Mr Shoigu's position was growing weaker and that he could lose his job. \nIn April, one of his deputies - Timur Ivanov - was arrested on corruption charges in a rare move against such a senior official.\nAnd Russia's campaign in Ukraine was meant to last a few weeks at most. Instead, it is now in its third year and has been plagued by military setbacks and big losses in men and materiel.\nAlthough Mr Shoigu will remain in a powerful role as secretary of the Security Council, the move appears to be a demotion for him. \nIt's not yet clear what will happen to the council's current head, Nikolai Patrushev. \nMr Shoigu has close links with President Putin, often taking him on fishing trips in his native Siberia.\nHe was given the defence portfolio despite having no military background, which rankled with some of his top brass.\nA civil engineer by profession, Mr Shoigu rose to prominence as the head of the emergencies and disaster relief ministry in the 1990s. \nIn 2023, Mr Shoigu became embroiled in a public feud with Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin over Russia's conduct of the war. \nPrigozhin, who led a short-lived mutiny against Moscow, accused Mr Shoigu of being a \"dirtbag\" and \"elderly clown\" in audio messages that went viral.\nThe mercenary chief died in a plane crash while flying from St Petersburg to Moscow in August 2023. The Kremlin denied it was to blame.\nAccording to unnamed government officials quoted by independent Russian website The Bell, Mr Belousov is seen as a \"hard-line defender of the state, who believes that Russia is encircled by enemies\".\nLike President Putin, he is close to the Russian Orthodox Church. He is said to be a martial arts enthusiast - as is President Putin - who practised karate and the Russian combat sport sambo in his youth.\nBefore becoming deputy prime minister, he worked for several years as an aide to Mr Putin and was reportedly the only member of the president's economic entourage to support the annexation of Crimea in 2014.\nMr Putin was sworn in as president for a fifth time on Tuesday after winning Russia's recent election with 87% of the vote without facing any credible opponents. He has led Russia since May 2000.",
    "A 16-year-old was arrested after entering a Catholic church in Louisiana with a gun, inciting panic among children gathered for their First Holy Communion last weekend. \nWhen police arrived to St Mary Magdalen in Abbeville, they found a teen unarmed and pinned to the ground by parishioners, according to local news.\nNo one was harmed during the incident, which was captured on a livestream.\nThe FBI is assisting Abbeville Police with the investigation.\nFootage from the incident over the weekend shows a man walking up to the priest mid-ceremony to whisper something in his ear. The priest then stops the ceremony and asks the congregation to join him in prayer - then panic erupts.\nAccording to a St Mary Magdalen Catholic Church Facebook post, ''a suspicious person opened the back door of the building\". Witnesses told local news that he was armed and dressed in black.\nChurchgoers slowly noticed him, and in the footage, cries and screams erupt from the church pews as the priest is seen slowly ducking behind the altar. Multiple children are seen running across the screen. \nThe church described the encounter over the weekend as a \"frightening experience\" that \"understandably caused a panic\" in the post.\n\"The individual was immediately confronted by parishioners, escorted outside and the police were called,\" a church Facebook post said. \n\"It was the scariest thing I have ever gone through,\" one woman wrote on social media. \nWhen police arrived at 10:35 CST (16:35 BST), they \"made a sweep through the church to make sure there was no additional threat\", the Abbeville Police Department said. \nAbbeville Police Chief Mike Hardy told local news that the suspect said there was a second shooter nearby. However, police said they didn't find evidence of that.\nThe suspect was taken into custody and questioned, then taken to be medically evaluated. He is charged with terrorizing and two counts of possession of a firearm by a juvenile, police said.\nIn the Facebook post, St Mary Magdalen thanked its parishioners and police for \"acting quickly to ensure safety for all\" and said uniformed police will be at all upcoming Masses \"out of an abundance of caution\". \nThe encounter follows a similar scene also captured on video in Pennsylvania. On 5 May, a man walked into a church service, aimed a gun at the pastor and pulled the trigger. The gun jammed, sparing the pastor. \nThe man was restrained by parishioners until police arrived and placed him under arrest.",

    "It wasn't just the past they were remembering today. Beside the rows of fresh graves at Israel's Mount Herzl military cemetery, new plots were still being marked out - too recent for a memorial stone, their empty shapes heaped with flowers.  \nNext to them, the vacant space stretched, shadowed with the future losses of Israel's ongoing war.\nThe crowd packed around them - some in uniform, some in tears - saluted or bowed their heads as the morning siren sounded to mark Remembrance Day; the price of Israel's previous conflicts laid out in the cemetery, beneath the pines, across the years.\nIsrael's defence ministry says the names of 826 people from the security forces were added to the list of the country's fallen this year, along with 834 victims of terrorist attacks - almost all of them from the 7 October Hamas attacks and the Gaza War that followed.\nFaced with the human cost of his current war, Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, offered a reminder of why he was asking families to pay it.\n\"It's either us - Israel; or them - the monsters of Hamas,\" he said. \"It's either existence, liberty, security and prosperity; or annihilation, massacre, rape and subjugation. We are determined to win.\"\nHis speech was noticeably less belligerent than usual - his calls to continue \"until victory\" toned down - but he again justified the continuation of the war by quoting those paying the highest price. A soldier who had both legs amputated, he said, had urged him to \"continue until the end\".\nDoron Perez said he had only been half-listening to the prime minister - his mind had been on his son, Daniel, a tank commander who was killed during 7 October attacks.\nTwo months ago the family buried Daniel's bloodied uniform beneath his memorial at Mount Herzl - his body is still being held by Hamas in Gaza.\n\"[Almost] 25,000 soldiers have lost their lives since the establishment of the State of Israel,\" Doron said. \"And for me, this particular battle was the most obvious in terms of the need to put our lives on the line. This is not a political issue, this is about the very existence of Israel. It was one of those 'to be or not to be' moments.\"\nDespite the support from some families, this Memorial Day is a sensitive moment for Israel's prime minister.

Fourteen Israeli soldiers were reported dead last week alone.

    "The M25 in Surrey has reopened seven hours ahead of schedule after being shut all weekend between junctions nine and 10 for roadworks, National Highways said.\nThe stretch of road, between the A243 Leatherhead and the A3 Wisley, has been closed in both directions since 21:00 BST on Friday.\nIt was so a new bridge consisting of 72 beams, each weighing 16 tonnes, and a further four beams, weighing 40 tonnes, could be installed.\nNational Highways said on X, formerly Twitter, on Sunday the works had been completed early and the motorway was open in both directions.\nAt about 13:30, Surrey Highways said there were major delays in West Byfleet along the Parvis Road.\nIt said there was also congestion in Leatherhead, Oxshott and surrounding areas, including Weybridge, Cobham and Walton-On-Thames.\nFour diversion routes have been in place between Gatwick and Heathrow. Two in either direction for regular traffic and two for overheight vehicles.\nThe diversion routes take cars on a 19-mile (31km) journey on A roads, crossing from Surrey into London's Ulez area, but National Highways says \"no enforcement action will be taken\".\nHowever, it warned people they could receive penalty charges under Ulez rules if they strayed off official diversion routes over the weekend.\nOn Saturday, National Highways said it had seen an increasing number of motorists choosing to ignore the diversion route - starting at junction eight - and instead continuing on the motorway to the next junction.\nThe M25 works are part of a project to improve safety and reduce pollution.\nIn March, a five-mile (8km) stretch of the M25 was shut between junctions 10 and 11.\nIt was the first time there had been a scheduled daytime shutdown of all lanes since the motorway opened in 1986.\nThe improvement scheme, which is part of a \u00a3317m upgrade to the motorway, will see an increase in the number of lanes in an attempt to make journeys safer and a new junction layout to improve traffic flow.\nThree more closures are planned before the end of 2024, with the next one organised for August.\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, and on X.

    "Russian President Vladimir Putin is to remove his long-standing ally Sergei Shoigu as defence minister, the Kremlin has announced.\nThe 68-year-old had been in the role since 2012 and will be replaced by Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov, an economist with little military experience. \nMr Shoigu is to be appointed secretary of Russia's Security Council.\nThe Kremlin said the defence ministry needed to stay \"innovative\". \nReshuffles in Russia don't happen very often so this is a big moment at the top of Russian politics.\nBut Vladimir Putin remains the person who ultimately calls the shots. It was his decision to start the war in Ukraine and all the big decisions are taken by him.\nThe appointment of Mr Belousov as defence minister will come as a surprise to many, given his previous experience. \nBut analysts suggest President Putin is seeking to align the Russian economy more closely with the war effort.\nThe decision to put an economist in charge of the Ministry of Defence reflects the changing priorities of the Kremlin and the huge amounts of money the Russian authorities are now pouring into the war in Ukraine - and Russia's need to boost efficiency in the armed forces. \nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the proposed appointment of a civilian showed the role of defence minister called for \"innovation\".\nHe said Russia was becoming more like the Soviet Union in the mid-1980s, when a high proportion of GDP went on military spending.\nAs a result, it was necessary to make sure that military expenditure was better integrated into Russia's overall economy, he added.\n\"The one who is more open to innovations is the one who will be victorious on the battlefield,\" he said.\nIn recent months, there had been rumours that Mr Shoigu's position was growing weaker and that he could lose his job. \nIn April, one of his deputies - Timur Ivanov - was arrested on corruption charges in a rare move against such a senior official.\nAnd Russia's campaign in Ukraine was meant to last a few weeks at most. Instead, it is now in its third year and has been plagued by military setbacks and big losses in men and materiel.\nAlthough Mr Shoigu will remain in a powerful role as secretary of the Security Council, the move appears to be a demotion for him. \nIt's not yet clear what will happen to the council's current head, Nikolai Patrushev. \nMr Shoigu has close links with President Putin, often taking him on fishing trips in his native Siberia.\nHe was given the defence portfolio despite having no military background, which rankled with some of his top brass.\nA civil engineer by profession, Mr Shoigu rose to prominence as the head of the emergencies and disaster relief ministry in the 1990s. \nIn 2023, Mr Shoigu became embroiled in a public feud with Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin over Russia's conduct of the war. \nPrigozhin, who led a short-lived mutiny against Moscow, accused Mr Shoigu of being a \"dirtbag\" and \"elderly clown\" in audio messages that went viral.\nThe mercenary chief died in a plane crash while flying from St Petersburg to Moscow in August 2023. The Kremlin denied it was to blame.\nAccording to unnamed government officials quoted by independent Russian website The Bell, Mr Belousov is seen as a \"hard-line defender of the state, who believes that Russia is encircled by enemies\".\nLike President Putin, he is close to the Russian Orthodox Church. He is said to be a martial arts enthusiast - as is President Putin - who practised karate and the Russian combat sport sambo in his youth.\nBefore becoming deputy prime minister, he worked for several years as an aide to Mr Putin and was reportedly the only member of the president's economic entourage to support the annexation of Crimea in 2014.\nMr Putin was sworn in as president for a fifth time on Tuesday after winning Russia's recent election with 87% of the vote without facing any credible opponents. He has led Russia since May 2000.",
    "Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes has called for an investigation into emergency medical provision on Skye after a woman died at a music festival.\nAn ambulance was sent shortly before midnight on Saturday after the woman took unwell at Portree's Skye Live festival.\nMs Forbes said she was \"hugely concerned\" by reports that emergency access to Portree Community Hospital was limited at the time.\nNHS Highland said ambulance crews had responded to the incident, but declined to give further comment due to patient confidentiality.\nCampaigners have called for improvements to Portree hospital services, that were previously recommended in a review six years ago.\nThese include out-of-hours urgent care being available 24 hours a day, all week. \nMs Forbes said she was saddened by the death and thanked emergency services involved.\nHowever, she said she was \"hugely concerned by reports that during a medical emergency, access to Portree hospital was limited for vital life-saving equipment\". \nShe said: \"This is extremely serious if so.\"\n\"My first aim is to get all the facts so that I understand precisely what happened, and secondly there must be accountability.\"\nMs Forbes said she had asked NHS Highland to investigate medical provision in north Skye, and had raised the weekend's incident with the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) and Health Secretary Neil Gray. \nMs Forbes said: \"The full implementation of the Sir Lewis Ritchie report recommendations is something local campaigners and I have been pushing for some time now.\n\"Enough is enough. It has been six years, and the timescales for delivering the recommendations keeps shifting. \n\"North Skye in particular needs to know there is resilience and confidence in their local health service.\"\nThe festival was held over Thursday, Friday and Saturday and attended by about 1,000 people from Skye and further afield.\nThe event featured Scottish Traditional, folk and indie-folk music.\nNHS Highland said the SAS attended Saturday's incident and, also another medical emergency in Portree at the weekend.\nA spokesman said the SAS had been helped by an off-duty nurse and a doctor sent from Broadford Hospital, which is 25 miles from Portree.\nThe spokesman said: \"Emergency care is available 24/7 by contacting 999 in the event of a life-threatening emergency.\"\nThe health board said non-emergency out-of-hours urgent care was available at Portree hospital by appointment on Saturdays, Sundays, and bank holidays from 08:30 to 19:30.\nSkye Live told BBC Scotland News: \u201cWe are heartbroken by the tragic incident that occurred at our festival. \n\"Our thoughts are with the person\u2019s loved ones, and we continue to cooperate fully with the authorities.\"\nPolice Scotland said the woman's death was not thought to be suspicious.\nA spokesperson said officers' inquiries were continuing and a report would be sent to the procurator fiscal.",
    "A 16-year-old was arrested after entering a Catholic church in Louisiana with a gun, inciting panic among children gathered for their First Holy Communion last weekend. \nWhen police arrived to St Mary Magdalen in Abbeville, they found a teen unarmed and pinned to the ground by parishioners, according to local news.\nNo one was harmed during the incident, which was captured on a livestream.\nThe FBI is assisting Abbeville Police with the investigation.\nFootage from the incident over the weekend shows a man walking up to the priest mid-ceremony to whisper something in his ear. The priest then stops the ceremony and asks the congregation to join him in prayer - then panic erupts.\nAccording to a St Mary Magdalen Catholic Church Facebook post, ''a suspicious person opened the back door of the building\". Witnesses told local news that he was armed and dressed in black.\nChurchgoers slowly noticed him, and in the footage, cries and screams erupt from the church pews as the priest is seen slowly ducking behind the altar. Multiple children are seen running across the screen. \nThe church described the encounter over the weekend as a \"frightening experience\" that \"understandably caused a panic\" in the post.\n\"The individual was immediately confronted by parishioners, escorted outside and the police were called,\" a church Facebook post said. \n\"It was the scariest thing I have ever gone through,\" one woman wrote on social media. \nWhen police arrived at 10:35 CST (16:35 BST), they \"made a sweep through the church to make sure there was no additional threat\", the Abbeville Police Department said. \nAbbeville Police Chief Mike Hardy told local news that the suspect said there was a second shooter nearby. However, police said they didn't find evidence of that.\nThe suspect was taken into custody and questioned, then taken to be medically evaluated. He is charged with terrorizing and two counts of possession of a firearm by a juvenile, police said.\nIn the Facebook post, St Mary Magdalen thanked its parishioners and police for \"acting quickly to ensure safety for all\" and said uniformed police will be at all upcoming Masses \"out of an abundance of caution\". \nThe encounter follows a similar scene also captured on video in Pennsylvania. On 5 May, a man walked into a church service, aimed a gun at the pastor and pulled the trigger. The gun jammed, sparing the pastor. \nThe man was restrained by parishioners until police arrived and placed him under arrest.",
    "It wasn't just the past they were remembering today. Beside the rows of fresh graves at Israel's Mount Herzl military cemetery, new plots were still being marked out - too recent for a memorial stone, their empty shapes heaped with flowers.  \nNext to them, the vacant space stretched, shadowed with the future losses of Israel's ongoing war.\nThe crowd packed around them - some in uniform, some in tears - saluted or bowed their heads as the morning siren sounded to mark Remembrance Day; the price of Israel's previous conflicts laid out in the cemetery, beneath the pines, across the years.\nIsrael's defence ministry says the names of 826 people from the security forces were added to the list of the country's fallen this year, along with 834 victims of terrorist attacks - almost all of them from the 7 October Hamas attacks and the Gaza War that followed.\nFaced with the human cost of his current war, Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, offered a reminder of why he was asking families to pay it.\n\"It's either us - Israel; or them - the monsters of Hamas,\" he said. \"It's either existence, liberty, security and prosperity; or annihilation, massacre, rape and subjugation. We are determined to win.\"\nHis speech was noticeably less belligerent than usual - his calls to continue \"until victory\" toned down - but he again justified the continuation of the war by quoting those paying the highest price. A soldier who had both legs amputated, he said, had urged him to \"continue until the end\".\nDoron Perez said he had only been half-listening to the prime minister - his mind had been on his son, Daniel, a tank commander who was killed during 7 October attacks.\nTwo months ago the family buried Daniel's bloodied uniform beneath his memorial at Mount Herzl - his body is still being held by Hamas in Gaza.\n\"[Almost] 25,000 soldiers have lost their lives since the establishment of the State of Israel,\" Doron said. \"And for me, this particular battle was the most obvious in terms of the need to put our lives on the line.

    "A woman who claims she witnessed a couple plotting in a pub to murder the man's then-wife has been accused of lying by the defence.\nAllen Morgan, 73, and wife Margaret, 75, deny conspiracy to murder his first wife Carol, who was found bludgeoned to death in her shop in Linslade, Bedfordshire, on 13 August, 1981\nLast week Luton Crown Court court heard from key witness Jane Bunting, who was 17 at the time of the killing.\nShe claims the couple had met her in a pub and asked for help to recruit her criminal ex-boyfriend to kill Carol, but the defence said that meeting never took place.\nThe couple had been engaged in a \"passionate but forbidden\" affair in the months before 36-year-old Carol Morgan was killed, the court was told.\nThe prosecution claims the couple, now of Stanstead Crescent, Woodingdean, Brighton, hired a hitman to carry out the act, although no-one has ever been charged with carrying out the murder.\nMs Bunting said that while at the former Dolphin pub in Leighton Buzzard shortly before the murder, Mr Morgan asked whether her ex-boyfriend would know anyone who could kill Carol.\nShe recalled him asking: \u201cWhat about that Danny Mayhew you went out with? He\u2019s a bit of a criminal - would he know someone?\"\nOn Monday, Colin Aylott KC, defending Mr Morgan, told Ms Bunting the defence's position was that the meeting at the pub did not happen.\nHe revealed Mayhew had carried out a robbery in October 1981, two months after the murder, and was convicted in February 1982, where he served his first prison term.\nMayhew\u2019s only previous conviction at the time of the alleged pub meeting was a fine he incurred at Highgate Magistrates' Court in 1972, the defence said.\nMs Bunting said: \"In that case, I never knew why Allen said he was 'a bit of a criminal' apart from whatever he talked to Margaret about at that time.\"\nMr Aylott replied: \"You've been caught in a lie.\"\nBut Ms Bunting insisted she was \"not surprised the chronology doesn't work\".\nShe added: \"I know these events happened. I've always struggled after 40 years to fit them into a timeline.\"\nBut Mr Aylott told Ms Bunting: \"I suggest to you that your story is falling apart here.\n\"You take little snippets of information and try to use it to support your story.\"\nThe defence then questioned why Ms Bunting had waited over 40 years to approach police with her pub story.\nShe answered: \"It was not something that I thought about. This type of information, to me, I didn't know it to be vital.\"\nShe added: \"At 27, I would have known that police had interviewed Allen and Margaret and were unable to identify who did [the murder]. I assumed that they had excluded Allen and Margaret.\"\nWhen asked if it occurred to her to speak to the police \u201cwith the benefit of maturity\u201d, Ms Bunting replied: \u201cYes, I did a couple of times. I looked to see, but it was a closed case.\"\nMr Aylott then questioned why she had got in touch with Margaret Morgan in 2014 and exchanged several friendly emails.\nHe said: \"Did you not think that's a strange thing to do, given what you've told the jury?\"\nMs Bunting replied: \"No, I didn't. Because that thing, the murder, is not all that Margaret was to me.\"\nThe case continues.\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

    "A resident has described a popular lake as \"intimidating, unfriendly, filthy and dirty\" following a reported rise in anti-social behaviour. \nNeedham Lake in Needham Market, Suffolk sees about 300,000 visitors a year with high numbers during warmer months. \nLocal resident Janice Lilley said in recent weeks the mess left behind by visitors was \"unimaginable\" and had been putting locals off visiting. \nTim Weller, cabinet member for environment, culture and wellbeing at Mid Suffolk District Council, said it was \"upping its game\" and thinking of new ways to address the issue.\n \"It's been going on for about five or six years ,\" Ms Lilley explained. \n\"[People] come over to Needham Lake to use the barbecues and there's 200 to 300 of them.\n\"They leave a mess and it's very intimidating.\"\nSuffolk Police said it received reports of a large gathering in the area on 5 May and attended to monitor the situation.\nA spokesperson said the reports of anti-social behaviour were \"disappointing\" and the force would work with Mid-Suffolk District Council to ensure similar incidents did not happen again. \nMs Lilley, who runs a car boot from a nearby field, said she had found faeces as well as dirty nappies in the area.\n\"I have to clear it up before my car boot starts as it's not nice for anybody to see,\" she continued. \n\"It's also very scary for some old couples and there's no parking.\n\"Everybody is very upset this year and we're hoping to get it all sorted.\n\"You can't imagine it unless you see it.\"\nOn Monday, a large amount of rubbish could be seen at Needham Lakes following a high number of visitors on Sunday during warm weather.  \nMr Weller admitted the area wasn't \"looking its best\" while speaking with the BBC. \n\"We are doing quite a lot to make this an environment people want to come to but today it isn't looking it's best,\" he said. \n\"I'm sure before I go home some of the colleagues at Mid Suffolk District Council will be here to pick up the [bin] sacks, remove those and to do the litter pick that's required for the small bits that are left.\"\nMr Weller visited the lakes on Sunday and said he could see that \"everybody was happy\".\n\"I came back later in the evening when there were still some people here but I didn't see any anti-social behaviour,\" he continued.\n\"But some people have seen and reported that.\"\nMr Weller encouraged visitors to report anti-social behaviour to the council while ensuring any crime was reported to the police. \nHe also encouraged visitors to follow the rules, tidy up after themselves and make use of the barbecue areas that have been provided.\nWhen asked what the council was doing to tackle a reported issue of people defecating in the woods, Mr Weller said: \"All we can do is encourage people to use the [toilet] facilities here.\"\nMr Weller said the authorities had not seen this issue but admitted it could be happening once the toilets shut at 20:00.\nHe added the council was considering opening the toilets later to tackle this. \n\"As a multi-agency team we're looking at how to make this environment better by looking at how we time our visits or keeping the facilities open later - these are all things that might help to improve the situation,\" he said.\n\"We're upping our game and we're thinking of ways of addressing these issues that popularity brings.\n\"It's the minority who are making it difficult for everyone else and spoiling it for everyone else.\"\nFollow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A police sergeant has described how she feared being \"crushed alive\" when her vehicle was rammed by a lorry in south Armagh.\nIt happened just outside Jonesborough in March 2021.\n\"I heard the roar of the engine and I could see in the rear view mirror that the lorry had come within inches of the bumper of our police vehicle,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\"I think I shouted to the others in the vehicle \u2018he\u2019s going to ram us\u2019 then the lorry continued back and forward, colliding and impacting with the back of our police vehicle.\"\nThere have been 154 ramming incidents involving police vehicles since 2020, according to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).\nSix vehicles also have been put permanently out of use and repair costs for others have ranged from \u00a34,000 to \u00a345,000 over the same period.\nDuring the incident near Jonesborough, the officer said her police vehicle was pushed into the middle of the main road where other cars were travelling at speeds of up to 60mph.\n\"The police car spun right around,\" she said.\n\"I was sitting as the front seat passenger and I was now looking up at his passenger side wheel and I can visualise it at my door and thinking \u2018I\u2019m going to be crushed alive here\u2019. \n\"But eventually he just squeezed past us and headed straight to the border.\"\nThe sergeant and her team from Newry's Ardmore Police Station had been assisting HMRC in a joint operation at a commercial site on the Edenappa Road near Jonesborough when they were rammed.\n\"That type of operation would be fairly routine for us,\" she said.\n\u201cWe go as a partner agency. That day we came in and got our briefing. There was no intelligence to suggest that anything untoward was going to happen.\"\nShe told BBC News NI that she was about to get out of her vehicle at the top of the convoy when she saw the lorry out of the corner of her eye. \nThe officer was off duty for six weeks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it really hit home until I got home that evening,\" she added.\n\u201cMy son had heard a bulletin on the news that the police had been rammed and he came running to the door crying and I was thinking \u2018Oh my goodness, this isn\u2019t just me anymore I have my children to consider and my job could have implications for my family life\u2019.\"\nIn April a motion was passed at Stormont condemning those responsible for ramming incidents, which have led to 77 officers being injured in 2023 alone.\nThe motion also sought to find solutions to tackle the problem.\nIt was originally brought forward by DUP assembly member Keith Buchanan, but was passed after a Sinn F\u00e9in amendment which removed a line that read - \"highlights that the spate of such attacks in south Armagh has coincided with far-reaching and politically-motivated policing reforms in the area\".\nAccording to PSNI statistics, 32 of the 154 ramming incidents since 2020 were in the Newry, Mourne and Down region.\nOther ramming incidents happened in Belfast, Omagh, Randalstown, Strabane and Fivemiletown.\nThe officer said every member of her team has had first-hand experience of being rammed.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one sergeant in my team, which is myself and there\u2019s eight constables beneath me and every single one of the constables has been involved in a ramming incident in south Armagh,\" she said.\nThe type of incidents can vary, according to the officer. \nShe said it might be a \"drink driver trying to evade capture and detection\", but that her team were also rammed during a domestic incident in November.",

    "The destruction of community and people being priced out of the area they have lived in for decades - these are the fears voiced by residents after regeneration plans were unveiled for their housing estate in Birmingham. \nThe transformation of Druids Heath, which was recently the backdrop for BBC drama This Town, has been in the pipeline for generations.\nPeni Whelan said plans to demolish 1,800 homes and replace them with 3,000 new ones would be the death of the estate\u2019s history and culture, while others said they faced losing homes they had lived in all their lives.\nBirmingham City Council said plans were still subject to an extensive consultation.\nArtists' impressions unveiled two weeks ago showed the authority's vision for the estate, with the homes due to be built with higher specifications alongside more green space.\nAll the homes in the south and north east of the estate will be demolished in several phases that will take up to 20 years to complete. \nMs Whelan, who runs the community radio station Hope Radio, said people would not be able to afford to move back once the work was complete.\n\"It's not a regeneration. It's a demolition,\" she told the BBC.\n\"It's a destruction of an entire community. People here love their houses, families live here and there is a sense of community that has been built since the 1960s.\n\"All our history, culture, connections - our network will die.\"\nThe 56-year-old said when the demolition began, locals would be \"dispersed\".\n\"As far as we\u2019re concerned it's pretty pictures and promises,\" she added.\nDavid Pitt, whose property is included in the third phase of the demolition, said he was worried about losing his family home.\n\"I've lived here all my life, my parents moved in here in 1967 when the house was brand new,\" the 53-year-old said.\n\"I'm worried and stressed because I don't want to move. \n\"This is my family home and there are no concrete promises on whether I'll be able to come back.\"\nThe former carpenter, who lives on Manningford Road, said the plans were \"daunting\" and questioned whether there would be enough social housing for him to come back to.\nWhen asked whether the plans could have a positive impact on the community, he said: \"When its completed, it will be an area everyone will want to live in - but will we be even be able to afford it?\".\nBirmingham City Council's initial plans to demolish the estate's tower blocks were approved by its cabinet six years ago. \nBut one resident said plans for its transformation had been around for much longer. \nPat Hollinshead, who has lived on the estate since 1986, said: \"We've had promises about the regeneration since my daughter was 18 months old. \n\"She's 45 years old now and still nothing's been done.\"\nThe 68-year-old, who runs Manningford Community Centre, said that while she backed the council's plans for change, the timescale was concerning.\n\"I agree with the plans - they\u2019re lovely. But by the time they\u2019re done, I\u2019ll be kicking up the daisies. \n\"People around here are worried to death.\"\nJulien Pritchard, Green Party councillor for Druids Heath & Monyhull, said: \"When I saw the plans I was taken aback by the extent of the demolition being proposed, and so are many residents.\n\"Druids Heath absolutely needs investment, having been forgotten for decades. \n\"But the council has to do this regeneration with residents, not to them. \nA spokesperson for Birmingham City Council said the current version of the masterplan was still only a proposal that was \"subject to extensive consultation with the community of Druids Heath and costs are not yet finalised as a result\".\nOn the funding behind the project, they added: \"The regeneration will be part funded by the council. \n\"The council will need to seek additional investment to fund the regeneration by working with private sector developers as well as other partners like housing associations.\"",
    "Jessie Stockdale died in October 2023 - her family attending a funeral and receiving a box of ashes back.\nIn March, they were horrified to learn her body had been found with 34 others at Legacy Independent Funeral Directors, in Hull, which is now the focus of a major police investigation over concern for care of the dead.\nOn Monday, the 89-year-old was finally laid to rest, with her family asking BBC News to cover the service at Hull Minster as they continue their fight for regulation of the funeral industry.\nSeveral months on from her death, Mrs Stockdale's family had hoped by now to be healing, comforted by happy memories.\nInstead, they found themselves repeating her funeral, with the scab of grief lifted the moment police told them they had found the great-grandmother's body in Legacy's funeral parlour in Hessle Road - an area she called home.\nStanding next to her coffin, adorned with a red wreath and a framed photograph of Mrs Stockdale, the Reverend Canon Dr Dominic Black told the 50-strong congregation: \"This is one of the most bizarre funerals I have ever had to do.\n\"It's the only time, in all my years, where people have already had a funeral and yet here we are.\"\nHe added: \"But this time we are properly laying Jessie to rest.\"  \nMourners filed into the building to joyous images showing Mrs Stockdale doing the things she loved most: laughing with family, knitting, and tending to her beloved animals and garden.\nDr Black said the day was about remembering this \"dear woman\".\nFollowing the hymn All Things Bright and Beautiful, Dr Black gave a summary of Mrs Stockdale's long life.\nHailing from a large family, Mrs Stockdale grew up in Hessle Road - the home of Hull's once mighty fishing industry. She was an evacuee during World War Two. \nMrs Stockdale met her future husband, Maurice, on a \"blind date\", said Dr Black, with the couple going on to have seven children, all born at home. \nTo make ends meet, Mrs Stockdale worked \"until her fingers were blue\" in Hull's numerous fish houses. She also worked as a cleaner at Smith and Nephew and, at weekends, at the Debenhams department store.\nBut the years of toil were not at the expense of fun, with the family telling how Mrs Stockdale's favourite holiday destination was Disneyland Paris, where she took her family several times.\n\"She was funny and she knew it,\" said Dr Black, to chuckles from her family.\nThe vicar told how Tristan Essex, 24, Mrs Stockdale's grandson, had lovingly cared for her in her final seven years.  \nSpeaking to the BBC after going to say his \"last goodbyes\" to his grandmother on Friday, Mr Essex told of the trauma inflicted on his family.\n\"Nobody ever expects to have to arrange a second funeral,\" he said.\n\"What has happened at Legacy is nothing short of traumatic. We have all been left having sleepless nights, nightmares... I think that is going to be a hard thing to overcome.\n\"All Nana's memories have been tainted.\"\nBut Mr Essex - one of a number of people calling for regulation of the funeral industry - said the family hoped the funeral would give them some comfort.  \nClosing the service before a private cremation, Dr Black cited a passage from Song of Songs, reminding Mrs Stockdale's family that \"love is stronger than death\".\nHe added: \"She will always be part of your family. That love carries on for generations.\"\nA 46-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman arrested on suspicion of prevention of a lawful and decent burial, fraud by false representation and fraud by abuse of position remain on bail as police inquiries continue. \nVisit BBC Sounds for audio updates on this story\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

    "A teenager stabbed a 17-year-old boy in a fight on a crowded dance floor at a party, Brighton Crown Court has been told.\nCharlie Cosser, from Milford, Surrey, died in hospital two days after he was stabbed at an outdoor event attended by more than 100 people in Warnham, Sussex, on 23 July 2023.\nThe 17-year-old defendant, who was 16 at the time and cannot be named, denies murder and having a bladed article.\nProsecutor Alan Gardner KC said the defendant and his friends had been asked to leave because of complaints from a girl, and it appears this triggered the violence.\nJurors saw video footage of revellers dancing under disco lights in a marquee, with a fight visible in the background.\nMr Gardner said: \u201cIn the darkness and noise of a crowded dance floor, (the defendant's) use of the knife and blows of the knife went unnoticed by those in the vicinity.\u201d\nHe said: \u201cThe knife came into contact with Charlie more than once, three times in fact, but it was the stab wound to the central area of his chest which proved to be the fatal injury.\u201d\nThe prosecutor said the defendant had shared a bottle of vodka with a friend and taken the knife to the party.\nHe said the teenager had been heard speaking about \u201cbeating\u201d another party-goer.\nA teenage girl heard him say \u201cget the shank\u201d which she believed to be a reference to a knife, he said.\nThe witness did not see a knife, but the reference was \u201csignificant\u201d, he added.\nWitnesses said they saw Mr Cosser lying on the grass after the fight and believed he was intoxicated, the court heard.\nLater, his friend saw his T-shirt was bloodstained and lifted it to see the wounds and another friend called an ambulance, jurors heard.\nThe prosecutor said other witnesses saw the defendant\u2019s hands and jogging bottoms covered in blood.\nOne boy said he heard him say \u201cI\u2019ve stabbed someone\u201d six or seven times, jurors were told.\nThe court heard Mr Cosser was still conscious when police arrived at 00:30 BST.

    "An independent study has been commissioned into the effects of emissions from a landfill site.\nStaffordshire County Council said researchers would speak to residents, businesses and schools in Silverdale, Newcastle-under-Lyme, about the impact of the ongoing issues around Walleys Quarry on mental and physical health.\nThey will also consider the impact of the landfill\u2019s gas emissions have had on children\u2019s education, the local economy, community safety and house prices.\nA spokesperson for Walleys Quarry said the landfill\u2019s operators were focused on minimising its impacts on the community around the site.\nA survey will be conducted by Arcadis Consulting, with results due to be published later in the year, the council said.\nThe project is being led by Dr Richard Harling, who said authorities were aware that gas emissions from the landfill had caused health symptoms for some residents and that the persistent unpleasant odour had affected some people's wellbeing.\n\"The sustained nature of this problem is very unusual and it\u2019s possible that some of the consequences are less obvious than others,\" he said.\n\"Residents, community groups, schools and businesses will be contacted in coming weeks and there will be a mixture of approaches to explore their experiences and form an independent assessment.\n\"We also want to understand how living with this problem has affected the community in other ways, how it may have affected local schools, businesses, and whether people have struggled to sell their homes since this became national news.\"\nThere have been a large number of complaints about odours coming from the landfill since late 2020.\nIn April this year, Newcastle-under-Lyme Borough Council asked the government for permission to pursue legal action against the landfill, accusing its owners of failing to properly control emissions from the site.\nIn January, the Environment Agency said it was not satisfied the operator was taking sufficient steps to put a stop to the foul-smelling gas emissions.\nA spokesperson for Walleys Quarry said the landfill was stringently regulated by the Environment Agency to ensure the onsite activities do not cause harm to human health or the environment.\n\"We play a vital role in offering residual waste disposal supporting wider recycling services,\" they added.\n\"The team is focused on managing the site to minimise impacts to community around the site and we will continue to do so.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "A bereaved mother who found the grave of her baby son 53 years after he was stillborn is calling for an official apology for the practices of the past.\nGina Jacobs, from Wirral, Merseyside, said she wants the government to say sorry for what she describes as \"lies, disrespect and a lack of dignity\" towards mothers who suffered a loss.  \nBefore the 1980s, stillborn babies were taken away from families who were not given any details of what happened to their babies or where they were buried.\nFor more than 50 years Mrs Jacobs carried the grief of not knowing the whereabouts of her stillborn baby son, until she finally found him almost two years ago. \nShe found him at Landican cemetery in Birkenhead after watching a series on the issue on BBC North West Tonight.\nThe 79-year-old named him Robert and decided to share her story online.\nSince then she\u2019s gone on to help other bereaved mothers to find more than 60 babies at her local cemetery.\n\u201cSo many people got in touch and I couldn\u2019t refuse. \n\"I had to help. But there was so much joy in it.\u201d\nIn March, Mrs Jacobs received the Wirral Award in recognition of her efforts. \nIt is a civil award intended to recognise individuals for an outstanding achievement.\n\u201cI felt the award was in honour of the babies and the families and the people who suffered so much through the arrangement of the time. \n\"The memory of those little precious faces has been stolen from us because we weren\u2019t allowed to see them.\u201d\nBack then, it was the belief of medical professionals that it was in the best interests of the mother to keep them from seeing their babies, and knowing what happened to them afterwards.\n\u201cThe mums were told to go home and get on with it. \n\"I mean, one lady was told \u2018plenty more where those came from\u2019.\u201d\nNow, she is hoping for an official apology which her MP, Margaret Greenwood, is supporting. \nEarlier this month, the MP took the issue to the Commons, raising it at Prime Minster's Questions. \nShe asked Prime Minster Rishi Sunak whether he would apologise on behalf of all previous governments for the former practice which left grieving parents with nowhere to visit their buried children.\nThe Wirral West MP said she wanted to make sure Mrs Jacobs received national recognition for what she\u2019s achieved.\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t an apology but there was a good response. I think it was great that [the Prime Minister] paid tribute to her,\" the Labour MP said.\nMr Sunak said that \"one of the most incredible things about doing his job was meeting people like Gina\".\nMr Sunak said in response to the question: \u201cShe deserves nothing but our praise and admiration and I am so pleased that she has brought comfort to so many other people, too.\u201d\nThe great, great grandmother never gave her baby boy a name until she finally found him in 2022, when she named him Robert.\n\u201cRobert was mentioned. His name was actually mentioned in the House of Commons. That meant so much to me.\u201d\nShe said she was pleased with the comments of the prime minster but that the issue of the apology was skirted around.\n\u201cIt has to be, I think, our government to apologise for what happened with previous governments, which is someone to just say, \u2018we\u2019re sorry\u2019,\" she said. \n\"\u2018We\u2019re sorry that you all were put through that. Sorry for the lies, sorry for disrespect and for the lack of dignity.\u2019 \u201d\nMrs Jacobs says she owes great thanks to the staff at Landican cemetery who have responded to her every request to access the public records and find more babies, which she continues to do.\nHer story is just one of many remarkable stories of lasting grief and loss, and of long awaited closure. \nShe believes the word she awaits could have the power to heal.\nIf you or someone you know has been affected by issues with pregnancy, these organisations may be able to help.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram?

    "Staff are allegedly bringing drugs into a privately-run prison where nine people died in two months, a Conservative MP has said.\nStephen Crabb said a prisoner had claimed that drugs are \"everywhere\" at HMP Parc.\nThe House of Commons was told that of the deaths, four have been linked to substance misuse.\nA spokesperson for the prison said the \"vast majority of our staff are hard working and honest\", and that a range of tactics were used to \"tackle the ingress of drugs\".\nConservative prisons minister Ed Argar said 400 members of staff had been trained to use an anti-opioid medicine amid concerns over a lab-made drug.\nHe said the government was looking \"very carefully\" at nitazenes - which were linked to dozens of deaths in the UK last year.\nTwo MPs said they had heard from the parents of prisoners who feared for their safety at the Bridgend prison, run by G4S.\nLabour's Nick Smith said a prisoner from his area of Blaenau Gwent had described inmates \"walking around with shanks\" - a handcrafted bladed-weapon - \"just to feel safe\".\nHis party colleague Jessica Morden, from Newport East, said a parent told her on Monday: \"Every day I expect a phone call fearing the worst, is my son going to be another statistic?\"\nMr Argar expressed his condolences to the families and friends who had lost loved ones at HMP Parc, where nine have died since March.\nHe said he had to be a \"little careful\" not to pre-empt investigations by the prisons and probation ombudsman, and coroner's inquests.\nWhile he said two recent deaths at the prison in May were \"not currently linked to substance misuse\", he said the issue should be considered \"in the wider contest of the threat synthetic opioids pose\" to prisons and the country \"more widely\".\n\"There have been extensive searches of prisoners and staff. Any suspicious substances are tested on site with rapid scan,\" he said.\nMr Crabb, the MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire, told the Commons there had been \"multiple allegations of the staff themselves bringing in illegal substances into the prison\".\nHe said a current prisoner had written to the Welsh Affairs Committee, which he chairs.\nReading the prisoner's evidence to MPs, Mr Crabb said: \"Drugs are everywhere in prison - from cannabis to heroin, and so called spice. Dribs and drabs may enter through visits, and some by way of drone. But let us not confuse the issue - far more comes in by people employed in prison.\"\nHe asked why no staff were currently searched using x-ray body scanners.\nMr Argar replied that the \"vast overwhelming majority of the staff that work in [HM Prisons and Probation Service - HMPPS] do so honestly and with good intent\".\nThe prison service does not have legal powers to use x-ray scanners on staff. \nThe minister told the Commons the body scanners were in use for \"visitors and others\", and handheld detectors had been rolled out to track down drugs or locate drugs in a \"much more effective manner\".\nThe minister was responding on Monday to an urgent question from the Labour MP for Ogmore Chris Elmore.\nGiving his condolences to the families of those who died, Mr Elmore raised concerns from the public about the use of the drug spice within and around the prison.\nHowever, he urged caution on what he said was an \"absolute wild west assumption\" on social media about what is happening inside the prison.\n\"One of the concerns is that the prison is a catalyst for spice being transferred in and out of the prison,\" the MP said.\nHe urged the minister to do what he could to try and bring \"calm\" to the prison estate and the wider community in Bridgend.\nMr Argar said they had significantly increased the number of staff at the prison: \"I do recognise a number of those staff are new in post. There's a need to ensure that they are supported by experienced officers.\"\nLabour Shadow minister for justice Ruth Cadbury said it was \"shocking\" that the prison ombudsman had to warn prisoners at HMP Park to \"throw away drugs immediately due to the serve risk that those particular ones posed to public health\".\nThe Conservative MP for Bridgend Jamie Wallis said social media speculation was not just a case of some \"irresponsible people\".\n\"There is genuine concern and genuine worry there about what it means for the communities, what it means for the town\".\nAsked who was responsible - G4S or the Ministry of Justice - Mr Argar said it was a \"shared responsibility between G4S, HMPPS, the council, the health board, the police and others\".\n\"Because this is a challenge for both the community and the prison\".\nWhile prisons are the responsibility of UK government, health care services are managed by the devolved Welsh government.\nLiz Saville Roberts, of Plaid Cymru, said: \"The nine deaths at HMP Parc in less than three months highlight how prisoner welfare in Wales is fragmented, with responsibilities split between the Welsh government and the [Ministry of Justice].\"\nShe called for deaths in prisons to be the subject of scrutiny in the Senedd as well as the UK Parliamen",

    "The government has confirmed how much money it gave to the Royal Family last year and how much it will provide in the future.\nThe taxpayer-funded settlement, known as the Sovereign Grant, is paid annually - but is not the King's only source of income.\nFor 2022-2023, the Sovereign Grant was worth \u00a386.3m, the same as in 2021-2022.\nBut repairs to Buckingham Palace - which is undergoing a 10-year \u00a3369m refurbishment plan - and the costs associated with King Charles succeeding Queen Elizabeth, plus higher-than-expected inflation, took total spending for the period to \u00a3107.5m, according to the Royal Household's annual financial report. \nThat represents a 5% increase on the \u00a3102.4m spent the previous year. \nThe shortfall, with spending greater than the Sovereign Grant, meant drawing \u00a320.7m from reserves.\nThe King and other working members of the Royal Family use the money to pay for expenses related to their official duties.\nThe vast majority is spent on the upkeep of properties and staff costs. \nMembers of the Royal Family carried out 2,700 engagements across the UK and abroad during the year.  \nMore than 95,000 guests attended 330 events at royal residences, including receptions, award investitures and garden parties. Buckingham Palace received more than 183,000 items of correspondence. \nThe Royal Family was previously funded through a fixed annual payment known as the Civil List. \nThis was replaced by the Sovereign Grant in 2012. \nProfits of the Crown Estate - a property business owned by the monarch but run independently - go to the Treasury. The level of profit is used as a benchmark to calculate the funding given by the government to the Royal Family. \nThe Crown Estate had assets worth \u00a316.5bn in 2022: almost \u00a38bn of properties in London, including Regent Street, as well as nearly half the land along the coast of England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nIt is not the King's private property - it merely belongs to the monarch for the duration of their reign. The King cannot sell its assets or keep any profits for himself.\nThe Sovereign Grant had been worth 15% of the Crown Estate profits generated two years previously. \nIn 2017 it was agreed that this would increase to 25% for 10 years to help pay for the Buckingham Palace repairs.\nUnder the Sovereign Grant Act 2011, if the Crown Estate's profits fall, the monarch still receives the same amount as the previous year, with the government making up the difference. \nAfter a review, the government announced the Sovereign Grant will be worth 12% of the Crown Estate's profits from next year.\nThe decision follows a significant increase in profits from six new offshore wind farms on the Crown Estate, worth \u00a31bn. \nIn January, King Charles said he wanted the extra profits to be used for the \"wider public good\".\nCutting the percentage will mean the total Sovereign Grant for 2024-25 will remain at \u00a386.3m for the third consecutive year. \nHowever, if Crown Estate profits grow as predicted, even under the reduced formula, the amount given to the Royal Family would then increase substantially, to \u00a3124.8m in 2025-2026 and \u00a3126m in 2026-2027. \nThe 12% figure is due to remain in place until the end of the 10-year Buckingham Palace restoration project in 2027. \nThe King also receives money from a private estate called the Duchy of Lancaster, which is passed down from monarch to monarch.\nIt covers more than 18,000 hectares of land in areas such as Lancashire and Yorkshire, as well as property in central London. Worth \u00a3654m, it generates about \u00a320m a year in profits.\nWhoever holds the title of Duke of Cornwall (currently Prince William) benefits from the Duchy of Cornwall.\nIt mainly covers land in south-west England. Worth \u00a31bn, it generated a net surplus of \u00a324m in 2022-23.\nThe King and Prince William receive the profits from the duchies personally, and can spend them as they wish. However, they are not entitled to any proceeds from the sale of any estate assets, which must be reinvested.\nThe monarch also owns the royal palaces (which are not part of the Crown Estate) and part of the Royal Collection of art, but these do not generate income. \nSome palaces are looked after and funded by the Royal Family itself.

    "A former Army soldier has said he was given contaminated blood as medics fought to save his life.\nAfter losing his leg in 1979, Brendan West, from Farnborough in Hampshire, was given a blood transfusion while at a British military hospital in Germany.\nBut four decades later he discovered he was infected with hepatitis C when a blood donation was rejected.\nThe Home Office said it would continue to listen to the community as it addressed the infected blood scandal.\nIt is not known for sure if the blood transfusion was the cause of Mr West's diagnosis but he said the timeline seemed to match.\nAfter signing up to the Army in 1976, Mr West was deployed to the British Military base in Germany as part of his work with the Royal Electrical Mechanical Engineers (REME).\nWhile on duty outside of the barracks in 1979, Mr West was hit by a car and rushed to hospital with a leg which was \"smashed to pieces\", he said.\nWith his condition deteriorating, the decision was made to amputate his leg and he was given a blood transfusion.\n\"I wouldn't blame surgeons, or nurses, or whoever gave me the blood, but systematically there is obviously some blame there,\" he said.\nMr West, now 63, only discovered he was infected with the virus when he was turned away from donating blood during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nA letter soon arrived in the post informing him hepatitis C antibodies had been detected, and that the blood bank could not take his donation.\nOnce he had been tested for the virus, he said a specialist nurse told him: \"By the looks of the reading, you have had this for more than 20 years.\"\nHe added: \"We then backtracked through my Army medical records and it seems it was as a result of a blood transfusion from my injuries.\"\nFurther tests revealed Mr West, who was born in Colne, Lancashire, had suffered severe liver damage as a result of the virus going undetected for so many years.\nMr West said the news had affected his mental health.\nHe said he felt the government had been \"totally uncaring\" towards victims of the infected blood scandal.\n\"Having served my country, and trying to have faith in the government, but all I see publicly is that they're kicking me while I'm down,\" he said.\nA government spokesperson described the infected blood scandal as \"an appalling tragedy that never should have happened\".\nThey said a new body would deliver compensation for those affected, once victims had been identified and claims assessed.\nThe final report of the infected blood inquiry is due to be published on 20 May.\nThe Ministry of Defence declined to comment.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

    "A year after undergoing a world-first treatment for glioblastoma, Australian doctor Richard Scolyer remains cancer-free.\nThe esteemed pathologist's experimental therapy is based on his own pioneering research on melanoma.\nProf Scolyer's subtype of glioblastoma is so aggressive most patients survive less than a year.\nBut on Tuesday the 57-year-old announced his latest MRI scan had again showed no recurrence of the tumour.\n\"To be honest, I was more nervous than I have been for any previous scan,\" he told the BBC.\n\"I'm just thrilled and delighted... couldn't be happier.\"\nProf Scolyer is one of the country's most respected medical minds, and was this year named Australian of the Year alongside his colleague and friend Georgina Long, in recognition of their life-changing work on melanoma.\nAs co-directors of the Melanoma Institute Australia, over the past decade the pair's research on immunotherapy, which uses the body's immune system to attack cancer cells, has dramatically improved outcomes for advanced melanoma patients globally. Half are now essentially cured, up from less than 10%.\nIt's that research that Prof Long, alongside a team of doctors, is using to treat Prof Scolyer - in the hope of finding a cure for his cancer too.\nIn melanoma, Prof Long - herself a renowned medical oncologist - and her team discovered that immunotherapy works better when a combination of drugs is used, and when they are administered before any surgery to remove a tumour. And so, Prof Scolyer last year became the first brain cancer patient to ever have combination, pre-surgery immunotherapy.\nHe is also the first to be administered a vaccine personalised to his tumour's characteristics, which boosts the cancer-detecting powers of the drugs.\nAfter a tough couple of months of treatment at the start of the year - spent dealing with epileptic seizures, liver issues and pneumonia - Prof Scolyer says he is feeling healthier.\n\"I'm the best I have felt for yonks,\" he said, adding that he's back to exercising every day - which for him often means a casual 15km (9.3 mile) jog.\n\"It certainly doesn't mean that my brain cancer is cured... but it's just nice to know that it hasn't come back yet, so I've still got some more time to enjoy my life with my wife Katie and my three wonderful kids.\"\nThe results so far have generated huge excitement that the duo may be on the cusp of a discovery which could one day help the roughly 300,000 people diagnosed with brain cancer globally each year.\nProf Scolyer and Prof Long have previously said the odds of a cure are \"minuscule\", but they hope the experimental treatment will prolong Prof Scolyer's life and will soon translate into clinical trials for glioblastoma patients.\nThey currently have a scientific paper under review, which details results from the first weeks of Prof Scolyer's treatment, but Prof Long stresses that they are still a long way off developing an approved and regulated course of treatment. \n\"We've generated a whole heap of data, to then make a foundation for that next step, so that we can help more people,\" she said.\n\"We're not there yet. What we have to really focus on is showing that this pre-surgery, combination immunotherapy type of approach works in a large number of people.\"\nRoger Stupp - the doctor after whom the current protocol for treating glioblastomas is named - earlier this year told the BBC Prof Scolyer's prognosis was \"grim\", and that it was too early to tell if the treatment is working.\nHe added that while Mr Scolyer's earlier results were \"encouraging\", he wanted to see him reach 12 months, even 18, without recurrence before getting excited.\nProf Scoyler said he's already proud of the data his treatment has generated and grateful to his family and his medical team for supporting \"this experiment\".\n\"I feel proud of the team that I work with. I feel proud that they're willing to take the risk in going down this path.\"\n\"[It] provides some hope that maybe this is a direction that's worth investigating more formally.\"",
    "US President Joe Biden is ramping up tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars, solar panels, steel and other goods.\nThe White House said the measures, which include a 100% border tax on electric cars from China, were a response to unfair policies and intended to protect US jobs. \nChina said it was opposed to the hikes and would take retaliatory measures.\nAnalysts said the tariffs were largely symbolic and intended to shore up votes in a tough election year.\nThey follow months of criticism by former President Donald Trump, who is running for the White House against Mr Biden and has argued his rival's support for electric cars would \"kill\" the US car industry.\nMr Biden on Tuesday vowed that he would not let China \"unfairly control the market\" for electric vehicles and other key goods, including batteries, computer chips and basic medical supplies. \n\"If the pandemic taught us anything - we need\u00a0to have a secure supply\u00a0of essentials\u00a0here at home,\" he said.\nThe tariffs announced on Tuesday will hit an estimated $18bn worth of imports, the White House said.\nAs well as a rise from 25% to 100% on electric vehicle tariffs, levies on solar cells will increase from 25% to 50%.\nTariff rates on certain steel and aluminium products will more than triple to 25%, up from 7.5% or less.  \nIn response, China's commerce ministry said the new moves would \"severely affect the atmosphere for bilateral cooperation\", and criticised what it characterised as the politicisation of economic issues.\nAhead of the heavily-trailed White House announcement on Tuesday, a spokesperson for China's foreign ministry said it \"will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests\".\nThe moves expand sweeping border taxes that the US imposed on Chinese goods under Mr Trump, citing unfair trade practices. \nDuring the Biden administration's review of the measures, the government received nearly 1,500 comments, the vast majority of them from business owners arguing that they were driving up prices for everyday Americans, and asking them to be removed.\nMr Biden's decision to leave the tariffs in place and expand them into new areas - even as persistent US inflation has weighed on his approval ratings - is a testament to the dramatic shift in trade views for both political parties in the US, which had long championed the benefits of global commerce.\nWendy Cutler, a former trade official for the US who is now vice-president of the Asia Society Policy Institute, said she believed Americans were willing to accept higher priced cars, in exchange for helping to protect US companies and jobs.\n\"We've seen this movie before - with solar, with steel and [aluminium], and when it comes to cars and other products the United States needs to get ahead of the curve,\" she said.\n\"It's all about trade-offs and maybe in the immediate term cars become more expensive but in the longer term we want to have a competitive industry here.\"\nIn a briefing with reporters, White House officials denied that domestic politics had influenced the decision. \nThey said Beijing had shown no sign of moving away from practices that harm the US, including rules that force western companies to share information with the aim of stealing it and subsidies that have put firms in a position to pump out products well beyond expected demand.\n\"They're flooding the market,\" Mr Biden said. \"It's not competing - it's cheating.\"\nThe White House said the tariffs were targeted and it did not expect them to stoke inflation, contrasting their approach with that of Mr Trump.\nThe former president, who once called himself a \"tariff man\", has campaigned on a proposed across-the-board 10% tariff on foreign imports, which could jump to 60% for goods from China.\nHe has also attacked Mr Biden for promoting electric vehicles, a move he has argued will destroy US car companies, key employers in states such as Michigan that will be key election battlegrounds in November. \nErica York, senior economist at the Tax Foundation, said both candidates were \"heading down the same path\" of higher barriers to trade and looking inward \"rather than looking at what we can do on the policy front that would actually make our sectors more competitive\".\nShe said the administration's promotion of the tariffs as strategic was a \"euphemism for protection for sectors that are politically important for this administration\".\n\"It comes down to a political economy calculus rather than what makes the most economic sense or what's most affordable for US consumers.\"\nThe US already imposes steep tariffs on electric vehicles made in China, which has made sales of such cars negligible.\nBut Washington has been watching warily as sales by Chinese companies in Europe and other countries increase. \nWhite House officials said ensuring that green technologies were not dominated by a single country was critical to making the transition successful and sustainable in the long run. \nWhile moves targeting electric vehicles are likely to h",
    "OpenAI has unveiled the latest version of the tech which underpins its AI chatbot ChatGPT.\nIt\u2019s called GPT-4o, and it will be rolled out to all users of ChatGPT, including non-subscribers.\nIt is faster than earlier models and has been programmed to sound chatty and sometimes even flirtatious in its responses to prompts.\nThe new version can read and discuss images, translate languages, and identify emotions from visual expressions. There is also memory so it can recall previous prompts.\nIt can be interrupted and it has an easier conversational rhythm - there was no delay between asking it a question and receiving an answer.\nDuring a live demo using the voice version of GPT-4o, it provided helpful suggestions for how to go about solving a simple equation written on a piece of paper - rather than simply solving it.  It analysed some computer code, translating between Italian and English and interpreted the emotions in a selfie of a smiling man.\nUsing a warm American female voice, it greeted its prompters by asking them how they were doing. When paid a compliment, it responded: \u201cStop it, you\u2019re making me blush!\u201d.\nIt wasn\u2019t perfect \u2013 at one point it mistook the smiling man for a wooden surface, and it started to solve an equation that it hadn\u2019t yet been shown. This unintentionally demonstrated that there\u2019s still some way to go before the glitches and hallucinations which make chatbots unreliable and potentially unsafe, can be ironed out.\nBut what it does show us is the direction of travel for OpenAI, which I think intends  GPT-4o to become the next generation of AI digital assistant, a kind of turbo-charged Siri or Hey, Google which remembers what it\u2019s been told in the past and can interact beyond voice or text.\nIf there was an elephant in the room, alongside the enthusiastic off-camera audience whooping and applauding, it was the environmental price tag of this technology.\nWe know that AI is more power-hungry than traditional computing tasks, and that the more sophisticated it becomes, the more computing power it requires. There was no mention of sustainability during the evening.\nWe have seen chatbots like Elon Musk\u2019s Grok and Pi, from DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, prioritise the \u201cpersonality\u201d of their products, but the way in which GPT-4o seamlessly handled the combination of text, audio and images with an instant response appears to put OpenAI ahead of the competition.\nOf course, at the moment we only have the firm\u2019s word for it \u2013 it was their demo, carefully curated and managed by them. It will be interesting to see how GPT-4o copes at scale with the millions of people who already use ChatGPT as it rolls out.\nOpenAI's chief technology officer Mira Murati described GPT-4o as \u201cmagical\u201d but added that the firm would \u201cremove that mysticism\u201d with the product\u2019s roll-out.\nAn interesting and emotive choice of words: while this tech is rapidly becoming more sophisticated and increasingly convincing as a companion \u2013 it is not sentient or magic, it is complex programming and machine learning.\nThere have been rumours about a partnership between OpenAI and Apple and while this has not yet been confirmed, it was telling during the presentation that Apple products were used throughout. \nAnother shot across the bows was the timing of this event, 24 hours before its rival Google is due to show off its latest AI developments at its annual conference, Google IO.",
    "China's ambassador has been summoned by the UK Foreign Office, after three people were accused of assisting Hong Kong's intelligence services.\nIn a meeting with Zheng Zeguang, the Foreign Office officials condemned a \"recent pattern of behaviour\" by China, including cyber-attacks.\nOn Monday, three men in the UK were charged with offences under the National Security Act.\nHong Kong called on UK officials to provide \"full details\" of the charges.\nChina, under which Hong Kong operates as a special administrative region, has refuted the allegations that the city's intelligence service was involved.\nThe Foreign Office said it told Mr Zheng that the \"recent pattern of behaviour directed by China against the UK, including cyber-attacks, reports of espionage links and the issuing of bounties\" was \"not acceptable\". \nIn a statement, the Chinese embassy described the allegations as \"groundless and slanderous\".\nIt said it had complained to the UK government about its \"wrongful behaviour,\" including the \"unwarranted accusation\" against the Hong Kong government. \nMr Zheng had \"made further, serious representations to the UK side on the UK's wrongful behaviour, including its unwarranted accusation\" of Hong Kong's government. \nChi Leung (Peter) Wai, 38, Matthew Trickett, 37 and Chung Biu Yuen, 63, are accused of agreeing to undertake information gathering, surveillance and acts of deception that were likely to materially assist a foreign intelligence service between 20 December 2023 and 2 May.\nMr Wai is a UK Border Force officer and Mr Trickett is a Home Office immigration officer who served as a Royal Marine for six years. \nMr Yuen, also known as Billy Yuen, is a retired Hong Kong police officer who now works as a trade official for the territory based in London.\nOn Tuesday, Hong Kong's leader John Lee said he did not know Mr Yuen personally after a photo of the two men reported to have been taken in 2002 began circulating online and in the media. \nMr Lee confirmed in a news conference that both he and Mr Yuen were in the photo - reportedly from a graduation ceremony at Australia's Charles Stuart University - but said \"my impression of that person is just this photo\". \nHe also told reporters that his government had requested more information from the UK government about the accusations and was \"waiting for a reply\".\nThe three accused men have yet to enter pleas and were granted bail until 24 May, when they are due to appear at the Old Bailey.\nDistrict Judge Louisa Cieciora imposed conditions including a 10:00 to 05:00 curfew, reporting weekly to their local police station, no international travel and informing police of devices used to access the internet.\nDowning Street said the charges were \"deeply concerning\" and that the prime minister \"thanks the police for their work keeping us safe\".",
    "For years, Western spy agencies have talked of a need to pivot to focus on China. This week, the head of the UK's GCHQ intelligence agency described it as an \"epoch-defining challenge\".\nIt follows a series of arrests across the West of people accused of spying and hacking for China. And on Monday, China's ambassador was summoned by the UK Foreign Office, after three people were accused of assisting Hong Kong's intelligence services.\nThese are a sign of a normally hidden contest for power and influence between the West and China bursting out into the open.\nThe West - the US and its allies - are determined to push back. But senior officials worry the West has not taken the challenge from China seriously enough and has fallen behind in intelligence terms, leaving the West more vulnerable to Beijing's spying, and both sides at risk of a potentially catastrophic miscalculation.\nWhat concerns Western officials is Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s determination that Beijing will shape a new international order. \"Ultimately it aspires to displace the United States as the foremost power,\" the chief of MI6, Sir Richard Moore, told me in a rare interview in his office for a new BBC series on China and the West.\nBut despite years of issuing warnings, Western intelligence services have struggled until recently to concentrate their focus on Chinese activity.\nNigel Inkster, who was number two at MI6 when he retired in 2006, says China's emergence as a major global power \"took place at a time when there were a lot of other pre-occupations\".\nAs Beijing rose on the world stage during the 2000s, the thinking of Western policymakers and security officials - and the focus of the intelligence services - was dominated by the so-called war on terror and military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nShadow war: China and the West\nThe rise of China is the defining challenge of our times - how far to co-operate, compete or confront. Gordon Corera asks if the West has been slow to wake up.\nListen now on BBC Sounds\nMore recently, a resurgent Russia and now the Israel-Gaza war have appeared more urgent challenges, officials in the US and Europe concede.\nAt the same time, there has been pressure from government and businesses alike to focus on securing access to China's huge market, rather than confronting the security risk it poses.\nPolitical leaders frequently preferred their intelligence chiefs not to call China out by name. And businesses too preferred not to admit their secrets were being targeted.\n\"The pendulum did swing very far in the direction of the economic and commercial interests,\" says Nigel Inkster.\nChinese intelligence was already engaging in industrial espionage back in the 2000s, he says, but Western companies typically stayed quiet. \"They didn't want to report it for fear that doing so would jeopardise their position in China's markets,\" he says.\nAnother major challenge has been that China spies differently from the West. That has made its activity harder both to recognise and confront.\nA former Western spy says he once improbably told a Chinese counterpart that China did the \"wrong type\" of spying. What he meant was that Western states prefer to focus on gathering the kind of intelligence that helps them understand their adversaries. But Chinese spies have different priorities.\nProtecting the position of the Communist Party is central. \"Regime stability is their number one goal,\" Roman Rozhavsky, an FBI counterintelligence official, explains.\nThat requires delivering economic growth. And so China\u2019s spies see acquiring Western technology as a top national security requirement. Western spies say their Beijing counterparts share information they have gathered with Chinese state-run companies, in a way that the West\u2019s intelligence agencies do not with their own domestic firms.\n\"My agency is busier than we've ever been in our 74 years of history,\" Mike Burgess, the plain-speaking head of the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation (Asio) explained to me.\n\"I rarely call out countries because when it comes to straight espionage, we do it to them,\" Burgess told me. \"Commercial espionage is a completely different matter, and that's why China is getting special treatment on this one.\"\nHe acknowledged that the Western allies had been slow to understand this threat. \"I think it's been going on for a long time and collectively we've missed it,\" he admits.\nWe were sitting down last October in California, where he was taking part in the first ever public appearance by the security chiefs of the so-called Five Eyes \u2013 the intelligence-sharing alliance made up of the US, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.\nThe unprecedented gathering was a very deliberate attempt to turn up the volume of warnings about China because of the fear that many companies and organisations were still not listening. The location in Silicon Valley was also carefully chosen - a spotlight on China\u2019s attempts to steal technology, sometimes through cyber",
    "\"For Indians, spices are like paints in a paint box\", says Indian actor-turned-food writer Madhur Jaffrey. \"We get different shades from the same spice by doing something to the spice.\" \nIn other words, you can roast the spices or grind them into powders. The diversity of their flavours is mind-boggling. Indian spices enhance pickles and season meat. They flavour savouries and street food. Zesty spices energise local fruit drinks and add a tangy twist to fruits and salads.\nUnsurprisingly, India has emerged as a global spice powerhouse. It exports more than 200 spices and value-added products to some 180 countries, worth $4bn (\u00a33.1bn), according to the Spices Board of India. The domestic market alone is worth a staggering $10bn, making it the world's largest consumer of spices.\nBut now, concerns are emerging regarding the safety of these renowned spices. Last month, Singapore and Hong Kong halted sales of some spices produced by Indian companies MDH and Everest over suspected elevated levels of ethylene oxide, a cancer-causing pesticide. \nThat's not all. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is also investigating products from the two popular brands for potentially containing the pesticide, an FDA spokesperson told Reuters. An analysis done by the news agency of the US regulatory data found that since 2021, an average of 14.5% of US shipments of MDH spices were rejected due to presence of bacteria. Both brands insist that their products are safe.\nThe European Union (EU) has raised concerns of its own, discovering the same cancer-causing substance in samples of chilli peppers and peppercorns from India. Reports say that the Maldives, Bangladesh and Australian food regulators have also launched investigations. \n(Source: Spices Board, Global Trade Research Initiative)\nClearly, it is a disturbing development. For one, both the brands are popular and trusted ones. Delhi-based MDH, an iconic 105-year-old family-run firm, offers a range of more than 60 blended and ground spices. The 57-year-old Everest Food Products, launched by a spice trader, claims to be India's \"largest manufacturer of pure and blended spices\", exporting to over 80 countries. Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan, Bollywood superstars, have served as Everest's brand ambassadors.\nTo be sure, this is not the first time Indian spices have been found to be contaminated. In 2014, Ipsita Mazumdar, a biochemistry expert, tested popular spice brands in Kolkata which made chilli, cumin, curry powder, and garam masala. She found lead in the food colouring used to give the spices vibrant orange or red hues. And more recently in April, food and drugs control authorities in Gujarat seized more than 60,000kg of adulterated spices - chilli powder, turmeric and coriander power and pickle masala. \nSo are Indian spices safe? The federal government has instructed all state governments to conduct quality tests. The Spices Board - which has five quality evaluation labs - has issued guidelines to exporters to check for use of ethylene oxide. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is also testing samples. \nIndia's health ministry claims the country has one of the world's strictest Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) standards, with pesticides' MRLs varying by food commodity and determined through rigorous risk assessments. But something is clearly amiss: in 2022, the FDA highlighted inadequate sanitary facilities, accommodation, and equipment cleanliness standards at a premier Indian spice plant.\n\"India has been a spice exporter for centuries. But this image has been declining in the last few years, with the government's inadequate attention. We do not yet know at which stage the contamination is happening. Ethylene oxide is not used by farmers. It is most probably a post-harvest, post-processing residue,\" says Narasimha Reddy Donthi, an independent researcher and environmental justice activist.\n\"It is not only the negative attention. Repeated cases of excessive residues can have a long-term effect. In the past, mango exports to the US suffered for years due to pesticide residues,\" Mr Reddy adds.\nDelhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) believes the recent quality concerns could threaten half of India's spice exports due to \"cascading regulatory actions in many countries\".\nIf China questions the quality of Indian spices, over half of India's global exports could be affected, joining five other countries, the GTRI said in a recent report. \"The situation could worsen if the EU, which regularly rejects Indian spice consignments over quality issues, follows suits.\" \nFor spice enthusiasts in the West, the origin of the spices in their food remains unclear.\n\"I don't think most people are aware of where their spices come from. I certainly don't, and I use spices a lot! I live a few blocks from Chicago's main Indian shopping district, Devon Avenue, which is where I buy my spice. l assume they come from India but have never looked into this",
    "The first official painted portrait of King Charles III since his coronation has been unveiled at Buckingham Palace. \nThe vast oil on canvas shows a larger-than-life King Charles in the uniform of the Welsh Guards. \nThe vivid red work, measuring about 8ft 6in by 6ft 6in, is by Jonathan Yeo, who has also painted Tony Blair, Sir David Attenborough and Malala Yousafzai.\nQueen Camilla is said to have looked at the painting and told Yeo: \"Yes, you've got him.\"\nIn the new portrait, the King is depicted, sword in hand, with a butterfly landing on his shoulder.\nUnveilings are always a little nerve-wracking, both for the sitter and the artist, but particularly when one of them is a King.\nYeo jokes: \"If this was seen as treasonous, I could literally pay for it with my head, which would be an appropriate way for a portrait painter to die - to have their head removed!\"\nIn reality, Yeo isn't going to lose his head of course - no executions for a badly received portrait of a monarch, in modern times anyway.\nFortunately, he has also already had a nod of approval from a key royal figure.\nThe Queen dropped in during the final sitting and said the artist had captured the King well. Yeo says the best judge of a portrait is someone who knows your sitter really well because they have instant recognition of whether it feels familiar.  \nThe King also got a glimpse of it, says Yeo, in its \"half-done state\u2026 He was initially mildly surprised by the strong colour but otherwise he seemed to be smiling approvingly\".\nIt is a vibrant painting.\nThe King was made Regimental Colonel in the Welsh Guards in 1975. In the picture, the red of the uniform fades into the red background, bringing the King's face into even more prominence.\nYeo says he wanted the painting to be distinctive and a break with the past. He was aiming for something personal. \n\"My interest is really in figuring out who someone is and trying to get that on a canvas.\"\nYeo decided to use some of the traditions of royal portraiture - the military outfit, the sword - but aimed to achieve something more modern, particularly with the deep colour and the butterfly.\nHe says he's referencing the tradition of official royal portraits but suggesting that's something \"from the past and what's interesting about them is something a bit different from that\". \n\"In history of art, the butterfly symbolises metamorphosis and rebirth,\" he explains, fitting for a portrait being painted of a monarch who has recently ascended to the throne.\nThe butterfly is also a reference to the King's long held interest in the environment, causes \"he has championed most of his life and certainly long before they became a mainstream conversation\". \nYeo says it was Charles' idea after they talked about the opportunity they had to tell a story with the portrait.\n\"I said, when schoolchildren are looking at this in 200 years and they're looking at the who's who of the monarchs, what clues can you give them?\n\"He said 'what about a butterfly landing on my shoulder?'\".\nYeo began the portrait when Charles was still Prince of Wales, with the first sitting at Highgrove in June 2021. \nThe King sat four times in all, for about an hour at a time, with the final sitting at Clarence House in November 2023. Did the artist notice any obvious change in the man after he became King?\nYeo says he's spotted \"a physical change\" in politicians he's painted in the past. \"They physically look and feel different when they're in high office or out of it.\"\nYeo adds the King \"had already been gaining presence and stature by the time I started it, and it went up a level again when he became King, as you'd expect\". \nThe sittings ended before the King's cancer was diagnosed. He had a lot going on, says Yeo, with an upcoming speech at the COP Summit, but \"didn't seem like someone who was physically exhausted\".\nHe was \"in good spirits\", the painter adds.\nKing Charles posed in his full Welsh Guards uniform and had to stand leaning on his sword for around 40 minutes each time.\n\"He stood impressively still, and didn't get distracted like some sitters do.\"\nYeo won't reveal much of what they talked about during sittings, although he says Charles III has \"a great sense of humour\" and is a \"very engaging person\".\nHis interest in art meant Charles wanted to discuss the process of creating the work and the brushes being used. They also talked about \"how he'd learned to paint and about some of the pictures on the walls\".\nBut Yeo says \"there's a sanctity to the portrait process\". Your sitters \"need to believe what goes on is between the two of you because that way I think they feel more comfortable about opening up\".\nRoyal portraits in the past have had an important role to play in signifying power and projecting an image. They were part of the tools used to ensure the survival of the monarch. Some of the most memorable include Henry VIII by Hans Holbein the Younger. The Tudor king employed Holbein as court artist, although only two portraits survive.\nBut ",
    "\u201cI don't want anyone to think that I ever said these horrible things in my life. Using a Ukrainian girl for a face promoting Russia. It's crazy.\u201d\nOlga Loiek has seen her face appear in various videos on Chinese social media - a result of easy-to-use generative AI tools available online.\n\u201cI could see my face and hear my voice. But it was all very creepy, because I saw myself saying things that I never said,\u201d the 21-year-old, who studies at the University of Pennsylvania, told the BBC.\nThe accounts featuring her likeness had dozens of different names like Sofia, Natasha, April, and Stacy. These \u201cgirls\u201d were speaking in Mandarin - a language Olga had never learned. They were apparently from Russia, and talked about China-Russia friendship or advertised Russian products.\n\u201cI saw like 90% of the videos were talking about China and Russia, China-Russia friendship, that we have to be strong allies, as well as advertisements for food.\u201d\nOne of the biggest accounts was \u201cNatasha imported food\u201d with a following of more than 300,000 users. \u201cNatasha\u201d would say things like \u201cRussia is the best country. It\u2019s sad that other countries are turning away from Russia, and Russian women want to come to China\u201d, before starting to promote products like Russian candies.\nThis personally enraged Olga, whose family is still in Ukraine.\nBut on a wider level, her case has drawn attention to the dangers of a technology that is developing so quickly that regulating it and protecting people has become a real challenge.\nOlga\u2019s Mandarin-speaking AI lookalikes began emerging in 2023 - soon after she started a YouTube channel which is not very regularly updated.\nAbout a month later, she started getting messages from people who claimed they saw her speak in Mandarin on Chinese social media platforms.\nIntrigued, she started looking for herself, and found AI likenesses of her on Xiaohongshu - a platform like Instagram - and Bilibili, which is a video site similar to YouTube.\n\u201cThere were a lot of them [accounts]. Some had things like Russian flags in the bio,\u201d said Olga who has found about 35 accounts using her likeness so far.\nAfter her fianc\u00e9 tweeted about these accounts, HeyGen, a firm that she claims developed the tool used to create the AI likenesses, responded.\nThey revealed more than 4,900 videos have been generated using her face. They said they had blocked her image from being used anymore.\nA company spokesperson told the BBC that their system was hacked to create what they called \u201cunauthorised content\u201d and added that they immediately updated their security and verification protocols to prevent further abuse of their platform.\nBut Angela Zhang, of the University of Hong Kong, says what happened to Olga is \u201cvery common in China\u201d.\nThe country is \u201chome to a vast underground economy specialising in counterfeiting, misappropriating personal data, and producing deepfakes\u201d, she said.\nThis is despite China being one of the first countries to attempt to regulate AI and what it can be used for. It has even modified its civil code to protect likeness rights from digital fabrication.\nStatistics disclosed by the public security department in 2023 show authorities arrested 515 individuals for \u201cAI face swap\u201d activities. Chinese courts have also handled cases in this area.\nBut then how did so many videos of Olga make it online?\nOne reason could be because they promoted the idea of friendship between China and Russia.\nBeijing and Moscow have grown significantly closer in recent years. Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Putin have said the friendship between the two countries has \u201cno limits\u201d. The two are due to meet in China this week.\nChinese state media have been repeating Russian narratives justifying its invasion of Ukraine and social media has been censoring discussion of the war.\n\u201cIt is unclear whether these accounts were coordinating under a collective purpose, but promoting a message that is in line with the government\u2019s propaganda definitely benefits them,\u201d said Emmie Hine, a law and technology researcher from the University of Bologna and KU Leuven.\n\u201cEven if these accounts aren\u2019t explicitly linked to the CCP [Chinese Communist Party], promoting an aligned message may make it less likely that their posts will get taken down.\u201d\nBut this means that ordinary people like Olga remain vulnerable and are at risk of falling foul of Chinese law, experts warn.\nKayla Blomquist, a technology and geopolitics researcher at Oxford University, warns that \u201cthere is a risk of individuals being framed with artificially generated, politically sensitive content\u201d who could be subject to \u201crapid punishments enacted without due process\u201d.\nShe adds that Beijing\u2019s focus in relation to AI and online privacy policy has been to build out consumer rights against predatory private actors, but stresses that \u201ccitizen rights in relation to the government remain extremely weak\u201d.\nMs Hine explains that the \u201cfundamental goal of China\u2019s AI regulations is to balance maintaining s",
    "A sailing yacht has sunk in Moroccan waters in the Strait of Gibraltar after being rammed by an unknown number of orcas, Spain's maritime rescue services said.\nTwo people onboard the vessel, Alboran Cognac, were rescued by a passing oil tanker, after the incident at 0900 local time (0800 BST) on Sunday.\nIt is the latest in a series of orca rammings of vessels around the Strait of Gibraltar over the past four years.\nScientists are unsure about the exact causes of the behaviour, but believe the highly intelligent mammals could be displaying \"copycat\" or \"playful\" behaviour.\nSpain's maritime rescue service said the two passengers reported feeling sudden blows to the hull and rudder, causing water to seep into the vessel.\nThe couple alerted emergency services and were rescued by a nearby oil tanker which then took them to Gibraltar.\nThe yacht was left adrift and eventually sank.\nOrca rammings in the Strait of Gibraltar - one of the busiest waterways in the world, with approximately 300 ships crossing daily - and off the Atlantic coast of Portugal and north-western Spain, have become increasingly common over the past four years.\nExperts believe them to involve a subpopulation of about 15 orcas given the designation \"Gladis\".\nThe research group GTOA, which tracks the population of the Iberian orca sub-species, has documented nearly 700 interactions involving the species, since the attacks were first reported in May 2020.\nExperts believe attacks first began after one or two orcas, which are also known as killer whales, started interacting with and damaging small sailing vessels that month. \nOne of the main theories that has circulated social media is that the orcas are seeking revenge for White Gladis - a killer whale supposedly hit by a boat.\nThat caught on when Alfredo L\u00f3pez Fernandez, from research group GTOA, was quoted as saying a \"traumatised orca\" had launched the attacks.\nBut, according to animal behaviour experts, this might not be true.\n\"The idea of revenge is a great story, but there's no evidence for it,\" neuroscientist Lori Marino, president of the Whale Sanctuary Project previously told the BBC.\n\"There's never been a case of an orca harming a human being in the wild.\n\"If they really wanted to do damage and harm the people on the boat they could easily do that.\"\nInstead, Lori told the BBC, it's more likely the apparent attacks \"started out as play behaviour\", and it's a case of copycat killer whales rather than aggression.\n\"We're talking about very intelligent beings, and we know that they are social learners,\" she says.\nScientists think the endangered mammals instead appear to be \"playing\" with the boats out of curiosity and copycat behaviour, rather than aggression.",
    "Timber smuggling, estimated to be worth $23m (\u00a318m) a year, from Mozambique\u2019s ancient forests to China is helping to fund a brutal Islamist insurgency as well as a large criminal network in the north of the southern African country.\nThis illicit trade in rosewood is linked to the financing of Mozambique\u2019s Islamic-State linked militants, in the northernmost province of Cabo Delgado, according to data seen by the BBC from the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), an NGO that campaigns against alleged environmental crime.\nRosewood is a catch-all trade term for a wide range of tropical hardwoods that are highly prized for luxury furniture in China.\nMozambique\u2019s rosewood is protected under an international treaty, meaning only very limited trade that does not threaten the species is allowed.\nHowever, a four-year undercover investigation by the EIA in both countries has revealed that poor management of officially sanctioned forest concessions, illegal logging and corruption among port officials is allowing the trade to expand unchecked in insurgent-controlled areas.\nThe revelation comes at the same time as a significant resurgence in fighting in the north of Mozambique. On Friday, at least 100 insurgents staged their boldest attack in three years, on the town of Macomia, which was eventually stopped by the army.\nThe location of the attack confirms that the insurgency is expanding its area of operations due to the increased presence of soldiers in the worst-affected areas. It \u201chas also gained enough funds to recruit in neighbouring Nampula province further south\u201d, according to Mozambique analyst Joe Hanlon.\nA Mozambique government report published earlier this year and seen by the BBC - the National Risk Assessment on Terrorism Finance Report - says the al-Shabab insurgents have taken advantage of the illicit timber trade to \u201cfuel and finance the reproduction of violence\u201d.\nThe report says the insurgents\u2019 involvement in the \u201csmuggling of fauna and flora products\u201d, including wood, and the \u201cexploitation of forest and wildlife resources\u201d is contributing to a \u201cvery high level of fundraising\u201d for the insurgency group. It estimated its revenue from these activities amounted to $1.9m a month.\nGiven the challenge in accessing the Cabo Delgado region it is hard to quantify the insurgents\u2019 level of day-to-day involvement in the timber trade but there have been reports of firms paying a 10% protection fee to the jihadist groups to carry out illegal logging in forest areas.\nForests with valuable trees - not just rosewood - are divided up in to chunks, or concessions. Anyone who wants to log these areas must pay a fee to the authorities. These are typically licensed to a Mozambican national - the middleman - and rented out to Chinese logging firms.\nTrading sources who did not want to be named estimate that 30% of the timber logged in Cabo Delgado is at high risk of coming from insurgency-occupied forests.\nThere are thought to be three main forested areas in Cabo Delgado where logging and timber sales take place: Nairoto; Muidumbe and Mueda, plus one more in Napai, in neighbouring Nampula province.\nWhile the Chinese authorities have made it illegal to log rosewood in their own country, huge quantities continue to be imported.\nRosewood is given a customs code for hongmu (meaning red wood in Chinese) on arrival in the country, which allows researchers to trace it.\nMozambique was China's top African supplier of hongmu last year, providing over 20,000 tonnes worth $11.7m, according to Trade Data Monitor, a commercial company that tracks global trade.\nIt has overtaken other countries like Senegal, Nigeria and Madagascar as their rosewood species have been stripped or depleted, or laws banning exports have been more strictly enforced.\nAs part of its undercover investigation, the EIA tracked a huge rosewood shipment out of Mozambique.\nBetween October 2023 and March 2024, investigators traced around 300 containers of a type of rosewood known as pau preto from the port of Beira to China.\nPau preto rosewood, which is found in the north of Mozambique and in Tanzania, is classed as a threatened species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list.\nThese 300 containers were transporting 10,000 tonnes of the rosewood. Trader estimates value each container at around $60,000, putting the value of the total shipment at around $18m.\nEIA undercover footage seen by the BBC shows some of this specific shipment was also in raw log form - rather than planks that had been processed through sawmills. This breaks Mozambique's own 2017 law on exporting any unprocessed timber.\nThe containers also held processed planks.\nIndustry sources say that typically when trees are cut down by loggers in Cabo Delgado\u2019s forests - either at concessions operated largely by Chinese firms, or illegally beyond these boundaries - the timber is taken to be processed at sawmills around Montepuez, a large town in Cabo Delgado.\nThis timber from multip",
    "A severe internet outage that has hit several African countries - the third disruption in four months - is a stark reminder of how vulnerable the service is on the continent.\nQuestions are being asked about how the reliability of what has become an essential tool in nearly every aspect of life can be improved.\nA cut to two of the undersea cables, which carry the data around the continent, early on Sunday morning, led to the recent disruption.\nIn March, damage to four cables off the West African coast caused similar problems.\nAnd in February, the vital links were damaged in the Red Sea after the anchor of a stricken ship dragged through three cables.\nInvestigations are under way into this weekend\u2019s case.\nBut it was also likely to have been caused by \u201can anchor drag\u201d from a ship, Prenesh Padayachee, chief digital and operations officer at Seacom, which owns one of the two cables affected, told the BBC.\nThe second cable, known as Eassy, was affected at the same time and at the same place.\nThe incident happened off the South African coast, just north of the port city of Durban, according to the Communications Authority of Kenya (CAK).\nThe capacity of the infrastructure connecting Africa to the rest of the world has improved in recent years and telecoms companies are switching to other cables to maintain the service.\nIn Kenya, for example, the CAK said that local internet traffic was currently using The East Africa Marine System (Teams) cable that was not affected.\nWhile Kenya has alternatives, other countries, such as Tanzania where connectivity levels hit 30% of what they were expected to be, do not.\nThe data should be able to find other routes, but when there is a limited number of pathways the service gets jammed and slows down.\nCases of cable damage are increasing but that is because the number of connections has also gone up.\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t realise that the internet is held up by these cables that are like garden hosepipes except it\u2019s one that stretches 10,000km, and that means that they are quite fragile,\u201d Dr Jess Auerbach Jahajeeah, a researcher into digital connectivity at the University of Cape Town, told the BBC\u2019s Focus on Africa programme.\nAnchor dragging from ships close to shore is one of the most common causes of damage, but underwater rockfalls, as was believed to be the case in West Africa in March, and seismic activity can also affect the cables.\nAs \u201cmany of these subsea cables are often quite close to each other, then one activity on the ocean floor or one ship can damage multiple cables at the same time\u201d, industry expert Ben Roberts said.\nRepairing the damage, which requires specialised equipment and expertise, can take days or weeks, depending on the weather, sea conditions and the extent of the problem.\nIt took more than a month, for example, for the four severed West African internet cables to be repaired and returned to service.\n\u201cWe are working on a temporary capacity solution to ensure connectivity is reinstated to the affected regions,\u201d said Mr Padayachee from Seacom.\nHe added that they were \u201cactively collaborating with various parties to expedite the repair process\u201d.\nCable repair ship the L\u00e9on Th\u00e9venin, that had been docked in Cape Town, is being sent to the site of the damage and should be there in three days, said Chris Wood, who runs a company that has invested in Eassy.\nDespite an increase in connections, Africa's reliance on a limited number of undersea cables for the internet makes the continent more susceptible to disruptions and exacerbates their impact.\nEurope and North America, on the other hand, have a dense network of high-capacity overland and undersea cables that diversify connectivity routes and improve resilience.\nWhile discussions have been ongoing to address Africa's internet infrastructure challenges, progress has been slow because of logistical and financial constraints.\nDr Jahajeeah said one problem was that the support systems to repair the growing number of cables around the continent had not kept up with the growth.\nWhile other ships can help out, the L\u00e9on Th\u00e9venin is the only repair ship dedicated to servicing Africa.\n\u201cThe [ship] used to do two or three repairs a year [but] last year it did nine\u2026 and there is a real need for African governments and global governments to get together and say we need to ensure that there is no digital divide,\u201d Dr Jahajeeah said.\nSome people have proposed alternatives such as satellite internet links to bolster digital resilience.\nElon Musk's Starlink project, for example, aims to provide high-speed internet to people who live in remote areas via a network of satellites. But is very expensive and currently not available everywhere.\nThe answer really lies in greater investment on the ground to support the vital communications infrastructure.\n\u201cIt needs more networks, more connectivity, more data centres and more internet exchanges to make sure that we have a diverse connectivity,\u201d said Mr Roberts.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for mor",
    "Canadian author Alice Munro, a 2013 Nobel Prize winner for literature, has died at the age of 92. \nMunro wrote short stories for more than 60 years, often focusing on life in rural Canada. \nShe died at her home in Port Hope, Ontario on Monday night, her family and her publisher have confirmed.\nMunro was often compared to Russian writer Anton Chekhov for the insight and compassion found in her stories. \n\"Alice Munro is a national treasure - a writer of enormous depth, empathy, and humanity whose work is read, admired, and cherished by readers throughout Canada and around the world,\" Kristin Cochrane, the CEO of Penguin Random House Canada, said in a statement. \nHer first major break-through came in 1968, when her short story collection, Dance of The Happy Shades, about life in the suburbs of western Ontario, won Canada's highest literary honour, the Governor General's Award. It was the first of three Governor General's Awards she would win in her lifetime.\nMunro has published thirteen collections of stories as well as one novel, Lives of Girls and Women, and two volumes of Selected Stories.\nIn 1977, the New Yorker magazine published one of Munro's stories, Royal Beatings, based on punishments she received from her father when she was young. She went on to have a long relationship with the publication. \nMunro, the daughter of a fox farmer and a schoolteacher, was born in 1931 in Wingham, Ontario. Many of her stories are set in the area and chronicle the region's people, culture and the way of life. \nIn her youth, she was named class valedictorian at her high school and received a scholarship to the University of Western Ontario in London. Munro had the the highest standing in English of any student who applied to the university. \nWhile pursuing higher education, Munro said she spent about half her time on academics and the other half writing.  \nShe has published more than a dozen collections of short stories. In the 1950s and 1960s, her stories were broadcast on the CBC and published in several Canadian periodicals. \nSome of her stories compared life before and after the social revolution of the 1960s. \n\"Having been born in 1931, I was a little old, but not too old, and women like me after a couple of years were wearing miniskirts and prancing around,\" she said.\nOne well-known story, The Bear Came Over the Mountain, was made into the 2006 film Away from Her, starring Julie Christie and Gordon Pinsent.\nIn 2009, Munro won the Man Booker Prize International Prize for lifetime achievement.\nThe judges said in a statement at the time: \"To read Alice Munro is to learn something every time that you never thought of before.\" \nThey added that Munro \"brings as much depth, wisdom and precision to every story as most novelists bring to a lifetime of novels\".\nShe later won the Nobel Prize in 2013. Previous winners include literary giants such as Rudyard Kipling, Toni Morrison and Ernest Hemingway. \nThe Nobel committee called Munro a \"master of contemporary short story\".\nMunro said in an interview with the Guardian in 2013 that she had been \"writing personal stories all my life\".\n\"Maybe I write stories that people get very involved in, maybe it is the complexity and the lives presented in them,\" she told the Guardian in 2013. \"I hope they are a good read. I hope they move people.\"\nHer last collection of stories, Dear Life, was published in 2012. It included a collection of partly-autobiographical stories. \nShe told the National Post newspaper that Dear Life was special because she'd likely not write anymore. \n\"Not that I didn't love writing, but I think you do get to a stage where you sort of think about your life in a different way,\" she said.

    "Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden has raised allegations with the Saudi government that its forces were \"told to kill\" for a futuristic city following a BBC investigation.\nNeom's The Line, the desert city, is one of the projects promoted at a UK-hosted event in Riyadh.\nMr Dowden is leading a 450-strong delegation on a trade mission to Saudi Arabia. \nThe UK said it has vital economic and national security interests there.\nSpeakers at the event include footballer Rio Ferdinand, former minister Jo Johnson and a British Airways executive.\nHuman rights groups have urged UK delegates to pressure Saudi leaders over the BBC's exclusive investigation.\nThe \"Great Futures\" launch event taking place this week claims to \"bring to life the sheer scale of opportunities for UK business in Saudi Arabia\" and kickstarts a year-long partnership promoting trade, tourism, and education between the two countries.\nThe UK's Cabinet Office posted photos of the deputy prime minister with Saudi leaders on X. \nHe was quoted as saying that \"Britain doesn't just endorse Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, we want to be a part of it\".\nAsked about the BBC's report, the prime minister's official spokesman confirmed that Mr Dowden had \"raised the issue of the treatment of villagers in the construction of the Neom project in his bilateral meetings while he has been out on this visit.\"\nHe added that the UK had vital economic and national security interests with Saudi Arabia, but that \"no aspect of our relationship prevents us from speaking frankly to them about these sorts of issues\".\nNeom is one major part of Saudi's Vision 2030 strategy which aims to diversify the kingdom's economy away from oil.\nImages of Neom's The Line, a mirrored city in the desert, are central to the Department for Business and Trade's website advertising the event. \nLast week, an ex-intelligence officer, Colonel Rabih Alenezi, told the BBC that he was ordered to evict villagers from a tribe in the Gulf state to make way for The Line, part of the Neom eco-project.\nOne of them was subsequently shot and killed for protesting against eviction. A statement issued by Saudi state security at the time alleged that he had opened fire on security forces and they had been forced to retaliate. Human rights organisations and the UN have said he was killed simply for resisting eviction.\nAt least 47 other villagers were detained after resisting evictions, many of whom were prosecuted on terror-related charges, according to the UN and the UK-based human rights group ALQST. Of those, 40 remain in detention, five of whom are on death row, ALQST says.\nThe Saudi government and Neom management refused to comment on the findings of the BBC investigation.\nAmnesty International, a human rights organisation, said: \"The reality behind such futuristic projects is the brutal repression of citizens and residents.\"\n\"Any business that knowingly contributes to human rights harms is in clear violation of international law,\" Dana Ahmed, Amnesty International's Middle East Researcher said.\nALQST said it appears that the UK is \"increasingly willing to turn a blind eye to the catalogue of Saudi abuses on the ground.\" \n\"Imagine if companies working on Neom made their involvement conditional on the release of local residents arrested for protesting forced eviction?\" said Josh Cooper, deputy director of the organisation.  \n\"Or if university chancellors withheld Saudi partnerships until detained University of Leeds PhD student Salma al-Shehab was freed? Such steps would have a positive bearing,\" he added.\nThe BBC contacted several high-profile speakers participating in the event, but many did not respond.\nOf those that did, many described the event as an important opportunity to showcase and promote British business, culture and society.",
    "For years, Western spy agencies have talked of a need to pivot to focus on China. This week, the head of the UK's GCHQ intelligence agency described it as an \"epoch-defining challenge\".\nIt follows a series of arrests across the West of people accused of spying and hacking for China. And on Monday, China's ambassador was summoned by the UK Foreign Office, after three people were accused of assisting Hong Kong's intelligence services.\nThese are a sign of a normally hidden contest for power and influence between the West and China bursting out into the open.\nThe West - the US and its allies - are determined to push back. But senior officials worry the West has not taken the challenge from China seriously enough and has fallen behind in intelligence terms, leaving the West more vulnerable to Beijing's spying, and both sides at risk of a potentially catastrophic miscalculation.\nWhat concerns Western officials is Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s determination that Beijing will shape a new international order. \"Ultimately it aspires to displace the United States as the foremost power,\" the chief of MI6, Sir Richard Moore, told me in a rare interview in his office for a new BBC series on China and the West.\nBut despite years of issuing warnings, Western intelligence services have struggled until recently to concentrate their focus on Chinese activity.\nNigel Inkster, who was number two at MI6 when he retired in 2006, says China's emergence as a major global power \"took place at a time when there were a lot of other pre-occupations\".\nAs Beijing rose on the world stage during the 2000s, the thinking of Western policymakers and security officials - and the focus of the intelligence services - was dominated by the so-called war on terror and military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nShadow war: China and the West\nThe rise of China is the defining challenge of our times - how far to co-operate, compete or confront. Gordon Corera asks if the West has been slow to wake up.\nListen now on BBC Sounds\nMore recently, a resurgent Russia and now the Israel-Gaza war have appeared more urgent challenges, officials in the US and Europe concede.\nAt the same time, there has been pressure from government and businesses alike to focus on securing access to China's huge market, rather than confronting the security risk it poses.\nPolitical leaders frequently preferred their intelligence chiefs not to call China out by name. And businesses too preferred not to admit their secrets were being targeted.\n\"The pendulum did swing very far in the direction of the economic and commercial interests,\" says Nigel Inkster.\nChinese intelligence was already engaging in industrial espionage back in the 2000s, he says, but Western companies typically stayed quiet. \"They didn't want to report it for fear that doing so would jeopardise their position in China's markets,\" he says.\nAnother major challenge has been that China spies differently from the West. That has made its activity harder both to recognise and confront.\nA former Western spy says he once improbably told a Chinese counterpart that China did the \"wrong type\" of spying. What he meant was that Western states prefer to focus on gathering the kind of intelligence that helps them understand their adversaries. But Chinese spies have different priorities.\nProtecting the position of the Communist Party is central. \"Regime stability is their number one goal,\" Roman Rozhavsky, an FBI counterintelligence official, explains.\nThat requires delivering economic growth. And so China\u2019s spies see acquiring Western technology as a top national security requirement. Western spies say their Beijing counterparts share information they have gathered with Chinese state-run companies, in a way that the West\u2019s intelligence agencies do not with their own domestic firms.\n\"My agency is busier than we've ever been in our 74 years of history,\" Mike Burgess, the plain-speaking head of the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation (Asio) explained to me.\n\"I rarely call out countries because when it comes to straight espionage, we do it to them,\" Burgess told me. \"Commercial espionage is a completely different matter, and that's why China is getting special treatment on this one.\"\nHe acknowledged that the Western allies had been slow to understand this threat. \"I think it's been going on for a long time and collectively we've missed it,\" he admits.\nWe were sitting down last October in California, where he was taking part in the first ever public appearance by the security chiefs of the so-called Five Eyes \u2013 the intelligence-sharing alliance made up of the US, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.\nThe unprecedented gathering was a very deliberate attempt to turn up the volume of warnings about China because of the fear that many companies and organisations were still not listening. The location in Silicon Valley was also carefully chosen - a spotlight on China\u2019s attempts to steal technology, sometimes through cyber",
    "OpenAI has unveiled the latest version of the tech which underpins its AI chatbot ChatGPT.\nIt\u2019s called GPT-4o, and it will be rolled out to all users of ChatGPT, including non-subscribers.\nIt is faster than earlier models and has been programmed to sound chatty and sometimes even flirtatious in its responses to prompts.\nThe new version can read and discuss images, translate languages, and identify emotions from visual expressions. There is also memory so it can recall previous prompts.\nIt can be interrupted and it has an easier conversational rhythm - there was no delay between asking it a question and receiving an answer.\nDuring a live demo using the voice version of GPT-4o, it provided helpful suggestions for how to go about solving a simple equation written on a piece of paper - rather than simply solving it.  It analysed some computer code, translating between Italian and English and interpreted the emotions in a selfie of a smiling man.\nUsing a warm American female voice, it greeted its prompters by asking them how they were doing. When paid a compliment, it responded: \u201cStop it, you\u2019re making me blush!\u201d.\nIt wasn\u2019t perfect \u2013 at one point it mistook the smiling man for a wooden surface, and it started to solve an equation that it hadn\u2019t yet been shown. This unintentionally demonstrated that there\u2019s still some way to go before the glitches and hallucinations which make chatbots unreliable and potentially unsafe, can be ironed out.\nBut what it does show us is the direction of travel for OpenAI, which I think intends  GPT-4o to become the next generation of AI digital assistant, a kind of turbo-charged Siri or Hey, Google which remembers what it\u2019s been told in the past and can interact beyond voice or text.\nIf there was an elephant in the room, alongside the enthusiastic off-camera audience whooping and applauding, it was the environmental price tag of this technology.\nWe know that AI is more power-hungry than traditional computing tasks, and that the more sophisticated it becomes, the more computing power it requires. There was no mention of sustainability during the evening.\nWe have seen chatbots like Elon Musk\u2019s Grok and Pi, from DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, prioritise the \u201cpersonality\u201d of their products, but the way in which GPT-4o seamlessly handled the combination of text, audio and images with an instant response appears to put OpenAI ahead of the competition.\nOf course, at the moment we only have the firm\u2019s word for it \u2013 it was their demo, carefully curated and managed by them. It will be interesting to see how GPT-4o copes at scale with the millions of people who already use ChatGPT as it rolls out.\nOpenAI's chief technology officer Mira Murati described GPT-4o as \u201cmagical\u201d but added that the firm would \u201cremove that mysticism\u201d with the product\u2019s roll-out.\nAn interesting and emotive choice of words: while this tech is rapidly becoming more sophisticated and increasingly convincing as a companion \u2013 it is not sentient or magic, it is complex programming and machine learning.\nThere have been rumours about a partnership between OpenAI and Apple and while this has not yet been confirmed, it was telling during the presentation that Apple products were used throughout. \nAnother shot across the bows was the timing of this event, 24 hours before its rival Google is due to show off its latest AI developments at its annual conference, Google IO.",
    "Dating app Bumble has apologised for adverts that critics said shamed women who were not sexually active.\nThe marketing campaign included messages such as \"A vow of celibacy is not the answer\" and \"Thou shalt not give up on dating and become a nun\".\nBumble said the ads were supposed to bring humour to \"a community frustrated by modern dating\".\nBut critics said the adverts were tasteless and ran counter to the company's stated aim of empowering women.\n\"In a world fighting for respect and autonomy over our bodies, it's appalling to see a dating platform undermine women's choices,\" wrote Jordan Emanuel, a model and actress who has talked publicly about her decision to refrain from sex for a year.\nThe company, which made its name in the world of dating apps by putting women in charge of starting conversations, said it understood the complaints and would remove the adverts, which started appearing on billboards in the US last month.\n\"We made a mistake,\" the company said in a statement posted on social media. \n\"For years Bumble has passionately stood up for women and marginalised communities, and their right to fully exercise personal choice. We didn't live up to these values with this campaign and we apologize for the harm it caused.\"\nIt said it would offer the advertising space to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, among other organisations and donate money.\nBumble was founded in 2014 and became a public company in 2021, but it has struggled amid concerns about its ability to reach younger users.\nThe company, which also owns Badoo, has seen its shares slide sharply since its debut.\nIn February, it announced plans to lay off 30% of its workforce - about 350 people.\nThe company recently relaunched its Bumble app, an overhaul that includes a new setting allowing users to remove the requirement that women initiate contact.\nA 2022 Pew survey estimated that a third of US adults and just over half of those under 30 had used a dating app or site at some point.\nOf those who had tried out online dating, only half reported they found it a positive experience. \nBumble has about four million paying customers, including 2.7 million on Badoo.",
    "Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden has raised allegations with the Saudi government that its forces were \"told to kill\" for a futuristic city following a BBC investigation.\nNeom's The Line, the desert city, is one of the projects promoted at a UK-hosted event in Riyadh.\nMr Dowden is leading a 450-strong delegation on a trade mission to Saudi Arabia. \nThe UK said it has vital economic and national security interests there.\nSpeakers at the event include footballer Rio Ferdinand, former minister Jo Johnson and a British Airways executive.\nHuman rights groups have urged UK delegates to pressure Saudi leaders over the BBC's exclusive investigation.\nThe \"Great Futures\" launch event taking place this week claims to \"bring to life the sheer scale of opportunities for UK business in Saudi Arabia\" and kickstarts a year-long partnership promoting trade, tourism, and education between the two countries.\nThe UK's Cabinet Office posted photos of the deputy prime minister with Saudi leaders on X. \nHe was quoted as saying that \"Britain doesn't just endorse Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, we want to be a part of it\".\nAsked about the BBC's report, the prime minister's official spokesman confirmed that Mr Dowden had \"raised the issue of the treatment of villagers in the construction of the Neom project in his bilateral meetings while he has been out on this visit.\"\nHe added that the UK had vital economic and national security interests with Saudi Arabia, but that \"no aspect of our relationship prevents us from speaking frankly to them about these sorts of issues\".\nNeom is one major part of Saudi's Vision 2030 strategy which aims to diversify the kingdom's economy away from oil.\nImages of Neom's The Line, a mirrored city in the desert, are central to the Department for Business and Trade's website advertising the event. \nLast week, an ex-intelligence officer, Colonel Rabih Alenezi, told the BBC that he was ordered to evict villagers from a tribe in the Gulf state to make way for The Line, part of the Neom eco-project.\nOne of them was subsequently shot and killed for protesting against eviction. A statement issued by Saudi state security at the time alleged that he had opened fire on security forces and they had been forced to retaliate. Human rights organisations and the UN have said he was killed simply for resisting eviction.\nAt least 47 other villagers were detained after resisting evictions, many of whom were prosecuted on terror-related charges, according to the UN and the UK-based human rights group ALQST. Of those, 40 remain in detention, five of whom are on death row, ALQST says.\nThe Saudi government and Neom management refused to comment on the findings of the BBC investigation.\nAmnesty International, a human rights organisation, said: \"The reality behind such futuristic projects is the brutal repression of citizens and residents.\"\n\"Any business that knowingly contributes to human rights harms is in clear violation of international law,\" Dana Ahmed, Amnesty International's Middle East Researcher said.\nALQST said it appears that the UK is \"increasingly willing to turn a blind eye to the catalogue of Saudi abuses on the ground.\" \n\"Imagine if companies working on Neom made their involvement conditional on the release of local residents arrested for protesting forced eviction?\" said Josh Cooper, deputy director of the organisation.  \n\"Or if university chancellors withheld Saudi partnerships until detained University of Leeds PhD student Salma al-Shehab was freed? Such steps would have a positive bearing,\" he added.\nThe BBC contacted several high-profile speakers participating in the event, but many did not respond.\nOf those that did, many described the event as an important opportunity to showcase and promote British business, culture and society.",
    "Almost 450,000 Palestinians have fled from Rafah over the past week, the UN says, as Israeli tanks reportedly push deeper into the southern Gaza city.\n\"People face constant exhaustion, hunger and fear,\" warned the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa.\nIsrael's military says it is continuing \"operations against terror targets\" in the east of the city, where more than a million people had been sheltering.\nNew Israeli operations in northern Gaza have displaced another 100,000 people. \nIsraeli troops have gone back into the areas of Zeitoun and Jabalia, where the military says Hamas has regrouped only five months after it claimed to have dismantled the group's local battalions.\nThe military ordered civilians to evacuate eastern Rafah and Jabalia for their own safety before starting the assaults, but the total of those displaced in recent days is equivalent to almost a quarter of Gaza's 2.3 million population.\nIsrael launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 35,170 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 82 in the past 24 hours, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nOn Tuesday morning, Unrwa posted several photos showing empty streets in Rafah which were packed with tents and makeshift shelters before the start of the Israeli operation on 6 May.\nFamilies had fled in search of safety, it said, but added: \"Nowhere is safe. An immediate ceasefire is the only hope.\"\nUnrwa spokeswoman Louise Wateridge, who is in Rafah, wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that families still in the city had \"moved as far west as possible\" and had set up tents on beaches along the Mediterranean coast. Further inland was \"now a ghost town\", she added.\nHadeel Radwan, a displaced mother of a newborn baby who is sheltering in the western Tal al-Sultan area, said she was terrified by the constant shelling and was enduring shortages of drinking water and other supplies.\nShe told AFP news agency that fellow residents had been fleeing, but \"I had a C-section and moving quickly, under threat, would be difficult for me.\"\nOther Palestinians told Reuters news agency that Israeli tanks were advancing deeper into residential areas in south-eastern Rafah and had crossed the main north-south road to the nearby Rafah crossing with Egypt, which Israeli troops took control of on Tuesday.\n\"The tanks advanced this morning west of Salah al-Din road, into the Brazil and al-Jneineh neighbourhoods,\" one resident said. \"They are in the streets inside the built-up area and there are clashes,\" they added.\nAl-Jneineh was one of the eastern neighbourhoods covered by the initial Israeli evacuation order, while Brazil was included in the expanded evacuation zone declared on Saturday. \nResidents have been told to head towards an \"expanded humanitarian area\", which stretches north from the coastal strip of al-Mawasi to the central town of Deir al-Balah. But the UN has said the area lacks basic infrastructure.\nIn a statement issued on Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces said troops had \"eliminated several armed terrorist cells in close-quarters encounters on the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing\" and also \"eliminated a number of terrorists and located weapons\" in eastern areas of Rafah.\nHamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other countries - said its fighters had killed and wounded several Israeli troops after it targeted an Israeli troop carrier with an anti-tank missile in the al-Salam neighbourhood, south of Brazil, and blew up a booby-trapped building on George Street, which runs through al-Jneineh.\nThe IDF said a soldier was seriously wounded in combat in southern Gaza.\nAfter seven months of war in Gaza, Israel has insisted victory is impossible without taking Rafah and eliminating the last remaining Hamas battalions.\nBut the UN and Western powers have warned that an all-out assault could lead to mass civilian casualties and a humanitarian catastrophe.\nAs well as the mass displacement of Palestinians in the city, the UN has warned that it is running out of supplies of fuel, food and other essential goods because the Rafah crossing is closed and the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing with Israel is inaccessible due to the hostilities in the area.\nThe UN said an Indian staff member was killed on Monday in a strike as he travelled in a marked vehicle to the European Gaza hospital in Khan Younis, just to the north-east of Rafah, without blaming any party.\nThe IDF said an initial inquiry indicated the vehicle was struck in an active combat zone and that it had not been made aware of its route. But the UN said Israeli authorities had been informed of its planned movements.\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Monday that the US still believed \"it would be a mistake to launch a major military operation into the heart ",
    "The whereabouts of a Chinese citizen journalist jailed for covering the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic is still unknown a day after she was expected to have been released, having served her four year sentence.\nSupporters say they are unclear if Zhang Zhan had actually been freed - although rights groups had said authorities were likely to keep tight-lipped on her status.\nThe 40-year-old former lawyer is one of several activists who had run into trouble with Chinese authorities for their Covid-19 reporting. Some have been detained while others have gone missing.\nShe was found guilty of \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble\", a frequent charge against activists in China.\nMedia watchdogs and human rights groups had said that Ms Zhang was wrongfully prosecuted. They had called for her release because of her deteriorating health.\nThere is \"huge concern\" about the safety of Ms Zhang after she is released, Reporters Without Borders advocacy officer Aleksandra Bielakowska said.\n\"In China, journalists detained for their work often remain under detention or surveillance even upon completion of their prison terms,\" she said.\n\"I honestly think we will have no updates soon. They will probably try to detain her in secret location, or keep her out of the eye sight for some time.\"\nOne of Ms Zhang's lawyers told BBC Chinese that her \"personal freedom will still be restricted\", adding that she will now live with her parents in Shanghai.\nFrom her base in Shanghai, Ms Zhang travelled to Wuhan in February 2020 to document what she saw on the streets and in hospitals. \nHer livestreams and essays were widely viewed on social media, and she continued to produce them despite threats from authorities. \nOne of her livestreamed clips showed how she kept her camera rolling while an official warned her to \"stop filming or [he would] get mad\".\n\"Maybe I have a rebellious soul... I'm just documenting the truth. Why can't I show the truth?\" she said in an interview with an independent filmmaker, a clip of which was obtained by the BBC. \n\"I won't stop what I'm doing, because this country can't go backwards.\"\nThis was thought to be her last interview before she was detained.\nMs Zhang had posted more than 100 videos on her YouTube Channel, WeChat and Twitter, before being reported missing on 14 May 2020. \nThe next day, authorities announced that she was detained by police in Shanghai. She was charged in November that year and was sentenced the following month.\nMs Zhang went on a hunger strike in the first few months of detention, and her lawyer had said then that she was being force-fed through a tube.\nShe remained on partial strike until July 2023, when her weight had reportedly plummeted to just 37kg - half of what it was before her detention.\nShe was also suffering from severe malnutrition, gastrointestinal disease, and low white blood cell count, RSF said.\n\"Journalist Zhang Zhan, who courageously risked her life by informing the public on the outbreak of Covid-19 in Wuhan, is at risk of dying if she does not receive extensive medical treatment,\" the organisation said in a statement in September last year.\nThe significance of Ms Zhang's case will rest on what happens after she is released, said Jerome Cohen, an expert in Chinese law.\n\"Most released human rights advocates are kept quiet through informal means of suppression. Some try to leave the country and are successful in continuing to report on human rights violations in China but they are exceptions,\" said Prof Cohen.\nA lawyer for Ms Zhang said her family had been \"frequently approached\" by the police during her detention, and they were instructed not to discuss the case with others.\n\"Citizen journalists were the only source of uncensored, first-hand information about the Covid-19 outbreak in China. \n\"Because they work independently of state-controlled media, citizen journalists face constant harassment for exposing information the government would rather keep quiet,\" Amnesty International said in a statement.\nWhen the pandemic first struck in early 2020, the Chinese internet - despite being heavily censored - was inundated with messages describing government cover-ups and failures in the healthcare system. \nBut the state's censorship machine doubled down to suppress the unprecedented online anger. \nSeveral channels went quiet, posts were swiftly erased and some activists like Ms Zhang received explicit warnings from the authorities.\nAmong the most well-known internationally was the case of whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang, who had tried to warn his colleagues about a \"Sars-like virus\". \nDr Li died in February 2020 after contracting Covid-19. It was later revealed that he had been under investigation for \"disturbing social order\" by \"making false comments\". His death sparked an outpouring of support on social media, but the posts were periodically scrubbed.\nThe Communist Party filled state media with positive stories about its Covid-19 response.

    "Documentary makers are trying to track down the man who played a post-apocalyptic traffic warden in 1980s TV drama Threads.\nThe warden appeared as an extra in the 1984 TV film for less than 30 seconds - but his striking image was used to publicise its release. \nThe dystopian film explored the impact of a thermonuclear blast on Sheffield.\nCraig Ian Mann, who is working on the documentary, said he wanted to know how the man felt about the role. \n\"He has become the iconic image of that film,\" he said. \n\"He was on the front cover of the Radio Times, he was on the cover of every video, DVD or Blu-ray of Threads which has been made. \n\"People even dress up as him for Halloween,\" he said. \n\"We went to Sheffield Horror Con at the weekend, and there was somebody dressed up as him. \n\"He has become an iconic character and if he is still around, I would like to ask him if he is aware of it, and how he feels about it.\"\nThe film, written by Kes author Barry Hines, was shown at a time when nuclear war seemed a very real possibility, and shocked and horrified many who saw it. \nThe story focused around a young couple living in South Yorkshire when a bomb went off, and shows a society breaking down as nuclear winter sets in.\nIn the aftermath of the blast, a scene depicts increasingly desperate people trying to seek medical help or food, many of whom are herded into some tennis courts. \nMr Mann said: \"Patrolling these courts is a traffic warden with a gun in his hand, and we would love to be able to track him down.\n\"We have interviewed about 30 people so far, and none of them know who played the traffic warden in the film. \n\"He is almost definitely a local person who volunteered to be an extra in the film,\" he said. \n\"He may even have been a traffic warden, as his shirt and tie were far too clean for someone who just dressed for an extra that day.\"\nAt 34, Mr Mann was too young to have seen the film when it first aired but watched it a few months after moving to Sheffield as a student in 2007. \n\"Many people say it has shaped their lives in various ways, it was quite deeply affecting and it has stayed with them for a long time,\" he said. \n\"I have seen it four or five times since. I think if you didn't see it in the mid 80s, seeing it now is going to have the same effect on you I would say.\"\nHe is co-writing the documentary with Robert Nevitt, 44, who is the director of Sheffield horror film festival Celluloid Screams.\nMr Mann said they were asked to make a feature about the locations of the film to accompany its release on Blu-ray.\n\"I said we can do better than that, we are here, we have access to the people who were extras, actors, or in it in some way or another,\" he said. \n\"We got the green light to put together a documentary and have been talking to as many people as we can find who were involved.\"\nSome of those the pair have tracked down so far include a volunteer fire crew, who made sure none of the fires on set got out of control, and a woman and her son, who was just two years old at the time, who was shown being snatched from his pram as the bomb detonated.  \nMr Mann said: \"The boy's mother can be seen picking him up out of his pram and running, then you can see his pram overturning in the middle of The Moor. \n\"They answered an ad in the Sheffield Star, they went for auditions and then they were given call sheets and told when and where to turn up. \n\"However some people turned up at two, three or four of the film's scenes so feature more than once in the film.\" \nLord David Blunkett has also been interviewed, as he was the leader of Sheffield City Council when the film was first shown. \n\"Normally when we are trying to find somebody, there is someone who can say 'that was my father, brother, grandad' - but this time, we're not getting anything,\" he said.  \nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

    "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that Russian President Vladimir Putin must pay to rebuild what he has destroyed in Ukraine.\nSpeaking in Kyiv, Mr Blinken said Washington has the power to seize Russian assets in the US and will use them to help rebuild Ukraine. \nHe also said that Ukraine is getting \"closer to Nato\".\nEarlier, the top US diplomat told Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that military aid is \"now on its way\".\n\"What Putin destroyed, Russia should - must - pay to rebuild. It's what international law demands. And it's what the Ukrainian people deserve,\" Mr Blinken said during his speech at Kyiv Polytechnic University.\n\"Our Congress has given us the power to seize Russian assets in the US, and we intend to use it,\" he said.\nHe added that the G7 group - the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and the US - can unlock billions of dollars, \"and send a powerful message to Putin that time is not on his side\".\nSince the full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago, Russian state assets in the EU estimated to be worth almost \u20ac211bn (\u00a3181bn) have been frozen.\nMr Blinken landed in the Ukrainian capital on Tuesday after a nine-hour journey via sleeper train from the Polish border.\nHis visit comes as the country struggles to hold back a major Russian incursion near its second biggest city of Kharkiv.\nMr Blinken's arrival also marks three weeks since the US Congress finally agreed a new $61bn (\u00a349bn) aid package for Ukraine.\n\"We are bringing Ukraine closer to and then into Nato,\" Mr Blinken said in his speech.\n\"We will make sure Ukraine's bridge to Nato is strong.\"\nMr Blinken sought to reassure Ukrainians with a direct-to-camera message: \"You are not alone. We are with you today and we will stay by your side\".\nHe noted that his visit came at a \"critical moment\" - amid a fresh Russian offensive which he said had been aided by North Korea, Iran and China.\nHe also touched upon new legislation to help mobilise troops to fight invading Russian forces. The measure is aimed at boosting numbers in the military, which is under severe pressure as Russia continues its advances in the east.\nMr Blinken described Ukraine's recent mobilisation reforms as \"a difficult decision but a necessary one\", lauding all those who have stepped up to serve their country.\nDuring Mr Blinken's meeting with President Zelensky, he paid tribute to Ukraine's \"extraordinary resilience\" and to the Ukrainian president's \"strength and leadership\". \nHe acknowledged that it was a \"challenging time\" but that the US assistance was \"on the way\", which he said would make a crucial difference on the battlefield.",
    "\"Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A-minor.\"\nWith every second Kendrick Lamar holds on to the last letter of \"minor\" in Not Like Us, the inflammatory song about his fellow rapper Drake, his raspy vocals reverberate through hip-hop and popular culture.\nIt's an explosive allegation, made without evidence, that calls into question Drake's conduct with young women - an allegation now heard around the world. Drake, one of the world's biggest artists, vehemently denies it.\n\u202fSince its release on 4 May, Not Like Us has been dissected on social media,\u202fplayed at NBA basketball games and boomed from DJ booths\u202fat parties from London to Los Angeles; New York to Atlanta, piercing the public consciousness.\u202f\nAnd it is only one of nine songs that make up a mind-boggling, escalating conflict between two modern rap titans, involving unevidenced accusations of domestic violence, secret children and paedophilia - all denied.\nThis is a cold war that has simmered over the last decade finally boiling to the surface.\u202f\n\"I think we've all expected this to happen at some point,\" says Minou Itseli, also known as Mimi The Music Blogger, a journalist and content creator. \"They've been sending indirect shots to each other in their music a lot more than we first thought. But no one could have seen the beef go this far.\"\nBoth men have been praised and criticised during the feud, and fans of both have proclaimed their favourite the winner.\nBut who - if either - has come out of this looking good? \nYou'd be forgiven for blinking and missing some of the detail, given how fast this confrontation has moved.  \nIt began with Lamar's verse on Like That, by rappers Future and Metro Boomin. Drake responded with Push Ups, belittling Lamar's achievements and status as a rap legend.\u202fThat track currently sits on more than 70 million streams on Spotify. \nDoubling down, Drake's controversial Taylor Made Freestyle utilised AI-generated voices of two of Lamar's heroes - Snoop Dogg and the late, great, Tupac Shakur - to goad him into a reply.\nDrake also claimed Lamar wasn't replying to his taunts for fear of interrupting the release of Taylor Swift's new album. Drake raps: \"Taylor Swift is your new top\" - meaning Lamar's boss - \"and if you boutta drop, she gotta approve.\" \nThe message was clear. Drake doesn't respect Lamar, who is considered one of the greatest rappers of his generation, and was ready to take him down a peg.\nJoseph \"JP\" Patterson, editor-in-chief of Complex UK and founder of TRENCH magazine tells the BBC: \"I might be the only person on this planet with this viewpoint, but Taylor Made Freestyle was pretty dope. I get the rap purist's dismay around him using AI verses but even down to the beat, I was feeling it.\"\nAnd then, fans waited with bated breath anticipating the next move.\u202fThose on social media felt Lamar wasn't up for the fight, given he had yet to respond.\nHis rebuttal was Euphoria, a track questioning Drake's parenting skills, rumours that he'd had plastic surgery and his use of AI.\nLines as straightforward as: \"I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress\" resonated with fans because of Lamar's heated delivery, highlighting everything - and he means everything - he dislikes about Drake.\nIt was so impactful that Euphoria was used in an official TikTok video for US President Joe Biden's election campaign against Donald Trump.  \nItseli believes this track perfectly sums up Lamar's stance: \"It's a summary of everything he wanted to say to Drake,\" she shares. \"If anyone wants a short recap of Kendrick's side, you'll find everything in Euphoria.\"\nLamar's 6:16 In LA followed, where he muses: \"Have you ever thought that OVO [Drake's record label] was working for me? / Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it.\" He threatens to shine a forensic light on Drake's character to bring his reputation into disrepute, with help from inside Drake's own label.\nItseli says that Lamar was playing perfectly to his audience throughout the back-and-forth. \"Kendrick knew what to bring to the table and went for the kill. He studied Drake's behaviour and catered his songs to every audience. He gave us wordplay, a club hit, conceptual songs. Drake couldn't really compete.\" \nAnd with this one-two punch from Lamar, fans feared the walls were closing in on Drake. But the Canadian rapper went nuclear in response.  \nFamily Matters attacks Lamar's family unit, claiming his son is the biological child of Lamar's creative partner, Dave Free, and that he has been physically abusive to his wife, Whitney Alford.\nDrake sings: \"When you put your hands on your girl, Is it self-defence 'cause she's bigger than you?\" referencing the height difference between Lamar and his wife.\nLamar has denied these claims,\u202fbut the beef had now entered a new realm - one uncomfortable for many observers.\nIn a culture that prides itself on the boundless nature of lyrical battle, where anything can be said about your opponent, some of t",
    "Beach Boys star Mike Love has said he hopes his cousin Brian Wilson will still be able to make music with the band after he was placed under a conservatorship.\nA judge last week granted the conservatorship \u2013 to oversee Wilson\u2019s personal and medical affairs \u2013 due to ill health.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Love said Wilson, 81, had good long-term memory and still had his \u201cmusical abilities\u201d but needed help with \u201cmedical supervision and care\u201d.\nLove was speaking ahead of a new Disney documentary about the band which begins on 24 May.\nCourt documents obtained by several US media outlets earlier this year said Wilson was suffering from a \"neurocognitive disorder\" similar to dementia. \nLove told Today's Nicola Stanbridge: \u201cWe got together at Paradise Cove (in Los Angeles) at the end of the documentary.\n\"He was remembering things I\u2019d forgotten about our high school days. His long-term memory is right there. \n\"His musical abilities, as long as he\u2019s alive he\u2019ll have those, but he does need medical supervision and care. His wife did take care of that.\u201d \nThe move to apply for a conservatorship came after Wilson's wife of 28 years, Melinda, died in January.\nThe family said their decision had been taken after \"careful consideration and consultation\" with Wilson, his doctors, his seven children and his housekeeper. \nOn Thursday, a judge appointed two long-time Wilson representatives, publicist Jean Sievers and manager LeeAnn Hard, as his conservators.\nLove told Radio 4: \u201cHe (Wilson) knows that he needs the help but we\u2019re still able to get together and we\u2018re going to see each other soon.\n\"It\u2019s not so negative as it sounds. As long as he\u2019s cared for properly. He\u2019s seeing his children\u2026 he\u2019s being well taken care of.\u201d\nBruce Johnston, another Beach Boys member, said he felt the documentary was like \"a new beginning\".\nHe added: \"I think once Brian and Mike sit round the piano and just the magic, you can\u2019t stop it\u201d.\nLove said they hadn\u2019t had a chance to collaborate yet but \u201cit\u2019s a brand new day now and I\u2019m hoping we can do something together - all of us - and it\u2019ll be great\u201d.\nWilson is the co-founder and chief songwriter for the Beach Boys who emerged as part of the surf-rock boom in 1961 and built their reputation on sophisticated melodies and complex vocal harmonies.\nAfter hits like Surfin' USA, I Get Around and California Girls, the emergence of The Beatles prompted Wilson to steer the band in a more experimental, psychedelic direction.\nHis magnum opus was 1966's Pet Sounds - widely considered one of the all-time greatest rock albums.\nBut his escalating drug use, combined with the pressure to keep creating ever more elaborate songs, led to a nervous breakdown and he began to withdraw from touring and public life.\nWilson was placed under a conservatorship once before, in the early 1990s, because his family fought to separate him from controversial psychologist Eugene Landy who they said exerted \"undue influence\" over his life, music and finances.\nThe case was triggered by the re-drafting of Wilson's will in 1989 in which Landy was named as chief beneficiary, standing to inherit up to 70% of his estate.\nBy 1992, the Superior Court of Santa Monica had ruled that Landy must remove himself from Wilson's life.\nThe court also appointed an independent conservator with \"specific and limited powers over the artist's affairs\".\nMelinda was supposedly one of the chief instigators of that court case.\nAfter her death last month Wilson said on his website: \"We are lost. Melinda was more than my wife - she was my saviour.\"\nThe couple married in 1995 and adopted their children Dakota Rose, Daria Rose, Delanie Rose, Dylan and Dash together.\nWilson also has two daughters, Carnie and Wendy, from his first marriage.",
    "A Thai activist accused of insulting the country's monarchy has died in detention following a months-long hunger strike.\nNetiporn \"Bung\" Sanesangkhom died after her heart \"stopped suddenly\" on Tuesday morning, officials said.\nThe 28-year-old, part of a youth movement calling for royal reforms, had been detained since 26 January, facing seven separate charges - including two of insulting the monarchy.\nShe began her hunger strike the next day, only accepting water once again in late February, and food from April.\nMs Sanesangkhom was demanding reform of Thailand's justice system, including changes to the notorious lese majeste law, which criminalises critical comment about the royal family.\nShe had initially been held on a contempt of court charge, with her detention extended after bail in a separate lese-majeste case was revoked.\nMs Sanesangkhom was accused in two cases of lese-majeste case, one relating asking the public\u2019s views on the disruption caused by royal motorcades. \nIf found guilty, Ms Sanesangkhom - a judge's daughter who previously worked as a tutor - was facing up to 15 years in prison for each charge.\nThailand has some of the strictest lese-majeste laws in the world. According to legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, around 260 charges have been filed under the lese-majeste law since 2020. \nEarlier this year, a man was jailed for 50 years under the law - the longest ever sentence handed down.\nThis was not the first time Ms Sanesangkhom had gone on hunger strike. Back in 2022 she and a fellow activist from Thaluwang - which translates as \"shattering the palace\" - were released from prison after refusing to eat for 64 days.\nIt is not clear exactly how long she refused food on this occasion. Thai Lawyers for Human Rights said she started accepting food again in April.\nShe had been sent to a prison hospital due to declining health.\nAccording to prison officials, the hunger strike had left her weak and suffering from anaemia, but a statement from the Department of Corrections said she refused vitamins and electrolytes offered. \nHer heart stopped early on Tuesday morning, the statement said, with doctors attempting to revive her for several hours before she was sent to a nearby hospital where she was declared dead.\nThai MP Rukchanok Srinork from the reformist Move Forward Party - who is on bail while appealing against a six year sentence for convictions including lese-majeste - pointed out several other detained activists were also on hunger strike \"demanding their rights\".\n\"How many times will the courts allow deaths like these to happen until they're satisfied?\" she asked on X (formerly Twitter), after paying tribute to Ms Sanesangkhom.",
    "India has urged the US not to take a \"narrow view\" of its port agreement with Iran, a day after Washington warned that countries doing business deals with Tehran risked sanctions.\nOn Monday, India signed a 10-year deal with Iran to develop the strategically important Chabahar port.\nThe US said any country considering business deals with Iran \"needs to be aware of the potential risks\".\nBut Delhi has backed the move and said the agreement would benefit the region.\n\"I think it's a question of communicating, convincing and getting people to understand that this is actually for everyone's benefit. I don't think people should take a narrow view of it,\" Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told reporters on Tuesday. He was responding to a question about Washington's remarks on the deal.\nMr Jaishankar added that in the past, the US too had been \"appreciative of the fact that Chabahar has a larger relevance\" and that a long-term agreement with Iran was necessary to improve the port's operations. \n\"And the port operation, we believe, will benefit the entire region,\" he said.\nIndia first entered an agreement to develop the Chabahar port, which is close to Iran's border with Pakistan, in 2016. It took over operations at the end of 2018. \nThe port opened a transit route for Indian goods and products to Afghanistan and Central Asia, avoiding the land route through Pakistan - neighbours India and Pakistan share a tense relationship.\nSo far, 2.5m tonnes of wheat and 2,000 tonnes of pulses have been shipped from India to Afghanistan through Chabahar port, officials say.\nUnder the new deal, India is set to develop the port further by investing about $370 million in the project.\nThe country's shipping minister called it a \"historic moment in India-Iran ties\".\nBut US State Department Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel said on Tuesday in response to a question that Washington would continue to impose sanctions on Iran.\n\"Any entity, anyone considering business deals with Iran - they need to be aware of the potential risks that they are opening themselves up to and the potential risk of sanctions,\" Mr Patel added.\nA crucial ally of India, Washington has strained ties with Tehran. The country has imposed more than 600 sanctions against Iran-related entities over the past three years. ",
    "A prominent far-right German politician has been found guilty of knowingly using a Nazi slogan in a speech.\nBj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, who leads the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in the state of Thuringia, was on trial for saying the words \"Everything for Germany!\" at a May 2021 rally. \nThe slogan is associated with the SA stormtroopers, who played a key role in the Nazis' rise to power.\nH\u00f6cke - a former history teacher - had denied knowing the phrase's roots.\nThe court in the eastern city of Halle convicted the 52-year-old of using symbols of a Nazi organisation and fined him \u20ac13,000 ($14,000; \u00a311,200). DW News reports that the money will go to a grassroots anti-extremism programme. \nHowever, H\u00f6cke escaped the maximum sentence of three years in prison and being barred from public office. He can appeal the verdict.\nDuring the trial, which started last month, H\u00f6cke had argued that he was \"completely innocent\". \nBut court spokesperson Adina Kessler-Jensch said judges were convinced that H\u00f6cke was aware of the ban. \nPresiding judge Jan Stengel told H\u00f6cke he was \"an articulate, intelligent man who knows what he is saying\", according to the German news agency DPA.\nAt the campaign event in the state of Saxony-Anhalt in May 2021, Mr H\u00f6cke ended a speech by saying: \"Everything for our homeland, everything for Saxony-Anhalt, everything for Germany!\"\nProsecutors say he knew the phrase was banned for being associated with the Nazi Sturmabteilung (SA). But he said it was a \"common saying\" which should not be criminalised.\nAt another rally in December 2023, he said: \"Everything for\u2026\", to which the audience responded: \"Germany!\"\nProsecutors had initially sought to try him for both incidents but the court in Halle decided to try him only for the 2021 rally.\nIn 2017 H\u00f6cke called the Holocaust memorial in Berlin a \"memorial of shame\". \nH\u00f6cke has led the AfD's regional branch in Thuringia since the party was founded in 2013. The party is leading in the polls for elections in the state due later this year.\nThe Thuringian AfD is one of three branches under official surveillance by the domestic intelligence agency as a \"proven right-wing extremist\" group. \nThe ruling comes a day after another court case, which found Germany's domestic intelligence agency was justified in putting the AfD under observation for suspected extremism.

    "Prince Harry and Meghan's charitable Archewell Foundation has been listed as \"delinquent\" by US authorities, after a cheque for registration failed to arrive.\nA spokesman for the couple says all the charity documents were filed on time, but the required cheque appears not to have been received.\nIt has been re-sent so the issue will be \"quickly resolved\", says Archewell.\nUntil then Archewell is not allowed to operate as a charity.\nThe letter from the State of California Department of Justice, sent on 3 May, gives a \"delinquency notice\" to the Archewell Foundation.\nIt warns that the process for being on the \"registry of charities and fundraisers\" has not been completed and as such Archewell cannot carry out charitable activities, such as \"soliciting or disbursing charitable funds\".\nThe charity, which gave grants of $1.2m (\u00a3960,000) last year, says that a cheque sent alongside registration information was not received by the California authorities, triggering the \"delinquency\" notice.\nA spokesman for Prince Harry and Meghan said that once Archewell had been notified, a \"new cheque has been mailed\".\nThis registration problem was not about tax filings, which a spokesman said had been submitted in full and paid on time.\nTax filings for 2022, published last year, showed Archewell had holdings of $11m (\u00a39m) and made donations including $100,000 (\u00a380,000) for the Halo Trust, a mine-clearing charity once supported by Princess Diana.\nOther funded projects included $200,000 (\u00a3160,000) for a \"gender justice\" project in Washington, $125,000 (\u00a3100,000) for a civil-rights charity and $100,000 (\u00a380,000) for a project promoting responsible use of technology.\nArchewell was founded when Prince Harry and Meghan moved to the US and stepped down from being working royals.\nEarlier this year there was an overhaul of the couple's operation, with a new sussex.com website, under the title of the Office of Prince Harry and Meghan.\nThe couple have just completed a visit to Nigeria, following celebrations in the UK to mark the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games.",
    "Jurgen Klopp's place as a Liverpool legend has long been cemented.\nIn nine years as manager, he has led the football club to eight trophies, including the Champions League and their first league title in 30 years.\nBeyond the silverware though, the charismatic German has become more than just a football manager to many in his adopted city, a feeling summed up by the 2022 move to give him the freedom of Liverpool.\nAs the 56-year-old prepares to hang up his trademark baseball cap for the last time on Sunday, some of those whose lives he has touched have paid tribute to him.\nFor Hillsborough campaigner Margaret Aspinall, Klopp's understanding of what she and the others affected by the 1989 disaster had been through was what endeared him to the city.\n\"He really gets the people of Merseyside,\" she said.\n\"The first time I met [him], I was quite surprised how much knowledge he had of Hillsborough.\"\nShe said the affected families \"have been through so much\", but the joy Klopp's accomplishments with the Reds had brought had given some respite.\n\"We've won a lot of things with Jurgen,\" she said.\n\"He's took all our pain away for those 90 minutes.\"\nShe added that he also had a unique way of making people feel at ease.\n\"If you only meet him for five seconds, you feel as if you've known him for years,\" she said.\n\"I feel he is a Scouser.\"\nKlopp's inspiring nature has had an effect on more than just the football field.\nAt Homebaked co-operative bakery, which stands in the shadow of Liverpool's Anfield stadium, a particularly popular pie bears his name.\nHead chef Dan Shiels said the Klopp pie, filled with steak, ale, potato and \"German almost-pickled ingredients\" in a nod to the Stuttgart-born manager's heritage , was one of their bestsellers.\nHe said staff at the bakery were \"devastated\" Klopp was stepping down as manager, but his legacy would live on beyond his reign.\n\"Even though Jurgen is leaving at the end of this season, we are going to keep on running the Klopp pie,\" he said.\nCouncillor Richard Kemp was the man who nominated Klopp for his civic honour. \nHe said he put the German forward \"because of the effect he has had on our city\", especially in the way the club's success under him boosted tourism and the work he did during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\"He used the football club as a way of uniting people and bringing people out of the despondency they were in,\" he said\n\"He spoke many times about that publicly, but he did a lot of work privately as well.\"\nNeil Pullar, from Formby, lives near the Liverpool manager and serves on the management committee of fans group The Spirit of Shankly.\nDespite being a lifelong Red, he said it was not the footballing achievements that earned Klopp a special place in his heart.\nHe said he would never forget the messages Klopp sent him after he had a cardiac arrest in 2022. \nWhile he was recuperating, he was sent a Liverpool shirt signed by Klopp, his wife Ulla and the team. \nHe said the completely unprompted act of kindness showed Klopp's \"place within the local community\", which meant \"a great deal\" to him.\nColette Halliday said her partner Stephen Murphy received a similar gesture from Klopp just weeks before he died of pulmonary fibrosis.\nShe said that \"out of the blue came this absolutely beautiful letter\", which she added was written in Klopp's \"unique Scouse-German\".\n\"We just all burst into tears when we read it,\" she said.\n\"I was so pleased Stephen got to see it because he died about three weeks later.\n\"The kindness that [Jurgen] showed in writing that letter when he didn't have to is the measure of the man.\"\nShe said the letter ended with a message about how the \"managers, players, owners, directors, staff and supporters\" of Liverpool were \"all supporting\" Mr Murphy \"and the best thing about this I know is what a difference it can make\".\n\"We're all with you,\" Klopp wrote.\n\"You'll never walk alone.\"\nIt will be that exact phrase that many of the city's residents will hope he carries with him himself beyond his final game.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Two Native American tribes in South Dakota have barred its governor, Kristi Noem, from their land as she doubles down on derogatory commentary against tribal leaders and reservation life.\nThe latest bans add to existing exclusions from four other reservations this year. Ms Noem is now banned from nearly one-fifth of state territory.\nIt comes after the Republican cut short a disastrous national media book tour.\nMs Noem was once a frontrunner to be Donald Trump's running mate this year.\nLess than three months ago, she topped a poll of candidates to run as vice-president for the November election. However, a crop of recent controversies, including a story of how she shot a pet dog, have drawn bipartisan criticism.\nThe Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate and Yankton Sioux tribes on Friday passed separate resolutions to prohibit Ms Noem from setting foot in their territory.\nThe tribes joined the Cheyenne River Sioux, Oglala Sioux, Rosebud Sioux and Standing Rock Sioux tribes in making the state's chief executive an outlaw on their lands. It means six of South Dakota's nine Native tribes are now refusing her entry.\nTribal governments have a sovereign right to exclude non-tribal members from their lands, with tribal law enforcement prepared to act if necessary.\nA secretary for the Yankton Sioux, however, clarified to local media that the tribe has not \"officially\" banned the governor by a vote of its general council, but one by its business and claims committee, the main elected body.\nAs governor, Ms Noem, 52, has often been at odds with these authorities. While tribal and federal authorities have criminal jurisdiction over reservations, she has sought to expand state power.\nShe was banished in 2019 by the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council after signing anti-riot legislation in response to Native-led protests against the Keystone XL pipeline, and then again earlier this year over rhetoric linking illegal immigration to crime on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.\nThe governor also ignored tribal objections to a 2020 fireworks display over Mount Rushmore and clashed with tribal leaders after they set up coronavirus checkpoints to control visits to their reservations.\nMost recently, she alleged Native children \"don't have any hope\" because of absentee parents and suggested without evidence that tribal leaders were \"personally benefitting\" from drug cartel operators.\n\"Governor Kristi Noem's wild and irresponsible attempt to connect tribal leaders and parents with Mexican drug cartels is a sad reflection of her fear-based politics that do nothing to bring people together to solve problems,\" Janet Alkire, chairwoman of the Standing Rock Sioux, wrote in a lengthy five-page rebuke in March.\nA spokesman for Ms Noem told the BBC that \"banishing Governor Noem does nothing to solve the problem... she calls on all our tribal leaders to banish the cartels from tribal lands\".\nIt is the latest embarrassment for the former rising star of the Republican party.\nIn her new book, No Going Back, Ms Noem recounts how she shot dead her 14-month-old dog, Cricket, for bad behaviour. She also killed a goat she said smelled and was mean.\nThe governor said the shootings were examples of her willingness to do things that were \"difficult, messy and ugly\".\nIn another passage, later removed, Ms Noem claimed she had been to the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea and \"stared down Kim Jong Un\". No public record of either action exists.\nShe also claimed she had been \"slated to meet with French president Emmanuel Macron\" during a visit to Paris but nixed their sit-down over alleged \"pro-Hamas\" comments he made in the press. \nA French government official said there was no record of a scheduled meeting or even an invitation.\nMs Noem has hit back at what she calls left-wing \"spin\", but her attempts at damage control have failed across the political spectrum. Several interviews have since been cancelled.\nLast week, Mr Trump acknowledged Ms Noem has had \"a rough couple of days\" but said he liked her \"a lot\" and noted she \"has been supportive of me from the beginning\".\nAccording to US media, however, Trump insiders say she has \"killed her chances\" of being his vice-president."
