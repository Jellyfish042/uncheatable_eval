    "For the current station, see Margate railway station.\nDisused railway station in Margate, Kent\nMargate East was a railway station in Margate, Kent, United Kingdom. It opened in 1863 and was closed in 1926 as part of the remodelling of railways in the Isle of Thanet by the Southern Railway.\nHistory\nIn 1857, the Herne Bay and Faversham Railway was granted approval to construct a 10\u00a0miles 48\u00a0chains (17.06\u00a0km) long railway line from Faversham to Herne Bay via Whitstable, despite severe opposition from the South Eastern Railway. In 1859, permission was granted to extend to Margate and the company changed its name to the Margate and London Railway. It was arranged that the London, Chatham and Dover Railway would work the line. By 1861, permission had been granted to extend to Ramsgate, and a further change of name to the Kent Coast Railway had taken place. The line between Herne Bay and Ramsgate opened on 5 October 1863.\nMargate East was 24.5 miles (39.43\u00a0km) from Faversham, and thus about 76.5 miles (123.11\u00a0km) from London Victoria station. In July 1922, service was six trains per day from London, and five trains per day to London. Margate East was one of four stations in the Isle of Thanet closed on 2 July 1926 by the Southern Railway's remodelling scheme.\nExternal Links\nPhotographs of Margate East via Margate Historical Society.\n",
    "Municipal building in Kilmaurs, Scotland\nThe Kilmaurs Tolbooth, also known as The Jougs, is a municipal building on Main Street in Kilmaurs in Scotland. The building, which is local landmark, is a Category A listed building.\nHistory\nThe original tolbooth was a single-storey building at the corner of Irvine Road and Main Street which may have dated back to the 16th century. The building, which is likely to have been used to hold prisoners, was no longer in use by the late 17th century.\nThe current building, on the east side of Main Street, was designed in the Scottish medieval style, built in painted stone and was completed in around 1709. The original design involved a rectangular main block facing onto Main Street with gables at either end. The building was repaired in 1743, and a four-stage tower was added in 1800. There was a short flight of steps leading up to a round headed doorway with a fanlight in the first stage, a Diocletian window in the second stage, blind walls in the third stage and a belfry with louvres in the fourth stage, all surmounted by pyramid-shaped roof and a weather vane in the form of a cockerel. Internally, the principal room was the council chamber on the first floor, which had a bench and a dock, and it once featured a fireplace. There were two prison cells on the ground floor.\nAfter the jougs (a form of neck shackle) had been withdrawn from use in 1820, they were attached to the south wall of the building to act as a warning to others. A new mercat cross was erected to the north of the tolbooth in 1830. The council chamber was used as a meeting place by the ancient burgh council and, following the implementation of the Poor Law (Scotland) Act 1845, by the parish council, as well the venue for the magistrates' court. In February 1851, the magistrates, concerned that there were no police officers living in the immediate area, sought approval from the county prison board to put one of the old prison cells in proper order and to use it as a lock-up for petty prisoners. The other prison cell was used to accommodate the local horse-drawn fire engine.\nA clock was added to the third stage of the tower in 1866 and, after the tower was hit by lightning, 12 feet (3.7\u00a0m) of masonry had to be replaced in 1874. An extensive programme of external restoration works, which included repairs to the cement render, was carried out by a local stonemason in 2018.\nSee also\nList of Category A listed buildings in East Ayrshire\nList of listed buildings in Kilmaurs, East Ayrshire",
    "Pricing strategy in sewage treatment\nIn the sewage treatment, the Mogden formula is a pricing strategy used to estimate the difficulty in treating industrial wastewater.  It is named after Mogden Sewage Treatment Works.\nThe Mogden formula calculates cost as a combination (empirical coefficients) of volume, strength in terms of normal treatment oxidation demand and the suspended solids proportion. Applicable to the whole works, it also approximates the cost for tested industrial waste water that may, if treatable, be lawfully sent to a regular sewage works.\nThe Mogden formula is:\nC = R +  + B(Ot/Os) + S(St/Ss)\nwhere:\nC = charge per volume of effluent (\u00a3/m3)\nR = reception and conveyance charge \nV = primary treatment (volumetric) charge \nBv = additional volume charge for biological treatment \nM = treatment and disposal charge where effluent goes to sea outfall \nB = biological oxidation of settled sewage charge \nOt = chemical oxygen demand (COD) of effluent after one hour of quiescent settlements at pH 7 \nOs = chemical oxygen demand (COD) of effluent after one hour of quiescent settlement \nS = treatment and disposal of primary sewage sludge charge \nSt = total suspended solids of effluent at pH 7 \nSs = total suspended solids of effluent \nThus the less biologically friendly the effluent (see wastewater quality indicators including pH), and more solid-laden, the higher the charge should be for treating the lawful effluent.\n",
    "\nThe 1928 State of the Union Address was given by the 30th president of the United States, Calvin Coolidge, to a joint session of the 70th United States Congress on December 4, 1928. Delivered at a time of economic prosperity and international peace, Coolidge's message highlighted the nation's growing wealth, peaceful international relations, and efforts to improve efficiency in both government and industry.\nCoolidge described the state of the Union as being more favorable than at any previous time, with \"tranquility and contentment\" marking the domestic sphere. He noted that industrial relations were harmonious and that the nation's economy had moved beyond mere necessities into the \"region of luxury.\"\nIn foreign affairs, Coolidge pointed to the success of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, an international treaty renouncing war as a means of resolving disputes. He described it as a \"solemn declaration against war\" and a major step towards a peaceful global order. He also discussed the United States' role in facilitating peace in Latin America and Europe, particularly through negotiations with Nicaragua and support for resolving tensions between Chile and Peru.\nThe address also emphasized fiscal conservatism, with Coolidge explaining that tax cuts and reductions in government spending had stimulated economic growth. He proudly noted that one-third of the national debt had been paid off, and government revenues had continued to grow despite repeated tax cuts.\nCoolidge concluded by calling for continued fiscal responsibility, warning that new spending without revenue to support it would lead to an unbalanced budget for the first time in his administration.\n",
    "\nA Sarbhaja (Bengali: \u09b8\u09b0\u09ad\u09be\u099c\u09be pronounced ) is a milk based sweet originating from West Bengal, which is one of the famous Bengali sweets. The sweet's name comes from sar, the surface creamy layer of milk which is its main ingredient, and the word Bhaja refers to the frying of the sar. The Sarbhaja uses cow's milk and ghee is used for frying. It is fried until golden brown in color. This sweet made from milk is famous throughout Bengal.\nAlthough the sweet gained popularity in the first decade of the 20th century, its earliest mention is in the 15th century Chaitanya Charitamrita. In 1902, Adharchandra Das opened a sweet shop in Krishnanagar, and the shop became famous for its Sarpuria and Sarbhaja. As per the Hindu custom, it is customary to take sweets for the members of the household on Vijaya or other festive occasions; the Krishnanagarik or Krishnanagarians have a tradition of taking Sarbhaja as a sweet.\nIngredients and preparation\nTraditional Sarbhaja is usually made from milk, ghee, and sugar (powdered). Depending on the recipe, some other ingredients may be added to these ingredients such as cinnamon, cardamom.\nSar is made using traditional techniques from pure cow's milk, the Ghoshes\u2014businessman of milk products\u2014of Krishnanagar mainly supply the milk. Fresh milk is thoroughly boiled in a semi-flat iron ko\u1e5b\u0101i (pan) using dry cow dung cake flame. Half an hour is required to form a rich foam on the boiling milk surface, during which the ladle or wooden stick is stirred in the boiling milk. The low heat of red burn dry dung cake make the milk to condense and a thick foamy layer of milk fat accumulates on the surface; it is called sar. The sars used in Sarbhaja are usually 7 to 9 inches in diameter. About 400 milliliters of milk is required to produce a 9-inch diameter sar. The sar is collected from the karai and placed on a piece of cotton cloth to cool; about 2 to 3 hours are required for cooling. Sarbhaja preparation requires another dairy product called kheer, which is made by boiling milk. To make kheer, fresh cow's milk is boiled for half an hour and stirred continuously with a ladle to obtain  concentrated form of mnilk called kheer in pest form. Sugar is added while boiling the milk.\nThe sars and kheer prepared from milk are arranged in successive layers. In this process kheer is spread over a piece of sar and covered with another layer of sar, thus keeping 3-5 layers of sar and kheer. This layered sar and kheer material known as kacha Sarbhaja (raw Sarbhaja). Kacha Sarbhaja is cut into square shape pieces with the help of a knife. Kacha Sarbhaja pieces are fried until they turn light golden-brown in color, using pure ghee for frying. After frying, the fried pieces of Sarbhaja need to be cooled. The pieces of hot Sarbhaja are cooled on a wooden plate.\n",

    "New Zealand marketpalce website\nFelt is an online marketplace founded in 2007 for New Zealand-based artists and craftspeople to sell their work.\nOrigin\nFelt was launched in 2007 by Christchurch graphic designer Lucy Arnold, in response to the US craft-selling site Etsy. Arnold, in her mid 20s, had bought a sewing machine in 2005 and made merino arm warmers for friends and family, eventually selling them on Etsy. She decided to create a New Zealand version of the site that allowed people to buy locally-made handcrafts and compete with imported mass-produced goods. The success of the New Zealand auction website Trade Me in competing with eBay, at a time when online shopping was still a new concept for New Zealanders, suggested that such a business was workable; Trade Me was a poor fit for craft vendors, as it only allowed items to be listed for one week, and was designed for bargain-hunters. The name Felt was chosen after three weeks of brainstorming because it evoked the material felt, touch, and emotion. The site was set up to allow designers, artists, and craftspeople to promote and sell their hand-made work directly to customers; the only requirement was for the vendor to be resident in New Zealand. Vendors paid a deposit and a small fee per listing, as well as 5 per cent commission to Felt. Arnold's intent was for Felt to support small local businesses and provide a platform for craftspeople beginning their careers.\nGrowth\nThe website experienced initial rapid growth, with 500 sellers and 2600 registered users by May 2009, and was one of the top three trading sites in the 2010 New Zealand Netguide Web Awards. After Felt supported the Wellington-originated Craft2.0 events in Christchurch in 2008 and 2009, Arnold organised an inaugural Christchurch craft fair, A Craft Affair, in July 2010. Along with two other crafters Arnold began Crafty Business, a monthly meeting for crafters to discuss marketing and princing their goods.\nFelt was badly affected by the 2011 Christchurch earthquake: its premises was red-stickered for demolition and all computer equipment was lost. In June 2011, Felt had 15,000 to 20,000 registered users; this had grown to 64,300 by 2015. The COVID-19 pandemic boosted sales, as part time crafters began to sell their wares online. At a COVID media briefing on 14 April 2020, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern wore a pair of feather earrings crafted from bicycle inner tubes by a Felt vendor. This led to surge in sales and visitor numbers to the site. By 2023, Felt goods were being sold by 1500 vendors to customers in 56 countries, with the most popular categories being jewellery, infant clothing, and garden art, and vendors were collectively making over $1 million in sales annually. Nevertheless, Felt was still a relatively small business, run by Arnold and three staff working from their homes in central Christchurch.\n",

    "Buddhist temple in Amsterdam\nFo Guang Shan He Hua Temple (Chinese: \u4f5b\u5149\u5c71\u8377\u83ef\u5bfa; pinyin: F\u00f3 Gu\u0101ng Sh\u0101n H\u00e9 Hu\u00e1 S\u00ec; lit. 'Buddha's Light Mountain Lotus Flower Temple', or simply He Hua Temple, is a Buddhist temple located at Zeedijk 106\u2013118, Chinatown in Amsterdam. It is the largest Buddhist temple built in the traditional Chinese palace style in Europe. The temple is part of the Fo Guang Shan, and the BLIA. It is also the first Chinese Buddhist temple building in Europe.\nHistory\nAt the end of Zeedijk street, right before Nieuwmarkt was originally a convent for nuns which was founded in 1475. The convent was later used as shop premises. In 1944, the last remnants of the building were demolished after the Jewish owners were deported during World War II. It was turned into a playground in the 1950s.\nMid-1990s, there was a nuisance of drug addicts in the Chinatown of Amsterdam. A land lot was vacant at Zeedijk 106-118. Architect Aldo van Eyck installed playground equipment there. The organization NV Economisch Herstel Zeedijk was active with the economic recovery of Zeedijk. They weighed the options for the vacant lot. Frank Man, chairman of the Chinese Entrepreneurs Association Amsterdam, and the restaurant owner Fu Wen Lo, supported Chinese entrepreneurship in the neighborhood. They thought a large Buddhist temple was necessary as a crowning achievement of Amsterdam's Chinatown. In 1992, the mayor of Amsterdam Schelto Patijn told the Chinese community that \"something is allowed there\". In 1994, it was officially decided to build a Buddhist temple. Architect Fred Greven had multiple projects in the Zeedijk and joined the meetings. The Fo Guang Shan was interested in building a temple. Despite Greven's lack of experience in designing Buddhist temples, he was appointed and travelled to Taiwan to learn about Buddhist temples. Greven met the leaders of the Fo Guang Shan, most importantly Hsing Yun (founder of the Fo Guang Shan), and a Taiwanese woman who managed global Buddhist real estate. They agreed to finance the temple's construction.\nThe temple was commissioned by the Buddha's Light International Association based in Taiwan. It was designed by the Dutch architect Fred Greven. After several years of construction, the He Hua Temple was officially completed in September 2000. On September 15 of the same year, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands attended the opening ceremony.\nArchitecture\nThe leaders of the Fo Guang Shan dismissed the first temple design by architect Fred Greven as too small with incorrect measurements. For the second design he applied the Buddhist sacred measurement unit of 32 centimeters and everything fell in place. The temple is dedicated to the meeting between Chinese and Dutch culture. It symbolizes a blossoming lotus flower for Buddhism in the Netherlands. The granite outdoor stairs and balustrades were made in China.\nThe temple has four floors: \nFloor (-1) has a large dining hall and exhibition space. A free vegetarian meal is served after each ceremony.\nFloor (ground 1) has two rooms for Buddha worship with statues of Kuan Yin (Guanyin), Wei Tuo (Skanda) and Qie-Lan (Guan Yu).\nFloor (2) are private quarters.\nFloor (3) has a library.\nThe facades of the two side-buildings transition to typical Dutch architecture of the Zeedijk. The roof was originally covered with imported Taiwanese roof tiles. However, these were incompatible with Dutch weather. They were replaced by custom yellow glazed Romanesque tiles with replica fittings and prayer statues. These were made by the Dutch ceramics company Traditec.\nEvents\nThere are events during traditional Chinese festivals and important Buddhist holidays. On Vesak Day, during full moon in May, a large number of Chinese Dutch and other Buddhists come to burn incense to worship Buddha, and the many bodhisattvas. During the procession, a statue of Siddhartha Gautama is carried from the temple to the Nieuwmarkt.\nGallery\nHe Hua temple\nTemple during non-opening hours with closed bars\nHandwritten information board\nIncense pot\nGate seen from Kuan Yin Shrine\nKuan Yin Shrine\nKuan Yin Shrine\nLeft duilian on the gate seen from the Kuan Yin Shrine\nRight duilian on the gate seen from the Kuan Yin Shrine\nKuan Yin Shrine (Guanyin)\nRoof of the temple\nAltar of Skanda\nAltar of Guan Yu\nGuan Yu\nSkanda\nJaden Buddha hall\nAltar of Siddhartha Gautama\n",

    "1997 studio album by Bad Livers\nHogs on the Highway is an album by the American band Bad Livers, released in 1997. The band's label, Sugar Hill, marketed the album to bluegrass audiences and college radio. Bad Livers supported the album with a North American tour.\nProduction\nThe album was recorded over two months in Austin and San Marcos, Texas. Bob Grant replaced fiddler Ralph White, although both contributed to Hogs on the Highway. Steve James played mandolin on some of the tracks. Bass player Mike Rubin played tuba on \"Lathe Crick\". The band used a mbira on \"Falling Down the Stairs (With a Pistol in My Hand)\". Most of the songs were written by frontman Danny Barnes, who also produced. \"Cluck Old Hen\" is an interpretation of the traditional banjo song. \"Saludamas a Tejas\" is a version of the polka standard. Bad Livers included two unlisted tracks at the end of the album.\nCritical reception\nUSA Today stated that \"Bad Livers are a mix of sincerity and goofiness, capable of worthy homages to Hank Williams and Bill Monroe as well as outbreaks of punk anarchism.\" The Chicago Tribune called the album a \"fleet-fingered swig of pinewood blues and ragged breakdowns\", later noting that \"it spills over with tubas, banjos and accordions, and is infused with elements of gospel and even a vague sort of hillbilly pop\u2014it's the closest they've come to making an unselfconscious, truly grownup record.\" The Gazette determined that \"although the Livers are very credible playing straight-ahead bluegrass, they're really a symbiotic, high-energy country roots band who can swing on a fiddle tune one minute, stomp the blues the next and bring it all together in a high-energy package\".\nThe Sydney Morning Herald said that Bad Livers \"have taken just about every conceivable left-field roots-country style and mixed up a tasty brew which drifts from Texas swing to jug band, bluegrass.\" The Santa Fe New Mexican noted that \"the band's punk sensibilities come out in the some of the goofball lyrics\". The Houston Chronicle concluded that \"Bad Livers are less disjointed 'thrash-grass' than they are faithful to the moonshine spirit of old-timey string bands such as Gid Tanner and the Skillet Lickers.\" The Houston Press listed Hogs on the Highway among the best Texas albums of 1997.\nTrack listing\n",

It is trying to ensure accountability from the government and health authorities, along with providing a platform for junior doctors to voice their grievances.\nAbhaya Clinic\nThe Abhaya Clinic initiative was launched by WBJDF, which includes both telemedicine services and temporary medical camps, was created to continue serving patients during the doctors' ongoing strike, which seeks justice for their colleague.\nThrough these clinics, doctors provide free medical consultations and medications to underserved communities across Kolkata and other parts of West Bengal. Notably, the clinic also want to extended its services to treat flood victims, offering essential medical aid to those affected by the disaster. Since its inception, thousands of patients have benefited from these efforts, ensuring uninterrupted healthcare during both the strike and the emergency.  These camps have been held in multiple locations, including Kumartuli, Esplanade, and near prominent medical colleges, and are staffed by doctors from various disciplines, offering their services every Sunday.\nThe name \"Abhaya,\" meaning \"fearlessness,\" symbolizes the doctors' determination to fight for justice while ensuring that patients are not left without care.\n",
    "Ethnic group\nChristian Turkic are ethnic Turkics who follow Christianity. The Christian Turkic peoples represent an intersection of Turkic and Christian cultural and historical dynamics, particularly within the context of Central Asia and the Caucasus. Historically, the most prominent group within this category were the Bulgars. Currently, The major Christian-Turkic peoples include the Chuvash of Chuvashia, and the Gagauz (G\u00f6ko\u011fuz) of Moldova and Yakuts of the Sakha Republic. The vast majority of Chuvash and the Gagauz are Eastern Orthodox Christians.\nThe Bulgars were Turkic semi-nomadic warrior tribes that flourished in the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe and the Volga region between the 5th and 7th centuries. They became known as nomadic equestrians in the Volga-Ural region, but some researchers believe that their ethnic roots can be traced to Central Asia. The Bulgars converted to Christianity during the early medieval period, around the 10th century. Under Khan Boris I (reigned 852\u2013889), they officially adopted Christianity in 865 and embraced Eastern Orthodoxy in 879. Their Christian identity was shaped by a blend of Byzantine and local Eastern Christian traditions, which significantly influenced their cultural and political relations with neighboring states.\nBetween the 9th and 14th centuries, the Church of the East, often referred to as the Nestorian Church, had a notable presence among Turkic peoples, including the Naimans, a prominent Turkic tribe.  Between the 9th and 14th centuries, it represented the world's largest Christian denomination in terms of geographical extent, and in the Middle Ages was one of the three major Christian powerhouses of Eurasia alongside Latin Catholicism and Greek Orthodoxy. It established dioceses and communities stretching from the Mediterranean Sea and today's Iraq and Iran, to India (the Saint Thomas Syrian Christians of Kerala), the Mongol kingdoms and Turkic tribes in Central Asia, and China during the Tang dynasty (7th\u20139th centuries). This period marked a significant expansion of the Church's influence into Central Asia and beyond. It even revived in Gaochang and expanded in Xinjiang in the Yuan dynasty period. The rise of Islam in the region and the decline of Mongol power contributed to the persecution and eventual disappearance of the Church of the East from Central Asia.\nIn the 19th century, numerous Turkic groups within the Russian Empire, such as the Na\u011fayb\u00e4k, Chuvash of Chuvashia, and Yakuts of the Sakha Republic, increasingly adopted Russian ways of life. Many of these communities converted en masse to Russian Orthodox Christianity, reflecting the broader cultural and religious influences of the empire during this period. Most Na\u011fayb\u00e4ks are Christian and were largely converted during the 18th century.\nHistory\nMiddle Ages\nFurther information: Bulgars and Cumans\nPalm Sunday procession of Nestorian clergy in a 7th- or 8th-century wall painting from a church at Karakhoja, Chinese Turkestan\nThe Bulgars, a Turkic semi-nomadic semi-nomadic warrior tribe thrived in the expansive landscapes of the Pontic-Caspian steppe and the Volga region from the 5th to the 7th centuries. Originating from Central Asia, the Bulgars became renowned as skilled equestrians and fierce warriors, adapting to the demands of their environment while establishing a formidable presence in the region. By the 10th century, they began to embrace Christianity, a pivotal transformation that would shape their identity and influence in the broader Eurasian context. The Bulgars\u2019 conversion to Christianity was formalized during the reign of Khan Boris I, who ruled from 852 to 889. Under his leadership, the Bulgars officially adopted Christianity in 865, subsequently embracing Eastern Orthodoxy in 879. This shift was not merely a religious change but a complex interplay of cultural exchanges with the Byzantine Empire and local Eastern Christian traditions. As a result, their Christian identity emerged from a rich tapestry of influences, which significantly impacted their political and cultural relationships with neighboring states and peoples.\nThe Uyghur Khaganate had established itself by the year 744 AD. Through trade relations established with China, its capital city of Ordu Baliq in central Mongolia's Orkhon Valley became a wealthy center of commerce, and a significant portion of the Uyghur population abandoned their nomadic lifestyle for a sedentary one. The Uyghur Khaganate produced extensive literature, and a relatively high number of its inhabitants were literate. The official state religion of the early Uyghur Khaganate was Manichaeism, which was introduced through the conversion of B\u00f6g\u00fc Qaghan by the Sogdians after the An Lushan rebellion. The Uyghur Khaganate was tolerant of religious diversity and practiced variety of religions including Buddhism, Christianity, shamanism and Manichaeism.\nThe term \"Gagauz\" collectively refers to Turkic people in the Balkans who speak the Gagauz language, distinct fr",

He played for Great Britain in the inaugural 1938 Amateur World Series.\nPlaying career\nKendrick played with the semi-pro Smith Falls club of the Canadian\u2013American League in 1936. He was recruited by John Moores, a British businessman and baseball executive, to come play professionally in Britain; he abandoned his Canadian wife and three children to play in the U.K.\nHe began his career in the British league with the York Maroons of the Yorkshire League in 1937. The following year, he played with Leeds of the \"International League\" (a circuit populated largely by foreign import players) and with the Oldham Greyhounds of the Lancashire-Yorkshire League (the successor to Moores's original Yorkshire League). He pitched Oldham into the finals of the Challenge Cup, which would determine the national champions, but lost to Rochdale in a 15-inning pitching duel.\nKendrick also pitched two games in a series of \"test matches\" between the Great Britain and United States national teams which would become retroactively known as the inaugural Amateur World Series, the first major international baseball tournament. In the two games he started, he pitched two shutouts and struck out 16 and 12 American batters, respectively, to deliver Great Britain the championship.\nDuring World War II, Kendrick played in games against American servicemen, including one against Skippy Roberge, a former Major Leaguer. After the war, he became an electrician, but continued playing baseball into his 60s. He was inducted into the British Baseball Hall of Fame as part of the inaugural class in 2009.\n",
    "\nThe building, in 2016\nRoyal Crescent Court is a historic building in Filey, a town in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe building lies on The Crescent, and was one of three built as an addition to the original design.  Nikolaus Pevsner describes it as \"the most prestigious building in The Crescent\".  It was completed in 1853, and served as a hotel.  It was initially leased by Edwin Taylor, who operated it as Taylor's Crescent Hotel, but in the mid-1880s it became the Royal Crescent Hotel.  Early guests included the Archbishop of York and Lord John Russell, while Leopold II of Belgium ate at the hotel.  It was taken over by the British Army during World War II but reopened after the war, and in the early 1950s was taken over by the Frederick Group.  However, it was closed in about 1955 and converted into apartments.  The building was grade II listed in 1985.\nThe building is constructed of stuccoed brick, with a sill band, a modillion cornice, a moulded eaves cornice, and a hipped slate roof.  There are four storeys, a basement and attics, and five bays, the middle and outer bays projecting. In the centre is a portico with paired Doric columns and a balustrade, above which is a Venetian window with a keystone, and a tripartite window.  Flanking the portico are continuous wrought iron balconies.  The windows in the first floor have cornices with detached consoles.  In the returns are four-storey bow windows.  In front of the building, and on the sides, are cast iron railings on a low stone plinth, and there are four cast iron lamp pedestals.\nSee also\nListed buildings in Filey",

    "Palazzo Gatti\nThe Palazzo Gatti (also called Casa Gatti) is a 13th-century Gothic architecture palace located in Via Cardinal La Fontaine, 23 in central Viterbo, region of Lazio, Italy.\nThis palace was initially erected in 1266 by the capitano del popolo Raniero Gatti. It was a larger complex of buildings, extending westward behind the former church of Santi Giuseppe e Teresa and the former convent of the Discalced Carmelite nuns that still occupies the block between Via La Fontaine and Via degli Scalzi (and the Piazza of the Fontana Grande).  As was typical of the houses of noble families in this era, the Gatti Palace included defensive towers, six in number, that no longer exist. The palace is said to have hosted a number of visiting lords, including in 1328 Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor (Ludovico il Bavaro); in 1452 Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor on his way to Rome to be crowned by Pope Nicholas V and to receive his bride to be, the young Portuguese princess Lionora; and also in 1474, Federico da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino. By 1496, the power of the Gatti family and their Ghibelline allies had been routed by the Guelph forces and their allies in Viterbo, including the Tignosi, Orsini, and Maganzesi families.\nIn the following centuries, the palace fell into near ruin, and various connected structures were razed. Remaining today is a three-story stone structure with peaked-arch portals at the ground floor and mullioned windows on the upper floor. The garden terrace on the roof is a 20th-century addition, replacing a gabled roof previously there. A wide stone staircase, in the alleway leading north, from Via La Fontaine, rises up to the piano nobile. Above the mullioned windows are various heraldic coat of arms, including those of the Alessandri family.\n",

    "Occupation of Veracruz by the United States\nThe Military Government of Veracruz (Spanish: Gobierno Militar de Veracruz) was a provisional military government established during the American occupation of Veracruz in 1914 that lasted from April 21 to November 23.\nOccupation\nSee also: Battle of Veracruz (1914)\nJos\u00e9 Azueta is considered a Mexican hero for his actions during the Battle of Veracruz\nU.S. Army Brigadier General Frederick Funston was placed in control of the administration of the port. Assigned to his staff as an intelligence officer was a young Captain Douglas MacArthur.\nMexican President Victoriano Huerta was not able to respond to the U.S. invasion due to his preoccupation with the Mexican Revolution. He had to contend with numerous revolts across his country, the most notable of which were led in Chihuahua by Pancho Villa and in the state of Morelos by Emiliano Zapata. Venustiano Carranza, previously an ally of the federal government, also revolted against Huerta in Coahuila, the state where he was formerly governor. These rebellions eventually culminated in the Battle of Zacatecas on the 24th of June, 1914, where the Federal army lost 5,000 soldiers. The result was instrumental in bringing about Huerta's resignation.\nThe occupation brought the United States and Mexico to the brink of war and worsened relations between the two countries for many years. Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, who at the time were negotiating the ABC pact, a proposed economic and political treaty to prevent conflict in South America,  held the Niagara Falls peace conference in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, on May 20 to avoid an all-out war over this incident and to prevent American hegemony over the region.  A plan was formed in June for the U.S. troops to withdraw from Veracruz after General Huerta surrendered the reins of his government to a new regime and Mexico assured the United States that it would receive no indemnity for its losses in the recent chaotic events. Huerta soon afterwards left office and gave his government to Carranza. Carranza, who was still quite unhappy with U.S. troops occupying Veracruz, rejected the rest of the agreement. In November 1914, after the Convention of Aguascalientes ended and Carranza failed to resolve his differences with revolutionary generals Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata, Carranza left office for a short period and handed control to Eulalio Guti\u00e9rrez Ortiz.\n\"Defensores de Veracruz en 1914\" Memorial in Mexico City. This monument celebrates the Mexican defenders of Veracruz.\nDuring this brief absence from power, however, Carranza still controlled Veracruz and Tamaulipas. After leaving Mexico City, Carranza fled to the state of Veracruz, made the city of Cordoba the capital of his regime and agreed to accept the rest of the terms of Niagara Falls peace plan.  The U.S. troops officially departed on November 23. Despite their previous spat, diplomatic ties between the U.S. and the Carranza regime greatly extended, following the departure of U.S. troops from Veracruz.\nAfter the fighting ended, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels ordered that fifty-six Medals of Honor be awarded to participants in this action, the most for any single action before or since. This amount was half as many as had been awarded for the Spanish\u2013American War, and close to half the number that would be awarded during World War I and the Korean War. A critic claimed that the excess medals were awarded by lot. Major Smedley Butler, a recipient of one of the nine Medals of Honor awarded to Marines, later tried to return it, being incensed at this \"unutterable foul perversion of Our Country's greatest gift\" and claiming he had done nothing heroic. The Department of the Navy told him to not only keep it, but wear it.\nThe controversy surrounding the Veracruz Medals of Honor led to stricter standards for the awarding of the Medal of Honor and the establishment of lower ranking medals to recognize a wider range of accomplishments.\nMexico's Naval Lt. Azueta and a Naval Military School cadet, Cadet Midshipman Virgilio Uribe, who died during the fighting, are now part of the roll call of honor read by all branches of the Mexican Armed Forces in all military occasions, alongside the six Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes of the Military College (nowadays the Heroic Military Academy) who died in defense of the nation during the Battle of Chapultepec on September 13, 1847. As a result of the brave defense put up by the Naval School cadets and faculty, it has now become the Heroic Naval Military School of Mexico in their honor by virtue of a congressional resolution in 1949.\nPolitical consequences\nAs an immediate reaction to the military invasion of Veracruz several anti-U.S. riots broke out in Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Uruguay. U.S. citizens were expelled from Mexican territory and some had to be accommodated in refugee campuses at New Orleans, Texas City, and San Diego. Even the British government w",
    "1998 history book\nMoral Panic: Changing Concepts of the Child Molester in Modern America is a 1998 American history book by American historian Philip Jenkins. The book analyses public reactions to child sexual abuse throughout the 20th century, the influence of child molestation scandals on American law and culture, and the effects of such scandals on the shifting popular and scientific beliefs regarding child sexual abuse and child sexuality throughout the century. The book employs Stanley Cohen's and Stuart Hall's concept of moral panic to analyze such events related to child molestation in the 1910s, 1940s and 1980s.\nContents\nMoral Panic investigates three moral panics related to child molestation in the United States, the first of which occurred from 1908 to 1916, the second from 1935 to 1955, and the third which started in 1976 and continued to the end of the century. In the book, Jenkins describes how mass media, law-enforcement agencies, legislators and other social groups repeatedly exaggerated the threat of child sexual abuse in several periods of the 20th century. He also analyses newspapers, films, fiction books and other media to assess popular attitudes and beliefs regarding the dynamics of child sexual abuse and child sexuality.\nThe book also examines a period of American history, lasting from the 1950s to the 1960s, in which child sexual abuse received less attention from popular media. Jenkins states in the book that, in the early 1930s and throughout the 1960s, social sciences began supporting the idea that deviant sexual behaviors were not harmful to minors and, in the second period, downplayed the effects of sexual interactions between adults and underage people. In the 1970s, an event which he called the \"child sexual abuse revolution\" brought the issue of child sexual abuse back into prominence. The book covers the social reactions to child abductions in the 1970s and 1980s, child pornography and \"pedophile rings\" in the mid-1980s, the day-care sex-abuse panic, the satanic panic, internet sex rings and the moral panic over sexual predators in the 1990s.\nThe book further describes how child sexual abuse concerns were used by American Conservatives in the 1990s to censor the Internet, persecute homosexuals and increase social control over the youth. Jenkins also argues that U.S. states have infringed against suspects' basic constitutional rights and engaged in practices including shock therapy, psychosurgery, and psychotropic drugs. He also covers the development of Megan's Law and investigates how child sexual abuse concerns played a role in the overturning of the rehabilitative criminal justice system of the United States in the 1980s.\n",
    "Pipe band concert series\nThe Pre-Worlds Concert is an annual pipe band concert organised by the Glasgow Skye Association Pipe Band, first held in 1994.\nThe concert takes place just before the prestigious World Pipe Band Championships, the concert is designed to showcase performances by the world's top pipe bands. Drawing both local and international audiences, the event has grown into a highly anticipated feature of the pipe band calendar. Over the years, the concert has highlighted a diverse array of piping talent, offering an opportunity for bands to present unique and innovative performances outside of the competitive arena.\nHistory\nThe Pre-Worlds Concert was conceived by the Glasgow Skye Association Pipe Band as a way to spotlight the artistry and musical creativity of leading Grade 1 pipe bands. The event was originally hosted in the Motherwell Civic Centre but is now hosted at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, with the exception of 2023 when it was closed for refurbishment, and occurs in the week leading up to the World Pipe Band Championships, which are regarded as the pinnacle of competitive pipe band performance.\nUnlike the highly structured and competitive nature of the World Championships, the Pre-Worlds Concert allows bands to showcase more experimental and diverse repertoires. This includes original compositions, collaborations with other musicians, and innovative arrangements giving performers a chance to explore different musical styles while retaining the traditional essence of Scottish traditional music.\nOver the years, many of the world's top-ranked pipe bands have been invited to perform, making the concert a prestigious event. The concert draws both local piping enthusiasts and international visitors, with tickets often selling out well in advance.\nIn 2023, the concert was moved to the SEC Armadillo due to refurbishments at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall but returned in 2024.\nFormat\nEach year, a single pipe band is invited to headline the concert. The chosen band often uses the opportunity to present music that highlights their strengths, with a special emphasis on innovation, musicality, and showmanship. The concert typically runs for about two hours, with the headlining band performing a series of sets that vary in style and mood. Many bands also use the event as a platform to release live albums, allowing the music performed at the concert to reach a wider audience.\nList of concerts\nLegacy\nThe Pre-Worlds Concert has been instrumental in promoting and preserving the cultural tradition of pipe band music while encouraging creative growth within the genre. The concert has inspired several other events and continues to be a significant moment for the piping community, providing a high-profile stage for the world's best bands.\nMany of the performances from the Pre-Worlds Concert have been recorded and released as live albums, further contributing to the global reach of the event. For many pipe bands, performing at the concert is seen as a high honour, a recognition of their excellence within the global piping scene.\n",

    "Boxing match\nJames Toney vs. Mike McCallum II, billed as Once Is Not Enough, was a professional boxing match contested on August 29, 1992, for the IBF middleweight title.\nBackground\nToney and McCallum had previously met the previous December, fighting to a split draw. Given the indecisiveness of the decision, talks of a rematch happened immediately afterwards during the post-fight press conference with McCallum stating \"I'd love to do it again, it wasn't nothing but fun\". A rematch was not agreed to for the time being however, and Toney instead went on to make his next defense against Dave Tiberi in February 1992, being declared the winner by a highly disputed split decision despite Tiberi seemingly dominating the fight. Toney would then make another successful defense against Glenn Wolfe in April on the undercard of the George Foreman\u2013Alex Stewart fight, while McCallum would have one tune-up fight between his two fights against Toney, defeating journeyman Fermin Chirino by unanimous decision in May. Following Toney winning a non-title tune-up against Ricky Stackhouse, the Toney\u2013McCallum rematch was set to take place on August 29, 1992. Prior to the fight, Toney and his team, trying to get in the almost 36-year old McCallum's head, presented McCallum a rocking chair inscribed with \"Happy Retirement, Mike\" at a press conference and the two fighter nearly came to blows at another press conference after Toney suddenly jumped up from his chair and challenged McCallum.\nThe fight\nToney would win the fight by spit decision. For the second straight fight, one judge scored the fight even at 114\u2013114, though the other two judges had Toney the winner with lopsided scores of 117\u2013110. McCallum actually out-landed Toney by 100 punches, scoring 332 of his 849 thrown punches compared to Toney who landed 232 of 714 punches, though Toney was able to land the harder punches throughout the fight.\nFight card\nConfirmed bouts:\n^Note 1 For IBF middleweight title ^Note 2 For vacant IBF lightweight title\nBroadcasting\n",

    "New Zealand diver and police officer (born 1966)\nNicola Val Cooney (former married name Riordan; born 1966) is a New Zealand police officer and former diver. She represented her country at the 1986 and 1990 Commonwealth Games, winning a bronze medal at the latter. Since 2023, Cooney has been the Eastern Bay of Plenty area commander in the New Zealand Police.\nEarly life and family\nCooney was born in Rotorua in 1966, the daughter of Val and Denis Cooney. Her mother was a physical education teacher and her father owned a septic-tank company. She took up diving when she was eleven years old. She began her secondary education at Rotorua Girls' High School, but later became a boarder at Waikato Diocesan School in Hamilton to be able to train daily at the deep-water pool at the University of Waikato.\nDiving\nIn 1982, Cooney was selected for the diving squad as part the New Zealand schools swimming team that competed at the Pacific Schools Games in Brisbane.\nAt the 1983 New Zealand national diving championships, Cooney finished second in both the women's open one-metre springboard and women's open tower events, and won the Hansells Trophy for the highest-scoring individual dive by an age-group competitor. She was subsequently named in the 15-strong New Zealand team to compete at the world age-group championships held in Hamilton later that year, where she placed eighth in the 15\u201317 girls' one-metre springboard competition.\nIn 1984, Cooney reached the qualification standard for the 1984 Olympic Games, but was not selected for the New Zealand team. However, she began competing on the North American diving circuit during the Northern Hemisphere summer. In early 1985, she was part of the four-person New Zealand team that competed in Australia at the Australia Day diving competition and at the Australia Games. In March that year, Cooney won the women's three-metre and tower titles at the New Zealand diving championships, and was runner-up in the women's one-metre springboard event.\nIn early 1986, Cooney was a member of the New Zealand team at the Southern Cross international diving series in Australia. At the New Zealand championships in March that year, she was injured while competing in the women's platform event and had to withdraw from the event. However, she recovered to win the three-metre springboard title. Later that year, Cooney competed in the three-metre springboard at the 1986 Commonwealth Games, finishing fifth with a score of 469.62, a New Zealand record score for the event, surpassing the record previously held by Ann Fargher.\nIn 1987, Cooney retained her national three-metre springboard title, and the following year she was again overlooked for selection to represent New Zealand at the 1988 Summer Olympics. In 1989, she competed at the FINA Diving World Cup in Indianapolis.\nAt the 1990 Commonwealth Games held in Auckland, Cooney competed in the women's one-metre springboard, in which she finished in eighth place, and the three-metre springboard event where she won the bronze medal. Also in 1990, Cooney was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal.\nPolice career\nIn 1990, Cooney joined the New Zealand Police, and undertook a range of duties, including frontline and road policing. After taking a six-year break from the police, she returned and became head of the road policing team in Rotorua, before serving in various managerial roles at district headquarters. In 2023, Cooney was appointed Eastern Bay of Plenty area commander.\n",
    "\nFrancisco Leal Rodr\u00edguez (born 23 July 1964) is a Spanish former footballer who played as a goalkeeper.\nHe started and ended his career at Sevilla, and played 181 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n games for that club, Atl\u00e9tico Marbella, M\u00e9rida and Alav\u00e9s. He won that league's title twice with M\u00e9rida and once with Alav\u00e9s, as well as winning the Ricardo Zamora Trophy for best goalkeeper once with each of those clubs. His one La Liga season was 1995\u201396 for M\u00e9rida, playing every minute.\nCareer\nBorn in Osuna in the Province of Seville, Leal was a youth player at local Sevilla FC. Aged 16, he made the reserve team, Sevilla Atl\u00e9tico, in the Tercera Divisi\u00f3n. Sensing that his opportunities in the first team were low, he moved to Recreativo de Huelva and then Lorca Deportiva. He helped the latter to promotion from the fourth tier in 1986\u201387 and earned a trial at Barcelona, which did not result in a transfer due to the demands of the selling club's president.\nLeal instead spent 1987\u201388 at Melilla before heading to Atl\u00e9tico Marbella, where he achieved two consecutive promotions to reach the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n by 1993. Due to the Costa del Sol team's high outlay, he then moved to M\u00e9rida, where he won the Ricardo Zamora Trophy for best goalkeeper (19 goals conceded in 38 games) as they won the second tier in 1994\u201395.\nLeal and M\u00e9rida both debuted in La Liga on the same day. Their season ended with relegation, though he played the entire 3,780 minutes of 42 games, a figure only matched by his Atl\u00e9tico Madrid counterpart Jos\u00e9 Francisco Molina. The team won promotion back as champions immediately, but Leal had faced stiffer competition from Juan Carlos Balaguer and decided to leave for Alav\u00e9s.\nIn 1997\u201398, his only season for the club from Vitoria-Gasteiz, Leal was second-tier champion and received the Zamora Trophy again, making him the only person to win it with different clubs in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. He conceded 22 goals in 39 games. He also helped his team to the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey, where they lost to Mallorca.\nLeal returned to Sevilla at age 34 in 1998. He helped the team to promotion to the top flight, his third in succession; he had played the majority of games over the campaign, but was replaced by Monchi from February. The latter, as director of football, named him goalkeeper coach, a position he resigned from in October 2010.\n",

    "German ironclad gunboat\nFor other ships with the same name, see SMS Natter.\nSMS Natter was an ironclad gunboat of the Wespe class built for the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) in the 1870s. The ships, which were armed with a single 30.5\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) MRK L/22 gun, were intended to serve as part of a coastal defense fleet.\nDesign\nMain article: Wespe-class gunboat\nPlan and profile of the Wespe class in their original configuration\nDevelopment of the Wespe class of ironclad gunboats began in the 1850s, after the first ironclads were introduced during the Crimean War. Through the 1860s, the Federal Convention examined various proposals, which included plans to build at least eight vessels, to as many as eighteen armored warships. The decision was finalized based on the fleet plan conceived by General Albrecht von Stosch, the new Chief of the Kaiserliche Admiralit\u00e4t (Imperial Admiralty), in the early 1870s. He envisioned a fleet oriented on defense of Germany's Baltic and North Sea coasts, which would be led by the ironclad corvettes of the Sachsen class. These were to be supported by larger numbers of small, armored gunboats, which became the Wespe class.\nNatter was 46.4 meters (152\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) long overall, with a beam of 10.6\u00a0m (34\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in) and a draft of 3.2 to 3.4\u00a0m (10 to 11\u00a0ft). She displaced 1,098 metric tons (1,081 long tons) as designed and 1,163\u00a0t (1,145 long tons) at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 3\u00a0officers and 73 to 85\u00a0enlisted men. She was powered by a pair of double-expansion steam engines that drove a pair of 4-bladed screw propellers, with steam provided by four coal-fired cylindrical fire-tube boilers, which gave her a top speed of 11.1 knots (20.6\u00a0km/h; 12.8\u00a0mph) at 800 metric horsepower (790\u00a0ihp). At a cruising speed of 7 knots (13\u00a0km/h; 8.1\u00a0mph), she could steam for 700 nautical miles (1,300\u00a0km; 810\u00a0mi).\nThe ship was armed with one 30.5\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) MRK L/22 gun in a barbette mount that had a limited arc of traverse. In practice, the gun was aimed by turning the ship in the direction of fire. The Wespes were intended to beach themselves on the sandbars along the German coastline to serve as semi-mobile coastal artillery batteries. The armored barbette was protected by 203\u00a0mm (8\u00a0in) of wrought iron, backed with 210\u00a0mm (8.3\u00a0in) of teak. The ship was fitted with a waterline armor belt that was 102 to 203\u00a0mm (4 to 8\u00a0in) thick, with the thickest section protecting the propulsion machinery spaces and ammunition magazine. The belt was backed with 210\u00a0mm of teak. An armor deck that consisted of two layers of 22\u00a0mm (0.87\u00a0in) of iron on 28\u00a0mm (1.1\u00a0in) of teak provided additional protection against enemy fire.\nService history\nProfile drawing of the Wespe class as they appeared c. 1900\nThe keel for Natter was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in July 1879, and she was launched on 29 September 1880. The ship was named after the earlier, wooden gunboat Natter. Work on the ship was completed the following year, and she was commissioned into active service on 20 May for sea trials. She was then placed in reserve, assigned to the Marinestation der Nordsee (North Sea Naval Station) based in Wilhelmshaven.\nNatter, which had been stationed in Wilhelmshaven, was commissioned for her first proper period of active service on 15 June 1884 to replace her sister ship Biene, which had suffered machinery breakdown and would not be available for the upcoming training exercises. The crew from Biene were sent to Wilhelmshaven to activate Natter, and she got underway on 19 June, bound for the Baltic Sea. She arrived in Danzig Bay on 26 June, where she joined several of her other sisters in the Armored Gunboat Flotilla, which was serving with the Maneuver Fleet. The ships conducted various training exercises over the following three months, and on 30 September, Natter was decommissioned at Kiel. On 25 November, she was officially transferred to the Marinestation der Ostsee (Baltic Sea).\nThe ship remained out of service for the next decade, and in the early 1890s, she was modernized. The work included the installation of a pair of 8.7\u00a0cm (3.4\u00a0in) L/24 built-up guns, a pair of 37\u00a0mm (1.5\u00a0in) Hotchkiss revolver cannon, and two 35\u00a0cm (14\u00a0in) torpedo tubes in her bow, both of which were below the waterline. Natter next recommissioned on 2 October 1894, and she was assigned to the Armored Gunboat Reserve Division, based in Danzig. The unit only remained in existence for another ten days before being disbanded, and Natter was allocated to the Danzig Reserve Division. On 1 May 1895, she became the flagship of the deputy commander of the division; the same day, she came under the command of Kapit\u00e4nleutnant (KL\u2014Captain Lieutenant) Maximilian von Spee. Natter and the divisional flagship, her sister M\u00fccke, participated in training exercises with the rest of the fleet. On 19 September, Natter was decommissioned for the winter, but returned to service on 28 May 1896, now under the command of KL Friedrich Musculus. ",

    "\nA\u00efcha Goblet (born Madeleine Julie Gobelet) (28 February 1894 - 27 June 1972) was a French artists' model and dancer, a figure of the Ann\u00e9es folles in 1920s Paris.\nEarly life\nMadeleine Julie Gobelet was born on 28 February 1894 at Renescure, a commune in the Nord department in northern France. Her twin brother Henri was born a few hours before her. They were the children of Marthe Joseph Calin and Jules Am\u00e9ry Gobelet. Their father had died in Brazil on 1 September 1893, whilst their mother was pregnant. Their mother travelled back to France a month before the twins' birth. Both parents came from Renescure, and were a domestic servant and day labourer when they married in 1880. Madeleine had an older brother, Jules Charles and two sisters, Marie Antoinette and Marie Julienne, born in 1885 and 1887 in Clairmarais in the Pas-de-Calais.\nIn 1911, Madeleine settled with her mother and older sister in N\u0153ux-les-Mines. Later, many false or hard-to-verify accounts of her youth were circulated in the press: it was said (or she herself said) that she was born in Hazebrouck or Roubaix, that her parents had ten children, or that she started out as a circus rider at the age of 6. It was suggested that her mother was Flemish, and that her father was South American, Argentinean or from Martinique. In his 1950 book Montparnasse, Andr\u00e9 Salmon suggested that her father was an artist in a travelling circus. A\u00efcha later described herself as the only black woman in her family and said that her twin brother was \u2018as blond as wheat\u2019.\nArtists' model\nGoblet recounted different versions of how she became an artists' model in 1911. In one, she was approached in the street in Paris by the painter Jules Pascin, whom she later met again at the Caf\u00e9 de l'Ogive; another version claimed that while working in a circus in Clamart, two men approached her and asked her to become a model; she agreed to go to the caf\u00e9 du D\u00f4me and meet Pascin there. What is known is that she did become the painter's exclusive model for a time, but never posed nude for him.\nAfter a year, Goblet stopped modelling for Pascin, but remained close to him until his death in 1930. She lived for a time at the Villa Falgui\u00e8re, sculptor Alexandre Falgui\u00e8re's pink villa at no. 14 Cit\u00e9 Falgui\u00e8re, which developed into something of an artists' hotel in 1920s in support of the nearby artists studios. Under the name of A\u00efcha, she became an icon of Montparnasse, dominated at the time by Alice Prin, alias \u2018Kiki\u2019 the unofficial Queen of Montparnasse. She carried a card-case containing cards painted with forget-me-nots and with scalloped gilt edges, engraved with just her name. Other artists of the period took her as their model, including F\u00e9lix Vallotton, Man Ray, Henri Matisse, Tsuguharu Foujita and Mo\u00efse Kisling. A\u00efsha most often appeared wearing a brightly coloured turban.  She also organised numerous debates and meetings, such as the \u2018A\u00efcha dinner\u2019 at La Coupole brasserie.\nIn 1920, A\u00efcha inspired the novelist Andr\u00e9 Salmon to write his novel La N\u00e9gresse du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur.\nPerformance career\nThat same year, A\u00efcha began working as a music hall actress and dancer. She appeared in several plays directed by Gaston Baty, alongside the black actor Habib Benglia, with whom she became friends. the plays included Le Simoun (1920), Haya (1922) and \u00c0 l'ombre du mal (1924) by Henri-Ren\u00e9 Lenormand. In 1925, in Paul Demasy's play La Cavali\u00e8re Elsa, based on the novel by Pierre Mac Orlan A\u00efcha appeared with bare breasts, at a time when nudity was not yet accepted on stage. According to historian Sylvie Chalaye, critics at the time praised her only for \u2018her figure and her nudity\u2019. As with Habib Benglia, the press and the public were more interested in her appearance than her acting. In 1928, she appeared nude in Simon Gantillon's D\u00e9parts, eliciting ambiguous reviews: whilst her performance was praised, it was described through a racist viewpoint and language.\nBy 1926, A\u00efcha Goblet was living at 11, rue Jules-Chaplain. She became the companion and model of the painter Samuel Granovsky.\nLater life\nAt the turn of the 1930s, her modelling career over, she continued to frequent the caf\u00e9s of Montparnasse and recounted her memories to journalists such as Henri Broca and Emmanuel Bourcier.\nAndr\u00e9 Salmon put her in touch with the director of a magazine, who she presented with an outline of her memoirs. Salmon later recounted: \"After reading it, he courteously invited A\u00efcha to come to the studio adjoining the literary office, for the express purpose of stripping off all veils and posing for the camera as simply as she had done in the studio, on the model's board. The result was two fascinating photographs\". However, all that emerged from this interview was a short article, illustrated with three nude photographs, published in Mon Paris.\nIn 1935, A\u00efcha Goblet appeared in her last play, H\u00f4tel des masques by Albert-Jean. She left Montparnasse for Montmartre, and never returned.\nA\u00efcha Goblet died in 1972, at her home",

He became a samanera (novice monk) and sought to gain the belief of the Pao'O people by claiming to be the next Buddha and the reincarnation of Alantaya Sayadaw. According to local people, when he arrived in the area, he had memories of the deceased Alantaya Sayadaw and was said to be able to identify the Sayadaw's personal belongings. Ashin Arira Wuntha, the son and successor of the Alantaya Sayadaw, recognized Khun Tan as his father and instructed the local people to worship Khun Tan before his passing. This led locals to believe that he might be an incarnation of the Sayadaw. By 2013, he had gained significant influence in the area, and the local people began to revere him as a bodhisattva.\nSome in Alantaya believe that women born under ill-fated circumstances can restore balance by marrying Khun Tan. He seduced hundreds of young girls, mostly aged around 15 to 18, under the guise of religious devotion. Khun Tan reportedly claimed to have officially married six Pa'O girls in a formal wedding ceremony within the Alantaya. According to reports, some parents feel regret if Khun Tan does not choose their daughter because they think that her marriage to him would be a blessing. Worship of Khun Tan is deeply ingrained in the area; his followers have claimed that they would be willing to die for him. Every household shrine in the Alantaya area features offerings of flowers and oil lamps to an image of Khun Tan, placed next to the revered figures of the Alantaya Sayadaw and his successor, Ashin Arira Wuntha.\nAfter leaving the monkhood at the age of 20, he formed an armed gang named Dragon Battalion and instructed his followers to set fire to the cars and motorcycles of locals who did not accept him as the next Buddha. Khun Tan often committed unacceptable and cruel acts, such as stepping on monks' heads with his feet and striking children with motorcycles from behind. He compensated the victims for the injuries caused by these assaults. He is also linked to drug trafficking.\nKhun Tan's crimes were not widely known until the case was revealed on October 17, 2017, by MP Khine Khine Lei from the Mon State Hluttaw, which brought significant public attention to the issue.\nLawsuit\nOn October 24, 2017, Win Nyunt, the father of one of the girls, filed a case accusing Khun Tan of exploiting the girls. Khun Tan was charged under Penal Code sections 366 for abduction with intent to forcefully engage, 363 for kidnapping, and 114 for abetment. Win Nyunt has received death threats for filing the case. The Religious Affairs Ministry also sued Khun Tan and his five followers under Article 295(A) of the Penal Code for undermining Buddhism after renovating the Alantaya Pagoda without obtaining the necessary permissions from the government. Khun Tan's case was heard at the Mon State Hluttaw in Mawlamyine.\nTo facilitate Khun Tan's arrest, the Mon State Government established an investigative commission involving monks. After conducting preliminary investigations, the commission issued an arrest warrant. However, Khun Tan has fled to Shan State. The Mon State Government negotiated with the Shan State Government to capture Khun Tan. The Myanmar National Women's Empowerment Leadership Group announced that they will file initial defamation charges against Khun Tan if he is arrested.\nIn January 2018, the Mon State Religious Affairs Department filed a complaint at the Thaton Township Court, requesting action against Khun Tan and his group for their involvement in religious malpractices. On May 13, 2018, a Pa'O ethnic group held a press conference in Bago, urging the withdrawal of charges against Khun Tan and his followers. Even though Khun Tan fled and became notorious after his news was made public, people in that area still worship him.\nSee also\nPhoe Ta Khit\nHopong Koyinlay",

    "Steinbach Castle, 1900\nSteinbach Castle (German: Schloss Steinbach) is a former hunting lodge located in G\u00f6stling an der Ybbs, Scheibbs District of Lower Austria.\nHistory\nIn 1875 Baron Albert Salomon Anselm von Rothschild bought a large estate in the south of Lower Austria, near the Styrian boarder, between G\u00f6stling, Lackenhof, and Gaming. Rothschild divided the property into five administrative areas, Waidhofen and der Ybbs, Gaming, G\u00f6stling an der Ybbs, Hollenstein and Langau. There, Rothschild established a substantial forestry business and a hunting lodge and Tyrolean style country estate for his family. The building was expanded into an elegant hunting lodge in 1894.\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, Rothschild had an English cottage-style hunting lodge built in G\u00f6stling. Upon his death in 1911, his sons Alphonse Meyer de Rothschild and Louis Nathaniel de Rothschild inherited the estate with Alphonse receiving Langau and Gaming, and Louis receiving G\u00f6stling an der Ybbs, Hollenstein and Waidhofen an der Ybbs.\nWorld War II\nBaron Rothschild's hunting lodge, c.\u20091905\nIn April 1938, after the Anschluss where Nazi Germany annexed Austria, all of the Rothschild estates in Lower Austria were expropriated. In 1939, the Ministry of the Interior and Cultural Affairs declared Steinbach to be a secret depot (code name \"Jagd\") along with Gaming Castle (German: Schloss Gaming) (code name \"Schloss\"). From 1939, Jagd and Schloss became the most important depot outside Vienna for items from the Kunsthistorisches Museum. They held Egyptian and Near Eastern objects, Ambras portrait, antiquities and coin collections from ancient Greece and Rome, the, the Imperial Treasury and the Collection of Sculptures, Arts and Crafts. The provisional director of the KHM, Fritz Dworschak, who coordinated the salvage operations from the Viennese state museums, had some of the objects d'art that had been expropriated from David Goldmann, Rudolf Gutmann, Felix Haas, Alphonse and Louis Rothschild, and Alfons Thorsch\u00a0 sent to \"Jagd\". In July 1942, however, the Nazis decided to abandon the building as depot and the objects were removed in September 1942. The building was then transferred to the Reich Forestry department (German: Reichsforste).\nPost War\nAfter the war, Louis de Rothschild claimed restitution of the expropriated properties in 1946 and in 1948. Rothschild, who by then was living in New York City, gave his properties to the Austrian state, on condition that it used the proceeds to fund pensions for his former employees. Therefore, the Steinbach Castle was taken over by the Austrian Federal Forestry department in 1949. The former Rothschild hunting lodge itself was purchased by Kurt Smolka, owner of the interior design company INKU, in 1962.\nSee also\nRothschild family residences",

The road terminates a short distance later at River Road, on the western banks of the West Branch Susquehanna River.\nThe headquarters of the university's student newspaper, The Bucknellian, are located in Stuck House on South 7th Street.\nBetween 1908 and 1973, at the intersection of South 7th Street and Snake Road, formerly stood The College Inn.\nNotable addresses\nSee also: National Register of Historic Places listings in Union County, Pennsylvania\nFrom north to south (eastern side):\nGreen Park\nSmith Hall (Bucknell University)\nStuck House (Bucknell University)\nWestern side:\nLewisburg Cemetery\nO'Leary Center (Bucknell University)",
    "Neo-liberty was an original but transient concept in architectural theory, which developed in Italy the 1950s. It was a concept held by a loosely connected group of Milanese architects, but particularly those associated with Casabella-Continuit\u00e0, an architectural and design magazine, led by the editor-in-chief at Casabella, Ernesto Nathan Rogers.\nNeo-liberty's origin lay in a re-assessment of the ideology of modernism. It suggested that there was continuity between historic architectural tradition and modernism rather than an immutable chasm. It further suggested that it was acceptable to include historical elements in current architecture and design.\nAlthough transient in terms of the history of architecture, and localised to Italy, albeit with some proponents in the United States, there was a strong reaction against Neo-liberty. This was published openly in April 1959 by Reyner Banham, the British architectural critic.\nOther architects associated with Neo-liberty included, Aldo Rossi, Vittorio Gregotti, Gae Aulenti, Giotto Stoppino, Guido Canella and Giancarlo De Carlo.\n",

    "British real tennis player\nRobert Shenkman (born 20 September 1996) is an amateur British real tennis player currently based at the Manchester Tennis and Racquet Club. He is the current British Amateur Champion, US Amateur Champion, and MCC Gold Racquet holder, the first amateur to unite the three titles since Julian Snow in 2003. Shenkman is ranked in the top 10 Open singles rankings  and has reached the semi final of the US Open doubles championships.\nCareer\nReal tennis\nShenkman began playing real tennis as a junior, competing in the British Junior Under 16's and Under 18's championships between 2011 and 2014 but not reaching the final on any occasion. As a junior, he competed in the senior category tournaments, winning the Category D in 2012 and the Category C in 2013. He also won the Prested Cup Under 20 championships in 2015 and 2016.\nShenkman entered his first Open aged 19 at the 2015 British Open. He narrowly progressed through qualifying against Zak Eadle, before losing in the first round of the main draw to Craig Greenhalgh. He reached the final of the 2016 British U21's Open, this time losing to Eadle. He toured the US in February 2016, reaching the semi final of the Tuxedo Gold Racquet, the final of the US Amateur at Aiken and won his first Open match in the first round of the US Open against Adrian Kemp in Chicago.\nShenkman attended the University of Birmingham from 2016, avoiding touring for major tennis tournaments but instead developing his game with Ben Taylor-Matthews at the Leamington Tennis Court Club alongside his studies. In 2017, he represented the British team at the under 26 Van Alen and Limb Cups in Boston. That year, he lost in the first round of the British Open to amateur Peter Wright.\nIn 2018, he mostly competed in amateur tournaments in Britain, challenging Ed Kay for the MCC Silver Racquet and again at the semi final of the British Amateur. He won the 2018 British Under 24's Open against Jamie Giddins.\nIn 2019, Shenkman retained his Under 24's Open title, this time defeating Zak Eadle in the final. Shenkman again played for the British Team at the Van Alen and Limb Cups at Manchester, winning both of his singles matches. He entered qualifying for the Champions Trophy for the first time, but failed to progress from the group stage. He again lost his first round match at the 2019 British Open to Jamie Douglas. In early 2020, he travelled to Australia as a hitting partner for Ben Taylor-Matthews in the 2020 World Championship Eliminator. There, he and Taylor-Matthews began their podcast \"A View from the Hazards,\" which they continued through the subsequent hiatus from competitive play due to COVID-19. A third consecutive Under 24's Open title was also secured in 2020, being only the fourth player to win the trophy in three consecutive years. \nWhen play returned after the pandemic, and having now completed his studies, Shenkman began touring more regularly and began having successes at the top of the Open and Amateur games. He won his first British Open match in 2021 against Will Burns, his first tournament back after the pandemic. In 2022, he won the US Amateur Championships for the first time, and progressed through qualifying to reach the main draw of the US Open. He represented Britain for the third time on the Van Alen and George Limb tour, this time to Australia where he also won the Australian Under 26 Amateur Championships in Hobart. He also debuted at the French Open, winning a set off former World Champion Robert Fahey in the first round.\nIn 2023, Shenkman began to climb the rankings through strong performances at the Open events. He defeated world number 4 Chris Chapman at the US Professional Singles in Newport in five sets, in what would be Chapman's last match before his retirement from international play. Shenkman would lose in the quarter final to Leon Smart 6/5 6/5 6/5, but he would win the associated Satellite tournament as a consolation prize. He also reached the quarter finals of the US Open and British Open for the first time, and qualified to the main draw of the Champions Trophy. On the amateur circuit, he defended his US Amateur title against Freddie Bristowe, and won his first British Amateur title against Jamie Douglas. He earned the right to challenge Douglas for the MCC Gold Racquet by defeating Ed Kay in the MCC Silver Racquet, but would ultimately be defeated by Douglas in five sets.\nAt the 2024 US Open, Shenkman and doubles partner Darren Long upset World Doubles challengers Ben Taylor-Matthews and Bryn Sayers to reach his first Open semi final. Shenkman and Long then lost to eventual winners Camden Riviere and Tim Chisholm. Shenkman defended his US Professional Satellite title in Newport and won through qualifying at that year's Champions Trophy reaching the second quarter final stage following a win over Leon Smart in the first quarter final.

    "Norwegian footballer (born 1994)\nStefan Hagerup (born 6 April 1994) is a Norwegian footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Lillestr\u00f8m SK. He is best known from his period in Ull/Kisa, where he played every single minute from 2017 through 2023 and scored 5 league goals.\nCareer\nHagerup hails from Sandsli in Bergen. He played youth football for L\u00f8v-Ham, being an outfield player until age 13\u201314, and continued after L\u00f8v-Ham was merged with Fyllingen to form FK Fyllingsdalen. Hagerup made his senior debut for Fyllingsdalen in 2013 and established himself as the first choice in the 2014 2. divisjon. Besides football, he worked in the mail service.\nIn May 2015, the second-tier club Sogndal IL found themselves without a goalkeeper, as Mathias Dyngeland was injured and Christian Sukke was ill. Sogndal gained permission to sign a goalkeeper outside of the transfer window, and found Hagerup via a former assistant coach who now had a role in Fyllingsdalen. Hagerup played 12 matches, helping Sogndal win the 2015 1. divisjon and promotion to the 2016 Eliteserien. Hagerup never played in the Eliteserien, and was instead loaned out to second-tier club Ull/Kisa between May and July 2016. After the 2017 season was over, Hagerup and Ull/Kisa agreed to a permanent move, initially on a contract spanning two years.\nIn 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023, Stefan Hagerup played every single minute for Ull/Kisa in the league. The team reached the Eliteserien playoffs twice, but was relegated from the second to the third tier in 2021. However, he arguably became more known for something other than goalkeeping.\nAhead of the 2019 season, it was reported from Ull/Kisa's pre-season camp that Stefan Hagerup would be Ull/Kisa's free kick taker. A journalist compared his technique to that of Didier Drogba and David Luiz.\nHagerup scored his first goal in a training match against Elverum, before his first official goal came in October 2019 against Skeid. In addition to being decisive for Ull/Kisa's 2\u20131 away win, the technique was described as staggering. Videos of the goal were posted by social media accounts and online newspapers all over Europe, North and South America, gaining millions of views. Another goal came in July 2020, saving one point against Jerv.\nIn June 2022, he scored twice, first in a 4\u20133 victory against Asker and a 3\u20132 victory against Brattv\u00e5g. Romerikes Blad described the latter as particularly spectacular, \"in headwind, from nearly 30 meters\"; being \"so fierce that the utmost fierce descriptions had to be dragged out\". The same newspaper wrote that his next goal, in 2023, rivalled the others, \"a study in perfectioned free kick technique\".\nIn late 2023, his contract with Ull/Kisa ended, and Hagerup wanted to try something new. He trained with Eliteserien club Lillestr\u00f8m SK in November 2023, and was offered a contract\u2014as backup for Mads Hedenstad Christiansen and to allow the younger goalkeepers to move out on loan. Said Hagerup; \"I am aware that I might play zero Eliteserien games as long as I am with LSK, but I am ready to do my best and will contribute positively\". In August 2024, Hedenstad Christiansen picked up an injury and was ruled out for an indeterminate time. Hagerup would make his Eliteserien debut at the age of 30.\nPersonal life\nHagerup entered a relationship with Rebecca Skaar Danielsen from Loddefjord, and the couple eventually had two children. While they resided at Jessheim, Rebecca's sister eventually moved there as well, and started a relationship with one of Hagerup's teammates.\n",

    "\nOstracioidea or Ostracioidei, the boxfishes, is a suborder of ray-finned fishes belonging to the order Tetraodontiformes, which also includes the pufferfishes, filefishes and triggerfishes. The fishes in this taxon are found in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans.\nTaxonomy\nOstracioidea was named in 1810 by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, and has been regarded as a family with the two extant families being regarded as subfamilies. However, recent phylogenetic studies have concluded that the families Aracanidae and Ostraciidae are valid families but that they are part of the same clade. The 5th edition of Fishes of the World classifies this clade as the suborder Ostracioidea within the order Tetraodontiformes.\nEtymology\nOstracioidea takes its name from the type genus, Ostracion, of the family Ostraciidae. This name was proposed by Linnaeus in 1758 and means \"little box\" an allusion to the body shape of O. cubicus.\nFamilies\nOstracioidea contains two extant families and two extinct families:\n\u2020Spinacanthidae Santini & Tyler, 2003\n\u2020Protobalistidae Gill, 1888\nAracanidae Hollard, 1860\nOstraciidae Rafinesque, 1810\nCharacteristics\nOstracioidea boxfishes share the head and much of the body, apart from the cheeks, being encased in a carapace made up of thick, typically hexagonal, inflexible plate-like scales. These scales are interlinked by small finger like extensiosn along their margins. To the rear of the carapace there are isolated scale plates which vary in shape but there is no complete covering of scales. The cross section of the body shows slight lateral compression with at least two angles or ridges. There is no spiny dorsal fin and the soft dorsal fin and anal fin have short bases and are supported by 9 to 13 soft rays. They do not have a pelvis or pelvic fins. There are between 6 and 17 teeth typically small, conical teeth arranged in a single series in each jaw, these are sometimes compressed at their bases and may taper at the tips. The largest species in the suborder are the scrawled cowfish (Acanthostracion quadricornis) and the buffalo trunkfish (Lactophrys trigonus) each with a maximum published total length of 55\u00a0cm (22\u00a0in), while the smallest species are just above 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in) in length.\nDistribution and habitat\nOstracioidea boxfishes have distributions centred on the Indo-West Pacific region, especially around Australia, and the deepwater oxfishes of the family Aracanidae are restricted to that region. The boxfishes in the family Ostraciidae are more widespread and some species in this family are found in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific Oceans too. The deepwater boxfishes, or temperate, boxfishes live as their name suggests in deeper waters.\n",
    "\nThe building, in 2018\nWinterburn Chapel is a historic building in Winterburn, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThere was a mediaeval chapel in Winterburn, but it did not survive the English Reformation.  In the mid 17th century, an independent congregation was established, meeting in the houses of John Hey and Richard Mitchell.  In 1677, the first Nonconformist ordination in Yorkshire took place there.  A few years later, a Mrs Lambert founded a dedicated Presbyterian chapel, intended to serve local miners.  Oliver Heywood preached many of his earliest sermons in the chapel.  The chapel was restored in 1862, when a vestry was added at the west end, at which time it was a Congregationalist chapel.  There were further alterations in the 20th century.  It was grade II listed in 1954, at which time it was serving as an Anglican chapel of ease to St Andrew's Church, Gargrave.  It has since been converted into a house.\nThe building is constructed of rendered stone, with eaves modillions and a stone slate roof.  It has one storey and five bays.  The central entrance has a chamfered surround and a Tudor arched lintel, and the outer bays contain double-chamfered mullioned windows.  At the west end is the gabled former vestry.  Before conversion, it contained seven rows of box pews.\nSee also\nListed buildings in Flasby with Winterburn",

    "2016 TV special directed by Bill Benz\nThe Adult Swim Golf Classic is a sports comedy television special directed by Bill Benz and written by Jon Daly. Set and filmed at the Trump National Golf Club, Los Angeles in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, the special stars Daly and Adam Scott as professional golfers John Daly and Adam Scott playing against each other in a charity golf event set in 1966. It is based on golf matches televised in the 1960s in programs such as Shell's Wonderful World of Golf.\nSponsored by the fast-food sandwich restaurant chain Arby's, the special was broadcast on Adult Swim on April 8, 2016, and was met with generally favorable reviews.\nPremise\nIn a faux documentary sponsored by Arby's (the real-life sponsor of the special), professional golfers John Daly and Adam Scott (portrayed by actors Jon Daly and Adam Scott, who share the same name as the aforementioned golfers) play against each other in a charity golf event in 1966 at the Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. The prize fund for the tournament was $15,000, with proceeds from the tournament going to the golfers' (and the actors') charity of choice ($10,000 to the winner's charity, $5,000 to the loser's charity and $7,500 to each golfer's charity in the event of a tie).\nThe faux documentary was hosted by Jim Shea (portrayed by Mel Fair) and analyzed by real-life golf instructor Eddie Merrins and Golf Channel sportscaster Gary Williams.\nCast\nJon Daly as John Daly. In real life, the golfer Daly has not began his professional golfing career until 1987.\nAdam Scott as Adam Scott. In real life, the golfer Scott wasn't born until 1980.

Daly was introduced to golf by his father, who is a fan of the sport, and has followed the career of golfer John Daly since he was eleven years old due to the admiration to the golfer's humor and the fact that the actor shares the same name as the golfer. Daly's banter with the golfer began when the actor made a website called jondalyisjohndaly.com, where he would upload photos of himself in a golf course dressed as the golfer Daly in order to subversively take over the golfer's SEO on Google. It was a success, where photos of the actor dressed as the golfer were mixed in with actual photos of the golfer in Google image searches for \"John Daly\".\nDaly pitched the idea to actor Adam Scott during filming for The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013), where the two actors starred together.\nProduction for the special took place in two days at the Trump National Golf Club, Los Angeles in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, one day of just the actors playing golf against each other and trying to win and another day for pick-ups and capturing landscape footage at the golf course. The scores of the match in the special are actual results of the actors playing golf scored by real scorekeepers and featured actual referees and caddies. The prize money for the match was real and it was donated to real-life charities, namely St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (for Scott, who would win the match) and Save the Children (for Daly).\nBroadcast\nThe special was broadcast on Adult Swim on Friday, April 8, 2016, at 11:30 PM ET/PT. Coincidentally, the special was broadcast on the same day as the second round of the 2016 Masters Tournament, where the golfer Adam Scott competed.\nAn extended version of the special, which ran for an hour and 40 minutes, was released on Adult Swim's website on April 10, 2016.\nReception\nThe special was praised by critics, with Alex McLevy of The A.V. Club giving it a B+ rating and writing that the half-hour television special \"delivers continuous laughs, based almost wholly on one fact: Jon Daly and Adam Scott really suck at golf.\" Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote that everything about the match is painful to watch, \"which makes it hilarious, if you\u2019re in a 19th-hole sort of mood.\"\n",

    "\nPeja\u010devi\u0107 Castle in Na\u0161ice (Croatian: Dvorac Peja\u010devi\u0107 u Na\u0161icama) is a Baroque-revival style lowland structure in Na\u0161ice, a town in Osijek-Baranja County, northeastern Croatia. The Building bears its name thanks to the Peja\u010devi\u0107 noble family, whose members owned several castles in the region of Slavonia in the modern era.\nHistory\nThe castle was built in 1811/1812 by the order of Vincencije Ljudevit Peja\u010devi\u0107   (*1780\u2013\u20201820). After an earthquake in 1817 it was repaired and in the middle of the 19th century it was renovated and expanded by Vincencije's brother Ferdinand Karlo Rajner (*1800\u2013\u20201878) and his son Ladislav (*1824\u2013\u20201901), who later became Ban of Croatia. The building was enlarged with thirteen new window openings added on the north and south facades. A decorative gable with volutes, a balustrade and a clock were also added.\nApart from its artistic significance, Peja\u010devi\u0107 Castle also has historical significance. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the famous Croatian composer Dora Peja\u010devi\u0107, the daughter of Croatian Ban Teodor, lived there.\nDuring the World War II, the castle was used by the German Army between 1943 and 1945. A German war hospital was located in the basement. The facade and roof of the castle were damaged during the war.\nAfter the war, the castle was used for various purposes: as a barracks, school, kindergarten or as an office of the state administration, for various associations, etc. Today, the castle houses the local history museum, the city music orchestra, the city library with the reading room and the art gallery.\nDescription\nDue to the slope of the terrain, the castle is one-floor building on the entrance side and two-floor one on the park side. It is richly decorated with stucco, wood paneling and built-in furniture. In the large lobby there is a double, semi-visible staircase with a stone railings.\nFirst original castle from 1812 was built in the classicist style and was smaller than today's one. It had a rectangular floor plan, with nine window openings on the southern entrance facade. The central part of the castle, in the width of three window axes, was highlighted by larger windows and gazebo supported by three arches. The look of the castle was later expanded and changed.\nNot far from the castle there is a smaller building called the Small Castle. This is a ground floor building built in 1904/1905 in the neoclassical style by the order of count Marko VI Peja\u010devi\u0107 (*1882-\u20201923). It served as a hunting lodge. In front of the castle there was a spacious terraced garden. Today the building houses radio rooms, a music school and several clubs.\nA park was created next to the castle, which was designed after the castle was finished in 1812. Before the castle was built, this area was covered with  natural forests. Around 1850, count Ladislav Peja\u010devi\u0107 arranged the park when he decorated the castle. A greenhouse, drawn on an old cadastral plan, also had to be built at that time, although its historicist facade may have been built later. The park from the mid-19th century has the character of landscape parks. In the second half of the 19th century, the park was extended northwards to the surface of a natural forest, where a lake with a small island was created. \nToday, the park, which covers an area of about 34.5 hectares has been impoverished by numerous contents and details that can be seen in old photographs.

Castle built in 1630 on the steep bank of the Zbrucz River, north of the city center, and an architectural monument of local importance.\nHistory\nThe castle was built as a borderland fortalition on the initiative of Marcin Kalinowski, Crown Field Hetman. When the hetman was taken prisoner by the Tatars in 1648, the fortress was captured and destroyed by Cossacks. Quickly rebuilt, it still managed to defend itself against the Cossacks and Tatars in 1653 and against the Muscovite army in 1655. Despite the victory, the fortress was severely damaged. The castle was besieged and captured during the Polish-Turkish War in the 1670s-80s. In 1683, after the defeat of the Turks at Vienna, it was recaptured by Polish troops under the command of Andrzej Potocki, castellan of Krak\u00f3w. However, the Turks, while retreating, destroyed the defensive walls of the city and partially also the castle. It survived in good condition until the end of the First Republic. The castle, which existed in a semi-ruined state, was sold by Agenor Romuald Goluchowski in the first half of the 19th century to a local rabbi, who dismantled the structure and built a new palace and synagogue for himself, which were completely destroyed in 1914\u20131918, during World War I. Before 1939, there was an entrance gate in the ruins of the ruins of the castle in Husiatyn.\nIt has reached the present day as a complete ruin, of which little remains. Traces of the old walls lean with their ends against the course of the river.\nOwners and guests\nUntil 1729 the building belonged to the Kalinowski family, then to the Potocki family, and from 1819 the estate was purchased by the Zabielski family, whose ownership it remained until the mid-19th century, when it became the seat of a Jewish tzaddik. In its history, the castle hosted Polish kings W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa and John II Casimir Vasa.\n",
    "Australian professional wrestler\nCharles Honroth (1897\u2013February 10, 1976) was an Australian professional wrestler who was active in the 1920s revival of professional wrestling in Australia contending for the Australian Heavyweight Championship and being billed as the heavyweight champion of South Australia from 1927 to 1936.\nBiography\nHonroth was born in 1897. He began studying wrestling in 1918 training at Weber and Rice's gymnasium in Melbourne, also becoming an employee of the business. He attempted to become an active professional wrestler in 1922, with the public endorsement of his trainer former heavyweight champion Clarence Weber. He made his debut in June 1923 defeating Jim McMurdo then lost to heavyweight champion Billy Meeske in a title match in Melbourne. His next match was a victory against Floria Franish in September, in what was described as an unexciting bout, \nin November he wrestled a draw with Jim McMurdo, then in December he went on hiatus from wrestling for a holiday.\nIn January 1924 Honroth was described as having the potential to become as good as Clarence Weber the reigning heavyweight champion, and was booked to wrestle Meeske for the cruiserweight championship with promotion of the match emphasizing that his training with Weber and improvement since his last match with Meeske. He lost to Meeske in February, however reporting noted he had improved considerably, although the match was described as featuring too much defense to be a spectacle. In May a rematch was booked between Honroth and Jim McMurdo, which Honroth won after an even bout. He then fell ill with influenza leaving him unable to wrestle although he continued working as a trainer for the Weber and Rice gymnasium, and was able to conduct wrestling exhibitions with Weber. He returned to the ring in September defeating Peter Fatouros, and in December he faced Australian amateur heavyweight wrestling champion Jim Heslin in his professional wrestling debut winning on points.\nHonroth demonstrating a wrestling hold on Hughie Whitman, 1927.\nIn March 1925 Honroth performed demonstrations alongside Clarence Weber to promote professional wrestling and the Weber and Rice gymnasium. In April he rescued a man in Bairnsdale who was drowning after a boat collision, and the same month he married and embarked on his honeymoon. In March 1926 he returned to the ring losing in a rematch to Jim Heslin. He then performed wrestling demonstrations to promote the profession, but did not have another match until July when he defeated Fred Bromley.\nIn September 1926 Honroth moved to Adelaide to work for the Adelaide branch of the Weber and Rice fitness business which was now named the Weber, Shorthouse & Rice Health and Strength College, and in October Clarence Weber visited Adelaide to give wrestling demonstrations with him. He was not actively involved in wrestling again until July 1927 when he served as a referee for a match between American wrestlers Ted Thye and Mike Yokel who had a match in Adelaide, and in August he refereed a match between Walter Miller and Al Karasick also in Adelaide. In October he wrestled Harry Titchen in a match billed as being to determine the heavyweight champion of South Australia and won the bout.\nCharles Honroth, 1930.\nIn September 1928 Honroth publicly challenged Billy Meeske for the heavyweight championship of Australia stating that he had been sidelined from the professional wrestling scene since moving to Adelaide but felt he was just as entitled to the championship as other active wrestlers, and Meeske accepted the challenge although a match was not booked. Honroth continued to serve as a referee for wrestling bouts in Adelaide and by 1929 it was what he was best known for, not wrestling again himself until July 1930 when he defeated Leon Labriola in Port Pirie and lost to Sam Burmister in Adelaide. He wrestled again in October 1931, billed as the heavyweight champion of South Australia, against Alf Walloscheck, and in 1932 he defeated John Lewis in Adelaide.\nIn November 1933 Honroth wrestled Bruce Robertson in Adelaide in a match billed as being a title defence of the South Australian heavyweight championship and he won retaining the title, and in December 1934 he was named South Australia's most perfect man in a physical culture competition held in Melbourne. In July 1936 he wrestled in a victory against Leo Demetral in Adelaide being billed as again retaining the South Australia heavyweight title. In 1937 he established a massage parlor in Adelaide, advertising himself as the cities leading specialist in physical therapeutics, with the business operating until at least 1942 and Honroth being in the news as a masseuse at late as 1945.\nHonroth died in 1976 and was buried in Enfield Memorial Park.\n",

    "Root-like fiber below the flagella of some eukaryotes\nLongitudinal section of the pelagophyte Plocamiomonas psychrophila under transmission electron microscopy showing system II fibre or rhizoplast (r) positioned at the base of the basal bodies and continuing parallel to the nucleus (N). The mature (mf) and immature (if) flagella are also visible.\nThe rhizoplast (also known as internal flagellar root, fibrous root or cross-banded root) is an organelle present in a variety of flagellates, including ochrophyte and chlorophyte algae and some fungi. This term is used for a variety of striated, fibrous root-like structures that attach to the basal bodies (kinetosome) of the flagella and end in some other organelle. In the strictest sense, the term refers specifically to a type of root (known as system II fiber) that is composed of contractile microfibrils of centrin and connects directly to the surface of the cell nucleus.\nDescription\nRhizoplasts are organelles that display a great diversity of structure and composition. They are components of the cytoskeleton as flagellar roots, closely related to the flagellar apparatus in many single-celled eukaryotic organisms that bear flagella (i.e., flagellates). There are two types of flagellar roots, both arising from the base of the flagella: the superficial root (also known as the microtubular root), which underlies the cell membrane, and the internal flagellar root or rhizoplast (also known as the fibrous root), which projects into the cell.\nRhizoplasts appear as striated, fibrous roots that are attached to the basal bodies (the structures from which flagella arise) at their proximal end, and develop in the direction of the cell nucleus. They are composed of protein microfibrils organized in rootlets, but their exact proteic composition and structure varies from one group of organisms to another. This great diversity is not known to be homologous; it is simply a synonym for any structure that appears as cross-banded or striated flagellar roots, which are commonly seen in flagellates.\nIn the strictest sense, the term 'rhizoplast' only refers to those internal flagellar roots which connect directly to the surface of the nucleus. These are alternatively known as basal body-nucleus connectors or system II fibers, and are found in some chlorophytes and most chromophyte families. These are composed of centrin proteins that assemble in contractile bundles of microfibrils, similar to muscle fibers; these are capable of contraction modulated by calcium ions. In contrast, system I fibers, also commonly referred to as rhizoplasts, are composed of the non-contractile protein assemblin.\nOrigin\nThe term 'rhizoplast' was first introduced by botanist Pierre Augustin Dangeard in 1901 through his comparative studies on zoospores and spermatozoids. He used the term to refer to a filamentous structure that connected the basal bodies and the cell nucleus, which he observed via light microscopy on the chloroplast-lacking alga Polytoma uvella. During the early 20th century, this observation lead to the popularized assumption that the flagellar apparatus was functionally connected to the nucleus in most flagellate cells. However, in the second half of the century this relationship was disproven for many species via electron microscopy studies: very often they end in some other unrelated structure, such as the pyrenoid or the cell membrane. Only some select groups, such as some chlorophytes and many ochrophytes, maintain rhizoplasts as complex connectors between the nucleus and the basal bodies.\nOccurrence\nFungi\nRhizoplasts are present in some zoospores of fungi. The chytrid genus Rhizophlyctis is characterized by the presence of a fibrous rhizoplast that directly links the nucleus with the kinetosome. It may play a role as a hinge during the redirection of movement. The aphelid species Aphelidium collabens has a striated rhizoplast that covers the anterior end of the kinetosome and ends near the posterior end of the nucleus.\nFunction\nThere are many theories and speculations on the functionality of this union between the nucleus and the flagellar apparatus given by rhizoplasts, including:\nAnchoring for the flagella. The rhizoplasts are firmly attached to the flagellar apparatus; if a cell bursts, both structures remain together as a unit. For this reason, they are thought to have a role in the positioning of the basal bodies.\nFormation and positioning of the mitotic spindle. During mitosis (specifically prophase) in cells of Ochromonas and Poteriochromonas, the rhizoplast replicates and migrates attached to one of the two pairs of flagella. The opposite end of the two rhizoplasts attaches to the centrosome at each pole of the cell and begins forming the spindle. This ensures that the flagella are equally distributed among daughter cells.\nTransmission of intracellular stimuli. The flagella are used in some cells as sensory transducers for rapid responses, including cellular responses upon con",

The battle ended with the retreat of the Crimean troops and a Russian victory.\nBackground\nAfter the failure of the Tatar campaign against Tula in 1552, A correspondence began between the Russian Tsar and the Crimean Khan, in which Devlet Giray offered friendship to the Russians, but in return demanded tribute, which the Russian Tsar refused.\nIn 1555, the Crimean Khan went to war in the land of the Pyatigorsk Circassians, after which Ivan the Terrible sent the commander Ivan Sheremetyev, with an army of thirteen thousand, to meet the Khan.\nBattle\nKhan hoped for a quick success, having an almost 10-fold advantage. Left with an army of seven thousand, Sheremetev did not shy away from the battle and broke the advanced regiment of the Tatars, took the banner of the Shirin princes, and he was seriously wounded. The small Russian army still could not withstand the pressure, got mixed up and ran. But Alexey Basmanov and Stefan Sidorov managed to stop the fleeing and settled down with two thousand in an oak grove and in a gully (on a slope), where the wagon train stood, turned into a fortress on wheels.

The decision was based on the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution, which meant that confessions deemed involuntary were excluded from federal criminal trials.\nBarkentine ship Herbert Fuller at wharf in East Boston \"at time of trial for the murder of the captain\"\nThe case involved a triple murder by axe, on a ship out of Boston, with three surviving suspects. It is considered a mystery that passenger Lester Monks, a Harvard dropout who emerged alone from the crime scene where the axe was stored, was never arrested. He implicated Thomas Bram, the first mate from St Kitts. En route to the nearest port, Halifax in Canada, a Swedish sailor known as Charley Brown was put under arrest. He then claimed to have seen Bram commit murder, so Bram was put under arrest.  \nOn shore, police detective Power spoke to Brown, then went to Bram and told him Brown saw into the cabin from the wheel, seeing Bram killing the captain.

In Project Winter, players take on the roles of \"survivors\" and \"traitors\", having to repair two objectives to escape from an incoming blizzard, or prevent an escape from happening.\nGameplay\nProject Winter features a mix of survival and social deduction game mechanics. Lobbies consist of 5-8 players, the majority of which are survivors. Survivors must search the map for bunkers and similar structures, containing parts required to fix objectives, as well as gear to strengthen themselves. The game also utilizes a crafting system as an alternative to scavenging. There are several different objectives, each requiring a different method to be fixed (some require parts, some do not). In order to win, survivors must locate and repair 2 objectives and call for help before 30 minutes pass.\nThe traitors' goal is preventing survivors from winning. Project Winter allows them to sabotage their surroundings in order to obstruct survivors. Traitors also have access to exclusive 'traitor crates' which usually contain amazing gear. Several reviewers have stated that they feel the gameplay favors traitors.\nProject Winter also features several other survival-game-esque aspects. Players must watch their health, heat, and hunger bars in order to not die and watch out for the local wildlife.\nThe game utilizes proximity chat.\nConsole ports\nThe game's Xbox port was announced in early 2021 and released on January 26, 2021. The ports for both the Nintendo Switch and the PlayStation 4 were aimed to be released sometime in 2021, eventually being released on September 16.\nAll of the console ports were generally well received.\nProject Winter Mobile\nProject Winter Mobile was first announced in July 2022, as pre-registrations for the game's mobile port had started the same day.  The announced and eventual release date for the game's mobile port was August 31, 2022.\nPocket Gamer deemed Project Winter Mobile as \"too demanding\" for most mobile devices, stating \"You'll need a fully charged recent model phone and highly stable internet connection to play this game with some smoothness. If you're not equipped to do this on the go, you may be better off playing it through a mobile emulator on your PC.\".\nOn April 19, 2023, the developers announced a server shutdown in a Facebook, the planned date being May 25, 2023. As of May 25, 2023, the apps have been taken off the App Store and Google Play Store, with users being unable to log in and instead being redirected to the aforementioned Facebook post.\nReception\nProject Winter\nProject Winter has received \"generally favorable\" reviews on Metacritic. Due to its social deduction-based nature, a lot of reviews nearing the game's console release in 2021 compared it to the video game Among Us.\nScreen Rant rated the game at 3.5/5 stars, stating \"While Project Winter has many fun features,  there is a lot going on during a round, and at times, the balancing act of wilderness survival, social deduction, puzzle solving and team communication can roll into an overwhelming blur.\" Other reviewers have praised the game's \"unique\" concept and \"impressive depth\", however, have also noted problems within the community as a negative. Nintendo Life commented, \"we were often met with the kind of racist and sexist troll behaviour that should have been left behind in the 2000s, which is, admittedly, not Project Winter's fault, but it did colour our experience.\"\nGamePro called the game a \"more complex Among Us for survival fans\".\n",
    "\nJohn Sarli is a mathematician and academic. He is a Professor Emeritus of mathematics at California State University at San Bernardino.\nSarli's research focuses on the geometry of groups of Lie type and the applications of hyperbolic geometry with his work published in Geometriae Dedicata, Journal of Geometry, Advances in Geometry, and the Journal of Elasticity.\nEducation\nIn 1974, Sarli earned an A.B. in Mathematics from Brown University. He then pursued advanced studies and received his Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1984.\nCareer\nSarli was Chair of the Department of Mathematics at California State University, San Bernardino from 1988 to 1994. In 1999, he joined the Mathematics Diagnostic Testing Project (MDTP) Workgroup. The following year, he took on the role of site director at CSU San Bernardino when an MDTP site was set up there. He assumed the position of Chair of the MDTP Workgroup in 2002 and held the role until 2020. He holds the title of professor emeritus of Mathematics at California State University, San Bernardino.\nResearch\nSarli, through his research, described an incidence structure for twisted groups \ud835\udc3a, where points are elementary abelian root subgroups establishing a correspondence between certain lines and planes in this structure, demonstrating that it induces a polarity on an embedded metasymplectic space. He showed that biharmonic functions, crucial for understanding equilibrium equations for elastic bodies, can be derived from a power series using matrix representations of \ud835\udc36 and applied to describe solutions to planar equilibrium equations within M\u00f6bius plane geometry. His alignment of the geometry of root subgroups in \ud835\udc3a=PSp4(\ud835\udc5e) with a system of conics in the associated generalized quadrangle provided an interpretation of symplectic 2-transvections. Classifying the intrinsic conics in the hyperbolic plane, using collineation invariants, he offered metric characterizations and highlighted a natural duality among these classes, induced by an involution related to complementary angles of parallelism.\nSelected articles\nSarli, J.

    "2024 studio album by Kylie Minogue\nTension II is the upcoming seventeenth studio album by Australian singer Kylie Minogue. BMG and Minogue's company Darenote plan to release it on 18 October 2024, in a variety of digital, physical, and streaming formats. It is a sequel to her sixteenth studio album, Tension (2023), and is described as a record influenced by electronic music with elements of dance. Before its release, \"My Oh My\" was released with Bebe Rexha and Tove Lo as well as three additional collaborative singles: \"Dance Alone\" with Sia, \"Midnight Ride\" with Orville Peck and Diplo and \"Edge of Saturday Night\" with The Blessed Madonna.\n\"Lights Camera Action\" serves as the album's lead single, and was released on 27 September 2024. Minogue will embark on her Tension Tour, promoting both Tension II and its predecessor, and will begin in Perth on 15 February 2025 before travelling through Australia, Asia, the United Kingdom, and additional appearances throughout Europe, North America, and South America. It will be her first concert tour since Summer 2019 and the first series of shows since her Las Vegas concert residency, More Than Just a Residency.\nBackground\nOn 22 September 2023, Minogue released Tension, her sixteenth studio album, following Disco in 2020. Upon its release, it received universal acclaim from music critics for its production quality as well as Minogue's personality and delivery throughout the album, with many publications naming it one of the best records of the year and one of Minogue's best works to date. Commercially, it was a success, reaching number one on various record charts in Australia, Belgium, Ireland, Scotland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. To promote the album, she released three singles, including \"Padam Padam\" and the title track, both of which were critical and commercial successes, generating viral sensation and cultural significance. In January 2024, Variety reported that Tension would be repackaged and released later that year. The following month, Minogue hinted at working on new music during an interview at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, where she received her second Grammy this time for Grammy Award for Best Pop Dance Recording for \"Padam Padam\".\nConcept and development\nThe Blessed Madonna (pictured) serves as a featured artist and co-producer to Tension II.\nAt the beginning of 2024, she was featured on several collaborations, including \"Dance Alone\" with Australian singer Sia and \"Midnight Ride\" with South African artist Orville Peck and American producer Diplo. In July, Minogue confirmed she was working on new music, and teased a potential live comeback in the United Kingdom. On 8 July, Minogue teased new music on social media with the acronym \"MOM,\" which turned out to be her single \"My Oh My\", with American singer Bebe Rexha and Swedish singer Tove Lo. She later released \"Edge of Saturday Night\u201d, which includes British-American DJ The Blessed Madonna. Minogue teased an announcement on her social media on September 18, and one day later, she revealed Tension II, its release formats, the lead single \"Lights Camera Action\", and the announcement of her Tension Tour. The album is a sequel to its predecessor and is marketed as the \"high-energy, high-octane\" version. Additionally, the record enters a more electronic-driven sound with additional \"dance floor anthems\".\nTension II features all of Minogue's collaborations from 2024. Certain songs, such as \u201cEdge of Saturday Night\" with The Blessed Madonna, was originally conceived in 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdowns, and was inspired by a DJ set in Berlin, which eventually led to Minogue's involvement in 2024. The Blessed Madonna describes the track as \"about edges\", saying \"When I sat down to write lyrics for the very first time, I was on the edge of a brand new life. When I programmed and wrote the music that would become this song, I was on the edge of the next big leap into producing.\" Furthermore, The Blessed Madonna stated, \"It\u2019s fitting that this song is about an equally important edge in my life. It was a morning that magically turned into night.\"\nMusic and songs\nAccording to a Shore Fire Media press release representing Minogue, the album is a sequel to its predecessor and is marketed as the \"high-energy, high-octane\" version. Additionally, the record enters a more electronic-driven sound with additional \"dance floor anthems\". The album opens with \"Lights Camera Action\", which is a \"high-energy\" club-inspired electronic track with \"raving synths\" and \"hard strutting beats\" that lasts two minutes and 42 seconds and has been compared to her work on Tension. \"Edge of Saturday Night\" is a pop and house-inspired track that \"opens with bright, twangy pluck synths that dance like fireflies in the dusk, setting the stage for a night brimming with promise.\" According to EDM.com, the lyrics \"Monday doesn't matter at all\" reflect the song's overall theme of \"living for the weekend, cutting loose, and making the",
    "The Pfalzfeld obelisk, Side A.\nThe Pfalzfeld obelisk (German: Pfalzfeld S\u00e4ule or Flammens\u00e4ule) is a Celtic carved sandstone monument, an example of the sculpture of the Iron age La T\u00e8ne culture. The obelisk, removed from its original site to the churchyard of Pfalzfeld, is believed to have been a funerary monument from one of the nearby burial grounds. The obelisk has been dated to the 4th or 5th century BC. It is currently in the collection of the Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn.\nArchaeological context and later history\nThere is no concrete indication of the stone's original location.:\u200a77\u200a The heads on the Pfalzfeld obelisk are stylistically and materially similar to the fragmentary sandstone head uncovered at Heidelberg, which may suggest they came from the same workshop, in which case the obelisk probably originated in the Odenwald.:\u200a9\u200a The stone has been identified as within the stylistic bounds of the late Iron Age La T\u00e8ne culture.:\u200a1\u200a Near Pfalzfeld are multiple burial grounds, identified as belonging to the early Hunsr\u00fcck-Eifel culture, which the obelisk could have been removed from.:\u200a9\u200a\nThe first record of the stone is a drawing (described by archaeologist Hans-Eckart Joachim\u00a0 as \"astonishingly careful\") on a 1608/09 map of the Rheinfels district by cartographer Wilhelm Dilich\u00a0.:\u200a2\u20134\u200a Another drawing was made in 1739, this one much less accurate. German antiquarian Constantin Koenen\u00a0 has mentioned a drawing of about 1845.:\u200a3\u20134\u200a:\u200a81\u200a When Dilich drew it, the obelisk was in the churchyard of Pfalzfeld, though it is not thought to have originated there.:\u200a274\u2013277\u200a Antiquarians in the 18th century apparently believed it to be a Roman tombstone. Some futile excavations were carried out in 1737 in search of the tomb.:\u200a80\u201381\u200a The obelisk was moved to St Goar in 1737; moved to Koblenz in 1805; moved to the border of St Goar and Pfalzfeld in 1807; then to the cemetery of St Goar in 1845; and finally, to a room in Rheinfels Castle in 1932. In 1938, it was gifted to the Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn, where it remains today.:\u200a6\u200a The obelisk is now featured on the coat of arms of the municipality of Pfalzfeld.\nIn the 1608/09 drawing, the height of the stele from the round base up appears to have been about 2.20m. In the 1739 drawing it was 2m and the 1845 drawing apparently shows no major further loss of height. However, by 1901, when Koenen wrote about the obelisk, its height had been reduced to 1.48m. A portion of the base also seems to have broken off in this period. The stone therefore appears to have undergone significant damage in the latter half of the 19th century, caused by weathering in combination with frequent relocation.:\u200a3\u20136\u200a A witness in 1690, furthermore, related that the old people of Pfalzfeld recalled that the obelisk had originally had a human head on top of it, but that this head was torn down as idolatrous.:\u200a277\u200a:\u200a6\u200a The obelisk was perhaps crowned with a head similar to the Janus-faced Heidelberg head.:\u200a6\u200a Joachim estimates that originally the obelisk may have measured as much as 2.80m from the base and 3.50m altogether.:\u200a6\u200a\nGallery\n1608/09 drawing in the Dilich map\n1739 drawing\n1901 drawing in Koenen's article (Note the incorrect base):\u200a5\u200a\nA diagram showing the deterioration of the obelisk (after Hans-Eckart Joachim):\u200a7\u200a\nThe Heidelberg head.\nDescription\nThe Pfalzfeld obelisk is carved from a brown-violet quartz sandstone, probably sourced from the Saar-Nahe Basin.:\u200a15\u200a It measures 1.48m from the dome base. The diameter of the broken tip is 55.8cm.:\u200a277\u200a The diameter of the dome base is about 40cm.:\u200a3\u200a The obelisk has been dated to the 4th or 5th century BC.:\u200a77\u200a\nThe base of the obelisk is an overturned dome, perhaps originally buried underground for stability. The body of the obelisk is four-sided, rectangular, and tapers from the base.:\u200a107\u200a Each of the four sides is decorated. All four sides of the obelisk are carved with the same basic pattern, with slight differences in execution and the orientation of some elements.:\u200a6\u20137\u200a Near the base of the obelisk, a head is carved on each side. Visible are a moustache, a nose, eyes without pupils, and a narrow headband; no mouth is visible on any of the heads.:\u200a9\u200a The forehead of each face is marked with a lotus motif. Each head wears a Celtic leaf-crown (German: Blattkrone), made up of two asymmetrical teardrop-shaped leaves.:\u200a107\u2013109\u200a Each head rests on a three-leafed design which archaeologist Ian Armit has described as \"enigmatic\".:\u200a109\u200a Joachim has identified them with beards; Michael J. Enright with tasselled torcs; and Armit with plinths upon which the heads (supposedly severed) rest.:\u200a109\u200a S-shaped swirls work their way up the obelisk symmetrically. The borders are rope-like, diagonally notched. At the very top, downwards-facing palmettes are visible.:\u200a14\u200a\nGallery\nSide B\nSide C\nSide D\nA detail of the carved face on Side D.\nInterpretation\nThe asymmetric leaf-crown depicted on the obelisk bears a strong resemblance to that of the Glauberg prin",
    "New Zealand high jumper and police officer (born 1937)\nMurray Jeffries (born 1 August 1937) is a former New Zealand field athlete and police officer. He represented his country in the high jump at the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, and was the national high jump champion on four occasions between 1961 and 1966. A police detective, Jeffries was involved in high-profile investigations including the murder of Harvey and Jeannette Crewe and the murder of Teresa Cormack.\nEarly life and family\nJeffries was born in Auckland on 1 August 1937, the son of Florence and Harry Jeffries. He was educated at Otahuhu College, and went on to study at Ardmore Teachers' College from 1956 to 1957, earning a Primary School Teaching Certificate.\nIn 1959, Jeffries married Barbara Anne Armstrong, and the couple had three children. Barbara Jeffries died in 1995.\nAthletics\nIn 1954, Jeffries set a junior national record of 6\u00a0feet 5\u00a0inches (1.96\u00a0m) in the high jump. He was a member of the New Zealand team at the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, where he finished ninth in the high jump with a height of 6\u00a0feet 2\u00a0inches (1.88\u00a0m).\nJeffries won four New Zealand junior national titles in 1955, in the high jump, javelin throw, shot put and discus throw, and that year broke the national junior record for the high jump, with a leap of 6\u00a0feet 5+5\u20448\u00a0inches (1.97\u00a0m), and the javelin throw, recording a distance of 192\u00a0feet 6\u00a0inches (58.67\u00a0m). The following year, he competed in Australia with the New Zealand Universities track and field team. He was nominated for the New Zealand team for the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne by the New Zealand Amateur Athletic Association, but he was not selected by the New Zealand Olympic and British Empire Games Association.\nJeffries won four national high jump titles: in 1961, 1962, 1964 (title shared with Bill Speirs), and 1966. His best winning jump was in 1966, with a height of 6\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (1.98\u00a0m).\nPolice career\nAfter a short period as a primary school teacher, Jeffries joined the New Zealand Police, and at the passing out for his intake at the Trentham Police Training School in December 1959 he won the prize for sportsmanship. He went on to become a detective at the Otahuhu Criminal Investigation Branch, and he was officer in charge of the scene following the 1970 murders of Jeannette and Harvey Crewe at their Pukekawa farm.\nJeffries later moved to Hawke's Bay, where he was involved in investigations including the disappearance of Kirsa Jensen and the murder of Teresa Cormack. He was also involved in the establishment of neighbourhood support and rural support groups in Hawke's Bay, and the victim support group in Napier.\nIn 1979, Jeffries received the New Zealand Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal, and in 1990 he was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal.\n",
    "Albanian violinist (1934\u20132022)\nEthem Qerimaj (1934\u20132022) was an Albanian virtuoso violinist, and one of the best performers of the Albanian kaba.\nBiography\nEthem was born in Cakran, Fier, to an Albanian family from P\u00ebrmet (southern Albania), a region from which many important performers of southern Albanain folk music emerged. Although his family was originally engaged in milling, Ethem's father also performed folk music, and with him, young Ethem started playing firstly the mandolin and then the violin.\nAn event that changed Ethem's whole life took place when he was 12 years old: when the Albanian prime minister of the time, Mehmet Shehu, came to Cakran with government officials, a lunch was held for them at the village school and Ethem was chosen as a musician to play a few songs on his violin. His skills impressed Prime Minister Shehu, who wrote Ethem's name in a notebook and told him to get ready because he would soon receive music education in Albaia's capital, Tirana. Some time passed after the event without notification from the Prime Minister, but one day, police officers came to the village and put Ethem in their vehicle without giving any explanation, reason why Ethem's family thought with fear and sadness that the police had arrested him. However, when Ethem arrived to the building of the Filarmonia Shqiptare (\"Albanian Philharmonic Orchestra\") in Tirana, he was told that he was brought there to study music on the orders of Prime Minister Shehu.\nIn the institution Qerimaj started his studies with teachers Lam Petrela and Adem Beqiri, violinists who graduated from Soviet conservatories. The two teachers soon realized that young Ethem could not even read musical notation, but considering that the order to teach him came from a high authority, they decided to give him a one-year trial period, which Ethem successfully passed. In the following years Ethem studied classical Western violin with Lam Petrela and Pjet\u00ebr Gaci.\nAfter his education, he served as second violin group leader in the Albanian Philharmonic Orchestra for five years and in the Albanian State Opera and Theater Orchestra for thirteen years. Thereafter he continued to serve in the Albanian Army Orchestra until his retirement. During all his service he performed in many countries around the world, and wherever he performed, he never neglected to play the violin in the folk music style with which he was imbued since his early years as a musician.\nEthem continued to perform until his death on September 13, 2022.\nCitations\n",
    "The For\u00eat des \u00e9crivains combattants (\"Forest of fighting writers\") is a forest in the French department of H\u00e9rault, named in honor of writers who died during the World Wars.\nLocation\nThe forest is situated in the mountainous massif of Caroux-Espinouse. It spans the territories of Combes and Rosis (H\u00e9rault). It is currently included within the Haut-Languedoc Regional Nature Park.\nHistory\nIn 1930, floods devastated much of southwestern France, including the department of H\u00e9rault. Deforestation was blamed, prompting public authorities to advocate replanting. The Association of Combatant Writers, led by Claude Farr\u00e8re, decided in 1931 to contribute to this effort by establishing the For\u00eat des \u00e9crivains combattants, planted with pine and cedar trees across 135 hectares. They partnered with the Touring Club de France (TCF).\nThe project was initiated by Emmanuel Bourcier, a writer and veteran, supported by nurseryman Francisque Lacarelle, who personally funded the planting of ten thousand trees. The aim was to preserve the memory of writers who died during the First World War.\nIn July 1938, alleys and markers bearing the names of deceased writers were inaugurated, along with monumental works by sculptor Paul Moreau-Vauthier (1871\u20131936): a stele and, in the center of a clearing, a six-meter table depicting a Croix de Guerre. Writer and future collaborator Paul Chack, association president since 1936, welcomed two serving ministers: Auguste Champetier de Ribes (veterans) and Henri Queuille (agriculture).\nOn 13 July 1952, Pierre Chanlaine, president of the Association of Combatant Writers, transferred forest ownership to the state. It became a state forest and was developed as a recreational site. Names of writers who died during the Second World War were added.\nIn 1983, wildfires devastated nearly a quarter of the forest. Subsequent replanting and new visitor facilities were implemented.\nOn 18 November 2010, a convention for enhancing the massif was signed at the Croix de Guerre in the For\u00eat des \u00e9crivains combattants between the H\u00e9rault General Council, the National Forestry Office, and the communes of Combes and Rosis.\nOn 30 September 2016, the rehabilitated site was inaugurated by senior officials involved in the 2010 protocol. All old scattered steles in the forest were replaced with new ones made of local stone, Madale stone, and are now grouped on either side of a newly concreted loop path through the undergrowth, about 1.7\u00a0km in length. Thirty steles have, since the inauguration, experimentally featured a sticker with a Flash code, or QR code, allowing access to specific information about the writers (biography, literary works, and for some, an excerpt from their major work). Panels by the National Forestry Office around the monumental Croix de Guerre provide visitors with information on the forest's origin, the Association of Combatant Writers, and the layout of the steles. Officially, this forest is known as the For\u00eat domaniale des \u00e9crivains combattants (FDEC).\nCombatant Writers\nAmong the 757 writers who died for France (560 during the First World War and 197 during the Second), and whose names are inscribed at the Panth\u00e9on, sixty-six have their names on a stele in the forest, including three women, Bertie Albrecht, Marietta Martin, and Ir\u00e8ne N\u00e9mirovsky.\nProminent honored writers include French figures Paul Drouot, Charles P\u00e9guy, Alain-Fournier, Pierre Brossolette, Pierre Leroy-Beaulieu, Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, Robert Desnos, Jacques Decour, \u00c9mile D\u00e9tanger (\u00c9mile Nolly)...\nSeveral foreign writers from allied countries are also named, including poets John McCrae (Canada) and Alan Seeger (United States), as well as novelist Gabriele D'Annunzio (Italy).\nSome alleys in the forest are named after unknown authors. Roland Dorgel\u00e8s wrote that it seemed \"right to honor the young, the unrecognized, the beginners, who left behind only a few scattered pages: those of whom I once said they spilled little ink, but all their blood\".\nGallery\nEntrance stele.\nEntrance stele (detail).\nErwan Bergot stele (1930\u20131953).\nAlain-Fournier stele.\nJean-Marc Bernard stele.\n",

He was the brother of writer Balys Sruoga.\nBiography\nSruoga was born on 12 March 1886 in the village of Baibokai, near modern-day Panev\u0117\u017eys, then the Kovno Governorate of the Russian Empire. After graduating from Jelgava Gymnasium, Sruoga studied law in St. Petersburg and also studied at the Berlin Trade Institute. In 1905, along with Ernestas Galvanauskas (who was a distant relative), Sruoga participated in the Russian Revolution of 1905. Sruoga organized Lithuanian-language evenings and cut phone wires. Sruoga also was a delegate of the Great Seimas of Vilnius. He was subsequently imprisoned, and released only on the condition that he would return to live with his parents. During the First World War, Sruoga graduated from a military engineering school and was heavily injured near Warsaw.\nIn independent Lithuania, Sruoga served in the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From 1920 to 1922 Sruoga acted as a secretary of a committee that negotiated the Soviet\u2013Lithuanian Peace Treaty in Moscow. From 1925 Sruoga worked as the Lithuanian delegate to Berlin. From 1934 Sruoga was the Lithuanian consul in Tilsit. He was married to Bron\u0117 Jazbutyt\u0117, with whom he had Marija Jolita Sruogait\u0117 (1934\u20132016). According to Sruoga's letter to his brother Balys Sruoga, Sruoga did not cooperate with Nazi occupants during the Second World War, and instead worked in local Lithuanian institutions such as the Kaunas district financial department and the social care directorate. From 1940 to 1941 he worked at \"food industries in the People's Commissariat\", and from 1944 onwards at the \"Social Development Department of the Executive Committee of the City of Kaunas\". After the death of Balys Sruoga in 1947, Juozas took care of his brother's literary work. Juozas Sruoga's daughter Jolita also continued the task, eventually gifting a secret manuscript of the novel Forest of the Gods to the Maironis Lithuanian literature museum.\nSruoga died in Kaunas on 12  December 1957.\n",

He has two brothers, Anthony and Nicholas.\nCareer\nEarly years\nLafornara began learning how to skate in 2008. He was introduced to the sport by his mother, a figure skating coach, and initially began as a freestyle skater. He began testing pattern dances at first as a way to improve his skills as a singles skater, but eventually chose to transition to ice dance full time. He had a short-lived early dance partnership with Gabriela Hernandez, with whom he placed 10th in the novice category at the 2019 U.S. Ice Dance Final.\nLafornara teamed up with Canadian skater Romy Malcolm in February 2020 after their respective coaches met at the 2020 Bavarian Open and suggested the two try out together. However, their training was quickly put on hold due to COVID-19-related lockdown policies, and the pair trained separately from March to September of that year. Due to insufficient practice time, the team and their coaches made the decision to sit out the 2020\u201321 competitive season.\nMalcolm/Lafornara made their competitive debut in 2021 in the U.S. Figure Skating Championship Series, the qualifying events to the U.S. Figure Skating Championships. They earned a slot in the junior ice dance category at the 2022 U.S. Figure Skating Championships, where they finished 6th. The team received an Junior Grand Prix assignment early the following season, the 2022 JGP Poland where they placed 9th. The event would be their last competition together as Malcolm and Lafornara chose to dissolve their partnership not long after.\n2023\u201324 season: Debut of Tali/Lafornara\nAfter several months without a skating partner, Lafornara was offered a tryout with Italian skater Noemi Tali, who'd ended her partnership with Stefano Frasca not long after the 2023 Junior World Championships. The two agreed to team up for Italy in March 2023 after just two days of skating together, and made the decision to split their training between Tali's coaches, Valter Rizzo and Brunhilde Bianchi in Milan during the competitive season, and Lafornara's coaches, Denis Petukhov and Melissa Gregory in Connecticut during the off-season.\nTali/Lafornara made their international junior debut in October 2023 at the 2023 JGP Armenia. There they won the bronze medal, finishing behind Israeli skaters Elizabeth Tkachenko / Alexei Kiliakov and U.S. sibling team Elliana Peal / Ethan Peal. While the team did not receive a second JGP assignment, their success continued with podium placements at three international junior B events over the course of October and November. At the 2024 Italian Figure Skating Championships in December, Tali/Lafornara took the junior dance title handily over Beatrice Ventura / Stefano Frasca and Vittoria Petracchi / Daniel Basile.\nDue to their success at the national championships, Tali/Lafornara were assigned to compete at the 2024 World Junior Figure Skating Championships in February 2024. At Junior Worlds, the team placed fourth in the rhythm dance, but fell to ninth in the free dance to finish seventh overall.\n2024\u201325 season\nTali/Lafornara opened their second season together with a win at the 2024 JGP Latvia over U.S. siblings Caroline Mullen / Brendan Mullen and 2024 Junior World bronze medalists Darya Grimm / Michail Savitskiy. At their second JGP assignment, the 2024 JGP Thailand, Tali/Lafornara again took the title, this time ahead of two American teams, Hana Maria Aboian / Daniil Veselukhin and Elliana Peal / Ethan Peal. With their two wins in hand, Tali/Lafornara became the first ice dance team to qualify to the 2024\u201325 Junior Grand Prix Final.\nPrograms\nWith Tali\nWith Malcolm\nCompetitive highlights\nJGP: Junior Grand Prix\nWith Tali for Italy\nWith Malcolm for the United States\nExternal links\nNoemi Maria TALI / Noah LAFORNARA at the International Skating Union",

She was the first woman to lead a large secondary school in Victoria that was not a girls' school.\nLife\nBrennan was born in the Bendigo suburb of Sedgwick in 1914. Her Catholic parents were Mary Anne (born Conway) and Richard Brennan. Her paternal aunt was the leading lawyer Anna Brennan and her uncles were the politicians Thomas Brennan and Frank Brennan.\nShe completed her education at the University of Melbourne where she had studied the family's subject of the law. This was at the time of the depression and finding that there was a shortage of teachers she abandoned her ambition to be an articled clerk. She spent the next thirty years working in different schools applying for new positions after two or three years in order to gain promotion. Secondary school's were short of women teachers and they were willing to offer better positions to ambitious single women.\nPreston Girl's High School had opened in 1928. She was promoted to her first headship there.\nBrighton High School was the first co-educational school of more than a thousand pupils in the State of Victoria to be led by a woman. The state had removed the gender barrier and this had led to several girls schools being led by men.However no woman was leading any large school that was not a girl's school. The headship at Brighton High School became vacant and Molly Brennan applied. She became the head here in 1970 after she appealed against an initial decision to appoint a less qualified man. The library here is named for her.\nIn 1974 she tried to repeat her success by applying to be the head of Melbourne High School for boys. She again appealled when a less qualified man was appointed, but this time with no success. Although she had made a political point.\nShe was the head of what is now called Castlemaine Secondary College for two years until she retired in 1977.\nBrennan died in 2012 in Bendigo.\n",
    "Speech by US president George Washington\nThe 1795 State of the Union Address was delivered by the 1st president of the United States, George Washington, to a joint session of the Fourth United States Congress on December 8, 1795.

    "Liberian politician\nNot to be confused with Hassan Bility.\nMusa Hassan Bility (born April 6, 1967) is a Liberian politician and businessman. Bility held a number of government positions in the administration of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. Bility served as president of the Liberian Football Association from 2010 to 2018. He sought the FIFA presidency for the 2016 election, but his candidacy was suspended after he failed an integrity check. He received a 10-year ban from FIFA in 2019.\nIn 2016, Bility joined the Liberty Party. He was elected chairman of the party in 2021. There was a leadership crisis in the party due to a conflict between him and Political Leader Nyonblee Karnga-Lawrence. Bility was elected to the House of Representatives of Liberia in 2023. In September 2024, Bility resigned as chairman and as a member of the Liberty Party.\nBiography\nMusa Bility was born on April 6, 1967, in Saclepea in Nimba County. His mother was Muasia Dulleh Bility. His maternal grandmother was from notable Mano family. He is of the Mandingo ethnicity and of the Islamic faith. He earned a degree in economics from African Methodist Episcopal Zion University in Monrovia in 2008. As a businessman, Bility has owned a number of companies, including the media company Renaissance Communications Inc., which runs Truth FM Radio, Real TV, and Renaissance Newspaper. He also owns Srimex, which by 2015 was Liberia's largest oil importing firm.\nBility was early supporter of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in the 2005 election. Bility was given various government appoints under the Sirleaf administration including to bodies such as the National Port Authority, the Liberia Water and Sewer Corporations, and the Liberia Airport Authority. In 2013 during his time at the Liberia Airport Authority, Bility, along with small group, was indicted for, among other things, economic sabotage and criminal conspiracy. The charges against him were dropped in October 2015, two years after they were made, after the government failed to prosecute. During the 2011 election, Bility used his media company to support President Sirleaf's re-election campaign.\nFootball\nOn March 20, 2010, Bility was elected president of the Liberian Football Association (LFA). At the time of his election, he was serving as president of the Watanga FC. In 2011, Bility was one of the few Africans to vote against Sepp Blatter for president of FIFA, instead backing Mohammed bin Hammam's candidacy. He was re-elected as president of the LFA in 2014. Under Bility's LFA presidency, on multiple occasions including in 2013, 2016, and 2017, the LFA failed to pay its employees on time, delaying payment for a duration spanning months.\nOn August 13, 2011, Bility was elected to serve as a vice president of the West African Football Union (WAFU). He was re-elected unopposed in 2016. By 2013, Bility had been elected to serve as a member of the executive committee of the Confederation of African Football (CAF). On May 2, 2013, Bility was banned by CAF from all football activity for six months. According to the BBC, he had \"violated statutes relating to the use of confidential documents\" after fighting a rule change which would allow for the unopposed re-election of CAF President Issa Hayatou. The ban was lifted on September 23.\nIn October 2015, Bility submitted his candidacy for the FIFA presidency. He was the second person to declare his candidacy for the 2016 election after Zico. He was the second African ever to run for the FIFA presidency. His candidacy was not backed by CAF. His campaign manager was former Liberian Speaker of the House Edwin Snowe. In November 2015, Bility was excluded from the election due to failing an integrity check. Bility attempted to appeal the decision to exclude him through the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The reasoning behind the exclusion was not initially made public. In a letter sent by the FIFA electoral committee, a number of reasons for his exclusion were outlined, including his 2013 CAF suspension, the fact that his company Srimex was convicted for tax evasion, and the dismissed Liberia Airport Authority indictment.\nBility transferred the LFA presidency to Mustapha Raji in September 2018, after Raji was elected unopposed. In July 2019, following an investigation of Bility started in May 2018, FIFA banned him for 10 years and charged him US$500,000 in fines due to a violation of the FIFA code of ethics. Allegations against Bility included misappropriating FIFA funds, both annual grants as well as a grant intended to go toward an Ebola prevention campaign, conflicts of interest, and offering and accepting gifts. In May 2023, after an attempt to appeal the decision, his ban was upheld by the CAS.\nLiberty Party chairman\nBility resigned from the Unity Party (UP) in October 2016, near the end of the Sirleaf presidency. He joined the Liberty Party (LP). In a convention on January 23, 2021, Bility was elected chairman of the LP, replacing Steve Zargo. At the ti",
    "Japanese game designer\nHiroshi Matsumoto (Japanese: \u677e\u672c \u88d5\u53f8, Hepburn: Matsumoto Hiroshi) is a Japanese game designer.\nWorks\nNicknamed \"Finish\", Matsumoto worked in the 1980s as a planner for the Capcom company and later moved to SNK where he became a director. Matsumoto was a planner in the first Street Fighter game working with director Takashi Nishiyama. He was influenced by the idea of a fighting game where they could explore martial arts. Matsumoto and Nishiyama ended up coming up with these ideas together, to give the game deeper story and character elements. Nishiyama thinks it became a trend at the time to incorporate these kinds of elements into games. Nishiyama would have loved to have more playable characters, but Capcom were only able to put in just the two of them: Ryu and Ken Masters as playable characters. Matsumoto had to teach the programmer staff about the making of the games to develop it. Matsumoto regrets issue with developer Okamoto almost left Street Fighter as an incomplete game until further help. Following mixed responses to prices and gameplay, Matsumoto saw president Kenzo Tsujimoto happy with the game thanks to the sales it achieved.\nShortly after Street Fighter's release, a headhunter approached Nishiyama and convinced him to leave Capcom and join nearby studio SNK. Nishiyama took Matsumoto and the majority of his team with him and abandoned the Street Fighter IP. In SNK, Matsumoto directed the fighting game Art of Fighting starring the leads Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia who fight people in the city of Southtown to rescue the missing Yuri Sakazaki. The cast were created by Hiroshi Matsumoto as an homage to the Capcom fighting games' characters. Matsumoto has stated that he felt he was appealing to people who did not usually play games by showing the story in the game instead of just media such as magazines and comics.\nMatsumoto was also involved in the Fatal Fury: King of Fighters fighting games created by Nishikiyama. The game focuses on Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard and Joe Higashi entering into The King of Fighters tournament to avenge Jeff Bogard killed by host Geese Howard. The second Art of Fighting incorporated Geese Howard due to his popularity in Fatal Fury and his younger look from the first original video animation as a hidden boss. Matsumoto kept working in Fatal Fury 2 in 1992 with an expanded cast from the original cast besides the original trio.\n",

    "British private secretary to the Rajah of Sarawak\nGerard Truman Magill MacBryan (9 January 1902 \u2013 1953) was a Scotsman who initially served as Rajah Charles Vyner Brooke's Private Secretary and curator at the Sarawak Museum, was notable for his involvement in the annexation of Raj of Sarawak by the British Crown and later meddled in Brunei's affairs, gaining the trust of Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin through connections made in Kuching. In her book Queen of the Headhunters, Sylvia Brett, the last Ranee of Sarawak, introduces MacBryan as \"a young man who was destined to play a sinister part in the history of the Sarawak Raj.\"\nAfter the Sultan's death on 4 June 1950, the succession to the Bruneian throne was seamlessly managed with British support for his brother Omar Ali Saifuddien III, but MacBryan, claiming to have been appointed political adviser by the late Sultan, attempted to assert himself in Brunei's affairs, only to be thwarted by British intervention. In mid-1950, MacBryan, posing as Ahmad Tajuddin's envoy, tried to negotiate with Standard Oil and alert the United States about perceived injustices in Brunei's treaties with Britain, while also claiming the Sultan's daughter had a right to the throne similar to British monarchs, but his claims were exposed as fraudulent by British officials led by Malcolm MacDonald, who then supported Omar Ali Saifuddien III to maintain good relations with Britain.\nEarly life\nBorn on 9 January 1902, in Wiltshire, Gerard Truman Magill MacBryan was the youngest of Eveline Ada Truman and Dr. Henry Crawford MacBryan's five sons. His father was an Irish physician who ran the first private mental health facility in England, located at Box, close to Bath. In the meantime, his mother passed away the moment he was born. He went to school at Burnham-on-Sea, where he was once charged with theft. Later, he enrolled at a naval training college, but he pretended to be colour-blind in order to pass his military entrance exams. His father's friend Henry Deshon encouraged him to apply for a cadetship in the Sarawak Service.\nSarawak\nService to the White Rajahs\nMacBryan joined the Straits Civil Service's Sarawak administration in 1920 when he was eighteen years old, but word soon got around about his unstable nature. Robert Payne and Sylvia Brett both kept notes on his strange behaviour; Sylvia related how he would have wild shooting sprees into the night because he would have hallucinations of attacks on his bungalow. The \"madman\" Payne referred to was MacBryan, who reportedly had manic episodes, including appearing naked at a party believing he was invisible, acting like a dog, and stealing from shops and alms-boxes.\nMacBryan spent the first decade of his career in Sarawak, serving as Rajah Charles Vyner Brooke's Private Secretary in the late 1920s. His first posting as a government cadet in Limbang in 1920 introduced him to Bruneian Sultanate, where he built strong connections and gained insights into the Sultanate's inner workings. His fluency in Malay, including the noble court dialect, helped him navigate Brunei's aristocratic circles and understand the challenges of the declining Sultanate. He suffered from manic episodes, but he stayed in Sarawak because of his strong friendship with Brooke, who called him \"wonderful, but nuts.\" Speaking Malay fluently and being well-liked by both Dayak and Malay people, he assisted in the negotiation of a peace treaty between the Kayans and Ibans in 1924. Realising his brilliance and aptitude, Brooke gave him the moniker \"Baron\" in honour of the eccentric Baron von Munchausen. According to historian Bob Reece, he was an accomplished politician who had an understanding of the Rajah's thinking. As such, Brooke found him to be beneficial in making judgments on his behalf.\nIn June of the following year, he went to witness the formal investiture of Sultan Muhammad Jamalul Alam II with the K.C.M.G. by Sir Laurence Guillemard, the Governor of the Straits Settlements at the time, along with F. F. Boult, the Resident of the Fifth Division. In order to finance the education of Sarawak's European officers' offspring, he convinced Brooke to establish the Rajah of Sarawak Fund in 1930 while he was in London for a Colonial Office Conference. His scheme was foiled, nevertheless, by the Colonial Office, which prepared a deed limiting benefits to children of pure European blood in all Colonial Services, not just the Sarawak Service.\nHowever, MacBryan was later banned from the region for nearly ten years due to various misdemeanours. He attempted to return to Sarawak in 1935 when he married a Kuching Malay woman, Sa'erah binte Abdul Kadir, in Singapore using Islamic customs. He declared that he had made the hajj to Mecca, returning with the name Haji Abdul Rahman and wearing white Arabian robes that King Ibn Saud had supposedly given him. But the native datu fiercely objected to his being in Sarawak, so he and his wife had to depart for London. There, he gained experie",

During the late 1950s, the house was bought by Dr. Irvin Murnane Cederlind and his wife Dorothy Jane Eldridge In 1961, a two car garage was added to the house and the bathroom was remodeled by Cederlind. By 1967 the house was occupied by Homer and Janet Weiner. Homer was an art professor at Western Washington University. In August of the same year, a small fire damaged the roof of the home. In 1969, Frances Bacon expressed her support of the house becoming a group home for boys. There was some pushback from the community against establishing the group home due to concerns about crime.\nIn 1972, the house became a court-appointed house for delinquent boys run by the Archdiocese of Seattle branch of the Catholic Church. The house had the capacity to hold 10 boys between the ages of 12 and 18. The Archdiocese spent about $25,000 repairing the house by 1978. The average stay at the house for each boy was about 9 months, with many returning home or entering foster care after their stay. By 1988, the house was the last remaining house for abused and neglected children in Whatcom County. Reason for closure was cited as financial losses, concerns over safety, and increasingly complicated psychiatric cases with the children referred to he home. On closure, there were 8 children who lived at the home. The house closed in 1990.\nThe house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 21, 1974. The house became a private residence in the 1990s and remains that way to current day.\n",

For the Department of Water and Power Headquarters, see John Ferraro Building.\nLankershim Arts Center, also known as the Department of Water and Power Building, is an art center and historic building located at 5108 Lankershim Boulevard in the NoHo Arts District in North Hollywood, California. Originally built for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the building has since been adapted into a performing arts and gallery space. It was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1980.\nHistory\nThe Department of Water and Power Building was designed by Charles S. Lee in the Streamline Moderne style in 1939. Designed to be light and flamboyant, the building was originally a neighborhood administration office for the Department of Water and Power, and was built when the organization believed their buildings should be monumental symbols of a benevolent government role in daily life.\nThe building was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1980 and it was refurbished in 1990, after which it became the Lankershim Art Center, a gallery and theater space that features 493 square feet (45.8\u00a0m2) of gallery/performance space, a 367 square feet (34.1\u00a0m2) dance floor, and a 364 square feet (33.8\u00a0m2) 44-seat theater.

    "Television station in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\nTV Di\u00e1rio (channel 19) is a Brazilian television station based in Mogi das Cruzes, a city in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, serving as an affiliate of TV Globo for the Alto Tiet\u00ea Region. It is owned by locally based Grupo Di\u00e1rio de Mogi, also responsible for the newspaper O Di\u00e1rio de Mogi, as its sole broadcasting property and its coverage covers 10 municipalities in the S\u00e3o Paulo metropolitan region. Its studios are located in the C\u00e9sar de Sousa district and its transmission antenna is at the top of the Serra do Itapeti.\nHistory\nThe owners of the newspaper O Di\u00e1rio de Mogi won the concession granted by the Ministry of Communications. The station's concession followed the new rules of minimum hours for local programming established in the bidding notices, and had a greater number of local/regional programs than the other Rede Globo affiliates in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, and even the affiliates spread throughout Brazil.\nThe station went on air on May 1, 2000, through UHF channel 14 (later in the same year moving to channel 38), replacing the Rede Globo S\u00e3o Paulo retransmitters in the Alto Tiet\u00ea region. At the time, the population was 1.2 million inhabitants, concentrated in cities such as Suzano (where a unit with a studio and a permanent journalism team was set up), Itaquaquecetuba, Ferraz de Vasconcelos and Po\u00e1. There are 1.6 million potential viewers, 539 thousand households with TV and a CPI of 0.824%.\nOn May 15, 2008, exactly 15 days after the station's 8th anniversary, reporter Edson Ferraz suffered a gunshot attack on the street in the Rodeio neighborhood, in the C\u00e9sar de Sousa district, in Mogi das Cruzes. The reporter was returning alone from the capital of S\u00e3o Paulo when a car surrounded the broadcaster's vehicle and fired two shots at the professional, who escaped without injury. The police's suspicion is that the attack is a reprisal for the report that Edson Ferraz made for SPTV in the Capital, about the complaint that the State Public Prosecutor's Office made against 13 investigators from Garra de Mogi das Cruzes, suspected of involvement in a bribery scheme of illegal businesses such as car dismantling, gambling houses and prostitution in the city and in Suzano.\nIn 2013, the station's branch was opened in the city of Suzano. With its own commercial and journalism team, as well as a studio for presenting local newspapers, TV Di\u00e1rio's presence in the city and throughout the region was further intensified.\nTechnical information\nTV Di\u00e1rio started its digital broadcasts in 2010, through physical channel 52. On June 4, 2018, per a decision taken by ANATEL, its physical channel moved to channel 19. The station's local programs converted to widescreen on March 14, 2022, marking this the last Globo station in overall to switch to that format for its local programs as when the station launched its HDTV signal in 2010, only network programming was shown in widescreen.\nAnalog-to-digital conversion\nBased on the federal decree transitioning Brazilian TV stations from analog to digital signals, TV Di\u00e1rio ceased broadcasting on UHF channel 38 on March 29, 2017, the same day as the end of analog television in the S\u00e3o Paulo metropolitan area, following the official ANATEL roadmap.\nPrograms\nBesides relaying TV Globo's national programming, currently TV Di\u00e1rio produces and airs the following programs:\nBom Dia Di\u00e1rio: Morning news, with William Tanida;\nDi\u00e1rio TV 1.\u00aa edi\u00e7\u00e3o: News, with Mirielly de Castro;\nDi\u00e1rio TV 2.\u00aa edi\u00e7\u00e3o: News, with Robson Moreira;\nCompartilha: Variety, with Filipe Almeida;\n+ Di\u00e1rio: Magazine program, with J\u00e9ssica Le\u00e3o;\nDi\u00e1rio Comunidade: Journalistic program, with Janaina Rodrigues;\nRelayed from TV Globo S\u00e3o Paulo\nBom Dia S\u00e3o Paulo: Morning news, with Rodrigo Bocardi;\nGlobo Esporte SP: Sports news, with Felipe Andreoli;\nFutebol na Globo: Soccer matches from the teams of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo\nOvernight, to comply with the minimum schedule stipulated by law, TV Di\u00e1rio airs Faixa da Madrugada, which is made up of repeats of news and other productions of the station, pre-empting Sess\u00e3o Com\u00e9dia na Madruga on weekdays, Coruj\u00e3o on Saturdays and Cinema\u00e7o on Sundays.

    "RNLI Lifeboat station in Argyll and Bute, Scotland\nIslay Lifeboat Station is located in the harbour village of Port Askaig, which sits on the Sound of Islay, in the north east corner of the Isle of Islay, off the north-west coast of Scotland.\nA lifeboat was first placed at Port Askaig by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1934.\nThe station currently operates a Severn-class All-weather lifeboat, 17-08 Helmut Schroder of Dunlossit II (ON 1219), on station since 1997.\nHistory\nOn 12 March 1934, 38-foot motor-lifeboat Frederick H. Pilley (ON 657) set out from Falmouth on a 10-day, 471 mile journey, to her new station. Built in 1920, she was a 14-year-old boat, having previously served the The Lizard, with a record of 120 lives saved. On board with Commander J. M. Upton, R.D., R.N.R., Inspector of Life-boats for the Irish District, was Ralph Scott (travelling mechanic), and four experienced fishermen who were to form a crew. These were Peter McPhee (coxswain), Hugh Buie (second coxswain), A. McPhee (motor mechanic) and J. McDougall, none of which had ever been at sea on a lifeboat. The boat stopped at Penzance, Padstow, and Angle; before crossing the Irish Sea to Rosslare Harbour, and then up the coast via Kingstown, Donaghadee and Larne. Particularly bad weather was encountered during the first part of the journey, arriving in both Angle and Rosslare in a full gale. Commander J. M. Upton said that this was the worst passage he had undertaken on a lifeboat, but it did highlight the qualities of the boat, giving confidence to the new crew. An unscheduled stop was made at Larne, due to the wind and strong tidal current preventing the boat from making headway. The final call was at Port Ellen, before arriving at her new home on the Isle of Islay, Port Askaig Lifeboat Station, on 21 March 1934.\nFrederick H. Pilley (ON 657) had been placed on station temporarily, to allow for the construction of a new lifeboat for Port Askaig. The 45ft 6in Watson-class lifeboat Charlotte Elizabeth (ON 774) arrived in Port Askaig in 1935.\nIn 1947, Charlotte Elizabeth was relocated to Port Ellen on Islay, due to crewing difficulties. But in 1948, the station at Port Askaig was reopened, and renamed Islay Lifeboat Station.\nCoxswain Duncan McNeill would receive a gift of \u00a310 in 1950, an annual award provided by Mrs G. M. Porter of Felixstowe, for the bravest deed of the year by a member of lifeboat crew. At 16:45 on the 12 April 1950, the lifeboat station received reports of a World War II Mine floating south through the Sound of Islay. With his own small boat in tow, Coxswain McNeill launched the relief lifeboat  Manchester and Salford (ON 689), located the mine, and then set out in his own boat. With the lifeboat 1\u20444\u00a0mi (0.40\u00a0km) away, he secured a rope to the mine, which was then towed to shore, out of danger to shipping.\nThe 31 January 1953 was a day of disasters. The Princess Victoria, one of the earliest roll-on/roll-off car ferries sank in the North Channel with the loss of 133 lives. On the same day, the Islay lifeboat was launched at 17:45 into a full north-north-east gale, to the aid of a vessel 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km) south of Jura, but nothing was found, and the lifeboat returned at 22:30. Soon afterwards, the boat was called again, this time to the fishing trawler Michael Griffiths. On passage, two of the crew, Second Coxswain A. McNeill, and Assistant Mechanic John MacTaggart, headed to the engine-room to dry their clothes. Overcome by fumes, both men died. At Oban Sheriff Court on 6 March 1953, Mr. R. Johnston Macdonald returned a formal verdict of \"death by poisoning by carbon monoxide fumes\". All 15 crew of the Michael Griffiths were also lost.\nIn hurricane conditions on 27 October 1959, the Charlotte Elizabeth (ON 774) was launched to the aid of the motor fishing vessel May, aground on a reef near the Black Rocks Buoy. Floating a line to the vessel, four men were taken off by breeches buoy. Coxswain James Gillies was awarded the RNLI Bronze Medal.\nThe 47ft Watson-class lifeboat Francis W. Wotherspoon of Paisley was withdrawn in 1979, and replaced by a Thames-class lifeboat. The Thames class was an RNLI development of the Waveney-class lifeboats, and had a 50 feet (15\u00a0m) steel hull, powered by a pair of 390 horsepower (290\u00a0kW) General Motors diesel engines. Initially six were ordered, but the project was cancelled with the development of the Arun-class lifeboat, and only two were constructed at Brooke Marine of Lowestoft. Built in 1976, 50-002 was initially used for trials, before being assigned to Islay. A donation from the Schroder Charity Trust funded the boat. At a ceremony in Port Askaig on Saturday 28 July, attended by over 1000 islanders and guests, Bruno L. Schroder of the Dunlossit estate Islay, and son of the late Helmut Schroder, formally handed over the boat to the RNLI. It was then named Helmut Schroder of Dunlossit (ON 1032).\nOn Sunday 18 November 1979, both the Islay lifeboat, 50-002 Helmut Schroder",
    "Molla G\u00fcr\u00e2ni was a 15th-century Ottoman administrator and mufti.\nEarly life\nG\u00fcr\u00e2ni was born on August 28, 1406, or in 1410 or in 1411, in a place called G\u00fbr\u00e2n in Esfarayen or in Shahrizor or near Diyarbekir or near Halabja, and given the name \u015eemseddin Ahmed b. \u0130sm\u00e2il or \u015eerefeddin or \u015eeh\u00e2beddin. He was later also given the honorific moll\u00e2 or mevl\u00e2n\u00e2 and became known by the nisba G\u00fcr\u00e2n\u00ee, \u015eehrizor\u00ee, Hemed\u00e2n\u00ee, Tebr\u00eez\u00ee,  K\u00e2hir\u00ee, or R\u00fbm\u00ee, thus his usual appellation Molla G\u00fcr\u00e2ni. He may have been of Kurdish ancestry.\nHe studied qira'at, kalam, tafsir, nahw (Arabic syntax), and fiqh in Baghdad and Arabic language and literature in Hasankeyf. At 17, he moved on to study in Damascus for five years and then to Jerusalem. After that, he moved on to Cairo, where he studied hadith, qira'at, tafsir, and fiqh, and received his ijazah from Ibn Hajar.\nMamluk career\nG\u00fcr\u00e2ni was appointed mudarris of fiqh at the Barquq Madrasa in Cairo and participated in scholarly assemblies in the court of Mamluk Sultan Sayf al-Din Jaqmaq, although in 1440 after a dispute with another scholar, he was found guilty of insulting the scholar's ancestors, sentenced to 80 blows with a rod (de\u011fnek), removed from his madrasa position, and exiled to Damascus.\nOttoman career\nAround the time of his punishment, either in Aleppo or Cairo, G\u00fcr\u00e2ni met Ottoman scholar Molla Yeg\u00e2n, who brought him to Sultan Murad II; the sultan appointed him mudarris first in the Kapl\u0131ca Madrasa in Bursa and then in the Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Madrasa. At some point, he changed from the Shafi'i school of jurisprudence to the Hanbali school. In 1443 he was appointed teacher (hoca) to Murad's son Mehmet, and he probably remained with Mehmed when Murad abdicated in favor of Mehmed in 1444 and when Murad returned to the throne in 1446.\nAfter Murad's death in 1451, Mehmed again became sultan and offered him a position as vizier, which he refused, and then a position as kazasker, which he accepted. He was part of Mehmed's council during the conquest of Constantinople and afterward wrote the account of events, the fetihn\u00e2me that was sent to the Mamluk sultan.\nHe was dismissed as kazasker in 1455 for acting too independently and sent to Bursa as qadi and as administrator (m\u00fctevelli) of evkaf. He was dismissed from this post for tearing up a firman he considered contrary to Sharia and beating its bearer. He then went on hajj, passing through Aleppo, Damascus, and Jerusalem on the way, and returning to Istanbul in 1458. At that time he was again appointed qadi in Bursa.\nIn 1480 he was appointed mufti of Istanbul or Shaykh al-Isl\u0101m, a position he held till his death, serving under both Mehmed II and Bayezid II. He was said to have a modest but dignified personality and superior morality, to be uncompromising in knowledge, and to be unhesitant in expressing his opinions.\nHe died in 1488, in Istanbul, and was buried in the Aksaray neighborhood of Istanbul or near Y\u00fcksek Kald\u0131r\u0131m in Karak\u00f6y, Istanbul.\nLegacy\nG\u00fcr\u00e2ni built several institutions in Istanbul, including a mosque in \u00c7apa; small mosques (mescit) in Galata, Mercan, and Vefa; a hadith school (d\u00e2r\u00fclhad\u00ees) in Vefa; elementary schools in \u00c7apa, Galata, and Vefa; a hammam in Mercan; and a han in Bah\u00e7ekap\u0131. Of these, only the small mosque in Mercan was still in existence in the 1970s. He also had a Byzantine church converted into a mosque, now known as the Molla G\u00fcrani Mosque.\nThe neighborhood surrounding G\u00fcr\u00e2ni's mosque in \u00c7apa, Istanbul, became known as the Molla G\u00fcr\u00e2ni neighborhood and is still known as that even though the mosque burned in 1917.\nG\u00fcr\u00e2ni's descendant, Burhanedd\u00een \u0130br\u00e2h\u00eem El-Gur\u00e2n\u00ee (1616/17-1697), was the author of more than 100 scholarly works.\nThe G\u00fcran family of the Ba\u011flar district of Diyarbak\u0131r claims to be descended from G\u00fcr\u00e2ni.\n",

    "Finnish cargo and passenger ship, museum\nSteam schooner Salama is a Finnish cargo and passenger ship that sank in 1898, was raised in 1971, and is now open to the public as a museum ship. The word \"salama\" is Finnish for lightning.\nThe vessel was built in 1874 by the Vyborg machine shop in the Grand Duchy of Finland for the Savonlinnan H\u00f6yrylaiva Osakeyhti\u00f6 (Savonlinna steam ship company). She was originally equipped with both a steam engine and auxiliary sails. She mainly operated on inland waterways of lake Saimaa and coastal waters of the Gulf of Finland on the route Joensuu - Savonlinna - Lappeenranta - Vyborg - Saint Petersburg carrying both cargo and passengers. In addition, the ship made a number of voyages across the Baltic Sea to L\u00fcbeck. The vessel was built for only 12 passengers, but after her 1883  refit, she could carry 60 people in a lounge and dining room.\nOn the night of 13 September 1898, SS Salama was traversing a narrow waterway near Puumala while returning from Saint Petersburg towards Savonlinna when she collided with the passenger ship SS Ilmari. The collision tore a hole in the starboard side of Salama's hull, and she sank half an hour later with her cargo of rye.  The tugboat Ahkera happened to be nearby and managed to rescue all of Salama's passengers and crew.\nIn 1970, the shipwreck was discovered by chance when Salama's mast was caught in a passing tugboat's wire. In the summer of 1971, 73 years after the sinking, the wreck was raised in a project funded by the forest industry company Enso-Gutzeit. Having been well preserved by the freshwater conditions, SS Salama was restored and the hole in her hull was repaired. In 1985, she was donated to the City of Savonlinna to be opened as a museum ship. As of 2024, she is afloat, but as her steam engine has not been restored, she is permanently moored outside the Savonlinna Museum in Riihisaari. The tugboat SS Ahkera that rescued her passengers during her sinking can be seen at the same pier.\nNotes\n",
    "1605 naval battle\nThe Battle of the Channel was a 1605 naval engagement in the English Channel between a Spanish transport fleet captained by Pedro de Zubiaur and the Dutch armada under Willem de Zoete. The Spanish fleet carried a tercio under Pedro de Sarmiento for the Eighty Years' War, which the Dutch attempted to intercept and destroy. Zubiaur managed to break through overwhelming numerical superiority with a few of his ships and take refuge in Dover, England. However, many of the troops he transported were captured by the Dutch or died in England. The battle was the last deployment of Zubiaur, who died in Dover from his wounds, after which the remaining troops reached their destination in Dunkirk in English ships.\nBackground\nOn May 24, 1605, Zubiaur sailed off from Lisbon at the head of eight galleons and two frigates, with the mission to carry 2400 tercio soldiers under maestre de campo Pedro de Sarmiento to Dunkirk. On their way through the English Channel, they were intercepted by an enormous 80-ship fleet of Dutch admiral Willem de Zoete. Learning about Willem's presence, four additional Spanish galleons were sent from Dunkirk to link with Zubiaur and arrived in time.\nBattle\nWitnessing the disproportion of strengths, Zubiaur ordered the Spanish carriers to head for the allied English port of Dover while he performed a diversionary attack with his own flagship and several other ships readied to fight. Zubiaur and his vessels faced the first 18 Dutch ships in battle for more than a day, sinking multiple enemy ships and dismasting others, which allowed them to follow the rest of the fleet to Dover. Willem attempted to give chase, but the local cannons forced him to withdraw. In exchange for the damage inflicted, Zubiaur had lost two galleons and was wounded himself.\nAftermath\nZubiaur received medical attention in Dover, but he died of his wounds on August 2, 1605. However, his leadership had been instrumental to save the rest of the fleet. Resuming the travel and crossing the Strait of Dover proved difficult for the rest of the fleet, which was entertained by diplomatic trouble with King James VI and I and the presence of Dutch ships, but after finally wintering in England, they crossed to Dunkirk in December. The troops he had transported who were still alive were carried to Flanders in English ships.\n",

    "\nOn August 8, 2021, jihadists from Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin ambushed Burkinabe forces in Dounkoun, Toeni Department, Burkina Faso, killing twelve soldiers.\nBackground\nSince 2015, north and northeastern Burkina Faso has been embroiled in an insurgency by the Mali-based Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin, the Niger-based Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, and the homegrown Burkinabe Ansarul Islam. The area of Toeni Department in northwest Burkina Faso, where Dounkoun is located, is an hotspot of JNIM activity, with a bus bombing in the area killing fourteen civilians. Four days before the Dounkoun ambush, jihadists from the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara launched several coordinated attacks against civilians and soldiers in Oudalan Province.\nAmbush\nAt around 3pm, a convoy escorting Burkinabe soldiers and troops from the elite Rapid Action Group for Surveillance and Intervention (GARSI) were ambushed by JNIM fighters near the village of Dounkoun. Several vehicles were destroyed and others were captured by JNIM. The ambush was in retaliation for the killing of JNIM commander Sidibe Ousmane and religious trainer Bande Amadou. Ousmane and Amadou had been killed the day prior by Burkinabe forces between Diamasso and Bouni in Kossi Province.\nTwelve Burkinabe soldiers were killed in the ambush at Dounkoun and eight others were injured.

    "Mansion in George Town, Penang, Malaysia\nWoodville is a mansion in George Town within the Malaysian state of Penang. Built in 1925, the building is situated at Northam Road within the city's Central Business District. It was originally the residence of Chinese tycoon Lim Lean Teng. The building is distinguishable from other mansions along the road due to the addition of a dome with a cupola, hastily designed by British architect Joseph Charles Miller. \nHistory\nThe mansion was designed by architect Joseph Charles Miller in 1925. Commissioned by Chinese businessman Lim Lean Teng, the building incorporates a canopy clas in oyster glass and a dome \u2013 features that had been inspired by the original HSBC Building at Beach Street. Lim believed that these features would set his mansion apart from others along Northam Road, which was commonly referred to as the \"Millionaire's Row\" at the time.

    "Television station in Sergipe, Brazil\nTV Atalaia (channel 6) is a Brazilian television station based in Aracaju, capital of the state of Sergipe, serving as an affiliate of the Record television network for the entire state. It is the flagship broadcast property of the locally based Sistema Atalaia de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o, a company of Brazilian politician and businessman Walter Franco, alongside the radio stations Transam\u00e9rica Aracaju, NovaBrasil FM Aracaju, Cidade 99 FM de Sim\u00e3o Dias and the A8 portal.\nHistory\nTV Atalaia emerged as an initiative of the business group of the then senator Augusto Franco, which among other companies, had the former R\u00e1dio Atalaia (Aracaju), founded in 1969. In 1972, Atalaia won a competition opened by the Ministry of Communications and won the concession of Aracaju's second television channel, winning the proposals presented by radio stations Cultura (from the Archdiocese of Aracaju) and Liberdade (then belonging to former senator Albino Silva da Fonseca).\nWork on assembling the structure and equipment of the station, which was then called TV 31 de Mar\u00e7o, began in January 1974, on an old site close to Colina de Santo Ant\u00f4nio, one of the highest points in Aracaju, where it was built the transmission tower. Atalaia's plans were to go live, in an experimental phase, on October 19th of the same year. However, in the early hours of the 15th, a Tuesday, four days before the first broadcast, a fire started in the technical part and destroyed part of the equipment, in addition to the main studio. The cause, according to police investigations at the time, was a short circuit in the air conditioning system. The incident resulted in a loss of Cz$5 million (in values at the time) and completely delayed the station's assembly roadmap.\nThe struggle and efforts increased, until the broadcaster, now called TV Atalaia, was founded on May 17, 1975, as an affiliate of Rede Tupi. Channel 8 VHF in Aracaju initially designed test bars, when at noon on its founding date, a video appeared with radio host Carlos Mota introducing the station. It was the first TV in the North-Northeast to broadcast its programming entirely in color, and its equipment, purchased to replace what was destroyed in the fire the previous year, made TV Atalaia one of the most modern and well-equipped in the region.\nWhen it went on air, after the celebration of a mass, it broadcast local programming that marked an era, such as S\u00e1bado Geral, which had prominent presenters such as Reinaldo Moura, Luiz Trindade, Hilton Lopes and Jo\u00e3o de Barros. Some of its main programs launched at this time were Reporter 8 and Nosso Mundo Infantil.\nWith the extinction of Rede Tupi in 1980, the station began broadcasting Rede Bandeirantes programming. It was the first station in Sergipe to defend Diretas J\u00e1 in 1984. In 1986, it left Rede Bandeirantes and became affiliated with SBT.\nOn June 28, 2006, representatives from TV Atalaia and Rede Record signed the affiliation contract, in a ceremony with a cocktail party held at the Quality Hotel, in Aracaju. On July 17, TV Atalaia began broadcasting Record programming, after 20 years as an affiliate of SBT.\nThe reason for the change to a new network is due to SBT's lack of dedication to journalism (already evident in recent years), the constant changes in schedules that harmed its programming, aggravated by the sudden change of the soap opera Rebelde to the same time as local television news, leading the broadcaster to decide not to renew the contract, when the station affiliated with Record. In the same week, TV Paju\u00e7ara in Macei\u00f3, Alagoas also left the network, on June 23.\nOn March 17, 2011, Aracaju's anniversary, the Atalaia Communication System brings news to the state: Atalaia FM is now called Megga FM and TV Atalaia debuts its new news program, Sergipe Not\u00edcias, shown on the mornings of both stations. On July 4, TV Atalaia premiered Gr\u00e1vidos, the first television series entirely recorded in the state, with 20 chapters. On September 5, the broadcaster relaunches the program Tudo a Ver Sergipe, a local version of the program of the same name shown by Record, the attraction combines journalism with entertainment through the best stories from TV Atalaia. One of the tables is similar to the national edition, the Top 10, this one with videos sent by viewers.\nOn May 17, 2012, the broadcaster celebrated its 37th anniversary and made changes to its news programs, removing the traditional news bench. On August 15, TV Atalaia opened the first branch of a television station in the state of Sergipe, in the city of Itabaiana.\nIn April 2014, the broadcaster decided to invest heavily in sports again. In this way, Atalaia Esporte debuted. The program is shown at noon and is presented by journalist L\u00edlian Fonseca. With the change, Jornal do Estado 1st Edition started to be shown at quarter past noon. The broadcaster also made changes to the scenarios of all news programs. On December 23, the broadcaster closed the Itabaian",

    "Kirkwall was a Parliamentary Burgh that represented Kirkwall, Orkney in two successive District of Burghs, Tain and Wick. It tended to be affected by the same influential landowners who controlled the Orkney and Shetland seat, although as it was one of a number of mainland Burghs, this influence was not always decisive for choosing the MP\nFormation\nBefore Union, Kirkwall returned one Burgh commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland.\nThe Act of Union in 1708 meant a reduction in Scotland's representation in Parliament.  Kirkwall was combined into a district of Burghs with the Highland burghs of Dingwall, Dornoch, Tain and Wick to form the Tain Burghs together sending one MP to the House of Commons.  Under this arrangement the councilmen of Kirkwall would elect a Commissioner who would go to where the election was held, which rotated between the Burghs, and would cast their votes with other commissioners.\nInfluence\nFrom the Act of Union to 1766 it was under the influence of the Earls of Morton although in 1766 James Douglas the Fourteenth Earl, sold the Morton holdings in Orkney, and so the influence in Kirkwall to the government contractor Sir Lawrence Dundas and his son Thomas Dundas retained influence over the borough until the end of the century when it passed to the local radical (and later MP for Orkney and Shetland) Malcolm Laing, although William Honyman also had some influence.\nCharles James Fox\nThe most prominent English political figure, to represent a Scottish constituency in the 18th century, was the leading Whig Charles James Fox. In the 1784 general election, Fox sought re-election for the Westminster constituency. The election was close and political opponents challenged Fox's election. As Westminster had the largest electorate of any English borough, the scrutiny of votes (to check that each voter had been legally qualified to participate in the election) was thought likely to take a long time. \nTo avoid Fox being out of Parliament, until the Westminster election petition was decided, his friend and political ally Thomas Dundas arranged for him to become member for Tain Burghs. This involved becoming a burgess of Kirkwall in 1784 However although the Dundas family had a lot of influence over the Kirkwall corporation, the election of Kirkwall's delegate was sharply contested with Dundas's allies needing to exclude ex-officio Coporation members who were opponents of the Dundas interest.  The election was held in Kirkwall, and Kirkwall was one of the three out of five Commissioners to vote for Fox.  Fox was not present either for the election or for becoming a Burgess, but sent a portrait as a gift to Kirkwall.\nFox was ridiculed for what was seen as using feudal tactics to stay in Parliament. It took until 1786 for Fox to be confirmed as a duly elected MP for Westminster. Fox then chose to represent his English constituency and Tain became vacant.\nWick Burghs\nAfter the 1832 Reform Act Kirkwall became part of Wick Burghs, with the same towns as Tain Burghs but with the addition of Cromarty.  The system of Commissioners was lost and the franchise was widened so that the votes in each Burgh were added up.\nIn 1918, the Wick Burghs were abolished and Kirkwall was merged into the county constituency of Orkney and Shetland.\n",
    "\nThe Twin Sisters was an early steam locomotive, built for use during the construction of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. It was distinctive for its use of two vertical boilers, with a pair of separate chimneys, leading to its name.\nEarlier locomotives for the construction of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway\nThe deep sandstone cutting at Olive Mount\nBy 1828 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway was under construction and their first steam locomotive had already been supplied to assist with this. This was one of the first railways built outside the coal-producing areas and so the local landowners were hostile to railways generally and particularly to any smoke they produced. The enabling Act of Parliament for the Liverpol and Manchester Railway required that locomotives should not produce smoke.\nThis first locomotive was described as the Liverpool Travelling Engine in Robert Stephenson's drawings, but would later become known as the Lancashire Witch. It used a new boiler design to reduce smoke: this burned coke rather than coal, and also had twin furnaces. These were fired sequentially, an idea that would later be patented and used in the Lancashire stationary boiler. The new boiler was the idea of Henry Booth, who had approached the L&M board in April 1827 with his ideas for coke-burning. Although Booth was the company secretary and treasurer of the L&M, he was also an inventive engineer and collaborated closely with the Stephensons, particularly on developments in boilers.\nThe Travelling Engine was ordered on 7 January 1828 and had only been working for a few months when on 21 April it was decided to transfer it to the Bolton and Leigh Railway, which was to be opened in June.\nA second engine as a replacement, similar to the first, was being built in Stephenson's works during July 1828, when it was seen by visitors including Horatio Allen of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company and the French engineers Coste and Perdonnet, who wrote one of the few contemporary engineering descriptions of it. The locomotive, later known as the Pride of Newcastle, was diverted to the DHC and shipped in October 1828.\nA further locomotive was discussed on 16 March 1829 and arrived in mid-July. The intention was to use it to remove spoil from the 70\u00a0ft deep Olive Mount cutting to the embankment constructed at Broad Green.\nDesign\nThe Liverpool and Manchester Railway were required to ensure that the engines did not produce smoke. This was the first railway where this was a formal requirement, although experiments had already taken place to reduce the smoke from the boilers of stationary engines. Combustion engineering was in its infancy but it was already recognised that coal burned in two stages: gases were released from the coal, which gases could then be burned, and the solid coke matter remaining could also be burned in a separate process. Techniques used to achieve this could either involve gasification of the coal in situ in the furnace, or coking of the coal in a separate furnace beforehand.\nA drawback to the use of coke was that the fire required a stronger blast on it, produced either by bellows, a fan or the blastpipe, or in Stephenson's term, the 'exarsting pipe'. Twin Sisters was designed from the outset to burn coke, this led to an alternative name for it as the Liverpool Coke Engine.\nStephenson's Lancashire Witch used twin furnaces to increase the heating surface area within the same length of boiler barrel, but the reason for Twin Sister's twin boilers is unclear; whether it was to do likewise, or simply because it was first built and tested as a smaller boiler, then duplicated. Booth's first attempt at a multitubular boiler was built at Laird's in Birkenhead and shipped to Newcastle, where Stephenson built a second and used them both on the one locomotive.\nThe rest of the design was conventional for a Stephenson locomotive of this time, with a number of features which had first appeared on Lancashire Witch. The overall weight of the Twin Sisters is not recorded, but may have been more than Lancashire Witch, indicated by the use of six wheels rather than four. These wheels were wooden, with wrought iron tyres, and all were sprung. Two inclined cylinders, of the same size and pattern as Witch, drove the end wheels, and thus through coupling rods to the others. There was a facility in the valve gear for expansive working.\nWater was supplied pre-heated by large 'railway kettles' at stations alongside the track.  This was then carried in a wooden barrel on the engine's tender and supplied to the boiler by a pump cylinder driven from the engine crosshead.\nService\nFrom mid-1829, Twin Sisters was used successfully for the line's construction.\n\nThe Rainhill Trials were held in October 1829. After this, Rocket was used on the construction of the line. Rocket was used on the Chat Moss section and  Twin Sisters was used near Liverpool.\nThe LMR opened in September 1830. After the opening of the line, Twin Sisters cont",

It has an intersection with Kinosota Access Road (which provides access to both Kinosota and Manitoba House) before going switchbacks as it travels through Reedy Creek, where the highway begins following the coastline of Ebb and Flow Lake. PR\u00a0278 passes through Bacon Ridge before travelling through the Ebb and Flow First Nation, serving as its main thoroughfare. The highway comes to an end shortly thereafter at an intersection with PTH\u00a068 (Northern Woods and Water Route) just south of Eddystone. The entire length of PR\u00a0278 is a paved, two-lane highway.\nMajor intersections\n",
    "Joseph P. Buckley is the president of John E. Reid and Associates, an American company based in Chicago, which trains law enforcement and others in The Reid Technique of Interviewing and Interrogation, which is focused on obtaining confessions.  \nAfter a B.A. degree in English from Catholic Loyola University in 1971, Buckley met John E. Reid socially, and joined his company in 1971. In 1973, Buckley was awarded an MS in \"Detection of Deception\" by Reid College. The college was a short-lived state-approved professional school, based on a six-month polygraph licensing course in Illinois set up by Reid.\nIn 1982, Buckley succeeded Reid as president. Buckley assisted with the third edition of  'Criminal Confessions and Interrogations', known as the Reid Manual. He became the lead author for the fourth and fifth editions, along with Brian Jayne.\nBuckley has trained people in the US government, including the US Office of Research Integrity and the US Food and Drug Administration. He also marketed the techniques to schools and led training courses for educators.\nHis office was directly involved in the original interrogations of Juan Riviera in 1992, eventually resulting in their largest lawsuit settlement as of 2015. Buckley was personally involved in the case against Brendan Dassey in 2007. In response to criticism from Dassey's trial lawyer Mark Fremgen, as shown in a popular documentary, Making a Murderer, Buckley denied that the techniques necessarily cause false confessions especially by youth. Buckley has been accused by professor Steven Drizin, Dassey's postconviction attorney, of not accepting how much the Reid techniques induce false confessions, but Buckley has pointed to examples where he supported clemency, such as the case of Robert Paul Davis.\n",

    "Criminal organization\nThe Principi group, also known as Belivuk-Miljkovi\u0107 clan, founded under the name Janji\u010dari, is a hooligan group of FK Partizan that was accused of organized crime. From a local vandals and hooligans in JSD Partizan's basketball and football matches, it grew into one of the most powerful criminal organizations in the Balkan region. It was founded in Ritopek, a suburban neighbourhood of Belgrade, Serbia. The crimes Principi committed in the span of 5-8 years were extortion, intimidation, kidnapping, torture and mutilation, murder and drug sales.\nFormation\nThe Principi criminal group is linked to Veljko Belivuk and Darko Elez, the mastermind of the criminal underworld in Republika Srpska, and the leader of Elez gang. They \"worked\" together, celebrated the murders of rival mobsters and were on the verge of joining a clan that would rule a large territory of Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Belivuk and Elez had the same boss, Radoje Zvicer, a Montenegrin criminal and a leader of Kava\u010d clan.\nCriminal activities\nBefore Belivuk and his right-hand man, Marko Miljkovi\u0107, Elez was arrested in Belgrade at the end of last year, on December 22. He was accused in Bosnia of at least two murders. Sini\u0161a Mili\u010devi\u0107, nicknamed Tigar, who was brutally murdered in \"sa\u010dekusa\" on June 1, 2018, and according to the same recipe, Milo\u0161 Ostoji\u0107 was killed on January 2, 2019. They were close to \u0110or\u0111e \u017ddrala, known as \u0110oka. Elez's former godfather with whom he has been in conflict for years and they have tried to eliminate each other several times.\nIn a major police operation, in which the DEA and the Serbian police participated, in addition to Belivuk, 18 other people were arrested, who are suspected of having committed several serious crimes, drug trafficking, extortion, blackmail, murder and mutilation of people. Belivuk was arrested at Rudnik, where he allegedly went to burn vehicles used in criminal acts. The police found a bunker and several other rooms that served Belivuk's criminal group at the Partizan Stadium. Drugs and weapons were found, including a sniper rifle. Police also found 15 people in the so-called \"barracks\". \nBelivuk became known to the general public in 2016 after the attack on Bo\u017ea Kumburovi\u0107 and Neboj\u0161a Petrovi\u0107, members of the security of FK Partizan's director Milo\u0161 Vazura. He was sentenced to one year of house arrest without electronic tagging. The media classified Belivuk in the so-called Kava\u010d clan, which has been at war with the \u0160kaljari clan for years.\nMurder of Oliver Ivanovi\u0107\nThis group was accused together with the group around Zvonko Veselinovi\u0107 of participating in the assassination of Oliver Ivanovi\u0107. According to those claims, \"Principi\" were in charge of immediate execution, while logistics were provided by Milan Radoi\u010di\u0107 and everything was organized by Zvonko Veselinovi\u0107. Ljubomir Lainovi\u0107 was the immediate executor, and Aleksandar Gligorijevi\u0107 was the courier. Gligorijevic was later killed in an internal conflict between the Principi group members, and Belivuk was blamed for his murder. Lainovi\u0107 disappeared, and it is speculated that he was brutally tortured and killed by \"skaljarac\" (an opposing clan), two of whose high-ranking members he also killed.\nAftermath of Belivuk's arrest\nAfter the Belivuk's arrest, groups core members completely changed, with Serbian government claiming the group is officially \"tarnished\". Alot of football fanatical supporters and fellow football hooligans claim that the group still operates, but with new leadership. It is alleged that Miljkovi\u0107's cousin is running the clans operations, while Djordje Preli\u0107 is the new leader of the hooligan crew on the south stand since 2022.\nAccording to news letters and police investigations in Serbia, Belivuk and Miljkovi\u0107 are in contact with over 29 Grobari supporters groups in Serbia and Serbian diaspora.

    "Open source, decentralized, mesh network\nMeshtastic is a decentralized wireless off-grid mesh networking LoRa protocol.  The main goal of the project is enabling low-power, long-range communication over unlicensed radio bands. Its designed around exchanging text messages and data in off-grid environments, with potential applications in IoT projects where a decentralized communication system is needed without existing infrastructure.\nMeshtastic uses LoRa peer to peer (p2p), a long-range radio protocol, to form a mesh network by rebroadcasting messages to extend communication reach. Each device can connect with a single phone, enabling messaging in off-grid areas, making it useful for not only messages, but also data transmissions.\nHardware\nMeshtastic uses hardware development boards, like ESP32 and nRF52840, that support LoRa and BLE communication technologies, along with GNSS receivers. These devices enable seamless mobile app connectivity via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, allowing long-range message retransmission across a mesh network using LoRa transceivers. This setup is ideal for developing communicators that don't rely on conventional infrastructure.\nCommercial purpose built Meshtastic boards and kits are available.\nUse cases\nDue to the small form factor of most Meshtastic nodes they can be used in different environments where phone or internet connectivity is limited.\nProposed use cases\nHiking, skiing, paragliding, and other outdoor sports with limited cellular coverage\nApplications requiring open-source GPS communicators (e.g., for glider pilots)\nSecure, long-range group communication without relying on cellular providers\nSee also\nFreedomFi",

She is particularly known for her pioneering research on perfectionism  and its effects on mental health, as well as her leadership in creating and directing the Charlie Waller Institute.\nEarly life and education\nShafran was born in London and attended North London Collegiate School. She studied experimental psychology at St Edmund Hall, Oxford University in 1991. She later obtained her Ph.D. from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience in 1995. Her research, which focussed on obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder, laid the foundation for her later work in clinical psychology. She qualified as a clinical psychologist and was accredited as a CBT therapist. Shafran worked as a Killam Post-Doctoral Fellowship at the University of British Columbia under Jack Rachman. At the time, she was volunteering at Great Ormond Street Hospital, where she became interested in medically unexplained symptoms. She worked alongside Rachel Bryant-Waugh on eating disorders. Her interests in obsessive compulsive disorder and eating disorders motivated her to work with Christopher Fairburn at the University of Oxford.\nCareer\nShafran moved to the University of Reading as the Charlie Waller Chair of Evidence-Based Psychological Treatment, where he founded and directed the Charlie Waller Institute of Evidence-Based Psychological Treatment. In 2013 Shafran was appointed a professor at UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, where she works to improve access to effective psychological therapies and developing new interventions.\nShafran investigates perfectionism, a transdiagnostic factor linked to multiple psychological disorders. Her work has significantly advanced the understanding of how perfectionism contributes to mental health issues, leading to the development of specialised interventions. Her research extends to the mental health of children with chronic physical conditions, the psychological impact of long COVID in young people, and the development of low-intensity psychological treatments for children with epilepsy.\nThe psychological medicine research team Shafran developed and leads at UCL was recognised by the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services for \"The Lucy Project\", a drop-in mental health booth that provided accessible, low-intensity early interventions for young people and their families who were concerned about mental health.

    "Analytic tools in disability studies\nModels of disability are analytic tools in disability studies used to articulate different ways disability is conceptualized by individuals and society broadly. Disability models are useful for understanding disagreements over disability policy, teaching people about ableism, providing disability-responsive health care, and articulating the life experiences of disabled people.\nThe most frequently discussed models are the Medical model of disability, which views disablement as caused by medical disorders; and the Social model of disability which instead views disablement being a result of societal exclusion and discrimination.\nDifferent models can be combined: the medical model is frequently combined with the tragedy model, which views disability as a personal misfortune. Together they form hegemonic views of disability in Western society. Other models exist in direct opposition: the affirmation model, which views disability as a positive form of social identity, is inherently incompatible with the tragedy model.\nDifferent models can be used to describe contrasting disabilities: for example, an autistic person who also has Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome may view their autism through the affirmation model, but their ME/CFS through the medical model.\nDeficit-focused models\nThis category of models centre on different deficits held by disabled people, such as the medical model (a deficit in health) and the rehabilitation model (a deficit in employment).\nDisability as a personal problem\nTragedy model\nThe tragedy model views disability as an individual's misfortune. It is one of the most dominant conceptualizations of disability in Western society. It is generally an individualistic view of disability: each disability is an individual, personal tragedy.\nThe tragedy model is criticized for being ableist; it is associated with the view that living with a disability is worse than death. In the tragedy model, pity is seen as an appropriate response to disability, and used to justify infanticide and other murders of disabled individuals. The tragedy model underlies the supercrip stereotype: if a disabled person is seen as thriving, it is because they did so in spite of their disability.\nCharity model\nThe charity model positions disabled people as pitiable victims, and abled people who provide them with charity as beneficent saviours. This model is frequently combined with other deficit models, such as the tragedy and medical models.\nThis model is criticized by disabled people, as it centres the people who provide the charity, rather than those ostensibly being \"helped\". Disability acts as a means for abled people to feel good about themselves, through providing charity\u2014without regard for whether this charity was wanted or effective.\nMoral and religious models\nThe moral model of disability, also known as the religious model, views disability as a form of punishment for having a deficit in one's morality. In Judeo-Christian tradition, disability may be viewed as a punishment by God for having sinned; in Hindu tradition, disability may be understood as karma for misdeeds committed in one's past life. The moral model is characterized by a distrust of disabled individuals.\nThe moral model is frequently seen regarding disabilities where individuals' actions may have contributed to acquiring the disability, such as AIDS, Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and addiction. Concerning addictions, the moral model is often contrasted with the medical model: addiction is less likely to be seen as a moral failing if one understands it instead as an involuntary, medical condition.\nExpert/Professional models of disability\nIn the expert or professional model of disability, disability is a problem that requires expert professionals to identify and then prescribe a series of interventions. This model produces a power dynamic where an abled, authoritarian service provider acts on behalf of a passive, disabled client. At its extreme, disabled people are given no authority or autonomy over their care or everyday life. It has been described as a fixer/fixee relationship.\nMedical model\nFurther information: Medical model of disability\nThe medical model, also known as the normalization model, views disability as a medical disorder, in need of treatment and ultimately cure. Its endpoint is a world where disability no longer exists, as all disabilities have been \"cured\".\nIn the medical model, physicians are the primary authorities on disability. It is categorized as a deficit model, as it views disability as a defecit in health. It is also categorized as an individualistic model, in that disablement is a result of each individual's body/mind. The medical model has been heavily critiqued by the disability community, as many disabled people do not wish to be cured, and reject the deficit framing.\nRehabilitation and functional limitations models\nThe rehabilitation model, also known as the functional lim",
    "Historic dining car in North Hollywood, California\nPhil's Diner is a historic dining car originally located at 11138 Chandler Boulevard and now at 5230 Lankershim Boulevard in North Hollywood, California. It is believed to be the oldest dining car in California.\nHistory\nThe Phil's Diner building was designed by Charles Amend and is believed to have been built by the Phillips Company in 1926. Originally located alongside the Lankershim Train Depot at 11138 Chandler Boulevard, Phil's Diner opened in the building in 1928.\nHollywood set decorator Casey Hallenbeck purchased the building in 1998, around the same time the diner had closed due to B Line construction. The building was then placed in storage for more than ten years, until it was moved to its new location at 5230 Lankershim Boulevard. Here it was restored under the supervision of Robert Chattel and reopened as Phil's Diner Fresh-n-Fast in 2011, only to close again later that year. The total cost for this undertaking was $1.1 million ($1.49\u00a0million in 2023), about 40% of which was paid for by the City of Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency.\nSince Phil's Diner Fresh-n-Fast's closure, three additional restaurants have opened and closed in the building. A fourth restaurant opened in 2022.\nArchitecture and design\nPhil's Diner was designed using a replica railroad car and features a pink finish and a neon sign. The original sign was stolen, and so a new one was reconstructed based on photographs of the original when the building was restored before reopening in 2011.\n",

    "French white wine from Alsace\nVillage of Katzenthal; Colmar in the background.\nAlsace Grand Cru Floriment is a French white wine produced in the  Haut-Rhin department, in Alsace. It is a part of the communes of Ingersheim and Katzenthal.\nOn the Alsace Wine Route, Floriment is lies at an altitude of between 250 and 280 metres, just east to the cru of Sonnenberg and to the west of the town of Colmar. It is one of the fifty-one grands crus of the Alsace region, each enjoying its own appellation but sharing the same Alsace Grand Cru specifications (with more stringent constraints than for the Alsace appellation in general).\nHistory\nIn 1983, Floriment was not one of the twenty-four lieux-dits selected to become the geographical names of the Alsace Grand Cru appellation. It was added in 1992.\nThere have been some changes since then: the decree of 1 March 1984 regulates the terms vendanges tardives and s\u00e9lection de grains nobles within the appellation and the decree of 24 January 2001 reduces yields and offers the option of modifying the specifications of each denomination (each vintage) after consulting the local wine syndicate.\nIn October 2011, all the grands crus of Alsace went from the status of geographical denominations within the same appellation to that of separate appellations sharing the same specifications.\nEtymology\nThe current name evokes the French words fleur (flower) and mont (mountain) - hence 'mountain of flowers'. This is consistent with its earlier German name, Blumberg, with the same meaning. A family with the similar name Blumenberg was earlier associated with the place.\nGeology\nThe area has a complex marl/calcareous with masses of fallen limestone rock, from the Bathonian and Bajocian periods.\nClimatology\nTo the west, the Vosges protect the hillside from wind and rain. The prevailing westerly winds lose their moisture on the western slopes of the Vosges and reach Alsace in the form of foehn winds, dry and warm. Precipitation is therefore particularly low.\nAs a result, the climate is much drier (Colmar is the driest station in France) and a little warmer (with an average annual temperature 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C higher) than would be expected at this latitude. The climate is continental and dry with warm springs, dry and sunny summers, long autumns and cold winters.\nThe planted area is 21 hectares.\nClimate\nThe appellation shares features with Alsace in general, namely the protection from wind and rain provided by the Vosges mountains. The winds lose their humidity as they pass eastward over the hills, with dry and warm Foehn wind passing over the vignoble, leading to very low rainfall.\nThe nearest meteorological station is the Entzheim station. Values between 1961 and 1990 are as follows:\nGrape varieties\nWines corresponding to the Appellation d'Origine Contr\u00f4l\u00e9e Alsace Grand Cru followed by the geographical name (place name) Altenberg de Bergheim must be produced with the following grape varieties, either as a single variety or as a blend: Riesling, Pinot Gris, Gewurztraminer or one of the Muscats (Muscat Ottonel, Muscat Blanc \u00e0 Petits Grains, or Muscat Rose \u00e0 Petits Grains).\nGewurztraminer (meaning \"aromatic traminer\" in German) is the most cultivated grape variety on the Altenberg. It is a pink grape variety with orange or purple berries. This close relative of Savagnin and Savagnin Rose (called Klevener de Heiligenstein in Alsace) is rather vigorous, produces large yields and gives better results on marl or limestone soils than on granite or schist soils.\nRiesling is not widely grown in Altenberg def Bergheim, but it is dominant in the blends (the grape variety limits mean between 50 and 70% of the surface area of the plots dedicated to the blends). It is a grape variety with late budburst and late ripening, requiring hillsides well exposed to the sun, whose harvests can take place around mid-October. On the other hand, it resists winter frosts well.\nPinot Gris (called Grauburgunder, \"Gray Burgundian\" in German, \"Malvoisie\" in Valais or Pinot Grigio in Italy) is a fragile grape variety and ripens quite early. It comes from a mutation of Pinot Noir and is therefore of Burgundian origin, where it is called \"Pinot Beurot\". It gives better results on soils composed of limestone gravel provided they are well drained thanks to a hillside exposure.\nMuscats are rarely grown, either in the entire Alsace vineyard or in plots classified as Grands Crus. Muscat Blanc \u00e0 Petits Grains, also called \"Muscat d'Alsace\", is originally from Greece; it has been grown in Alsace since at least the beginning of the 16th century. It is rather early. Muscat Ottonel is more recent, discovered in the 19th century in the Loire Valley before arriving in Alsace in the middle of the century. Ottonel is a hybrid of Chasselas, so it ripens even earlier than Muscat d'Alsace.\nCultivation practices\nThe vines are trained high to protect them from frost, with the foliage espaliered; the height of the trellised foliage cannot be less than 0.675 ",
    "Catholic devotion to infant or child Mary\nThe Infant Mary, also known as the Divine Infantess, the Virgin Child, Baby Mary, Little Mary, Little Immaculate Mary, Infant Mary, and as Divina Infantita in Mexico and Maria Bambina in Italy, is a Catholic devotion to the infant or child Mary.\nThe canonical Scriptures make no mention of the birth or infancy of Mary, and the devotion relies primary on Sacred Tradition and private revelation.\nLiturgical Feasts\nLiturgical feasts relating to Mary's infancy and childhood include:\nThe Feast of the Immaculate Conception of Mary (8 December)\nThe Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary (8 September)\nThe Feast of the Holy Name of Mary (12 September)\nThe Feast of the St. Joachim and St. Anne (26 July)\nThe Feast of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary (21 November)\nDevotion Images\nRecreation of the famous Maria Bambina image, from the Church of Maria Bambina, Dogana.\nVarious images of the Divine Infantess have been produced and crowned: Most famously the Maria Bambina of Milan and the Divina Infantita of Mexico.\nHistory\nIn Italy\nDevotion to the Infant Mary in Italy, called Maria Bambina, can be traced back to at least 1007 AD, in the city of Milan. In 1007 the church of Santa Maria Fulcorina (Later Milan Cathedral) was dedicated to the \"mystery of the Nativity of Mary.\" This devotion would further grow in Milan as the church became the Cathedral of Milan, and in 1251 Innocent IV granted in perpetuity a plenary indulgence for those who visit the cathedral on the feast of Mary's Nativity. In the 16th century St. Charles Borromeo would construct the present dome for the cathedral, dedicating it to the birth of Mary. The words Mariae Nascenti, meaning roughly \"to the infant Mary,\" would be inscribed over the main entrance of the cathedral.\nIn the early 18th century, devotion to Maria Bambina experienced a revival due to the donation of a wax simulacrum of the Infant Mary by Sister Isabella Chiara Fornari, a Franciscan from Todi. Between 1720 and 1730, Fornari gifted this artifact to Monsignor Alberico Simonetta. Upon Simonetta's death in 1739, the simulacrum was transferred to the Capuchin Sisters of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Milan. Due to subsequent religious suppressions initiated by Emperor Joseph II and later Napoleon, the Capuchin nuns moved the image through various locations: first to the convent of the Augustinian nuns, then to the Lateran canonesses, and eventually to the parish priest Fr. Luigi Bosisio. In 1842, Bosisio entrusted the image to Sister Teresa Bosio, the superior of the Sisters of Charity of Lovere, a religious institute founded by St. Bartolomea Capitanio. The image was then kept at Ciceri Hospital in Milan, and the nuns began to be referred to as the \u201cSisters of Maria Bambina.\" In 1876 the image of Maria Bambina was brought to the Generalate of the Sisters in Via Santa Sofia where it remains to this day.\nAs the image began to fade, it fell out of use. However, starting in 1884, various miracles began to be associated with the image: Several nuns of the order experienced healing from serious illnesses, and the image itself was miraculously restored, regaining its original flesh tones and coming to resemble what the nuns described as \u201cuna bambina vera,\u201d or a \"real little girl.\" In 1884, the image was dressed in new garments, placed in a new cradle, and moved to the convent chapel. The following year, in 1885, it was carried in a solemn procession to the Motherhouse chapel, attracting many pilgrims who sought the Infant Mary's assistance. Subsequently, an archconfraternity named Maria Bambina and the \u201cLeague of the Innocent\u201d were established. In 1904, the image was ceremoniously crowned, contributing to the spread of devotion to the Infant Mary from Milan throughout Italy.\nIn Mexico\nThe history of the devotion in Mexico dates back to January 6, 1840, in Mexico City. During the feast of the Epiphany Conceptionist Sister Magdalena de San Jos\u00e9 was praying before the manger of the infant Jesus, and asked herself. \u201cWhy is it that the Mother of God is not celebrated at her birth like her Son Jesus is?\" At that moment, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to her in the form of an infant, dressed like a queen and carried by angels, lying down. And Magdalena heard her say to her:  I want to be honored in my childhood, since it is a very forgotten devotion, and I will grant all the graces that are asked of me under this invocation and this image  After this Magdalena dreamed of the Infant Mary two times, moved by such an inexplicable events she began to dedicate herself to spreading devotion to the Infant Mary as \"Divina Infantita,\" or Divine Infantess. Being so zealous for this devotion, she asked permission from her superior, Mother Guadalupe de San Lorenzo, to make a title and image of the apparition she had witnessed and thus fulfill the desire of Infant Mary. However, her superior decided to test if the apparition was a delirium and ignored her, thi",

    "Friedrich Berr, born with the name Friedrich Beer, (April 17, 1794, Mannheim \u2013 Sept 24, 1838, Paris) was a German clarinetist, bassoonist, composer, and music educator. He studied music composition with Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis in Douai, and with Anton Reicha in Paris. He changed his last name to Beer in order to avoid confusion with the clarinetist Joseph Beer.

    "Bottles of alcohol in a plastic bag\nA cutty bang is a plastic bag containing small bottles of alcohol and mixers intended to be combined as a mixed drink. They are sold in select liquor stores in the San Francisco Bay Area.\nCutty bangs reportedly originated as early as the 1970s. \"Cutty\" is Northern California slang for \"shady\", i.e., \"probably not legal/safe/advisable\".

    "Designation for historic things\nSeoul Future Heritage logo\nSeoul Future Heritage (Korean:\u00a0\uc11c\uc6b8 \ubbf8\ub798\uc720\uc0b0) is a designation by the Seoul Metropolitan Government for entities in Seoul that are deemed worthy of preservation. Various things can be so designated, including buildings, restaurants, books, and foods. The designation has existed since 2012, and is maintained by the Seoul Metropolitan Government. Entities with the designation receive various benefits from the city government, including tourism support and funding for repairs.\nDescription\nSeoul is the capital of South Korea. It has experienced significant redevelopment in its recent history, with older entities being replaced by newer at a significant pace. While the city has significant amenities, some have argued that the city's identity has become less distinct amidst these losses. The Seoul Future Heritage program aims to preserve even more humble historic buildings and entities.\nAny citizen can propose additions to the list. The proposals are screened by the Future Heritage Preservation Committee, and the owner of the entity also provides consent to be included on the list.\nThe program's success has been debated; some argue that while the program is well-intentioned, the benefits given to businesses, especially amidst rising rent costs or redevelopment, is insufficient. Protections given to these entities have varied over time. One reporter in 2022 argued that Seoul mayor Oh Se-hoon reduced protections for older entities in order to address housing cost concerns around the time of his election.\nList of Seoul Future Heritages\nSee also: Category:Seoul Future Heritages\nSee also\nOraegage \u2013 a designation for historic businesses in Seoul\nHeritage preservation in South Korea",
    "Russian major general\nValery Mumindzhanov is a Russian major general who served as the deputy commander of the newly reformed Leningrad Military District. On September 2, 2024, it was announced Mumindzhanov was arrested on corruption charges.\nBiography\nOn September 2, 2024, it was announced Mumindzhanov was arrested for taking a 20 million rouble (~223,000 USD) bribe. The bribe was from an army supplier to secure a contract for military uniforms. At the time of the bribe Mumindzhanov was the head of a department which sourced supplies and resources for the Defense Ministry, with the contract being worth an estimated 1.5 billion roubles ($16.75 million). The Russian Investigative Committee claimed that they were tipped off to Mumindzhanov's corruption due to his vast properties in the Moscow and Voronezh regions valued at 120 million roubles ($1.3 million). The committee did not specify when he was arrested, but that they are awaiting a court ruling to decide the terms of his pre-trial custody.\nMumindzhanov was a direct subordinate of former Deputy Defense Minister Dmitry Bulgakov who saw his own corruption charges on July 26, 2024. Mumindzhanov was the ninth leading Russian military official to be arrested on charges of fraud, bribery or abuse of office joining Deputy Defense Ministers Timur Ivanov and Pavel Popov, as well as other allies of former minister of defense Sergei Shoigu. The Institute for the Study of War has assessed that the arrest of Mumindzhanov was part of an ongoing purge by Andrey Belousov to remove allies of Shoigu from important positions.\n",

    "Boxing match\nJulio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez vs. Meldrick Taylor II, billed as Unfinished Business, was a professional boxing match contested on September 17, 1994, for the WBC super lightweight title.\nBackground\nOn March 17, 1990, WBC super lightweight champion Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez met IBF super lightweight champion Meldrick Taylor in a unification bout. In one of the most memorable and controversial fights of the 1990s, Ch\u00e1vez, trailing on the scorecards, would score a last-second knockout victory after referee Richard Steele stopped the fight despite Taylor having risen from the knockdown and there being only two seconds left in the fight. The IBF ordered a rematch between the two fighters just two weeks later on the basis that Steele failed to direct Chavez to a neutral corner when he began initiating his 10-count with IBF president Bob Lee stating \"We are not saying he shouldn\u2019t have stopped the fight. We think he did the right thing to protect the fighter, but if he stopped the count, who knows what might have happened?\" To help facilitate the rematch, the IBF would rank Taylor as the number-one super lightweight thus making him Ch\u00e1vez's mandatory challenger and giving Ch\u00e1vez six months to face Taylor or be stripped of their title. In December 1990, promoter Don King announced that Ch\u00e1vez and Taylor would meet in rematch set for February 2, 1991, however Taylor's promoter Dan Duva denounced King's announcement stating \"There is no Feb. 2 date. Never has been. Never will be.\" Instead Taylor would move up to the welterweight division to challenge WBA titlist Aaron Davis on January 19, defeating him by unanimous decision to become a 2-division world champion.\nAfter over four years of waiting, King would announce in August 1994 that the long-awaited rematch between Ch\u00e1vez and Taylor would occur the following month on September 17. However, both Ch\u00e1vez and Taylor's reputation's had taken a hit; Ch\u00e1vez had lost his unbeaten streak earlier in the year, losing to Frankie Randall in January and then barely beating him in a rematch in May, while Taylor had been blown out in back-to-back world title matches in 1992 and had only faced marginal competition since, somewhat dulling the luster of the rematch. Though Taylor was only 27 at the time, he was considered a \"shot\" fighter and was installed as 3 1/2 underdog. Taylor would dismiss notions that he was past-his-prime stating \"I've done everything I've had to do to prepare for this man.\" Ch\u00e1vez would retain top trainer Emanuel Steward, while Taylor would enlist Willie Rush, his trainer as an amateur and Philadelphia-based nutritionist Shiloh Bey, who helped  Taylor lose 30 pounds to get down to the 140-pound super lightweight limit by implementing a natural food diet. Taylor claimed to be in \"tip-top shape\" and stated \"I have my hand speed back, my power. I'm punching harder. I predict a knockout and not because I'm cocky or arrogant.\"\nThe Ch\u00e1vez\u2013Taylor main event would be supplemented on the undercard with five additional world championship matches; Juan Mart\u00edn Coggi vs. Frankie Randall for the WBA super lightweight title, F\u00e9lix Trinidad vs. Yori Boy Campas for the IBF welterweight title, Gabriel Ruelas vs. Jesse James Leija for the WBC super featerhweight title, Vincent Pettway vs. Gianfranco Rosi and Ricardo L\u00f3pez vs. Surachai Saengmorakot for the WBC mini flyweight title. The six world title fights set a record for most on a single boxing card.\nThe fight\nTaylor started the fight well, taking several of the early rounds, but Ch\u00e1vez would take control of the later rounds, with a low-blow costing Taylor one point on the scorecards in the sixth round. Midway through the eighth, Ch\u00e1vez would connect with a left hook that sent Taylor down on the seat of his pants. Dazed and bleeding from his mouth, Taylor answered referee Mills Lane's 10-count at eight and was allowed to continue the fight, but was quickly met with a bevy of punches to head from Ch\u00e1vez. As Taylor was not fighting back, Lane quickly stepped in and ended the fight just seconds later, giving Ch\u00e1vez the victory by technical knockout.\nFight card\nConfirmed bouts:\n^Note 1 For WBC Super Lightweight title ^Note 2 For WBA Super Lightweight title ^Note 3 For IBF Welterweight title ^Note 4 For WBC Super Featherweight title ^Note 5 For IBF Super Welterweight title ^Note 6 For WBC Mini Flyweight title\nBroadcasting\n",
    "Seattle investment firm\nHimalaya Capital (Himalaya) is an American investment management firm based in Seattle, Washington. The firm takes a value investing approach in Asia companies mainly in China. It is founded by Li Lu who has been dubbed the \"Chinese Warren Buffett\".\nBackground\nIn 1997, Li Lu founded Himalaya as a one-man hedge fund in New York City after spending a year at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. The firm had an inauspicious start as it focused on investing in Asia but due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis, it posted a 19% loss in its first year resulting in one of its largest investors withdrawing its capital. Li soon became tired of day trading and short selling which exposed him to unlimited downside risk. The firm took stakes in Japanese and Korean stocks that had been battered by the crisis which helped it recover and by mid-2000s, it had around $100\u00a0million in assets under management which allowed it to hire more employees.\nDespite being one of the leaders of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, Li changed his views and strategy to make long-term investments in China. In 2002, the firm invested in BYD Company shortly after its initial public offering despite Li being forbidden visiting its factory in Shenzhen as Li believed in the manufacturing might of China and the purchasing power of its 1.4\u00a0billion consumers. This would be Himalaya's defining bet.\nIn 2002, Julian Robertson provided capital to Himalaya on the condition it wound would make bearish as well as bullish bets on companies. However Li stated it wasn't a good fit as he hated having \"trade all the time\" to adjust the portfolio resulting in capital being returned.\nIn 2003 through his human rights contact Jane Olson, Li met Charlie Munger, vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway at a Thanksgiving lunch and created a partnership that would last until Munger's death in 2023. Upon the advice of Munger, Li changed Himalaya from a hedge fund into a long-only investment vehicle that would use a value investing approach.\nIn 2004, Himalaya opened a new fund with $4\u00a0million of his own money, $50\u00a0million from other investors and Munger investing $88\u00a0million on the condition the fund remained closed to new investors. The fund produced very strong returns with Munger's $88\u00a0million soaring to become roughly $400\u00a0million. Investments include BYD Company and Kweichow Moutai. Munger has stated that Li is the only outside manager he has ever invested with and has described him as the \"Chinese Warren Buffett.\"\nIn 2007, Himalaya moved its office to Pasadena, California to be closer to Munger.\nIn 2010, Li was granted re-entry into China as part of a trip to accompany Bill Gates, Buffett and Munger's visit to BYD Company to invest in it. Afterwards Li made subsequent trips to China, visiting companies and delivering lectures on value investing at universities. It was reported as of 2010, Himalaya had an annualized compound return of 26.4% since 1998, compared to 2.25% for the S&P 500 during the same period.\nIn 2018, Himalaya moved its office to Seattle, Washington which had lower taxes.\nIn July 2021, Himalaya sold 10.8\u00a0million of BYD Company H shares trimming the position to 6% of the portfolio for US$309\u00a0million in profits.\nCorporate affairs\nHimalaya takes a value investing approach that is espoused by Benjamin Graham,  Buffett, and Munger. Li's mantra is \"accurate and complete information\" which sometimes means going to extraordinary lengths to get a read on the CEO of a company being researched.\nThe office set-up of Himalaya is carbon copied from Berkshire Hathaway, where teams of analysts cover a handful of companies in detail and report directly to a central decision maker. Li calls analysts for one-on-one meetings to discuss investment ideas where he will eventually make the investment decision.\nHimalaya keeps a low profile and doesn't actively court new investors as it already has a steady stream of high-net-worth individuals and pension funds to invest in it. Many of them gather in Omaha, Nebraska every year for the Berkshire Hathaway annual general meeting. Most of Li's personal wealth is tied up with Himalaya.\nAccording to Li in 2020, Himalaya does not charge a management fee and for the first six percent return.\n",
    "Ecuadorian prison director and murder victim (died 2024)In this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  Resabala and the second or maternal family name is  Icaza.\nMar\u00eda Daniela Icaza Resabala (died 12 September 2024) was an Ecuadorian prison official who was the acting director of the Litoral Penitentiary (Spanish: Penitenciar\u00eda del Litoral), known officially as Center for Social Rehabilitation of Men No. 1 of Guayaquil (Spanish: Centro de Rehabilitaci\u00f3n Social de Varones N. 1 de Guayaquil), the largest prison in Ecuador. The prison holds nearly 12,000 inmates. She was killed during a wave of violence against prison and municipal officials after gang violence put the country's prisons under military protection.\nBackground\nIn 2011, Mar\u00eda Daniela Icaza Resabala worked at Ecuador's Civil Registry. She earned a degree in social communication before joining the civil service. She was married, a mother of two children and the leader of a scout group. In 2016, she joined the Ministry of Justice and began work at the prison directorate, the National Service for Comprehensive Care for Adult Persons Deprived of Liberty and Adolescent Offenders  (Spanish: Servicio Nacional de Atenci\u00f3n Integral a Personas Adultas Privadas de la Libertad y Adolescentes Infractore). There, she began work at Litoral Penitentiary. Icaza had nearly a decade of experience working at the Penitentiary before she was promoted to acting prison director.\nPrior to becoming director, Icaza Resabala had worked several roles in the prison, including ward director. According to colleagues, Icaza Resabala was noted for her integrity and rapport with inmates. She was reportedly involved in coordinating the release of inmates for medical consultations, a significant responsibility, as the prison had only rudimentary medical facilities.\nLitoral Penitentiary\nIcaza came to Litoral Penitentiary at a time when organized crime and drug violence had begun to change Ecuador's perception of safety, and the prison system was in a state of crisis. From 2021 to 2024, more than 400 deaths have reportedly taken place in Ecuadorian prisons due to gang violence. Litoral Penitentiary became known as the country's \"most violent\", after a series of deadly riots, violence and gang activity. Several notable incidents, including the February 2021 Ecuadorian prison riots, September 2021 Guayaquil prison riot, and November 2021 Guayaquil prison riot contributed to the institution's reputation.\nAfter a string of incidents in 2021, rapporteurs from the United Nations Committee against Torture and Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture issued a press release abhorring the violence taking place in the country's prisons, and calling on Ecuador to commit to upholding a commitment to maintain security inside the prison system. These concerns were echoed in 2022, when human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch highlighted security failings at Litoral. They put blame on prison officials for overcrowding, poor management and unsafe conditions at the penitentiary. Despite efforts, violence continued to thrive at Litoral. \nIn July 2023, 31 inmates were killed during riots, and over 120 guards were held hostage at Litoral. It required 2,700 members of the security forces to stop the fighting. The next month, the military returned to disrupt rioting once again after several inmates were killed. Amnesty International described the conditions at the prison as violating the human rights of detainees and their family members.\nVillamar's escape and insecurity\nSee also: 2024 Ecuadorian conflict and Ecuadorian security crisis\nIn January 2024, drug lord Jos\u00e9 Adolfo Mac\u00edas Villamar escaped from Litoral Penitentiary, where he was serving a thirty-four year sentence and where Icaza was serving as director. Villamar was said to have \"significant control\" of the prison prior to his escape.\nAfter his escape, criminal gangs in Ecuador launched widescale attacks, including arsons, bombings, and a hostage situation on a newsroom. The actions led Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa to declare a state of emergency, calling in military support to control the violence. In the months that followed, the country continued to experience a growing security crisis due to increasing influence of criminal gangs. As prisons became headquarters for the gangs, on 15 January 2024, Noboa put the prison system under military control. Conjugal visits at Ecuadorian prisons, notably Litoral Penitentiary, were stopped under the new system.\nIncreased pressure on prison officials\nIn April 2024, a constitutional referendum gave increased military support to control crime in the country. On the same day as the referendum, the director of the El Rodeo prison was murdered in retaliation. Cosme Dami\u00e1n Parrales had been appointed director of the prison a week prior to his assassination. He was shot while eating with his wife at a restaurant. In May 2024, two prison officers from Litoral Penitentiary were killed in retal",

    "1638 naval battle\nThe Battle of Caba\u00f1as was an attempt in 1638 by Dutch privateer Cornelis Jol to capture the Spanish treasure fleet captained by Carlos de Ibarra. The naval battle, framed in the Eighty Years' War, ended with the Dutch fleet retreating after suffering heavy damage.\nBackground\nA Spanish fleet sailed off from C\u00e1diz to the Indies on April 29, 1638, commanded by Carlos de Ibarra. In their way, they reached Isla Tortuga, a usual center of foreign piracy, and upon finding the pirate settlements and plantations lightly defended due to the absence of the pirate crews, they destroyed them. Among the pirates there were many privateers for the Dutch Republic, leading to Admiral Jol to come out of Texel in May 1638 with 10 galleons in order to try to capture the 1638 Spanish treasure ships. After being joined by 16 other galleons, he arrived in Cuba and patrolled around Havana to intercept the Spanish in July.\nOn August 26, the authorities of Havana sent a messenger ships to Veracruz, arriving on September 2, thanks to which the Veracruz treasure ships managed to evade the enemy ships. However, the message failed to reach Cartagena de Indias in time, so Ibarra and the Veracrucian treasure fleet left on August 7 unaware of Jol' trap. On August 30, the Spanish galleon Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Regla discovered the Dutch ships.\nBattle\nJol advanced with 17 galleons in two parallel formations while Ibarra ordered to form a defensive line. Jol's 54-gun flagship, along with two other Dutch ships, attacked Ibarra's similarly 54-gun galleon San Mateo, but Ibarra ordered not to fire until the enemy ships were the closest possible, the tactic called fuego a la espa\u00f1ola (\"Spanish Fire\"). He waited enough than one of the Dutch ships actually collided with the San Mateo and Ibarra received light wounds by a grenade, but the delay paid off, with the Spanish artillery dealing enough direct damage to the three ships that they broke off. The rest of the fleets joined the fight, with viceadmiral Abraham Rosendal fighting his Spanish counterpart Pedro Urs\u00faa. After eight hours of battle, having lost 7 galleons, Jol ordered to retreat.\nThree days later, Jol launched a new attack. As the forces were closer in proportion now, with 10 Dutch ships between the 7 Spanish galleons and support ships, he ordered his fleet to keep distance and capitalize on their higher number of guns to pepper the Spanish from afar. They cannoned especially the galleon Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Carmen, captained by Sancho Urdanivia, whom they wrongly believed to be the Spanish flagship due to its similar size and the fact that it had accidentally been separated from the main fleet. The Carmen advanced and managed to forced them to back down, although it was damaged to the point Ibarra had to deploy divers to repair its water leaks in midst of the fights. Eventually, having suffered new damage in his fleet, Jol called for retreat again.\nThere would not be a third day of battle. Demoralized by the casualties, which included the death of Rosendal and the captains Jan Mast and Jan Verdist, the rest of Jol's captains refused to attack again, and Jol withdrew his fleet not to return. For his part, suspecting of Dutch reinforcements, and not wanting to risk losing a battle of attrition against an even bigger enemy, Ibarra headed for Veracruz, with the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Carmen being diverted to Havana for reparations.\nAftermath\nThe news of the battle were received with dismay in the Dutch Republic and among the pirate communities. Ibarra reached Veracruz on September 34, hosting celebrations for the victory, although he decided to wait for January 1639 to resume the travel in combination with the treasure fleet of Mart\u00edn Orbea. King Philip IV rewarded Ibarra by making him Viscount of Centenera and Marquis of Taracena. The Spanish mistakenly believed Jol had been killed in action.\n",
    "\nRavi Balgobin Maharaj is a political commentator and social activist in Trinidad and Tobago, known for his legal challenges against government actions and his alignment with the United National Congress (UNC). Maharaj has been involved in several high-profile cases, particularly those related to constitutional matters and government accountability. Maharaj's activism and legal interventions have made him a key figure in political opposition, often challenging government decisions through the courts. His cases frequently involve issues of governance, constitutional law, and civil rights, highlighting his commitment to ensuring transparency and adherence to legal standards in Trinidad and Tobago.\nEarly Years\nRavi Balgobin Maharaj was born and raised by his grandmother, Radha Maharaj, in the suburbs of Curepe, Trinidad and Tobago. Ravi attended St. Joeph Boys' R.C. Primary School, and then Barataria Secondary Comprehensive School, before completing a BSc degree in Computing with Business from the University of Greenwich. In March 2010, Ravi would first meet Nandita, nee Sahadeo Maharaj, who he would later go on to marry in November 2021. It was during his time in high school however, that he became interested in political activism, as he began campaigning with the United National Congress and its candidate in the Tunapuna constituency, Mr. Mervyn Assam in the 2000 General Election. Ravi would then be employed in the Tunapuna Constituency Office as his first job after Mervyn Assam was elected to represent the constituency. Ravi would remain involved in the campaigns of the Tunapuna constituency until 2010, playing a major role in the candidacies of Mervyn Assam in 2000 & 2001, Carlos John in 2002, Christine Newallo-Hosein in 2007, and the Local Government campaign of Omardath Ramkissoon in 2003.\nPolitical Commentary\nIn 2013, Ravi began commenting on political affairs through an email letter that would go on to become one of the most significant voices in discussions about democracy and governance in Trinidad and Tobago. His contributions have sparked debates about the role of leadership and the importance of civic engagement in shaping policy and societal change. His commentary often focuses on issues related to governance, public safety, and human rights. Maharaj is recognized for his critical views on government policies and decisions, advocating for accountability and transparency.\nHe has gained attention for his public statements, particularly regarding social issues, governance, law enforcement and the effectiveness of the police service. His activism extends to pressing for reforms and improvements in various sectors, including the justice system and public safety. Through social media and public forums, Maharaj engages with citizens, raising awareness about political and social issues affecting the nation. Ravi Balgobin Maharaj over the years would be considered as one of the most prolific political commentators in the Western Hemisphere, being published in numerous outlets across the region, including the Trinidad Express, Trinidad Guardian, Trinidad Newsday, Sunshine Today T&T, AZP News  the Indo-Caribbean Diaspora News, and Forbes Magazine\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nIn 2020, Maharaj, through his attorneys, issued a pre-action protocol letter threatening a lawsuit against the government, preventing the Stay-At-Home guidelines for the COVID-19 pandemic from infringing upon the Rights and Freedoms of the citizens of Trinidad and Tobago. While it was important for the government to implement strategies to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 infection during the height of the pandemic, the measures that were being put in place were overstepping the function and directions of the law and were creating a semi-militistic state that was unconstitutional. Through his actions, Maharaj was able to successfully get the government to rescind the order to illegally prevent the movement of people during this time.\nIn 2022, during the time that the majority of COVID-19 restrictions were being removed, Ravi again had to threaten the government with legal action, after they refused to allow Hindus the ability to access watercourses to perform their religious duties. While the government was allowing all citizens to access the beach for recreational use, there were still restrictions prohibiting anyone from visiting rivers, which directly affected the Hindu community who required access to these sources of freshwater for various religious ceremonies. While the government did relent in this decision as a result of the threat of legal action by Ravi, this was just another case of the infringement of basic human rights that were being inflicted upon the citizens of the country during the pandemic.\nLegal Activism\nDuring the 2015 General Election in Trinidad and Tobago, the Election and Boundaries Commission (EBC) would take a decision on the day of polling to extend the hours that electors would be able to cast their wotes by an addi",

The castles were located on rivers with steep banks.\nHistory\nThe town was first mentioned in 1456, and in 1629 Borshchiv was granted the Magdeburg Law and the Vasa coat of arms \u2013 Snopek. The town at that time had ramparts, and there was a brick castle on the river. It can be assumed that the castle was not only the owner's dwelling, but also a bastion that gave shelter to residents when the city fortifications were unable to stop an enemy attack.\nArchitecture\nIn the early 18th century, part of the castle was rebuilt into a classical palace on the site where a defensive castle formerly existed. Extensive underground dungeons testified to the size and importance of this ancient stronghold. In 1763, construction of a church began near the palace, which was located within one section of the castle's fortifications. The main facade of the Roman Catholic church was a three-story tower, which was rebuilt from an old castle tower from the 17th century. The walls of the lower tier of the tower were very thick. Today, all that remains of the castle is a fragment of the stone fortifications: the rebuilt defense tower, which became the bell tower of the Roman Catholic church.\n",

    "Belgian lawyer and politician (1802-1893)\nNicolas Defuisseaux (2 February 1802 \u2013 24 November 1857) was a Belgian lawyer, senator, industrialist, and a former commander of the Garde Civique.\nBiography\nEarly life and education\nNicolas Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Defuisseaux was born in Mons, Hainaut Province, Belgium on 2 February 1802. In 1792, after the Battle of Jemappes during the War of the First Coalition, Philippe Joseph Defuisseaux, his father, played a key role in establishing the French First Republic in the city of Mons.\nNicolas attended the Royal Academy of Sciences and Letters of Brussels in August 1817, winning a prize for his second year of grammar studies.\nLaw\nAfter attending the high school of Brussels, he obtained a Doctor of Law degree from Ghent University on 12 August 1825, and soon made a name for himself at the Bar of Mons. He worked as a lawyer in Mons from 1830 to 1845.\nDuring the Belgian Revolution of 1830, he was sent to Borinage, overseeing the first arrests and stopping acts of pillaging. Defuisseaux was appointed by the Provisional Government of Belgium to assist Auguste Harmignie, the government commissioner at the court of Mons, in the investigation of Gen. Juan Van Halen. For his contribution, he was decorated with the Iron Cross in 1831.\nPolitical career\nHe was elected as a member of the Provincial Council of Hainaut on 28 May 1838.\nFollowing the Belgian Revolution, Nicolas Defuisseaux was delegated the command of the Civil Guard (French: Garde Civique) in Brussels by an order of 22 June 1838. Defuisseaux filled the functions of commander on an interim basis until a royal decree of 9 September 1848, called Fran\u00e7ois Van Assche.\nDefuisseaux was actively involved in the Society of Sciences, Arts and Letters of Hainaut in Mons, serving as president by April 1841. The society's board also included Camille Wins and Camille Joseph Castiaux as vice presidents and Adolphe Mathieu as the secretary. Along with the other members, he delivered a speech at the funeral of Hainaut Governor Jean-Baptiste Thorn in 1841. Defuisseaux served as president for the organization's 1843\u20131844 term.\nElected to the Hainaut Provincial Council on 23 May 1842, Defuisseaux's term concluded in 1844.\nOn 25 March 1844, he became a member of the Society of Belgian Bibliophilists.\nIn 1844, he operated as the lawyer for Firmin Petit, a coal mining manager in Dour with a copper ore concession in Rouveroy and Givry, submitting an application for a concession.\nIndustrialist\nIn the mid-1840s, Defuisseaux partnered with Belgian engineer Fran\u00e7ois Declerc, who had converted a factory in Baudour into a porcelain factory in 1842.

    "Animal escape in Quezon City, Philippines\nThe 2003 Quezon city elephant escape incident occurred on May 8, 2003, where Jumbo, captive performing elephant escaped into the streets of Kamuning in Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines.\nBackground\nElephant World was a two-year show by Uniprom Inc., a Thai company which sent performing elephants around the world. In the Philippines, a group of 10 elephants were sent and set up shop in a compound near Araneta Center (now Araneta City) dubbed Elephant Arena where they are to perform.\nEscape\nOn the morning of May 8, 2003, Jumbo, a 21-year old, 8 foot tall Asian elephant, biggest of the 10, escaped its confines when a trainer allegedly left the visitor entrance gates open after the taping of the GMA network morning show Sis.\nUpon the elephant's escape, it had injured two trainers who were trying to stop it. Other handlers were unable to restrain the animal, which led it to walk some 3 kilometers passing by Ramon Magsaysay High School, onto EDSA traffic, finally ending in Tomas Morato Avenue where it took rest. A truck was used to block the animal from progressing further into the street.\nThe sight of the elephant seemingly touring the streets attracted the attention of a crowd of onlookers that gathered around it.  Handlers chained Jumbo to a tree and fed it bananas. A resident later doused the elephant with water to keep it cool. The elephant did not show signs of distress and was able to perform a few tricks entertaining the crowd. A veterinarian eventually tranquilized Jumbo.\nThe MMDA brought a crane and a truck to bring the sedated animal back to its enclosure, however, upon raising the animal to load it on the truck, they dropped Jumbo on his back, damaging a nearby taxi.\nAftermath\nAn investigation underwent regarding the circumstances of the escape and whether or not the company incurred violations or sanctions in bringing \"wildlife threats\" in the country. A team composed of wildlife experts and veterinarians was mobilized to check into living conditions of the elephants and if they were maltreated.\nThe incident caused major traffic and blockages in the notoriously busy city center which led to the rerouting of several motorists.\nIt was erroneously reported that one of the trainers was critically injured due to the animal stepping on his ribcage. This was later revealed that both trainers sustained only minor injuries and was treated in nearby Quirino Memorial Medical Center. Jumbo on the other hand was reported to not have sustained any damage from the fall and performed after a few days.\nTheories on why the elephant took a stroll dominated local news cycles for a few days.\nThe incident also prompted controversy when a trainer spat on Actor and known elephant lover Mark Gil's face as he rushed to get near Jumbo.\n",

    "8th-century Master of Chan Buddhism\nDazhu Huihai (Chinese: \u5927\u73e0\u6167\u6d77) (fl. 788) was a Chan Master in the Hongzhou School, and was a disciple of Mazu Daoyi. The Dunwu rudao yaomen lun (Treatise on the Essential Doctrine of Suddenly Entering into Enlightenment) is attributed to him. His name, Dazhu, means \"Great Pearl.\"\nBiography\nThe earliest biography of Dazhu Huihai was written well over a century after his death. As such, there is scant reliable information regarding Dazhu's life. He was born in Jianzhou (Fujian). According to Dazhu Huihai's entry in the Jingde Chuandenglu, his preceptor was Daozhi of the Dayunsi in Yuezhou (Zhejiang). He later studied with Mazu Daoyi for six years, but then returned to the Dayunsi to look after the aging Daozhi. The \u201cDaoyi St\u016bpa\u201d written by Quan Deyu lists Dazhu Huihai as the first among eleven of Mazu's students who led other disciples during Mazu's funeral. According to Jinhua Jia, this suggests that Dazhu was either the most senior or most important of Mazu's disciples. Mario Poceski states that Dazhu was one of Mazu's earliest disciples, but was something of an outsider in the Hongzhou School, as he left before Mazu became famous.\nAccording to the Tsung Ching Record, when Dazhu arrived at Kiangsi, he informed Mazu that he had come from Yuezhou seeking the Buddhadharma, to which Mazu replied, \"Instead of looking to the treasure house which is your very own, you have left home and gone wandering far away. What for? I have absolutely nothing here at all. What is this Buddha-Dharma that you seek?\" When Dazhu inquired as to the meaning of his own treasure house, Mazu said:\n\"That which asked the question is your treasure house. It contains absolutely everything you need and lacks nothing at all. It is there for you to use freely, so why this vain search for something outside yourself?\"\nAt these words, Dazhu experienced enlightenment. He later said of this encounter with Mazu: \u201cI, the poor priest, heard that the Reverend in Jiangxi said, \u2018Your own treasure is perfectly complete; you are free to use it and do not need to seek outside.\u2019 From that moment onward, I have ceased .\u201d\nDazhu is said to have later composed the Dunwu rudao yaomen lun at his home monastery in Yuezhou. When Mazu read a copy, he said, \u201cIn Yuezhou, there is a great pearl, whose perfect brilliance shines freely without any obstruction.\u201d This is a reference to Dazhu's name, which means \"Great Pearl.\"\nTeachings\nNature of mind\nThe Dunwu rudao yaomen lun, attributed to Dazhu Huihai, describes the mind in the following terms:\nMind has no colour, such as green or yellow, red or white; it is not long or short; it does not vanish or appear; it is free from purity and impurity alike; and its duration is eternal. It is utter stillness. Such, then, is the form and shape of our original mind, which is also our original body\u2014the Buddhak\u0101ya!\nAccording to Dazhu, this original mind does not depend on the sense organs, as it is without various means of perception. Instead, Dazhu says it perceives by means of one's own nature (svabh\u0101va) which is immaterial and motionless. When asked how perception is possible, since the mind's substance cannot be found, Dazhu replies: \"We may liken it to a bright mirror which, though it contains no forms, can nevertheless \u2018perceive\u2019 all forms.\"\nEternal perception\nAccording to Dazhu, when we encounter objects, the things being looked at do not actually exist within the sphere of perception. Similarly, he says when we do not encounter any objects, there is likewise no absence of anything in the sphere of perception either. When asked if it was still possible to perceive even while nothing confronts us, Dazhu responds in the affirmative, saying:\nWe are now talking of that perception which is independent of there being an object or not. How can that be? The nature of perception being eternal, we go on perceiving whether objects are present or not. Thereby we come to understand that, whereas objects naturally appear and disappear, the nature of perception does neither of those things; and it is the same with all your other senses.\nDazhu goes on to explain it is the same with hearing, as we continue to hear whether sounds are present or not. As such, Dazhu describes the nature of hearing as eternal. When asked who or what is the hearer, Dazhu responds, \"It is your own nature which hears and it is the inner cognizer who knows.\"\nSimultaneous functioning of dhy\u0101na and wisdom\nIn the Dunwu rudao yaomen lun, Dazhu says that dh\u0101yna is perpetual and not affected by speech or silence, stating that dhy\u0101na functions even when we are engaged in speaking or making distinctions. He says this is like the sun which does not waver whether its rays encounter the earth or not, and also like a mirror whose brightness does not waver whether it is reflecting something or not. He uses this analogy to illustrate the simultaneous function of dhy\u0101na and wisdom: where the capacity to shine (or reflect) refers to wisdom, the unwav",
    "\nThe Ensaios da Anitta are a series of live shows performed by singer Anitta, aimed at celebrating the pre-Carnival season in Brazil. Launched in January 2019, these events take place annually in January and February, traveling through various Brazilian cities such as Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, Salvador, and Belo Horizonte. These shows were conceived by Anitta as a way to energize her audience for her Carnival street party, the \"Bloco da Anitta\", offering a mix of live music, dance, and themed performances.\nEach edition of the Ensaios da Anitta has its own theme, which influences the visual production, including set design, costumes, and the overall aesthetic of the event. The theme often inspires the outfits of the attending audience, who frequently come dressed in costumes. An example of this was the 2024 edition, which featured the theme of samba schools.\nThe shows feature a setlist that blends various musical genres, including funk, pop, samba, pagode, and ax\u00e9, reflecting the diversity of Brazilian popular music. In addition to Anitta's performances, the Ensaios also include special appearances by other popular artists in Brazil. Throughout the editions, artists such as Pabllo Vittar, Lu\u00edsa Sonza, Gloria Groove, Leo Santana, Ferrugem, J\u00e3o, Psirico, among others, have taken the stage, offering the audience exclusive collaborations and joint performances.\nEnsaios da Anitta in 2020.\nThe Ensaios da Anitta have stood out for their large-scale production and for being held in vast open-air venues, such as the Arena de Pernambuco, in Recife, and the Latin America Memorial, in S\u00e3o Paulo. The audience at these events is diverse, ranging from thousands of Anitta fans to others looking to enjoy the Carnival atmosphere. Since its inception, the event has seen tickets sell out quickly, establishing itself as one of the main attractions of the Brazilian summer calendar.\nThe growth of the project has led the Ensaios da Anitta to expand its presence to various regions of Brazil, becoming a traveling event that draws both tourists and locals alike. For 2025, Anitta has chosen the theme \"Anitta Marathon\", inspired by the Olympics and sports events.\nInternationalization\nAnitta has announced plans to expand her pre-Carnival event, the \"Ensaios da Anitta\", to an international stage. The singer revealed that Portugal could be one of the first countries to host the project, noting that if her performance at the Festival Sudoeste is well received, it could encourage the team to take the event outside Brazil. \nEditions\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\nSetlist\n\"Simply the Best\"\n\"I'd Rather Have Sex\"\n\"Practice\"\n\"Envolver\"\n'\"Downtown\"\n\"Maria Elegante\"\n\"Me Gusta\"\n\"Lobby\"\n\"Faking Love\"\n\"Some que Ele Vem Atr\u00e1s\"\n\"Loka\"\n\"Voc\u00ea Partiu Meu Cora\u00e7\u00e3o\"\n'\"Essa Mina \u00c9 Louca\"\n\"Contatinho\"\n\"Ai Papai\"\n\"Ela N\u00e3o Vale Nada\"\n\"Mel\"\n\"Meiga e Abusada\"\n\"Zen\"\n\"Cobertor\"\n\"Bang\"\n\"Desce pro Play (Pa, Pa, Pa)\"\n\"T\u00e1 com o Papato\"\n\"Tudo Nosso\"\n\"Macetar\"\n\"Gata\"\n\"Bola Rebola\"\n\"Vai Malandra\"\n\"Zen\"\n\"Movimento da Sanfoninha\"\n\"Rave de Favela\"\n\"We Are the World of Carnaval\"\n\"Avisa L\u00e1\"\n\"Combatchy\"\n\"Modo Turbo\"\n\"Onda Diferente\"\n\"Favela Chegou\"\n\"No Ch\u00e3o Novinha\"\n\"Que Rab\u00e3o\"\n\"Show das Poderosas\"\n\"Boys Don't Cry\"\n\"Ai Papai\"\n2024\nSetlist\n\"Combatchy\"\n\"Modo Turbo\"\n\"Avisa L\u00e1\"\n\"Envolver\"\n\"Bellakeo\"\n\"Terremoto\"\n\"Some que Ele Vem Atr\u00e1s\"\n\"Loka\"\n\"Voc\u00ea Partiu Meu Cora\u00e7\u00e3o\"\n\"Essa Mina \u00c9 Louca\"\n\"Romance com Safadeza\"\n\"Ela N\u00e3o Vale Nada\"\n\"Ai Papai\"\n\"Contatinho\"\n\"Cobertor\"\n\"Meiga e Abusada\"\n\"Zen\"\n\"Pilantra\"\n\"Bang\"\n\"Desce pro Play (Pa, Pa, Pa)\"\n\"At\u00e9 o C\u00e9u\"\n\"Vai Vendo\"\n\"Lovezinho\"\n\"Nu\"\n\"Mil Veces (remix)\"\n\"Menina M\u00e1\"\n\"Me Gusta\"\n\"Sua Cara\"\n\"Sin Miedo\"\n\"Joga pra Lua\"\n\"T\u00e1 com o Papato\"\n\"Tudo Nosso\"\n\"Movimento da Sanfoninha\"\n\"Bola Rebola\"\n\"Vai Malandra\"\n\"Onda Diferente\"\n\"Favela Chegou\"\n\"Rave de Favela\"\n\"No Ch\u00e3o Novinha\"\n\"N\u00e3o Para\"\n\"Show das Poderosas\"\n\"Boys Don't Cry\"\n2025\n",
    "United States historic place\nThe Alfred L. Black House, also known as the Wahl House, is a historic residence located at 158 S. Forest St in Bellingham, Washington. The house was finished in 1903. It consists of four stories and includes 10 bedrooms, six bathrooms, a library, a billiard room, a music room, a ballroom, and a wrap around porch. The interior wood consists of fir. It is approximately 13,500 square feet. \nBackground\nThe house was built by Alfred L. Black in 1903. Black was the last mayor of the town of Fairhaven before the city of Bellingham was established in 1903. After a special election to determine the mayor of the new city in December of that year, Alfred Black was voted as the first mayor of Bellingham. The building was designed by Alfred Lee, who also was the architect of the Whatcom Museum of History and Art and the Bellingham branch of the Carnegie Public Library.\nHistory\nIn 1917, the house was bought by J. B Wahl. Whal was the founder of Wahl's Department Store which was located downtown Bellingham until 1972. The house remained in the Wahl family until 1957 when it was sold to the Sisters of St. Joseph, who operated the house as a retreat. While in use by the sisters, the music room was used as a chapel. The basement was also remodeled into a dining room that could hold over 100 people.\nThe sisters later sold the house to John and Jackie Mumma in 1963. The Mumma's lived in the house until about 1978 when it was sold to Floyd and Becky Svensoon The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 4, 1980.\nBy 2008, the house was owned by Ron Weden. In August 2017, the house was damaged by fire.\n",
    "\nAngela Barker-Jones (July 29, 1969 \u2013 July 31, 2018) was a Cherokee jurist who served as a justice on the Cherokee Nation supreme court. She was the second woman to hold this position in the court's history.\nLife\nBarker-Jones was born on July 29, 1969, in Okmulgee, Oklahoma. Her mother, Dianne Barker-Harrold, was an attorney, and her husband, Stephen, led dental programs within the Cherokee Nation health system. She graduated from Tahlequah High School in 1987 and received a B.S. in criminal justice from Northeastern State University in 1991, where Barker-Jones graduated summa cum laude. In 1995, she earned her J.D. from the University of Tulsa College of Law, graduating in the top ten percent of her class and being named to the Order of the Curule Chair.\nBarker-Jones began her legal career as an assistant district attorney for Muskogee County from 1995 to 1996, later serving in the same role for Cherokee County in 2007. She later became a public defender in Cherokee and Adair counties, where she focused on ensuring fair legal representation for all clients, particularly juveniles. She maintained a private law practice in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, where she worked on criminal and civil cases. Barker-Jones served as a hearing officer for the Cherokee Nation's administrative appeals board and was a member of the tribe's employee appeals board.\nOn January 2, 2013, Barker-Jones was sworn in as a Cherokee Nation supreme court justice after her appointment was approved by the tribal council in December 2012.

    "\nOn the night between May 30 and 31, 2021, jihadists from the Allied Democratic Forces (also known as Islamic State \u2013 Central Africa Province or ISCAP) attacked the towns of Boga and Tchabi, killing a total of fifty-seven civilians and injuring forty-seven others. The attacks were one of the deadliest massacres ever perpetrated by the ADF since its founding in the 1990s.\nBackground\nThe Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) was founded in Uganda in the 1990s, gaining prominence as an Islamist rebel group and conducting deadly attacks on civilians in the early 2010s. The group pledged bay'ah to the Islamic State in 2019 and began carrying out its first attacks under the ISCAP moniker months later. Beginning in 2021, the ADF carried out dozens of deadly massacres against villages in North Kivu, attacking villagers along ethnic and religious lines.\nBoga and Tchabi are two towns located ten kilometers apart along the border between North Kivu and Ituri Province, where the ADF is active. Around 48,000 people lived in both towns combined; 30,000 in Boga, 18,000 in Tchabi. Boga was home to a displacement camp hosting refugees mainly from the Nyali people in one part of the camp and Banyabwisha people in another part. The head of the Nyali community in the area told Al Jazeera that they believed it was the same attacker for both villages. Banyabwisha are Rwandan refugees who had settled in the area since 2019, and were in a war with the Nyali over land rights. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res warned Congolese and United Nations authorities in April 2020 about the chances of an ADF attack in Boga and Tchabi due to few defenses in the towns.\nPrior to the attack, the Congolese government claimed that Congolese forces were unable to prevent the attack and establish a position as ADF fighters ambushed them as they were setting up the position. A battle ensued, and both sides retreated from the area.\nMassacres\nThe camp at Boga was the first attacked, around 1am on May 31. ADF fighters besieged the camp, and then indiscriminately shot civilians and burned down houses. A witness to the massacre in Boga said that he was alerted after hearing cries from his neighbor's house. When he arrived at the house, the perpetrators had already killed an Anglican pastor and wounded his daughter. Residents' houses were looted and torched, and vehicles located on the nearby road were burnt out. 26 people were killed at the Ruhindo displaced camp in Boga and three were killed in the Kinyanjojo camp. 47 others were reported injured in both the Boga and Tchabi massacres, and twelve people were still being treated in the Boga hospital as of June 3.\nADF fighters then attacked the town of Tchabi, killing over 24 people and injuring dozens of others. Some civilians were abducted from the town as well. Between both villages, 57 civilians were killed and 47 were injured, along with at least 25 civilians kidnapped. Some estimates by local civil society members and Gracien Iracan, a Congolese MP, assessed the death toll at above sixty killed. Forty of the victims were Nyali, and ten of them were Hema. Almost every one of the 48,000 refugees originally located in the towns also fled following the massacres, some to Uganda and many to Bukiringi. Many of the newly displaced refugees were sleeping in the bush to evade the attacks. Around 5,335 refugees were in these conditions as of June 6.\nAftermath\nPerpetrator\nThe president of the Irumu Territory civil society stated that the attackers were suspected to be Banyabwisha members of the ADF, as the Banyabwisha section of the Boga camp was untouched during the attacks. These claims of Banyabwisha ADF fighters were reiterated by Jules Ngongo, the spokesman for the FARDC in Ituri. Congolese authorities confirmed the ADF's responsibility in conducting the attack on June 5.\nReactions\nCongolese authorities in Kinshasa did not immediately react to the massacres. David McLachlan-Karr, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the DRC, condemned the attack. Congolese authorities released a statement calling the massacres a humiliation and demanding justice on June 3. The European Union condemned the attacks as well.\nSubsequent attacks\nOn June 7, brief clashes occurred at noon between the FARDC and ADF near Boga. It was later reported that these clashes were caused by an ADF attack on the hospital in Boga, killing ten civilians and two of the ADF attackers. The hospital, which had previously served over 80,000 people in the area, was considered unusable.\nMONUSCO and UN officials visited Tchabi and Boga between June 16 and 17, strengthening security measures in the area. Peacekeepers from Nepal, South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania all were dispatched to hunt down the ADF nearby and protect the villages. Despite this, ADF fighters re-established a camp in Tchabi by June 18.\nFurther reading\nRDC: ce qu'il faut savoir du drame de Boga, l'actuel epicentre des attaques ADF en Ituri - June 11, 2021, Actualite.cd",
    "Nationalism for Chile\nChilean nationalism is the nationalism of Chilean people and Chilean culture. It began as a strain of political thought that originated between 1904 and 1914 with the rise of the centenary essayists, the birth of the Nationalist Party and the reactivation of the authoritarian political discourse of the statesman Diego Portales.Veterans of the War of the Pacific in 1943. For the sociologist Hern\u00e1n Larra\u00edn, This episode strengthens the idea of a Chilean racial identity based on warlike qualities.\nIntellectual trajectory and main ideas\nChilean nationalist ideas arose in the context of the political and economic crisis at the start of the 20th century, when a group of intellectuals tried to find a way out of the crisis by appealing to industrial development, authoritarian policies, ethnonational identity, economic protection and strong opposition to political and economic liberalism.\nAccording to some authors, the first formal theorist of Chilean nationalism was the doctor and veteran Nicol\u00e1s Palacios, who published his famous book Raza chilena in 1904, in which he proposed the racial superiority of Chileans due to their mix of \"warrior Visigoths\" and \"strong Araucanians.\" Palacios was, according to historian Erwin Robertson, a self-proclaimed racist as well as a spectator of the social inequalities of the time, \u201ca preferential witness of the Santa Mar\u00eda School Massacre in Iquique\u201d and \u201cthe defender of the Roto against an oligarchy that he considered the result of negative social selection\u201d. This book contains three principal ideas: that Chilean miscegenation had given rise to a permanent and defined race, composed of both the Mapuche, an American Indian particularly suited to war and the hostility of the climate; as well as by Spanish conquistadors of Germanic descent, whose warrior skills were also highlighted by the author, that Chilean territory, contrary to the reports that were provided, was mostly unusable given its amount of sterile land, so immigration policies had to be even more selective and prevent the entry of \"Latin races\", in order to favor the entry of Germans and other \"Nordic\" ethnicities, and that much of the crisis they faced was related to the poor image that the people had of themselves, an issue accentuated by the \"dominant oligarchy\", which \"mercilessly despised\" the lower class.\nThe racial theories of Palacios influenced the prolific historian and philosopher Francisco Antonio Encina,(National Literature Prize, 1951), one of the founding members of the Nationalist Party in 1910. Nationalist sentiment was quite popular until the 1960s, the main ideas expressed in his extensive twenty-volume Historia de Chile desde la Prehistoria hasta 1891 (English: History of Chile from Prehistory to 1891), and in the essays Nuestra inferioridad econ\u00f3mica (English: Our inferior economy) and La educaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica y el liceo,(English: Financial education and high school) both published in 1912; many of his racial ideas can be found in La literatura hist\u00f3rica chilena y el concepto actual de la historia (English: Chilean literary history and the current concept of history), published in 1935 and republished in 1997 by Editorial Universitaria. Similarly to Palacios, Encina thought that the Chilean aristocracy had lost its chivalrous spirit for a banal and uncompromising one. For the historian, the decadency of the Chilean elite originated with the triumph of the liberals in the Civil War of 1891 and the implementation of anti-state policies of liberal economist Jean Gustave Courcelle-Seneuil, which consisted of lowering tariffs and allowing the entry of foreign products and companies, resulting in a \u201cdecline of the national entrepreneurial spirit and the surrender of the country to large foreign companies\u201d. It promoted policy oriented towards industrial education, since it considered the Chilean \"race\" incompatible with \"humanistic education\" (liberal arts) that the elites engaged in. However, the most remarked upon aspect of Encina's writings is their racist content: unlike Palacios, Encina saw racial mixing as a negative as it decreased Spanish blood. He lamented that miscegenation destroyed the prosperity that other European colonies achieved in North America, while Palacios was favorable towards ethnic mixing. Therefore, for Encina, the stratification of creole society and the political power of the aristocracy had a racial explanation: \"Chilean society was left with a social makeup, that, in general, coincides with the ethnic makeup: on top, the Chileans with the most Spanish blood, and on the bottom, those with the most Indigenous blood.\"\nJaime Eyzaguirre, main author of the Hispanic movement within Chilean nationalism.\nLater, the lawyer and academic Alberto Edwards published La fronda aristocr\u00e1tica en Chile (English: The aristocratic frond in Chile), a book that criticized the gentrification of the Chilean aristocracy due to its lack of connection with reality, its lack of abil",
    "\nIsmikhan Rahimov(September 18, 1925, Baku \u2013 December 15, 2004, Baku) \u2014 translator, linguist, and one of the founders of the anti-Soviet \"Ildirim\" (Lightning) organization.\nTogether with Haji Zeynalov and Gulhuseyn Huseynoglu, he founded a nationalist student organization against the Soviet occupation, and due to this activity, he was deprived of his voting rights for 5 years and sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment with the confiscation of all his property. He served his sentence in a labor camp in Siberia.\nHe completed secondary and higher education with distinction ahead of time. He had a unique methodology in teaching English. He was the author of several books and dictionaries in the field of linguistics. On October 28, 2000, he was awarded the \"Shohrat\" (Glory) Order for his services in the field of education in Azerbaijan. Since 2002, he had been a personal pensioner of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan.\nLife\nIsmikhan Mammad oglu Rahimov was born on September 18, 1925, in the city of Baku. His father, Shahverdiyev Alibanda, was a merchant and was arrested and executed by the Soviet regime in 1937. In 1931, he entered secondary school in Baku. He completed school one year earlier than expected with high grades. In 1941, he was admitted to the Institute of Foreign Languages, graduating with distinction in 1943. He then enrolled in the Faculty of Philology at Azerbaijan State University. During his studies there, he was also admitted to the Azerbaijan Medical Institute. In 1946, he graduated with distinction from the Faculty of Philology at Azerbaijan State University. Due to his admission to postgraduate studies, he discontinued his medical education.\nIn 1942, Ismikhan Rahimov, together with Haji Zeynalov and Gulhuseyn Huseynoglu, founded a secret nationalist student organization in Azerbaijan against the Soviet occupation. Later, Musa Abdullayev, Kamal Aliyev, Azer Alasgarov, Aydin Vahidov, and Kamil Rzayev also joined the organization. The organization consisted of eight university students in total. It had its own program and oath. The oath-taking ceremonies took place in early 1944 at Aydin Vahidov's apartment, with the oath text prepared by Ismikhan Rahimov. The main goals of the organization's members were the independence of Azerbaijan, the protection and expansion of the use of the Azerbaijani language, its establishment as the state language, and the opportunity for Azerbaijanis to hold high positions in state institutions. They also aimed to reassess the cases of writers who were arrested during the 1937\u20131938 period, labeled as enemies of the people, exiled to Siberia, or executed, and to achieve their rehabilitation.\nAt an event of the Azerbaijan Writers' Union held on May 10, 1944, Samad Vurgun criticized the union's work, stating that Azerbaijani literature was not developing as it should. He gave a speech about national literature, national consciousness, and national identity. Inspired by this, the members of the organization decided to write a letter to Samad Vurgun on May 11, proposing that he lead their organization as someone who could guide them. Ismikhan Rahimov, under the dictation of Gulhuseyn Huseynoglu, wrote the letter using a handwriting style resembling printed letters to avoid revealing the writer's identity. In the letter, they asked Samad Vurgun about the reasons why the Writers' Union had only 60 members, why the national rights of Azerbaijanis were not being ensured, and why scientific books were not being translated into Azerbaijani. They also declared that they had sworn to fight for the independence of the Azerbaijani people until the very end and expressed their support for Samad Vurgun. If he agreed with their views, they asked him to write a poem titled \"Stars of the Motherland.\" There is no information on whether the letter ever reached Samad Vurgun. In 1946, the organization ceased its activities due to internal disagreements among its members.\nAfter the letter fell into the hands of the NKVD, in 1945, dictations were conducted for students in all higher education institutions in Azerbaijan. Based on the handwriting, it was determined that the letter written to Samad Vurgun was penned by Ismikhan Rahimov. Later, he was monitored for a while. After gathering sufficient evidence, on September 26, 1948, Ismikhan Rahimov was arrested first, followed by Haji Zeynalov and the other six members. On the 21st and 22nd of 1949, the Criminal Court Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Azerbaijan SSR delivered the verdict. Gulhuseyn Abdullayev, Ismikhan Rahimov, and Haji Zeynalov were sentenced to 25 years, while the other five were sentenced to 10 years in prison. Exiled to a labor correction camp in Siberia, Ismikhan Rahimov worked as a paramedic there. After Stalin's death, he was released in 1955 and was acquitted in 1956.\nAfter returning to Baku, he resumed his education in postgraduate studies. In 1959, he defended his dissertation dedicated to the works of",
    "Political Uber is a project of Russian politicians Dmitry Gudkov and Maxim Katz to help young and promising opposition candidates register for municipal elections and run election campaigns.\nName\nThe project gained popularity under this name because of the analogy with the popular taxi service. The name embodies the maximum simplification of the user experience, including through the use of information technology with elements of gamification: for example, the overly complicated task of submitting documents for registration as a candidate in elections in the \"political Uber\" was presented in the form of a quest.\nGoals of the project\nIf you are against Putin, we will help you\u2014\u200aMaxim Katz\nAccording to Katz, access to participation in politics in Russia is too complicated, it is difficult even for entrepreneurs with money, not to mention less socially protected segments of the population, such as pensioners. According to Katz, such difficulties are created deliberately by the current government. The goal of \"political Uber\" is to eliminate such difficulties, to simplify access to elections for everyone.\nAccording to Gudkov, the project is focused on newcomers to politics who do not know how to collect signatures, fill out subscription lists, solve other similar problems, and only with the help of \"uberization\" of the process can they successfully pass registration and get a chance to be elected deputies. Also, according to Gudkov, the project was focused on people who are dissatisfied with the fact that the authorities do not hear them. \"Political Uber\" offered such people a convenient infrastructure in order to nominate themselves as candidates, so that later, if elected, they would begin to influence the situation, first in their own regions, and then at the national level. Opponents of Vladimir Putin and supporters of the European path of development were invited to the project.\nCampaign in Moscow\nIn 2017, \"Political Uber\" was first launched in the Moscow municipal elections under the brand \"United Democrats\".\nOf the 266 deputies supported by the project, 177 were nominated by the Yabloko party, which made the party the second largest in the city in terms of the number of deputy mandates. Commenting on the election results for Yabloko, Grigory Yavlinsky called Maxim Katz an \"effective ally\" and noted the involvement of young people in the elections.\nAs one of the key methods of campaigning, door-to-door canvassing of voters was used, which, according to Gudkov, made it possible to compensate for the authorities' silence about the elections. As a result, 267 out of 1046 candidates of the project became deputies in 62 districts. Candidates from the \"political Uber\" received about 20% of the votes, and in 7 districts of Moscow not a single candidate from United Russia was elected.\nLater, in January 2018, Dmitry Gudkov broke off cooperation with Maxim Katz due to disagreements regarding Yabloko and the election observation project.\nCampaign in St. Petersburg\nIn 2019, before the municipal elections in St. Petersburg, the project was divided: Maxim Katz organized his own headquarters to support candidates on the basis of the Yabloko party, while Dmitry Gudkov, in turn, transferred the United Democrats brand to the public organization Open Russia, which organized the headquarters under the same name. Also in 2019, the St. Petersburg Navalny Headquarters performed similar functions of supporting candidates in St. Petersburg under its own brand spb.vote.\nThe Yabloko headquarters received about 1,800 applications for nomination, a strict selection of candidates was carried out according to their political views. According to Maxim Katz, there were falsifications of the election results. As a result of the campaign, 99 people were elected deputies in 31 districts of the city.\nNotes\n",
    "German ironclad gunboat\nSMS Viper was an ironclad gunboat of the Wespe class built for the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) in the 1870s. The ships, which were armed with a single 30.5\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) MRK L/22 gun, were intended to serve as part of a coastal defense fleet.\nDesign\nMain article: Wespe-class gunboat\nPlan and profile of the Wespe class in their original configuration\nDevelopment of the Wespe class of ironclad gunboats began in the 1850s, after the first ironclads were introduced during the Crimean War. Through the 1860s, the Federal Convention examined various proposals, which included plans to build at least eight vessels, to as many as eighteen armored warships. The decision was finalized based on the fleet plan conceived by General Albrecht von Stosch, the new Chief of the Kaiserliche Admiralit\u00e4t (Imperial Admiralty), in the early 1870s. He envisioned a fleet oriented on defense of Germany's Baltic and North Sea coasts, which would be led by the ironclad corvettes of the Sachsen class. These were to be supported by larger numbers of small, armored gunboats, which became the Wespe class.\nViper was 46.4 meters (152\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) long overall, with a beam of 10.6\u00a0m (34\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in) and a draft of 3.2 to 3.4\u00a0m (10 to 11\u00a0ft). She displaced 1,098 metric tons (1,081 long tons) as designed and 1,163\u00a0t (1,145 long tons) at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 3\u00a0officers and 73 to 85\u00a0enlisted men. She was powered by a pair of double-expansion steam engines that drove a pair of 4-bladed screw propellers, with steam provided by four coal-fired cylindrical fire-tube boilers, which gave her a top speed of 10.4 knots (19.3\u00a0km/h; 12.0\u00a0mph) at 800 metric horsepower (790\u00a0ihp). At a cruising speed of 7 knots (13\u00a0km/h; 8.1\u00a0mph), she could steam for 700 nautical miles (1,300\u00a0km; 810\u00a0mi).\nThe ship was armed with one 30.5\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) MRK L/22 gun in a barbette mount that had a limited arc of traverse. In practice, the gun was aimed by turning the ship in the direction of fire. The Wespes were intended to beach themselves on the sandbars along the German coastline to serve as semi-mobile coastal artillery batteries. The armored barbette was protected by 203\u00a0mm (8\u00a0in) of wrought iron, backed with 210\u00a0mm (8.3\u00a0in) of teak. The ship was fitted with a waterline armor belt that was 102 to 203\u00a0mm (4 to 8\u00a0in) thick, with the thickest section protecting the propulsion machinery spaces and ammunition magazine. The belt was backed with 210\u00a0mm of teak. An armor deck that consisted of two layers of 22\u00a0mm (0.87\u00a0in) of iron on 28\u00a0mm (1.1\u00a0in) of teak provided additional protection against enemy fire.\nService history\nProfile drawing of the Wespe class as they appeared c. 1900\nViper was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in May 1875, and she was launched on 21 September 1876. The second member of her class to be built, she was named after the family of venomous snakes. Work on the ship was completed early the following year, and she was commissioned into active service on 27 March 1877 to carry out her initial sea trials, after which she was placed in reserve for the next eight years. During this period, by 1883, the ship had been refitted with an additional 8.7\u00a0cm (3.4\u00a0in) L/24 built-up guns, a pair of 37\u00a0mm (1.5\u00a0in) Hotchkiss revolver cannon, and two 35\u00a0cm (14\u00a0in) torpedo tubes in her bow, both of which were below the waterline.\nViper was recommissioned on 20 August 1885 for training exercises carried out with her sister ships Wespe, Salamander, and M\u00fccke, which were led by the screw corvette Stein. These concluded by 14 September, when Viper was decommissioned for the winter months. While she was out of service, she was allocated to the Reserve Division of the North Sea. She recommissioned on 11 May 1886 for another training period that lasted until 9 June. She exercised with Wespe, Salamander, and their sister Camaeleon at that time. Viper next returned to service on 16 August 1887, and that year, she and the rest of the gunboats in the North Sea joined the main fleet for the annual autumn exercises. These had concluded by 14 September, when the ship was decommissioned again.\nOn 15 August 1888, Viper was recommissioned, under command of Kapit\u00e4nleutnant (KL\u2014Captain Lieutenant) Oskar von Truppel, for another brief training period that lasted until 15 September. That year, she was moved to the newly created II Reserve Division of the North Sea. The next two years followed a similar pattern; she participated in training exercises from 13 August to 20 September 1890 and then from 4 August to 22 September 1891, the last time she would be commissioned. The last year, she was captained by KL Karl Dick. The ship was struck from the naval register on 28 June 1909 and then converted into a crane ship between 1909 and 1910. She was initially based at the island of Helgoland. The ship had a lifting capacity of 100\u00a0t (98 long tons; 110 short tons). She was later moved to Wilhelmshaven, and then other ports.\nIn May 1918, Viper was sent ",
    "Pacific tropical storm\nThis article is about the 2024 tropical storm. For other storms of the same name, see List of storms named Soulik and List of storms named Gener.\nTropical Storm Soulik, known in the Philippines as Tropical Depression Gener, was a weak tropical cyclone that impacted both the Philippines and Vietnam. It formed as the fifteenth named storm of the annual typhoon season in September 2024, Soulik originated from a low-pressure area to the east-northeast of Manila, Philippines on September 14, when it was designated as tropical depression Gener due to its formation within the Philippine Area of Responsibility on September 16. The system gradually shifted westward along the southern edge of a mid-level subtropical high, making landfall in Palanan, Isabela, on September 17. As it traveled further into Luzon, it weakened while encountering the rugged terrain of the Cordillera Central. After emerging over the South China Sea on the next day, the system displayed a broad, disorganized low-level circulation. Although two disturbances in the South China Sea were initially expected to merge closer to Vietnam, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center considered merging these disturbances into one system. Early the next day, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm named Soulik by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). Soulik made landfall near Quang Binh and Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb, Vietnam, at around 2 p.m. local time. It quickly weakened to a tropical depression due to land interaction, and the JMA continued to monitor the system until it dissipated on September 20.\nThe combined effects of Soulik, the southwest monsoon, and Typhoons Bebinca, Pulasan, and Igme have resulted in at least 26 fatalities, 18 injuries, and three missing persons in the Philippines, with total damages amounting to \u20b11.11 billion (US$22.63 million); in Vietnam, heavy rains from Soulik have led to three deaths and one injury, while in Thailand, officials in Nakhon Phanom have swiftly initiated water pumping operations into the Mekong River due to heavy rainfall, and the Meteorology and Hydrology Department has reported that the remnants of Soulik and associated wind waves are affecting the southeastern areas of Myanmar.\nMeteorological history\nMap plotting the storm's track and intensity, according to the Saffir\u2013Simpson scaleMap key Saffir\u2013Simpson scale  \u00a0 Tropical\u00a0depression (\u226438\u00a0mph,\u00a0\u226462\u00a0km/h) \u00a0 Tropical\u00a0storm (39\u201373\u00a0mph,\u00a063\u2013118\u00a0km/h) \u00a0 Category\u00a01 (74\u201395\u00a0mph,\u00a0119\u2013153\u00a0km/h) \u00a0 Category\u00a02 (96\u2013110\u00a0mph,\u00a0154\u2013177\u00a0km/h) \u00a0 Category\u00a03 (111\u2013129\u00a0mph,\u00a0178\u2013208\u00a0km/h) \u00a0 Category\u00a04 (130\u2013156\u00a0mph,\u00a0209\u2013251\u00a0km/h) \u00a0 Category\u00a05 (\u2265157\u00a0mph,\u00a0\u2265252\u00a0km/h) \u00a0 Unknown    Storm type  Tropical cyclone  Subtropical cyclone  Extratropical cyclone, remnant low, tropical disturbance, or monsoon depression \nThe origins of Tropical Storm Soulik can be traced back to September 14, when the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported that a low-pressure area had formed approximately 596\u00a0km (371\u00a0mi) east-northeast of Manila, Philippines. At 00:00 UTC on September 15, the JMA identified the system as a tropical depression, featuring a defined, partially exposed low-level circulation and persistent deep convection over the southwest quadrant. At 13:00 UTC on September 16, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA), indicating that upper-level conditions were marginal, with low to moderate vertical wind shear and weak outflow aloft. On that same day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) announced that the system had developed into a tropical depression and named Gener, as it formed within the Philippine Area of Responsibility. The system was gradually shifting westward along the southern edge of a mid-level subtropical high, and at 23:00 PHT (15:00 UTC) on September 16, the storm made landfall in Palanan, Isabela.\nThe tropical depression traveled further into Luzon and weakened as it encountered the rugged terrain of the Cordillera Central. As it emerged over the South China Sea at 14:00 PHT (06:00 UTC) on the next day, the system displayed a broad disorganized low-level circulation. The depresion had conditions that were conducive to tropical cyclogenesis, featuring warm sea surface temperatures of 29\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F) and low vertical wind shear. On September 18, the JTWC canceled their TCFA due to an obscured low-level circulation with flaring convection, while the depression had drifted into an area of moderate vertical wind shear. Earlier, two disturbances in the South China Sea near 98W and 99W were expected to merge and strengthen at 98W, closer to Vietnam, and shortly after, the system was classified as tropical depression 16W, showing rapidly consolidating deep convection that has organized significantly over the past six hours. However, the JTWC was considering the merging of two disturbances in the South China Sea into one system. Early the following day, the depr",

Sotirakis moved away from Nezera and established himself at Vostitsa (modern Aigio), where he founded a new branch of the family. He quickly distinguished himself for his prudence and courage. After being sent as vekil (representative) of the Morea to the Sublime Porte, on his return in 1799 he was named to the position of mora ayan (\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2), i.e. the most senior rank of the local notables of the Peloponnese (Morea), who were members of the provincial council advising the governor of the Morea Eyalet. He was accorded the special privilege of being consulted on the choice of the local archbishops, aiming to ensure that no foreigners were appointed to such posts.\nHe was executed by decapitation on 13 December 1812 (O.S.) at Tripoli by the Ottoman governor of the Morea. His son, Andreas Londos, became an important military and political leader of the Greek War of Independence and in the subsequent Kingdom of Greece.\n",

    "Mali attack by jihadist insurgents\nOn 17 September 2024, gunmen attacked several locations across Bamako, the capital of Mali, including police and military installations. At least 77 people were killed and more than 255 others were injured. The Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM), an Islamist militant group affiliated with al-Qaeda, claimed responsibility.\nBackground\nMain article: Mali War\nMali has been in a state of conflict since 2012, with fighting variously instigated by groups linked to Al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, Tuareg rebels, self-declared defence forces, and bandits. In an effort to resolve the situation, the Malian Armed Forces ousted the civilian government in a 2020 coup and resorted to allowing the entry of Russian mercenaries to fight insurgents after expelling French forces. Bamako itself had largely been unaffected by the fighting, with the last related incident being an attack on the Radisson Blu hotel in 2015 that killed 20 people.\nAttacks\nThe attacks began in the early morning of 17 September 2024 at around 05:00, when gunmen attacked several locations across Bamako including the Banankabougou neighbourhood, the Faladie military police school housing elite units of the Malian gendarmerie in the southeast of Bamako, and the nearby military airport, which the JNIM claimed to have fully taken. The attacks prompted the closure of Modibo Keita International Airport, which adjoins the military airport, while clashes were also reported at a police station controlling access to the former. The JNIM claimed to have destroyed six aircraft, including several fighter planes, and a drone, and opened fire at a drone platform and the presidential hangar of the military airport. An aircraft used for humanitarian work by the World Food Programme was also damaged on the ground, according to its owner, the South African\u2013based National Airways Corporation, adding that its crew and staff were secured in a safe house. The attacks were also said to have set fire to several buildings and infrastructure.\nThe attacks lasted for about nine hours before being finally put down by Malian government forces later in the day, with the Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces, Major General Oumar Diarra visiting the Faladie school and stating that all the \"terrorists\" who attacked the facility had been \"neutralised\".\nCasualties\nNo official numbers of casualties were released by authorities. As such, estimates of the casualties varied, with the death toll ranging from 77 to more than 100, while 255 others were injured. Among the dead were 50 military police students who were buried on 19 September. At least 20 militants were believed to have been captured, while the JNIM acknowledged the loss of a few dozen of its fighters while inflicting \"hundreds\" of casualties, including on members of the Wagner Group. One security person of the United Nations was also injured.\nIn the aftermath of the attack, one person was set on fire by residents on suspicion of being a militant.\nReactions\nMali's military government downplayed the incident with officials stating the situation was \"under control\" and the attack had been repelled. Officials later admitted the military had suffered casualties.\nThe attacks were condemned by multiple countries and organisations including the United Nations, the African Union, ECOWAS, Senegal, France and the United Kingdom. The World Food Programme said the loss of one of its aircraft at Bamako Airport \"reduces our humanitarian response capacity\", noting that the plane was used to \"transport aid workers and provide emergency humanitarian aid in remote areas of Mali\".\nCriticism of the attacks within Mali was limited due to severe restrictions on freedom of expression by the ruling military junta, with the exception of a few media outlets such as the Senegalese newspaper Nouvel Horizon, which wrote that it was \"time to apportion blame at all levels\". On 19 September, Abdoulaye Coulibaly, the governor of Bamako, ordered the indefinite closure of seven livestock markets in the city for \"reasons of public order\", raising concerns that it was being used to target members of the Fulani ethnic group, who operate most of the markets and are accused of supporting Islamist militants due to high membership rates in the said groups.\nOn 24 September, Mali's military leader Assimi Go\u00efta held a meeting with the country's defence establishment to review security arrangements and \"adjust strategy\". Goita also paid tribute to the victims of the attack, adding that it showed \"the imperative need to remain vigilant and maintain an exemplary operational stance in all circumstances\".\nJean-Herve Jezequel, Sahel project director at the International Crisis Group, said that one possible reason for the attack could be that \"the jihadists are trying to send a message to the Malian authorities that they can hit them anywhere and therefore that the big cities must also be protected\". He said the militants may want to force ",

    "Species of frog\nHyloxalus spilotogaster is a species of frog in the family Dendrobatidae.  It is known from a single specimen found in Peru.\nDescription\nThe single specimen, an adult female, measured 24.0 mm in snout-vent length. She had expanded climbing disks and fringed skin on the toes of all four feet. In preservative, the skin of the head and body was dull brown with some dark brown stripes. The lips were cream-white in color. The sides of the body were brown with some white marks. There were light brown stripes on flanks from the nose over the eye to where the hind legs meet the body. These were bordered by a dark brown stripe below each. The tops of the back legs were light brown with some other brown spots. The rest of the back legs were brown with some white spots. The front legs were light brown with dark brown lines. The belly was cream-white in color with brown spots.\nHabitat\nScientists known this frog exclusively from the type locality in Utcubamba Province in Amazonas, 2326 meters above sea level in the Cordillera Col\u00e1n. They observed exactly one female frog and no male frogs. She was on the leaf litter in a cloud forest. Scientists believe that the frog's tadpoles swim in streams, but they did not observe any.\nThreats\nThe IUCN classifies this species as data deficient. Scientists believe the fungal disease chytridiomycosis may pose a threat because it killed so many other stream-breeding, high-elevation-dwelling frogs in Peru, but they do not know for certain.\nOriginal description\nDuellman, W.

    "Urban park in Warsaw, Poland\nThe Krasi\u0144ski Garden (Polish: Ogr\u00f3d Krasi\u0144skich) is an urban park in Warsaw, Poland, within the neighbourhood of Muran\u00f3w in the Downtown district. It is located between \u015awi\u0119tojerska, Andersa, Stare Nalewki, and D\u0142uga Street, and borders Krasi\u0144ski Square to the east.\nThe park was designed in Baroque style, and developed in 1676, as a garden complex of the Krasi\u0144ski Palace. With the original area of 3.4 ha, it was the largest parks in Warsaw, until the opening of the Saxon Garden in 1724. In 1765, it was bought by the state, and turned into a public park opened in 1768. It was heavily redesigned between 1891 and 1895 by the main city gardener, Franciszek Szanior, and redeveloped in the style of an English landscape garden. After the end of the Second World War, it was enlarged to its current area of 11.8 ha. It was renovated between 2012 and 2014.\nHistory\nThe park gate at Stare Nalewski Street in the 1920s.\nThe Krasi\u0144ski Garden was founded in 1676, as the garden complex of the Krasi\u0144ski Palace, which was constructed between 1677 and 1695, as a residence of Jan Dobrogost Krasi\u0144ski, the voivode of the P\u0142ock Voivodeship. The garden was designed in the Baroque style, and with the area of 3.4 ha, it was the largest parks in Warsaw, until the opening of the Saxon Garden in 1724.\nThe palace and its gardens were bought in 1765 by the state, and turned into a park opened to the public on 1 April 1768. It was heavily redesigned between 1891 and 1895 by the main city gardener, Franciszek Szanior, and redeveloped in the style of an English landscape garden. There was also created an artificial lake, known as the Krasi\u0144ski Garden Pond.\nIn the evening of 29 November 1830, during the November Uprising, the insurgents fought and won in a skirmish at the western edge of the park, which subsequently allowed them to capture the Royal Arsenal and weaponry that was stored there. Currently, the event is commemorated with a plaque on a rock, placed in the park near Andersa Street.\nIn 1940, during the Second World War, while the city remained under the German occupation, outside the park, alongside current \u015awi\u0119tojerska and Stare Nalewski Streets, were erected the walls of the Warsaw Ghetto. In 1944, during the Warsaw Uprising the park and surrounding area became a sight of fighting between Polish insurgents and German forces. This included the Chrobry I Battalion of the Home Army, which set up there a redoubt blocking the access to the Old Town. It was placed in the ruins of Simons Passage store complex. It was bombed on 31 August 1944, by the German Air Force. In the event died over 200 people, 120 of whom, were soldiers of the Polish resistance. After the war, the park was enlarged to 11.8 ha, incorporating the land, which was previously occupied by the formerly-neighbouring it buildings, that were destroyed in the war.\nIn the 1930s, prior to the war, under the park was constructed the bunker for the city mayor, then Stefan Starzy\u0144ski. While he never used it, it became a shelter for the population of the nearby tenements during the conflict. After the war, it was used by the government as the archives. It survives to the present day. It has eight rooms with the height of 2.5, and enforced walls which are 1.3 m thick.\nOn 12 November 1963, at the garden square next to the park, near Andersa Street, was unveiled the monument dedicated to the soldiers of the First Polish Army that fought in the Second World War. It was designed by Xawery Dunikowski.\nIn 1965, the garden and the palace complex was given the statues of a protected cultural property.\nOn 31 August 1989, in the park, near Stare Nalewski Street, was unveiled a monument dedicated to the soldiers of the Chrobry I Battalion, designed by Jerzy Pietras. It was placed in the location of the former Simons Passage building. On 30 May 1999, in the garden square right outside the park's western gate at Stare Nalewski Street, was unveiled the monument dedicated to the Allies soldiers that fought in the Battle of Monte Cassino in 1944 during the Second World War. It was designed by Gustaw Zem\u0142a and Wojciech Zab\u0142ocki.\nAt the turn of 20th century, the trees and plants of the park were allowed to spread naturally across the park, altering its original landscape concept, while enriching its biodiversity.\nThe park underwent major renovation works between 2012 and 2014, with the goal of restoring it to its 19th-century design. There was erected a fence around the park, and the historic entrance gate at Stare Nalewki Street was renovated. 337 trees, one third of parks supply, were cut down. According to the renovators, half of them were removed due to their health.

    "\nOn September 15, 2024, Donald Trump, a former president of the United States and the nominee of the Republican Party in the 2024 presidential election, survived an alleged assassination attempt while golfing at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. A suspect, later identified as 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh, was spotted hiding in nearby shrubbery while aiming a rifle at a member of Trump's security detail. A Secret Service agent fired upon Routh, who fled the scene and was later captured in Martin County. No injuries were reported. Officials say that Routh intended to shoot Trump, and Routh had been indicted on five federal charges by September 24, including attempting to assassinate a presidential candidate. The incident occurred two months after Trump survived a previous assassination attempt while speaking at a campaign rally near Butler, Pennsylvania. Routh has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and a preliminary trial date has been set for November 18.\nBackground\nThe Trump International Golf Club had been noted as a potential target for attempts on Donald Trump's life. The incident occurred 64 days after a previous assassination attempt on Trump at a campaign rally near Butler, Pennsylvania, in which Trump was shot and wounded in his upper right ear by a sniper.  Law enforcement officials said that the golf course's perimeter was not fully secured as Trump was not an incumbent president. The Secret Service did not search the perimeter of the golf course, as Trump's visit there was not a scheduled event.\nIncident\nRouth being detained after the incident\nOn September 15, 2024, Donald Trump golfed at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, with his friend and donor Steve Witkoff. Trump was walking along the fifth hole when a Secret Service agent conducted a sweep of the sixth hole ahead of him for any threats. During the sweep, a man was seen aiming a rifle at the agent while hiding in shrubs approximately 400 yards (370\u00a0m) away. The position in which the man had been is well-known as a spot frequently used by paparazzi to photograph Trump at his golf course. At 1:31\u00a0p.m. EDT (approximately 12\u00a0hours after the gunman's 1:59\u00a0a.m. arrival), the agent, having seen the rifle barrel move, fired at the man, who dropped his weapon and fled in a vehicle.  After the shot was fired, Trump was escorted off the course by his Secret Service protective detail. The man did not have a clear line of sight on Trump and did not fire his gun. A witness took a photo of the suspect's vehicle, assisting authorities in tracking it down. The golf course was locked down shortly after the incident, and no injuries were reported.\nAfter the gunman fled the scene, a \"be on the lookout\" (BOLO) was issued to law enforcement with details about the suspect's car, a black Nissan SUV. After pulling over the vehicle, Martin County Sheriff's Office deputies forced the driver out of the car and arrested him at gunpoint. According to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, the driver was detained as a person of interest while he was driving northbound on Interstate 95 from Palm Beach County. The sheriff's units \"waited  a while\" to stop the vehicle to avoid engaging in a high-speed chase. An SKS-style rifle with a removed serial number, a scope, two backpacks containing ceramic tiles that could deflect a bullet, a plastic bag containing food, and a GoPro camera, were recovered at the scene. The driver was unarmed at the time of his arrest.\nAccused\nMain article: Ryan Wesley Routh\nShortly after the incident, authorities identified the suspect as Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old Hawaii resident who lived for most of his life in Greensboro, North Carolina.\nRouth had a history of political activity online and offline, with his political engagement dating back to at least 1996. Voting records showed that he did not vote in the 2016 elections, but in a 2020 Twitter post, he claimed to have voted for Trump in 2016 and later regretted it. In a self-published ebook in 2023, he wrote about his supposed previous support for Trump, saying, \"I am man enough to say that I misjudged and made a terrible mistake\". He reached out to Iran in his book, saying they should feel free to assassinate Trump for the United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as well as Routh himself for supporting Trump in the past. Routh condemned the January 6 Capitol attack as being \"perpetrated by Donald Trump and his undemocratic posse.\"\nAfter his disillusionment with Trump, Routh announced his support for various presidential opponents of Trump, including both Democratic and Republican presidential candidates. Additionally, Routh donated $140 to Democratic causes since 2019 and is registered in North Carolina as an independent voter. He voted in North Carolina's Democratic primary elections in 2024.\nRouth had multiple prior criminal charges, including a 2002 conviction for \"possessing a weapon of mass death and destruction\" a",

The prime suspect in at least 4 murders and a series of rapes in Leningrad Oblast, Russia, from 2006 to 2014, he was detained by Russian authorities and confessed to the crimes, but escaped during an investigative experiment on June 6, 2014.\nA month after this, Litovchenko murdered a girl in Kyiv, Ukraine, for which he was tried, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. Following his conviction, the Russian government requested for his extradition, but this never occurred due to the subsequent breakdown of diplomatic relations between the two countries. As a result, he was never prosecuted for the crimes he committed on Russian territory.\nEarly life\nYevgeny Litovchenko was born on March 8, 1971, in the village of Lisovichi, Kyiv Oblast, in the Ukrainian SSR. News sources claim that he grew up in a stable environment and that his parents had no known negative qualities that could affect his upbringing. After finishing school, Litovchenko graduated from a vocational school and began a career in manual labor.\nFollowing the collapse of the USSR and the economic reforms that followed, the Litovchenko family began to experience financial difficulties. During the 1990s, Yevgeny changed several jobs, mainly consisting of low-skilled labor, and in 1999, he left his native village, telling his parents that he was going to Saint Petersburg to earn money. Once in Russia, Litovchenko settled in Otradnoye, Leningrad Oblast, where he soon began raping underage girls. Although suspected in a total of eight rapes, he was only charged with three, convicted for these counts and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment in 2000, but served only nine before being paroled.\nArrest and exposure\nIn April 2014, Litovchenko tricked an eight-grade girl to accompany him to the forest near Gorodishchi in the Kirovsky District, where he raped her. According to the victim's testimony, Litovchenko attempted to strangle her after the assault, but she managed to fight back and escape. She remembered his features and the license plate on his car, leading to her assailant's arrest. During interrogations, Litovchenko quickly cracked under pressure and wrote four confessions describing various crimes, including at least four murders. These were the following:\nrape and murder of an underage girl at a penal colony in the Kingiseppsky District in 2006\nrape of two girls in Nevskaya Dubrovka in the summer of 2010\nrape and murder of a girl in a gardening community in the same area in 2012\nrape and murder of a 28-year-old woman in the Druzhba gardening community\nThe most notorious crime he admitted to was the murder of 6-year-old Pavel Kostyunin, who went missing from Otradnoye on December 6, 2011. He was last seen after leaving school, with various theories suggesting different possibilities about what had happened to him, including being abducted by gypsies or being killed in an automobile accident and the driver hiding the body. Kostyunin's parents were also initially held as suspects in his disappearance, but were released a polygraph test could not conclude with certainty that they were involved.\nAt the time, the Kostyunin case caused a huge outcry from the public, leading to Governor Alexander Drozdenko to offer a reward of 500,000 rubles for any information on the child's whereabouts. Litovchenko claimed that on that day, he was driving past the boy's house when he saw him, spontaneously stopped the car and abducted him. This was indirectly corroborated by the call history on Kostyunin's phone - a few minutes prior to his disappearance, he had called him mother and told her that he would be home any minute, after which he made an outgoing call that was quickly dropped and the phone was turned off after that.\nEscape\nDuring the course of the investigation, Litovchenko agreed to show where he had disposed of Kostyunin's body. Initially, he claimed that he had thrown it into the Neva and even indicated an approximate location where it supposedly washed ashore. However, he later changed his testimony to claiming he had strangled the boy and buried the body in a forest area 300 meters away from the Gorky Railway Station, near the 84th power line pole in Otradnoye.\nOn June 6, 2014, Litovchenko was brought to Otradnoye under escort from two police officers, Evgeny Kostyuk and Lt. Col. Denis Tsaryov. According to Kostyuk, after arriving in the area, Litovchenko asked to take off his jacket because it was too hot, after which Kostyuk handcuffed his hands from the front, but unhooked them from himself. Tsaryov noticed this, but did not react in any way. After that, another investigator, Alexander Rumyantsev, directed them to where they should go, but for unclear reasons did not accompany the two officers. Kostyuk cl",

It was likely built soon after the Viking's founding of Early Scandinavian Dublin in 849 AD, although a new stone may have been installed later.\nThe stone gave its name to the surrounding area and the nearby stein river as well as a local pub.\nHistory\nThe stone lay to the east of the city in an area known as Hoggen Green, Hogges Green or Hoggin Green and later referred to as Le Hogges in what is today the general vicinity of College Green, close to the old Viking Thingmote or Thingmount adjacent to what is today St Andrew's Church.\nIt was also located next to the Priory of All Hallows which evolved to become the site of Trinity College Dublin from 1592. In later years, the location also became the site of the Irish parliament at Chichester House from 1661 until it was reconstructed as Parliament House around 1728.\nThe stone was said to have been around 12 to 14 feet high. The use of the original stone is uncertain although it certainly acted as a general focal point and territory marker for the taking or retaking of Dublin. It may have also had pseudo religious or spiritual purpose. It is not clear if the stone was originally coloured as would be typical of a Viking runestone or originally contained information as with an Ogham stone or was just a general marker.\nThe stone was removed sometime before 1750 and it does not appear on John Rocque's 1756 map of Dublin. Its whereabouts are unknown as of 2024 although it is likely it is still extant in the general Dublin area as an architectural feature or used as a building material.\nSteine river\nThe stone and area gave its name to a nearby stream which was referred to as either the Steine, styne or Stein. This stream had its source near Charlemont Bridge and its mouth at Burgh Quay where it joined the Liffey. As of 2024, the stream has been culverted and cannot be seen above ground.\nReplacements\nSir Philip Crampton's memorial\nA memorial sculpture to the surgeon Sir Philip Crampton by Joseph Kirk was later erected near the site in 1862 and existed until 1959 when it partially collapsed and then was destroyed as part of road widening works. The statue was sometimes referred to as \"the cauliflower\".\nLong Stone replica\nA replacement 11 foot tall stein or sculptural pillar made of granite was erected on College Street, Dublin in 1986 near the site of the Crampton Memorial. The sculpture was designed by Cliodhna Cussen. The face of Ivar the Boneless has been carved into the base of the standing stone.\n",

    "Ghanaian political party\nThe Progressive Alliance for Ghana is a political party in Ghana.\nHistory\nThe party was formed to forward the ideas of Kwame Nkrumah, the first President of Ghana. A group of Ghanaians in North America came together to form the Concerned Nkrumahists of North America (CNNA). It initially set about trying to unite the various parties in Ghana who followed Nkrumah's ideology. The parties include the Convention People's Party (CPP), the People's National Convention (PNC) and the Progressive People's Party (PPP). After these efforts failed, they decided to form their own party. In 2018, in association with the Social Justice Movement of Ghana (SJMG), they decided to start a political party to promote Nkrumah's ideas. Other grassroots Nkrumah organisations were also involved. They announced that they would be inaugurating the party on 1 July 2024 at Cape Coast.\n2024 election\nIn August 2024, John Enyonam Kwakwu Kpikpi was announced as the presidential candidate of the party.

    "2024 human-caused wildfires\nThe 2024 Peru wildfires are a series of wildfires that began in July 2024 and continued into September, causing at least 16 deaths and the burning of about 3,000 hectares  (7,400 acres) of forest, protected areas, and agricultural land in 22 of 24 Peruvian regions. The source of the fires was stated by Prime Minister of Peru Gustavo Adrianz\u00e9n to primarily be human activity.\nWildfires\nWildfires first began to appear in July 2024. The Peruvian civil defense head Juan Urcariegui reported that the worst wildfires were in the Amazon near the border of Ecuador. Peru's National Forestry and Wildlife Service, SERFOR, said that the primary reason for the fires' rapid spread was due to \"extremely strong winds and prolonged droughts  dry out vegetation, turning it into highly flammable fuel\" that was strongly exacerbated by anthropogenic climate change. Amazon Watch reported that increased temperatures resulted in drought conditions that prevented moisture and mist from staying in the region, causing stronger and more numerous wildfires that contribute to further greenhouse gas emissions in a feedback loop.\nData from Peru's Ministry of the Environment said that many wildfires were regularly caused between August and November by farmers' and land traffickers' burning of dry grasslands in order to increase the amount of land open for sale or agriculture.\nImpact\nThe largest wildfire outbreaks were detected in the departments of Amazonas, Ancash, Cuzco, Madre de Dios, San Martin, and Ucayali. By 15 September, 222 fire emergencies were reported, of which 80% had been contained by then.\nPeru's civil defense reported that as a result of the widespread wildfires, at least 15 civilians were killed and 134 more were injured. Of these, 10 died in a two-week period from early-mid September, and 1,800 more civilians were impacted by the fires.\nResponse\nPrime Minister of Peru Gustavo Adrianz\u00e9n reported that aerial firefighting efforts were strongly hindered by the presence of smoke from the wildfires, along with high cloud cover and strong winds. He also pleaded to farmers and the rest of Peru to stop burning grasslands, stating that \"All the fires that are happening nationwide have been started by humans\".\nMany firefighters and firefighting volunteers were forced to use alternative tactics to put out and stop the spread of fires in hard-to-reach sections, such as by striking the ground with branches. Governor of Ucayali Manuel Gambini requested that military aircraft be used to aid firefighting efforts  and protect cocoa and palm crops due to the rugged terrain making ground operations difficult.\nSee also\n2024 Argentina wildfires\n2024 Brazil wildfires\n2024 South American wildfires\n2023\u20132024 South American drought\n2019 Amazon rainforest wildfires",

The excavated areas of the site were used at different times as a cemetery and a settlement. The finds from the site date mostly from the Second Intermediate Period, encompassing the period from the late Middle Kingdom to the early New Kingdom. The site exhibits burial practices of non-Egyptian origin, including donkey burials, attested at other eastern Delta sites during the period (such as Tell el-Dab'a, Tell Basta, Tell el-Yahudiya). The settlement architecture is comparable to that of the nearby site Tell el-Maskhuta. Along with other sites at the Wadi Tumilat, Tell el-Ku\u02bf is considered to be involved in trade contacts between Second Intermediate Period Egypt and the Levant.\nThe site was excavated in 1987 by Ibrahim M. Soleman, later by Nabil el-Sherif, M. Salem el-Hangury, Nasr Allah el-Kelany, and\nSoleman Mahmoud, and since 2018 by Aiman Ashmawy Ali.\nTell el-Mansheya\nJust 200 meters to the west of Tell el-Ku\u02bf lies another Second Intermediate Period archaeological site Tell el-Mansheya (Arabic \u062a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0634\u064a\u0629) Salvage excavations conducted in 2015 revealed settlement remains and burials.

    "Distilled spirit, liqueur and cocktail blend\nDesmondJi is a brand of alcoholic beverages manufactured by Agave India, founded by Desmond Nazareth.\nIt provides Indian agave spirits,  artisanal sugarcane spirit, mahua spirit and mahua liqueur as well as orange liqueurs.\nDesmondJi launched India's first agave-based liquor in April 2011, in Goa. It is made from semi-wild agave growing on India's Deccan Plateau  and produced at Agave India's micro-distillery that's located in the Chittoor district (present day Annamayya district) of Andhra Pradesh.\nPure Cane, made from sugarcane was released in 2013 and was the second category of spirits launched by DesmondJi.\nIn 2018 DesmondJi launched mahua spirit and mahua liqueur made from the flowers of the mahua tree, that were sourced from the central Indian forest belt.\nHistory\nIn the 1980s Desmond Nazareth, an alum of IIT Madras, went to America to study filmmaking at Temple University, Philadelphia. During this time he began making cocktails for friends and family. The Margarita was an indispensable part of his repertoire. When Desmond moved back to Mumbai, India, in the year 2000, he found that the main ingredient of the Margarita, Tequila, was both difficult and expensive to procure.\nWondering why Tequila, which is made from the agave plant, was only made in Mexico, but almost all equally well known alcoholic beverages have multiple producers in multiple countries; this is true for Whisky, Brandy, Rum, Gin, Vodka, Beer and Wine, Desmond set about researching the plant and the conditions for its growth. On remembering having seen the plant somewhere in India during his childhood, Nazareth compared the agave-growing regions in Mexico to India and found a match in the Deccan Plateau, where he finally located the plant.\nIn 2007, Desmond started Agave India, a craft distillery that uses Indian know-how and raw materials, and launched the brand DesmondJi in 2011.\n",

    "\nIn molecular biology, the HotDog domain is a protein structural motif found in a diverse superfamily of enzymes, primarily thioesterases and dehydratases. The name \"HotDog\" refers to its characteristic structure, where a central \u03b1-helix (the \"sausage\") is wrapped by a curved \u03b2-sheet (the \"bun\").\nStructure\nThe HotDog domain consists of a central \u03b1-helix (typically 5 turns long) and an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet (usually 5-7 strands) that wraps around the \u03b1-helix. The basic structural unit of HotDog domain proteins is typically a homodimer, formed by the association of two monomers or two tandem copies of the domain. However, more complex quaternary structures, including tetramers and hexamers, have been observed.\nFunction\nProteins containing the HotDog domain are primarily involved in thioester hydrolysis, various ehydration reactions and acyl transfer reactions. Hotdog fold protein play roles in various metabolic pathways, such as fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation, polyketide biosynthesis and phenylacetic acid degradation.\nEnzyme families\nThe HotDog domain superfamily includes several enzyme families, such as:\n4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterases\nFabA-like dehydratases\nYbgC-like acyl-CoA thioesterases\nTesB-like thioesterases\nMaoC dehydratase-like enzymes\nCatalytic mechanism\nThe catalytic mechanism of HotDog domain enzymes varies depending on the specific enzyme and reaction. However, many of these enzymes share common features in their active sites including a conserved catalytic triad or dyad, often including aspartate, glutamate, or serine residues. A nucleophilic attack mechanism, typically involving an activated water molecule and substrate binding sites that accommodate the CoA moiety and the acyl group.\nEvolution and distribution\nHotDog domain proteins are found in all three domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota. Their widespread distribution suggests an ancient evolutionary origin. Despite low overall sequence similarity, the structural conservation of the HotDog fold implies a common ancestor for these diverse enzymes.\nSee also\nProtein fold\nThioesterase\nDehydratase\nFatty acid synthesis",

The white dwarf is massive and has a mass of 1.00 \u00b1 0.02 M\u2609. The cooling age was determined to be 9.5\u00b10.2 Gyrs and the total age is 9.7\u00b10.2 Gyrs. A more recent work found a higher temperature and younger cooling age of about 6.4 Gyrs. The researchers detected sodium, lithium and weak calcium absorption. The researchers also detected infrared excess, indicative of a debris disk, around this white dwarf. The disk is inclined by 70\u00b0, has an inner disk temperature of 1,500 K and an outer disk temperature of 500 K. In the past WD 2317+1830 had a mass of 4.8 \u00b1 0.2 M\u2609 and was likely a B-type star.\nSee also\nList of exoplanets and planetary debris around white dwarfs\nWD J2356\u2212209 is another cool white dwarf with sodium detected\nLSPM J0207+3331 is another old white dwarf with a disk detected",
    "\nThe Battle of Paneriai (Russian: \u0421\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u041f\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0445; Polish: Bitwa pod Ponarami), also known as Battle of Vilnius was one of the most important events of the November uprising, when on June 19, 1831, Antoni Gie\u0142gud's corps of the Army of Congress Poland and Lithuanian insurgents was defeated near Vilnius, leading to a defeat of the Uprising of 1831 in Lithuania.\nBackground\nEthnically Lithuanian lands began widespread insurgency in early 1831 as they rose in support of the 1830 November Uprising that started in Warsaw. The Army of Congress Poland did not immediately advance into Lithuania after the defeat near Ostro\u0142\u0119ka. Therefore, Gie\u0142gud went on an expedition to Vilnius with 12,000 men.\nActions in Lithuania\nIn Lithuania, 12,000 insurgents joined Gie\u0142gud's corps. However, Gie\u0142gud made several mistakes and delayed the attack. Thus, Russian reinforcements managed to arrive in Vilnius, lining up at the front and taking up convenient defensive positions, the forces were equal: 24,000 rebels against 24,000 Russians.\nThe place of battle\nThe Russians took up quite strong positions, but they were narrow and it was impossible to deploy enough troops, the escape routes were also blocked, which means that the slightest failure would lead to disaster.\nBattle\nGie\u0142gud's inept command led to inconsistencies along the entire front, instead of a joint attack, the Polish-Lithuanian engaged in battles in parts, the infantry attacked before the artillery deployed and suffered heavy losses.\nThe roundabout measures also failed, Rolland stumbled upon the Russian guard and returned having lost part of the troops.\nRussian gradually turned to attacks, but the actions of the cavalry were not so successful, the cavalry battle ended with a Polish-Lithuanian victory, and the Russian cavalry in a scattered form led them to the positions of the artillery, the battle could have been lost, but the infantry hit the main troops of Roland in time and the Polish-Lithuanian forces retreated.\nThe pursuit could not be organized due to the orders of the high command, although with it the entire corps of 20,000 could be exterminated. The main reason for the defeat of the Polish-Lithuanian forces lay in the inability to conduct joint actions, while the Russians acted with good coordination. Gie\u0142gud reached the Prussian border and wanted to cross it, but was killed by his own soldiers.\nAftermath\nMonument to the battle\nPolish-Lithuanian forces lost up to 2,000, but government army lost only 364 men. Most of the Lithuanian rebels dispersed after the battle, which was a heavy defeat that put an end to the uprising in Lithuania.\n",
    "South African linguist, writer, Afrikaans linguistic patriot and politician\nS.P.E. Boshoff (Stephanus (\"Fanie\") Petrus Erasmus Boshoff, 14 July 1891, Vaalbank, Senekal, South Africa \u2013 30 April 1973, Potgietersrus, South Africa) was a South African Afrikaner linguist, writer, adapter of plays and promoter of the use of the Afrikaans language.\nYoung years\nBoshoff was born on July 14, 1891, at Senekal, Orange Free State, to Johannes Jurgens Boshoff (1847 \u2013 1918), a Volksraad member and commander in the Second Boer War (1899\u20131902), and Jacoba Christina de Waal (1848 \u2013 1919). Young Boshoff only went to school after the war when his mother had returned from a British concentration camp. He attended a primary school at Riebeek West, Cape Colony, and in 1911 graduated from Grey University College at Bloemfontein with a distinguished B.A. degree. He then taught school in Senekal (1912) and Bloemfontein (1913), while studying at Grey for a M.A. degree in English and Dutch. He left for the Netherlands to obtain a M.A. degree at the University of Amsterdam, but the outbreak of the First World War caused him to return to South Africa. There Boshoff joined the Maritz rebellion (1914 \u2013 1915) under general C.F. Beyers (1869 \u2013 1914), an experience he described in his 1918 book Rebellie - Sketse uit mij dagboek, 1914-1915 (Rebellion. Sketches from my diary, 1914\u20131915).\nCareer\nIn 1915 Boshoff obtained a temporary position as a successor of professor Jan Kamp at the Teologiese Skool at Potchefstroom. Two years later he was appointed a professor of English, Dutch and History at Potchefstroom Universiteitskollege (later North-West University). In 1920, he went on leave to the Netherlands to obtain a PhD degree with his 1921 dissertation Volk en taal van Suid-Afrika, a historical description and linguistic analysis of the Afrikaans language. Returned to Potchefstroom, he was municipal councilor and later mayor (1924 \u2013 1926).\nBoshoff was a member of the Taalkommissie (Language Committee) of the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns (SAAWK, South African Academy for Science and Art) from 1922 up to 1969 and with D. F. Malherbe and T.H. le Roux advised the 1933 translation of the Bible into Afrikaans, which was considered crucial to establish Afrikaans as a separate language from Dutch. In 1950 Boshoff was chosen president of the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie and continued up to 1958.\nHis Etimologiese woordeboek van afrikaans (Etymological dictionary of Afrikaans) was published in 1936.\nAwards\nHis awards include the 1959 and 1967 Stals Prize\u00a0 for the Humanities.\nPublications\nBoshoff published many books and articles, such as:\n1917 \u2013 Boshoff, Stephanus Petrus Erasmus (1917).

    "Classical pianist and pedagogue\nMusical artist\nIgor Hmelnitsky (27 December 1920 \u2013 27 September 1987) was a distinguished classical pianist and pedagogue who was based for most of his life in Australia, where he built his reputation. \nLife\nIgor Hmelnitsky  was born in Java, then in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). His father, the noted pianist Alexander Hmelnitsky, had emigrated to Asia from Kiev, Ukraine after the Russian Revolution. In 1925 the family moved on to Sydney.\nIgor served in the Royal Netherlands Air Force during World War II. In his ensuing Australian musical career he was known as an exponent of the grand Romantic school of classical pianism. He performed for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and promoted the piano works of the Australian composer Raymond Hanson.\nFrom 1972 to 1985 he taught at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. A notable student was the Australian pianist and teacher Gabriella Pusner.\nIgor Hmelnitsky died of cancer on 27 September 1987 at St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, and was survived by his fifth wife and four children. In February 2024 his nephew Justice James Hmelnitsky was sworn in to the Supreme Court of New South Wales.\nMedical research\nIgor Hmelnitsky undertook significant medical studies to help inform his pedagogy, and he co-authored a research paper examining weight-bearing manipulation in piano playing, along with the syndrome of overuse.\n",

The museum was founded in 1887 when the society received its first exhibition space and today it focuses on local history in the municipalities of Sombor, Apatin, Od\u017eaci, Kula and Ba\u010d. It is a complex museum with around 40,000 exhibits divided into five categories: archaeological, numismatic, historical, ethnological, and art collections. The museum publishes the Annual Journal of the City Museum of Sombor.\nHistory\nThe museum's origin is tied to the initiative of Istv\u00e1n Iv\u00e1nyi, who founded the Historical Society of B\u00e1cs-Bodrog County in 1883. After World War I, Sombor lost its regional role, and the museum's assets were transferred to Novi Sad in 1930. The assets were returned in 1936 when the Historical Society of Sombor was re-established under Radivoje Simonovi\u0107. The society aimed to collect and organize antiquities related to the county's history. In 1887, the society received a space in Sombor's County building for museum purposes. The society expanded its activities in 1906 to include the collection of ethnographic materials. The museum was reopened on March 14, 1945. The painter Milan Konjovi\u0107 was appointed its director. In 1952, the museum received the legacy of Imre Frej, enriching its numismatic and archaeological collections.\nCollection\nThe museum houses archaeological, ethnological, historical, and artistic treasures. Its archaeological collection features artifacts from the Neolithic Star\u010devo and Vin\u010da culture, as well as items from the Metal, Bronze, Roman, and Celtic periods. The museum also houses a rich numismatic collection with coins from ancient to modern times, and its gallery of contemporary art showcases works from the 1960s to the 1990s. The ethnological section displays items illustrating daily life in the region, including traditional costumes, furniture, and unique artifacts like molds for gingerbread and Easter eggs.\nSee also\nList of museums in Serbia\nHistorical Archive of Sombor",
    "Iakovos Argyropoulos (Greek: \u0399\u03ac\u03ba\u03c9\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2 \u0391\u03c1\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2; 1776\u20131850), known in Turkish as Yakovaki Efendi, was a Phanariote official and scholar in the service of the Ottoman Empire.\nLife\nIakovos Argyropoulos was a member of the Argyropoulos family, which belonged to the small circle of Phanariote families that by virtue of their knowledge of foreign languages occupied key positions in the Ottoman government during the 18th century, holding the posts of Grand Dragoman and Dragoman of the Fleet. Iakovos began his career as a secretary to the Patriarch of Constantinople, before being sent to his first diplomatic mission to the Prussian court in Berlin. He then occupied the office of Dragoman of the Fleet in 1809, as well as kap\u0131 kehaya (representative to the Ottoman government) of the island of Andros, before becoming Grand Dragoman in 1812. He served in this post until 1815, when he was ousted following the intrigues of Michael Soutzos.\nAfter the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence in 1821, several high-ranking Phanariotes were exiled or fled the Empire abroad. Argyropoulos was exiled to Anatolia, first to \u00c7orum, thence to Ankara in 1825, and Bursa in 1829. In 1829 he was pardoned and recalled to serve as ambassador to the Russian court alongside Stefan Bogoridi (who also had been exiled) for negotiations before the Treaty of Adrianople. Instead, Argyropoulos escaped to independent Greece, settling first in Aegina and then in Athens, where he died in 1850. His son Manuel later served as dragoman of the Greek and Russian embassies in Constantinople.\nWorks\nArgyropoulos was knowledgeable in several languages and active as a translator. His translations of Virgil and The Spirit of Law into modern Greek do not survive, as do his memoirs. He knew French well enough to write his diplomatic reports in that language\u2014the first Ottoman official to do so\u2014and translated Mahmud Raif Efendi's modern geographic work, Idjala al-jugrafiyya, from French into Ottoman Turkish. He also wrote a biographical history of the Russian empress Catherine the Great (Katerine Tarihi), based on the French-language history of Jean-Henri Cast\u00e9ra, but heavily edited, extended with events until 1801, and with detailed explanations of Russia's geography and government. Argyropoulos' work was likely written around 1813, but was first published in Egypt in 1829 and 1831. It was later heavily used, although unattributed, by Ahmed Cevdet Pasha in his own history, the Tarih-i Cevdet\u00a0. During his exile, and as part of renewed Ottoman attempts to create a modern army after the suppression of the Janissaries in 1826, Argyropoulos translated European military treatises into Turkish.\n",
    "American jazz composer, music arranger, trombonist, and singer\nFred Norman (October 5, 1910, Leesburg, Florida \u2013 February 19, 1993, New York City) was an American jazz composer, music arranger, trombonist, and singer. \nAfter attending Howard University, he joined the band of Claude Hopkins in 1932. He toured with that group as both a trombonist and singer for much of the 1930s, notably recording his own composition \"Church Street Sobbin\u2019 Blues\" as the trombone soloist with Hopkins's band in 1937 for Decca Records. He also appeared in short films with Hopkin's band during the 1930s. In 1938 he moved away from performance into work as a full-time music arranger. In the late 1930s and 1940s he wrote arrangements for Bunny Berigan, Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Lionel Hampton, Gene Krupa, Teddy Powell, Artie Shaw, Charlie Spivak, and Jack Teagarden. \nIn the 1950s he was the music director and an arranger for multiple records made by the singers Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington. He continued to work as an arranger until his retirement in the 1970s.\n",
    "2022 video game\n2022 video game\nOut There: Oceans of Time is a 2022 adventure game developed by Mi-Clos Studio and published by Modern Wolf.  It includes elements of survival games and role-playing games.  Players attempt to survive while tracking an alien warlord in their spaceship.  It is a sequel to Out There.\nGameplay\nPlayers control Commander Nyx, a character from Out There: Chronicles.  Nyx is pursuing an alien warlord named Archon, who escaped from captivity.  Players must manage the crew, scavenge for resources, explore planets, and engage in diplomacy with aliens.  Collecting one resource requires putting another at risk, such as requiring fuel to collect oxygen.  Sending expeditions to planets similarly risks fuel for the possibility of finding useful resources or villages.  To talk to aliens, players must first learn their language through trial and error.  Saving one's progress requires collecting a resource.\nDevelopment\nDeveloper Mi-Clos Studio is based in France. Mi-Clos' founder, Micha\u00ebl Peiffert, said the Out There series has mirrored his personal circumstances.  When he was no longer a sole developer and had to manage a team, the mechanics of the Out There series likewise changed.  Initially, Oceans of Time was meant to have roguelike elements like Out There.  As the story grew in importance, they found these mechanics untenable and rebalanced Oceans of Time as a role-playing game, which they felt made it more approachable.\nModern Wolf released Out There: Oceans of Time for Windows on May 26, 2022.\nReception\nOut There: Oceans of Time received mixed reviews on Metacritic.  Although NME enjoyed its creativity, they criticized its difficulty and what they felt was a poor tutorial, both of which they said made enjoying the game difficult. NME and CD-Action concluded that Oceans of Time was too split between the punishing difficulty of a roguelike game and a story-based adventure game to recommend. Eurogamer Italia recommended it to fans of the previous Out There games, who will be used to the punishing difficulty and survival elements.\n",
    "18th-century ruler (Dey) of Algiers\nBaba Ali, Also known as Bou Sebaa or Ali Melmouli or Baba Ali Neks\u00ees was the 17th ruler and Dey of Algiers. He ruled for 11 years after his predecessor Mohamed Ibn Bekir.\nRule\nEarly life\nHe was born in a small village in Asia, he grew up in a farm house and used to watch and handle the sheeps, he used to talk about his experiences of this period of his life and talk how the countryside nearly inaccessible.\nBiography\nBaba Ali was the agha of the spahis of the State of Algiers, he was an old  donkey-driver before, and was described as ignorant, brutal, fanatic and falling in a state of madness or imbecility. A slave/sailor of the militia, who was consulting the affairs of the state, said \u00ab\u00a0I am a donkey; you have more wit than me; decide\u00a0!\u00a0\u00bb, he didn't hide his origin and always showed his left hand, who was missing a thumb, telling the same story that he was mutilated by one of his animals which he once took care of.\nHe always responded to the complaints he received by \u00ab\u00a0I am the leader of a band of thieves, and therefore my job is to take and not to return.\u00a0\u00bb. He was also really mistrustful, and the starting of his reign was the beginning of a long series of executions, and the next day he ordered the arrestations of the conspirators of 11 December, and ended up impaling six, strangling four and some even beaten to death.\nPolitical activities\nA revolt broke out again in Algiers in the month of September, but would be maintained the same way as the last one, with multiple executions. During that time he would assure good relations with France and Great Britain, but would declare war on both the Netherlands and Tuscany for the benefit of the corso, Danemark and Sweden however would conclude peace with presents and gifts.\nThe war between the Netherlands and Algiers would last between (1755\u201357), the Algerian fleet was described weak by historians during the 1750s compared to 1715, the grain exports and trade of Algiers was almost non-existent due to the harsh weather and the earthquake that literally destroyed Algiers in 1755, were probably the reason of the weakness of the Regency. While inside the regency, the Kabyles revolted again and killed the Bey of Titteri, however in Tenes, the ruler of the city declared himself independent and even killed a company of Turks, the inhabitants fought bravely until they submitted.\nIn November 1755, the earthquake that hit Lisbon was also felt in Algiers but mainly in the coast of Morocco, the earthquake lasted two months, and just like in Lisbon, pillage and fires would add up to the disaster, a witness also reported that \u00ab\u00a0there was not a single house left intact in Algiers\u00a0\u00bb. During this period the Bey of Tunis declared war on Algiers and went on an expedition against the bey of Constantine, Hassan Bey, who suffered 2 major defeats against him. Baba Ali would send an army of 5,000 soldiers to Constantine, they would take El Kef and Tunis after a siege of two months, the pillage lasted days and even the Christian consuls weren't spared, except for the English consuls. But the bey of Tunis would eventually escape with his treasures in la Goulette, where Maltese ships were already waiting for him.\nThe Dutch consul was imprisoned after the Algerians found out that his nation had been providing Tunis with gunpowder, the consul M. Levet, would report that the Netherlands were trading the same marchandise to all the Barbary state, for over 150 years, But would regain his freedom with presents. In the same time the consul of Great Britain that promised his help with retaking Oran, corrupted the Dey against France, saying that the ships that the bey of Tunis escaped with were sent by France and not by the Maltese, the French consul also arrived in Algiers and denied the lies of the English consul. After his journey in Marseille, the dey demanded that the ships that were captured by the Bailli de Fleury were returned, the discussion escalated and M. Lemaire was sent to the Bagne, but would gain his liberty by presents offered by another french consul in 1756.\nin 1757, The Kabyles were still revolting, in July 12 they took Bordj-Boghni and Bordj-Bou\u00efra in August, and also the ones neatr Tenes and in the Djurdjura revolted, their activities continued until the middle of 1758, until they were stopped by armies sent from Algiers, Medea and Constantine. Even Tlemcen who was enjoying complete independence for 20 years, under the Ca\u00efd Redjem El- Bedjaou\u00ef, was besieged and their leader strangled by Algiers. During that time, the events with Tunis and Algiers caught the attention of the Sublime Porte, who sent a Capidji to stop the severe policy of Baba Ali, at the end, Tunis wasn't payed by Algiers for war reparations, and the Dey concluded peace with the Netherlands and Austria, where the Dutch merchants were stuck in \u0130zmir, in fear of passing over Algiers and being pillaged.\nThe dey would receive payements from both Great Britain, who donated 24 cann",

    "Urban areas in Vietnam include cities, district-level town, and commune-level town officially recognized by state authorities of Vietnam. While districts and communes are generally rural, some may be classified as urban if they meet certain conditions. Communes set to be upgraded to towns can also be recognized as type V urban areas.\nVietnam's cities are classified into six types: special, type I to type V. Special, type I, and type II cities are approved by the prime minister; type III and IV cities by the Ministry of Construction; and type V by the provincial government. The classification process is overseen by the National Assembly's Standing Committee.\nTypes of urban areas\nAs of August 16, 2024, there are 908 recognized urban areas in Vietnam\n, classified as follows:\nSpecial: 2 (Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City)\nType I: 21\nType II: 39\nType III: 43\nType IV: 97\nType V: 706\nCriteria for classification\nThe classification of urban areas in Vietnam is based on a series of factors, including population, density, and the proportion of non-agricultural labor. The classification framework is outlined in Resolution No. 1210/2016, which provides the following criteria for each type of urban area:\nCurrently, Vietnam has two cities classified as special urban areas by the government: Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. To support the authorities of these two cities in fulfilling their functions as special urban areas, the government allows Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City to benefit from certain specific financial and budgetary mechanisms.\nUrban areas in special regions\nIn special cases, such as border areas or island regions, urban classification criteria are relaxed.

    "Ottoman-Hungarian pasha (1822\u20131898)\nS\u00e1ndor Adolf Farkas (30 November 1822 \u2013 29 May 1898), also known as Farka\u015f Osman Pa\u015fa and Macar Osman Pasha (Turkish: Macar Osman Pa\u015fa, lit.\u2009'Hungarian Osman Pasha', Hungarian: Farkas Oszm\u00e1n pasa), was an Ottoman pasha of Hungarian descent. Like many other Hungarian and Polish revolutionaries, he fled to the Ottoman Empire after the revolution of 1848 and served in the Ottoman army until his death. Farkas was the father of one of the first Turkish female poets, Nig\u00e2r Han\u0131m.\nEarly life\nBackground\nS\u00e1ndor Adolf Farkas was born on 30 November 1822 in Moravia, Austrian Empire to a Hungarian family. Not much is known about his early years other than that his family moved to Nagyv\u00e1rad when he was young.\nHungarian Revolution of 1848\nFarkas was a participant in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. In Transylvania, he was one of the aide-de-camp's of Polish national hero Jozef Bem, who would also later become an Ottoman pasha. On 27 March 1849, under D\u00e1niel Ih\u00e1sz's and Bem's commands, he fought in a victorious three-hour battle fought at the Turnu Ro\u0219u Pass (V\u00f6r\u00f6storonyi-szoros). Farkas served as captain in Szamos\u00fajv\u00e1r. The last major battle of the revolution that Farkas fought in was at Krass\u00f3-Sz\u00f6r\u00e9ny county.\nWith the failure of the revolution, he fled to Turkey like most of the leaders of the revolution (Lajos Kossuth and the majority of his cabinet, Jozef Bem, Gy\u00f6rgy Klapka, Henryk Dembi\u0144ski, J\u00f3zef Wysocki, Gy\u00f6rgy Kmety, and many more).\nEmigration to the Ottoman Empire\nCrimean war\nFarkas moved to the Ottoman Empire and converted to Islam, taking the name Osman Nihal\u00ee. He served in the Crimean War and quickly rose in military rank. As a major, he served as one of Omar Pasha's aide-de-camp and was mostly active in the Danubian front of the war. For a time, Farkas was assigned to the general staff of the Commander-in-Chief of British soldiers sent to Crimea, Lord Raglan.\nMarriage\nIn the early 1860s, Farkas married the daughter of Grand Vizier Mehmed Fuad Pasha's sealer (\u0130zmirli N\u00fbri Bey), Emine R\u0131fat\u00ee Han\u0131m. Although they were said to be happily married for around 30 years, they divorced in the last years of Farkas' life. One of the children from this marriage was born in 1856, shortly after the end of the Crimean War; Nig\u00e2r Han\u0131m, one of the first Turkish female poets. Another child they had was a boy by the name of Ali.\nLater life\nRusso-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)\nIn 1870, Farkas was appointed as a teacher at the Turkish Military Academy by Sultan Abdulaziz. During the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878), Farkas was personally tasked with delivering orders from Sultan Abdul Hamid II in Istanbul to Gazi Osman Pasha during the Siege of Plevna. On one occasion, he was nearly killed by Russian cavalry whilst attempting deliver a message. Farkas was mostly based in Istanbul during the war and welcomed Hungarian visitors to his house. On 20 July 1888, Farkas was made pasha.\nVisit to Budapest\nDuring a visit to Budapest in the late 1880s, Farkas met with editor-in-chief of Pesti H\u00edrlap, N\u00e1ndor Borosty\u00e1ni (husband of Irma von Troll-Borostyani), who called him a \"brave old man\". He said that Farkas rarely spoke Hungarian, but followed events in Austria-Hungary through newspapers. Aside from spending time with his family, his most enjoyable pastimes were reading books in his large library and producing music (especially with the piano). Farkas had a harem and several wives other than Emine R\u0131fat\u00ee Han\u0131m, including a Circassian woman.\nThose sitting down (from left to right): Emine R\u0131fat\u00ee Han\u0131m, Adolf Farkas, Nig\u00e2r Han\u0131m's youngest son, Salih Keramet, and Nig\u00e2r Han\u0131m. Those standing (from left to right): Nig\u00e2r's middle child, Feridun, her oldest son, M\u00fcnir, and her husband, \u0130hsan Bey\nDeath\nThe circumstances of Farkas' death are debated. It is said that Farkas went on his daily walk but on the way, he died from a heart attack in B\u00fcy\u00fckada and fell into the sea. Even though his daughter, Nig\u00e2r Han\u0131m, writes in her memoirs that he did not seem suicidal, witnesses of Farkas' death said that they saw a man in military uniform deliberately jump into the sea and drown himself instead of shouting for help. If he did indeed commit suicide, its reasons are unknown but he was described as being melancholic and nostalgic because he missed his family and homeland dearly, which may have been a motive for suicide. Among those in Hungary who offered condolences for his death was member of Parliament Frigyes Podmaniczky.\nAfter his death, Nig\u00e2r Han\u0131m received a letter of condolences from the National Museum of Transylvanian History in Kolozsv\u00e1r which asked if she could send as many belongings of her father as possible. She replied by saying that it would be an honour to entrust her father's belongings to the \"chivalrous\" Hungarian nation. Nig\u00e2r Han\u0131m gave this letter and Farkas' possessions to her oldest son, M\u00fcnir, who would present it to \u00d6d\u00f6n Sz\u00e9chenyi, another important Ottoman-Hungarian pasha, so that he could send it to",
    "2024 ballet in two acts choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon\nOscar is a ballet in two acts choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon to a score by Joby Talbot with stage and costume design by Jean-Marc Puissant. The ballet is based on the life of Oscar Wilde focussing on his time in Reading Gaol, but incorporating scenes from throughout his life. It weaves two of Wilde's stories into the ballet - The Nightingale and the rose and the Portrait of Dorian Gray. It was commissioned by the Australian Ballet and premiered in Melbourne in September 2024.\nOscar is the first full-length ballet commissioned by the Australian Ballet's artistic director David Hallberg. and the first full-length narrative ballet commissioned by the Australian Ballet in 20 years.\nSynopsis\nPrologue\nOscar Wilde is prosecuted under Britain's Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885 that criminalised all sex acts between men. Details of his life are under intense scrutiny in the courtroom.\nAct 1\nWilde sits in his jail cell where he recalls better times on a family picnic with his wife Constance and their two boys. He reads them his fairy tale, The Nightingale and the Rose. We see the story unfold interspersed with scenes from Wilde's life in London's social circles and we see the beginnings of his relationship with Robbie Ross.\nAct 2\nSubjected to hard labour in prison, Wilde is malnourished and broken. He has tinnitus in one ear due to fall. Alone and in despair Wilde recalls scenes from his story The Picture of Dorian Gray as well as his relationship with Bosie (Lord Alfred Douglas). Dorian makes a deal with the devil to keep his beauty intact while his portrait is gradually transforming to become more and more grotesque. Wilde and Douglas's relationship deepens leading Lord Queensbury (Douglas's father) to denounce Wilde and his eventual conviction. We see parallels with Dorian, who's life collapses to restore his portrait to its former beauty.\nEpilogue\nOn his release, Wilde is collected from prison by his friend Robbie Ross. Broken and with reputation destroyed he dies a few years later aged 46. His writing lives on and continues to be read and enjoyed today.\nCritical reception\nThe ballet was well received on its premiere. Jane Howard writing for the Guardian said that the pas de deux between Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas \"deserves to take its place in the pantheon of great romantic balletic pairings\". Writing in The Age, Andrew Fuhrmann gave the ballet 5 stars and called it \"a daring but fantastically rewarding experiment in ballet storytelling\".\n",
    "Donald Trump has had his hiring decisions criticized due to relatively high level of scandals and legal trouble. Turnover in the Trump administration was the highest of all presidents since Brookings Institution started measuring in 1980, and cause for concern according to some experts. According to some historians, Trump has received criticism from former officials at levels not seen over the last hundred years. Nepotism has also risen as a point of comparison across administrations, with Trump having more family members in prominent roles than recent presidents.\nTurnover\nTurnover by presidency according to the Brookings Institution\nDonald Trump had more turnover in his administration than any president since the Brookings Institution started measuring in 1980, with 92% of his A-team followed by another 45% of his second hires for his A-team. The turnover rate in his first year was double the next highest president since Reagan. Kathryn Dunn Tenpas suggested that the high turnover stemmed from Trump's insistence on loyalty over competence. Infighting was also reportedly particularly intense and vicious.\nA 2018 Harvard Business Review article argued that White House turnover was especially concerning in the Trump administration due to the lack of experience and expertise among the staffers Trump hired. The article also argued that high turnover slows down productive work during the transition and as the new hire progresses up the learning curve, and that teams with high turnover at the top tend to perform worse. Replacement times can be higher in the White House due to security clearances, which makes high turnover environments more disruptive. Gautam Mukunda argues that the manner in which many high-profile personnel were fired, such as over Twitter, shrinks the pool of qualified candidates who would want to work in a Trump administration. There also have not seemed to have been lucrative jobs waiting for former White House officials as was true of previous administrations. He also speculated that the threat of legal bills for working in a Trump administration would be a significant deterrent.\nIn June 2020, Mick Mulvaney said that if he had one criticism of Trump, it was that he did not hire very well.\nActing secretaries\nTrump opted for filling some positions temporarily with acting appointees who did not have to get Senate confirmation. Stanford Law Professor Anne Joseph O'Connell found that they have a harder time accomplishing their work and have less influence. An April 2019 Time article described Trump as having an historically high level of acting cabinet members. Jon Michaels at UCLA School of Law called Trump's use of acting secretaries \"very troubling.\"\nPresidential transition\nSee also: Project 2025\n2016\nMain article: Presidential transition of Donald Trump \u00a7\u00a0Assessment of the transition\nTrump's 2016 presidential transition set a 'low bar' for modern transitions according to Max Stier, followed by George H. W. Bush.\n2024\nTrump's 2024 transition team officially started in August, which is considered unusually late as most transition efforts start in the late spring. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump were reported by Axios to be screening members of the transition team and future administration for loyalty. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s inclusion as an honorary co-chair has generated concern among health experts worried about the influence he could get over hiring people related to vaccines and other important health-related positions. Kennedy said his role in the administration would relate to healthcare and food and drug policy. Another conspiracy theorist named an honorary co-chair is Tulsi Gabbard. Gabbard has defended autocratic regimes against criticism including Russia and Syria.\nFelony convictions, indictments, charges and other ethics scandals\nSee also: Political appointments by Donald Trump \u00a7\u00a0Appointment controversies, and List of federal political scandals in the United States \u00a7\u00a0Executive branch 25\nIn July 2024, Axios described the number of Trump associates sentenced to prison as \"striking\". PolitiFact noted in 2020 that there have historically been many more indictments under Republican presidents than Democratic ones with 28 indictments under Nixon and 33 under Reagan.\nRobert Schlesinger criticized Trump's hiring decisions for the relatively high level of scandals and legal trouble, arguing that Trump's focus on loyalty over competence drives many of the issues. Chris Christie called hiring \"a blind spot\" for Trump.\nBy March 2018, 7 out of 24 members of Trump's cabinet faced accusations of abusing their perks in office.\nIn March 2018, ProPublica revealed that at least 187 of Trump's first 2,475 political appointees have been lobbyists, with many overseeing industries they once lobbied for. They revealed that of those, Trump had hired 18 recent lobbyists compared to 14 for Obama. The report found 27 members of the Heritage Foundation were hired.\nFamily members in major roles\nFurther information",
    "Friedrich Lindner (c. 1542, Legnica \u2013 September 15, 1597, Nuremberg) was a German composer, singer, music editor, copyist, and writer on music. He was educated at the Schulpforta school at the Pforta monastery and at the University of Leipzig. Composer Jakob Meiland engaged him at the Ansbach court in 1564 as a music copyist and singer. He succeeded Meiland as vice-Kapellmeister at Ansbach in 1573. Financial issues led to the dissolution of the music department at Ansbach, and in 1574 he became Kantor at the St. Egidien, Nuremberg where he remained until his death in 1597.\nLindner's own compositional output consisted mainly of choral sacred music. He notably conducted his own work, Veni, Sance Spiritus, for the dedication ceremony of the University of Altdorf (opened in 1578 after building construction completed) on 29 June 1575. His biggest contribution to music was through his work as a music editor; notably editing nine large volumes of music from Italy which became one of the principal means through which Italian music spread into Germany in the late 16th century.\n",

    "\nQueen Victoria Rock is a 4,780-foot-elevation (1,457-meter) pillar in Grand County, Utah, United States.\nDescription\nQueen Victoria Rock is located within Arches National Park and like many of the rock formations in the park, it is composed of Entrada Sandstone, specifically the Slick Rock Member overlaying the Dewey Bridge Member. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 400 feet (122 meters) above the Park Avenue Trail in 250 feet (76 meters) laterally. Precipitation runoff from Queen Victoria Rock drains to the nearby Colorado River via Courthouse Wash. This landform's descriptive toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names, and is so named because the feature resembles the profile of Queen Victoria sitting on a chair, although it may look more like Whistler's Mother. The first ascent of the summit was made in November 1986 by Charlie Fowler and Dan Grandusky via Dusty Shadows rock-climbing route (III, A-2+). Charlie Fowler and Alison Sheets also climbed the route, Queen For A Day, rated (I, A-2).\nClimate\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system, Queen Victoria Rock is located in a cold semi-arid climate zone with cold winters and hot summers. Spring and fall are the most favorable seasons to experience Arches National Park, when highs average 60 to 80\u00a0\u00b0F (15 to 25\u00a0\u00b0C) and lows average 30 to 50\u00a0\u00b0F (0 to 10\u00a0\u00b0C). Summer temperatures often exceed 100\u00a0\u00b0F (40\u00a0\u00b0C).

    "Coal mine in Crumlin\nNavigation Colliery is a former coal mine in Crumlin, Caerphilly County Borough, Wales. Opened in 1911, at its peak it produced 145,000 tonnes of coal a year. The mine closed in 1967 and the site has been disused since. The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales (RCAHMW) considers the Navigation site to be \"the best preserved colliery complex in South Wales\". The complex contains thirteen listed buildings, five at Grade II*, the rest at Grade II. The site is now managed by a charitable trust, Glofa Navigation Cyf, which seeks to redevelop it for community benefit.\nHistory\nThe construction of Navigation Colliery began in 1907 and was complete by 1911. The owners were Partridge, Jones & Co. The winding engines and the fan engine were manufactured by Walker Brothers of Wigan. At its height, the colliery employed over 700 men, and produced over 145,000 tonnes of coal a year. The pithead baths, opened in 1933, had facilities to accommodate 800 miners. Such baths were constructed after the Miners' Welfare Act 1926 introduced provision for their funding. The Durham Mining Museum records ten deaths at the colliery during its operation but this is an underestimate. The colliery ceased production and was closed in 1967. The site is now managed by a charitable trust, Glofa Navigation Cyf (The Crumlin Navigation Trust). The trust, working with the owners, the South Wales Building Preservation Trust, seeks to redevelop it for community benefit. In 2013 the Victorian Society placed the complex on its At Risk register. Funding shortfalls, and the challenge presented by a unstable, underground culvert at the site, were exacerbated in 2020 when Storm Dennis destroyed part of the culvert roof. In 2022 students from the School of Architecture at Cardiff University took the Navigation site as the basis of a finals project, and exhibited redevelopment plans at the colliery.\nArchitecture and description\nThe Navigation Colliery site is broadly rectangular, the buildings standing on two terraces in the Ebbw River valley. The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales (RCAHMW) notes the \"unusual architectural quality\" of the site\u2019s buildings. These are constructed in red brick, with yellow brick accents. The use of brick was relatively rare, the more common building material being local rubble. In his 2018 study, The Architecture of Wales: From the First to the Twenty-first Century, John B. Hilling notes the \"dramatic\" use of polychromatic brick at Crumlin. John Newman, in his Gwent/Monmouthshire volume in the Buildings of Wales series, describes the colliery complex as the \"finest group in Wales and an outstanding example of the proud showpieces Edwardian owners could erect when the South Wales Coalfield was the largest coal-exporting area in the world\". Five of the buildings on the site are listed at Grade II*, while another eight are listed at Grade II. The chimney, the Fan House, the North Winding Engine House, the Power and Pump Houses, and the South Winding Engine house are listed at Grade II*. The colliery baths, an Electrical House, the heapstead, the Lamp room, a revetment wall, the Colliery Offices, the Powder Store and another, attached, revetment wall, and the Workshops and Stores are listed at Grade II.\nNotes\n",

    "Spanish women ceramistIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  de Armas and the second or maternal family name is  Curbelo.\nDorotea de Armas Curbelo (6 February 1899 \u2013 17 June 1997) was a Spanish ceramist who was known for introducing traditional Canary Island aboriginal figurines in the iconography of her pottery works.\nLife\nDorotea was born on 6 February 1899 in Mu\u00f1ique, a small village next to Tinajo in Lanzarote, and died on 17 June 1997. She received her training as a potter from her mother. She started modeling clay and making different objects as a child at the age of 12. She also learned from her mother how to select the clay and how to work it to make different shapes.\nShe continued the profession of her mother and grandmother as a potter, traditionally known as locera, specializing in ceramic works that incorporate the traditions of the Canary Islands. She took up the pottery heritage of El Moj\u00f3n, where this craft of locera has a long tradition and is recognized as the village that best represents the pottery of Lanzarote.\nWorks\nRobert Verneau, in a work published in 1891, where he recounts the five years of stay that this author spent in the Canary archipelago (1876\u20131877 and 1884\u20131887), is the first researcher to address the subject of the ceramics of Lanzarote. He acquired a complete collection of typical traditional pottery of Lanzarote that he later donated to the Mus\u00e9e de l'Homme in Paris, France. The first archaeological study of this collection is due to the French researcher Denise Robert. Robert describes these ceramics as \"popular\", of rural origin, made by women in villages in the interior of the Canary islands, mainly for daily, common and domestic use, both for fetching water and for preparing and serving family meals (pots, trays, bowls, plates, etc.), used by peasants and city dwellers. In the 1970s, archaeologist Gonz\u00e1lez Ant\u00f3n studied the traditional pottery of the Canary Islands. Describing the ceramic production of El Moj\u00f3n, he highlighted the work of Dorotea de Armas, the only remaining potter in Mu\u00f1ique, and her animal figures, such as camels, as well as human figures called novios. Later studies also mentioned the work of de Armas.\nThe production of Dorotea is a prime example of this traditional rural pottery. Her search for the origins of the island's pottery led her to discover the ceramic figurines used by the aborigines of the Canary Islands in their rituals and daily life. She would select the clay and keep it moist enough to make it flexible enough to add black volcanic sand, which would allow her to shape it. After shaping the piece, she baked it in fire pits next to her house in Camino de las Monta\u00f1etas. The 1990 documentary \"Lanzarote \u2013 Isla de los Volcanes\", produced by Geoffrey Perfect, shows the creative and production process of de Armas.\nShe produced pottery for domestic use, toys and, most innovatively, idolillos, which reinterpreted the traditional Canarian idolillos. Figurines, such as the three-legged camels, along with figures such as the bride and groom, reinterpret the typical figures of the Guanches, the native inhabitants of the Canary Islands. Among the latter, Los Novios del Moj\u00f3n stand out, which brought her fame beyond the Canary Islands.\nDe Armas stands out for her craftsmanship and traditional pottery modeling. De Armas' work is appreciated by admirers of this Lanzarote tradition as a renovator of the potter's craft, incorporating into her work the traditional forms of the island's aboriginal inhabitants, from before the arrival of Europeans to the islands.\nDe Armas received several awards for her work during her lifetime, and also posthumously as the appointment of Artisan of the Year 2017, by the Cabildo insular de Gran Canaria. She passed on her knowledge to many people who have continued her work, including her granddaughter Maria Dolores de Armas and her son Juan Jes\u00fas Brito Paz. Among her students is Juan Brito Martin, another self-taught ceramist from Lanzarote, who has used Los Novios del Moj\u00f3n as a reference in many of his creations. In 2022, the Cabildo of Lanzarote paid tribute in Mancha Blanca to Dorotea de Armas with the inauguration of the sculpture \"Homenaje a la artesana do\u00f1a Dorotea\", a work by local artist Rigoberto Camacho P\u00e9rez.\nNotable work\nThe traditional clay figurines Novios del Volc\u00e1n created by Dorotea de Armas can still be found today in tourist shops.\nOne of the most representative works of De Armas is the Novios del Moj\u00f3n, also known as Mu\u00f1ecos or Novios del Volc\u00e1n, as De Armas calls them. They are two clay figurines representing a man and a woman, with an exaggerated representation of their sexual attributes, inspired by archaeological artifacts found in sites from the island's pre-Hispanic period. According to tradition, during betrothal ceremonies, men offered the male figure to offer it to their fianc\u00e9es, and if the engagement was accepted, women responded by giving a female figurine.\nJos\u00e9 Saramago w",

It has an area of 0.522\u00a0km2 (0.202\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), circumference of 2,713\u00a0m (8,901\u00a0ft), and height of 519.3\u00a0m (1,704\u00a0ft).\nThe oreum's name means \"dawn star\". It is said to stand high in the sky like a star.\nThe oreum is reportedly one of the most popular oreums to visit, and has views of the surrounding area. Hiking up takes around 30 minutes.\nJeju Fire Festival\nSince 2000, the oreum has been the site of the annual Jeju Fire Festival. The festival was started in 1997. The festival is a reenactment of a traditional Jeju cultural event called bangae, during which large fires are ceremonially lit in order to pray for good fortune, burn off old grass, and kill vermin in the fields. Such burnings were held at various oreums and fields in Jeju until the 1970s, when it was banned. The festival was started as a limited cultural practice for tourism in 1997.\nThe festival was held virtually in 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in 2025, the festival was planned to be reorganized in order to deemphasize the use of fire over environmental concerns.\nGallery\nJeju Fire Festival (2016)\nSee also\nOreum#List of oreum\nGeum Oreum\nGama Oreum",

    "Species of frog\nHyloxalus sordidatus is a species of frog in the family Dendrobatidae. It is endemic to Peru.\nDescription\nThe adult male frog measures 29.9 mm in snout-vent length and the adult female frog is 36.1 mm. This frog has climbing disks on the toes of all four feet. The skin of the dorsum is light brown in color. There are dark brown bars on all four legs. The posterior surfaces of the legs are light brown. There is a dark brown stripe from the nose to the eye to the ear all the way to the groin. There is a dull white stripe from the middle of the body to the groin. There is a dark brown crescent-shaped mark on each foreleg. The adult male frog has a gray belly and the adult female frog has a white belly. The throat and chest are bright yellow.  The scutes are gray-tan in color. The iris of the eye is red-bronze in color with black marks and a brown stripe in it. The male frog's testes are white in color.\nThe frog's voice sounds like a high-pitched whistle. It emits ten notes at a time.\nHabitat\nScientists observed this frog in exactly two places, both in the Cordillera Central, one 500 meters above sea level and the other 520 meters above sea level. This frog has been found cut-over rainforests and in dry thorn forests. This frog was observed near streams. During the day, this frog hides under big rocks. This frog is nocturnal.\nReproduction\nScientists observed tadpoles swimming in streams. At stage 25, the tadpole is 12.5 mm long in body and 30.0 mm long including the tail. The body is globular and wider than it is tall. The nose is round as viewed from above or from the sides. Its eyes are on the top of its head and look out to the top and sides. The body is brown in color and the tail is light orange in color.\nThreats\nThe IUCN classifies this frog as data deficient. Because it was found in cut-over rainforest, scientists believe it may be good at living in disturbed habitats.\nOriginal description\nDuellman, W. E.

    "Genus of lichen-forming fungi\nCelothelium is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Celotheliaceae. These lichens typically have a thin, crust-like thallus that often grows beneath the surface of tree bark or rocks in tropical rainforests and coastal areas. Celothelium species are characterised by small, black, shiny reproductive structures (perithecia), and thread-like spores. The genus has had an uncertain taxonomic history since its original description in 1860, but recent genetic studies have placed it in its own distinct group within the fungal class Eurotiomycetes. Celothelium species have been found in various parts of the world, including Asia, Europe, and the Americas.\nTaxonomy\nThe genus was circumscribed by Abramo Bartolommeo Massalongo in 1860. Its taxonomic placement has been uncertain, with various classifications proposed over time. Initially, it was thought to be related to Leptorhaphis in the Trypetheliaceae. Later, it was placed in the Thelenellaceae, and then in the order Pyrenulales. Celothelium socialis has been assigned as the type species, although the validity of this name as well as the nature of this taxon is still unclear.\nMolecular phylogenetics studies have clarified that Celothelium belongs to the class Eurotiomycetes, subclass Chaetothyriomycetidae. However, it does not group with other members of the Pyrenulales as previously thought. Instead, Celothelium forms a distinct lineage along with various anamorphic fungi from genera like Dolabra and Phaeomoniella. Based on this phylogenetic evidence, Celothelium is now placed in its own family, Celotheliaceae. Some researchers have proposed recognising this lineage as a new order, tentatively called Celotheliales. This order would include lichen-forming fungi (Celothelium) as well as some plant pathogens like Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Dolabra nepheliae.\nDescription\nCelothelium is characterised by a crusty (crustose) thallus, which is often difficult to see because it grows mostly beneath the surface of its substrate, such as tree bark or rock. The reproductive structures of the lichen, the perithecia, are small, black, and shiny, and may be scattered individually or found in small groups. These structures are initially embedded within the thallus but later emerge, becoming dome-shaped or flattened. Each perithecium has a small opening (an ostiole) located in a central bump that allows for the release of spores.\nSurrounding groups of perithecia is a dark layer known as the involucrellum, which is composed of both bark material and reddish-brown fungal threads (hyphae). This forms a protective shield referred to as a clypeus. The outer layer of the perithecia, the exciple, blends with the involucrellum and is mostly visible around the edges of the perithecia. The exciple is made of pale to brown fungal threads mixed with bark cells, forming a tightly woven structure.\nInside the perithecia, there are filamentous structures called paraphysoids that are branched and interwoven, aiding in spore dispersal. The fungi lack periphyses, another type of hair-like structure often found in similar fungi. The internal gel of the spore-producing area (hymenial gel) reacts to certain iodine stains (a hemiamyloid reaction), showing a distinctive blue colour near the tip of the spore-producing cells.\nThe asci, which are the spore-producing cells within the perithecia, are cylindrical and contain eight spores each. These asci have a two-layered structure: a thin, smooth outer layer and an inner layer without a noticeable apical beak. The spores inside the asci are thread-like to needle-like, translucent (hyaline), and divided by multiple internal partitions (multiseptate). They are often twisted within the asci and have pointed ends.\nPycnidia, which are the structures responsible for asexual reproduction, may be embedded within the lichen or found on its surface. These dark brown to black structures produce conidia (asexual spores) from specialised bottle-shaped cells. The conidia are also thread-like, clear, and multiseptate.\nThe lichen's photosynthetic partner (photobiont) is from Trentepohlia, a genus of green algae, which forms the green component of the lichen. Unlike many lichens, species in this genus do not typically produce secondary metabolites known as lichen substances.\nHabitat and distribution\nFound on branches in rainforests and coastal areas, Celothelium species largely occur in tropical areas. The genus has been recorded from Asia, Europe, Central America and South America.\nSpecies\nAs of September\u00a02024, Species Fungorum (in the Catalogue of Life) accept four species of Celothelium, although several more have been proposed.\nCelothelium aciculiferum (Nyl.)

    "Television station in Minas Gerais, Brazil\nBand Minas is a Brazilian television station based in Belo Horizonte, capital of the state of Minas Gerais. It operates on channel 7 (UHF digital 20) and is an owned-and-operated station of Rede Bandeirantes. It was founded in 1967 as TV Vila Rica, being acquired by Grupo Bandeirantes de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o in 1975. It covers most of the state, together with its co-sister Band Tri\u00e2ngulo, located in Uberaba. Its studios are in the S\u00e3o Bento neighborhood, in the southern region of the capital of Minas Gerais, and its transmission antenna is in Serra do Curral, in Belvedere.\nHistory\nTV Vila Rica was opened on March 2, 1967, based on a concession offered to Banco Real, with Simonsen receiving a part of the shares. Initially, it was affiliated with TV Excelsior, operating on channel 7 VHF, being part of the project to create a national network. However, due to several financial problems, in addition to troubled relations with the military government, Excelsior was taken off the air on September 30, 1970. With the network's extinction, TV Vila Rica began broadcasting TV Bandeirantes programming. On December 7, 1975, in the process of forming Rede Bandeirantes, TV Vila Rica was acquired by the S\u00e3o Paulo station, changing its name to TV Bandeirantes Minas in 1976.\nThe station airs approximately 16 hours of local programming per week. There is also Band Tri\u00e2ngulo in the state, the second television station belonging to Grupo Bandeirantes de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o, which broadcasts the group's programming to Tri\u00e2ngulo Mineiro and Alto Parana\u00edba. Previously, in 2008, the region received programming from Band Minas, based in Belo Horizonte. With the creation of Band Tri\u00e2ngulo, it took over the antennas previously occupied by Band Minas in the region, consolidating the presence of Grupo Bandeirantes in this specific area.\nThis redistribution strengthened the offer of diverse and relevant television content for the public in Tri\u00e2ngulo Mineiro and Alto Parana\u00edba.\nTechnical information\nBased on the federal decree transitioning Brazilian TV stations from analogue to digital signals, Band Minas, as well as other stations in Belo Horizonte, ceased broadcasting on channel 7 VHF on November 22, 2017, following the official ANATEL roadmap. The signal was cut off at 11:59 pm, during the Cine Band film session, being replaced by a slide from MCTIC and ANATEL about the switch-off.\n",

The director of the center is Israel Nelken.\nHistory\nThe Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences was established in 2009. It is located\nin the Goodman Brain Sciences building on the Edmond J. Safra campus of the Hebrew University in Givat Ram,  Jerusalem. The mission of the center is to gain more insight into the theoretical, biological and cognitive aspects of the brain; pursue interdisciplinary research to meet the scientific and technological challenges of the 21st century; promote academic collaboration and engage in community outreach.\nIn 1991, the university founded the Interdisciplinary Center for Neural Computation\n(ICNC) which introduced a new interdisciplinary doctoral program combining life\nscience, psychology, cognition and other disciplines associated with brain research.\n\nIn 2006, the president of Hebrew University, Menachem Magidor, appointed the\nNeuroscience International Review Committee to explore possibilities for the expansion of\nneuroscience research. With the financial support of the Edmond Safra\nFoundation, the university opened a new center dedicated to the study of the brain.\nThe center's International Steering Committee established in 2009 is composed of 11\nprominent neuroscientists, including Nobel laureates Bert Sakmann, Richard Axel and\nEdvard Moser.\nAcademic programs\nThe center runs two main academic programs: A five-year Ph.D. program in computational\nneuroscience open to students from many different disciplines established in 1992; and an\nundergraduate program offering a major track in brain sciences and a minor track in\ncomputational neuroscience established in 2021. Classes are held in English, which makes\nstudy accessible to foreign students from around the world.\nScientific research\nResearch at ELSC focuses on enhancing the understanding of brain mechanisms, spanning genetic, molecular, cellular and synaptic levels, as well as theoretical and computational studies of biological and artificial neural networks. This basic scientific research of brain function also extends to investigations of brain dysfunction, incorporating translational and clinical research. This includes psychological studies such as those by ELSC member Merav Ahissar to elucidate conditions like  dyslexia and autism. Ami Citri's lab uses molecular, synaptic, local circuit and behavioral data to study a small region of the brain called the claustrum. Varying its activity levels in mice has been shown to affect sleep, responsiveness and impulsive behavior - findings which could lead to new treatments for disorders like ADHD.\nAdvanced quantitative MRI methods are employed by ELSC member Aviv Mezer and his team to characterize changes in the biological composition of brain tissue as a person ages.\nOther studies utilize diverse methodologies, ranging from transcriptomics to electrophysiology and neuron-imaging, specifically targeting age-related diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.\nIn 2024, ELSC members have published studies that offer new perspectives on the brain, such as the research of Naomi Habib and her team on early stage detection of Alzheimer's; the questioning of the role of neurons as being responsible for all important processes in the brain by Inbal Goshen and her team; and the findings of the David Omer team that marmosets, considered a lower sub-species of the primate, call each other by designated names.\nNaomi Habib uses data from 1.6 million cells analyzed by algorithms and machine-learning techniques to identify specific cellular interactions. The study shows that Alzheimer's disease is not just a form of accelerated aging. On the basis of molecular markers, scientists will be able to pinpoint an individual's \"cellular path\" and likelihood of developing the disease.\nInbal Goshen challenges the traditional view that neurons alone are responsible for brain processing. She shows that astrocytes (non-neuronal brain cells) play an important role in brain plasticity and memory, so that stimulating astrocyte activity may alleviate Alzheimer's associated plaques.\nAwards and recognition\nHagai Bergman, a neuroscientist and physician at ELSC and the Faculty of Medicine of the Hebrew University, was awarded the Israel Prize for Life Sciences in 2024. Bergman's research has enhanced understanding of basal ganglia physiology and made significant contributions to the study and treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nIn 2024, Haim Sompolinsky, one of the founders of the center, was the first Israeli\nscientist to win the Brain Prize, an international prize awarded annually to leading brain researchers. Sompolinsky, a pioneer in computational neuroscience, uses theoretical models like the \u201cring attractor\u201d to study the dynamics of neuronal networks and their relation to animal and human behavior.\nHermona Soreq, anoth",

Raman (1919 or 1920 \u2013 15 December 1976) was an Indian-born Singaporean diplomat who served as the Ambassador to Indonesia and the Soviet Union (present-day Russia), from 1968 to 1969 and 1971 to 1976 respectively, and the High Commissioner to Australia from 1969 to 1971.\nA former educator, Raman also worked as a broadcaster, serving as the acting director of Broadcasting from 1965 to 1968 at Radio Singapore. In broadcasting, he was best known for advising then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew to not edit out the clip of him crying after announcing the separation of Singapore from Malaysia.\nEarly life and career\nRaman was born in either 1919 or 1920 in Papanasam, Madras, India (present-day Chennai, India) and moved to Singapore in 1947 following the Partition of India. He had originally planned to move from Singapore to Indonesia but was unable to due to financial problems.\nWhile living in India, Raman studied philosophy at Madras Christian College and worked as a Royal Air Force radar operator in Burma (present-day Myanmar) for the British during World War II. In Singapore, he worked as a teacher at Saint Andrew's School and a tutor. In 1963, he became a member and later chairman of the Council of Adult Education.\nIn the 1950s, Raman later got interested in broadcasting, working with Tamil and later English at Radio Singapore under the Central Production Unit, receiving further training in broadcasting in Madras, India.The clip with Lee Kuan Yew. The incident happens at 2:30.\nHe later served as the acting director of Broadcasting from 1965 to 1968. Whilst working as the acting director of Broadcasting, Raman advised then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew to not edit out a clip of him crying following his announcement of the separation of Singapore from Malaysia. Lee stated in his memoir that \" strongly advised against it. The press, he said, was bound to report it, and if he edited it out, their descriptions of the scene would make it appear worse.\"\nDiplomat career\nAmbassador of Singapore to Indonesia (1968\u20131969) and High Commissioner of Singapore to Australia (1969\u20131971)\nIn 1968, Raman served as the first Ambassador of Singapore to Indonesia following tensions between Singapore and Indonesia after the MacDonald House bombing. After the hanging of the perpetrators Harun Thohir and Usman Haji Muhammad Ali, Raman and his staff worked from Hotel Indonesia following death threats from Indonesians and the sacking of the Singapore Embassy in Indonesia.\nIn 1969, Raman suffered from a heart attack and went to a hospital in Jakarta before being flown back to Singapore for treatment.

    "Forged document circulated during the 1996 Australian federal election\nThe Ralph Willis letter was forged correspondence released by Australian Labor Party's Treasurer Ralph Willis in May 1996, in the last week of the 1996 Australian federal election.\nIt has been blamed for the crushing defeat of Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating and the ascendancy of the Liberals' John Howard. Labor stayed out of power federally until 2007.\nIncident\nIn the last week of campaigning, the news was dominated by the \"Ralph Willis letter\". Willis released two letters purporting to be secret correspondence between Liberal Opposition Leader John Howard and Liberal Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett. It dealt with the impact of the Coalition's funding plans for the states. Howard quickly denounced the letter as a forgery, and claims of Labor skullduggery dominated the close of the campaign, drowning out anything Prime Minister Paul Keating said.\nWillis acted unilaterally in releasing the correspondence. He suggested that the letters revealed that the Coalition government led by John Howard would cut grants to the states. However, media examination quickly revealed the letter to be a forgery. Labor claimed the forged documents had been foisted on Willis by the Melbourne University Liberal Club students.\nKeating's Labor government suffered a severe defeat.\nAftermath\nAfter the election, Willis chose to move to the backbench and announced his retirement from Parliament prior to the 1998 election. \nAccording to legal gossip sheet Justinian in 2002, leftwing writer Bob Ellis in Goodbye Jerusalem: night thoughts of a Labor outsider (1997) claimed that the Ralph Willis letter was the cause of Keating's defeat. An anonymous writer named \"Theodora\" wrote that Waterfront (2002) by Anne Davies and Helen Trinca had regaled Ellis's \"rant\".\nIn 2019, the Saturday Paper reported that the forgery was the work of university students. Nicola Gobbo, later to be known as Lawyer X, first came to public attention during the campaign. Gobbo, then a Young Labor member, publicly claimed that the forger was a then-Liberal staffer and later Senate president Scott Ryan, who had intended for the forgery to pass initial inspection then rebound on Labor. Gobbo backed up her story with a statutory declaration, but Ryan denied the claim.\nSee also\nOctober surprise\nZinoviev letter",

    "2022 novel by Vaishnavi Patel\nKaikeyi is a 2022 novel, the debut novel by Vaishnavi Patel. The work is a re-imagining of the life of the titular character, who first appeared in the ancient Sanskrit epic, the Ramayana. The character of Kaikeyi has long been vilified for her role in banishing her stepson Rama from the kingdom of Kosala. Patel's novel tells the story from Kaikeyi's perspective.\nPlot\nPrincess Kaikeyi is the only daughter of King Ashwapati of Kekaya. Kaikeyi grows up with no connection to the gods; unlike the rest of her family, they never answer any of her prayers. Kaikeyi discovers an old manuscript and learns to visualize the Binding Plane. Using this power, she can see threads connecting her to her other people. By plucking on these threads, she finds that she can manipulate their behavior.\nWhen she is sixteen, Kaikeyi is ordered to marry Raja Dasharath of Kosala, who has two other wives but remains childless. She agrees to marry Dasharath only on the condition that if she bears him a son, he will become the heir to Kosala.\nKaikeyi serves as Dasharath's charioteer in battle; she kills a minor warlord, saving his life. As a reward, he grants her two boons and a seat on his council. Kaikeyi slowly befriends Kaushalya and Sumitra, Dasharath's first two wives. The raja and his wives perform a Yagna. Agni appears before Kaikeyi, calling her both \u201cgods-touched\u201d and \u201cforsaken\u201d. All three women become pregnant at the same time. Kaushalya gives birth to Rama; the next day, Kaikeyi gives birth to Bharata; the next week, Sumitra gives birth to twins Lakshmana and Shatrugna.\nKaikeyi, Kaushalya, and Sumitra start a Women's Council to advocate for the needs of women within the country. This is opposed by religious leaders but is otherwise popular. When Rama is ten years old, he makes a derogatory remark about women. Kaikeyi slaps him and is frightened to see an image of god-like power within him.\nKaikeyi is sent as an emissary to Kekaya, where she reunites with her twin Yudhajjt. She brings Bharata and Rama with her. Along the way, Rama speaks to the river goddess Sarasvati, and Kaikeyi recognizes him as the incarnation of a god.\nAs her political influence grows, Kaikeyi angers Kosala's religious leaders by promoting women's independence from their husbands. She grows increasingly concerned by Rama's attraction to these conservative ideas. Dasharath breaks his promise to make Bharata his heir and names Rama instead. He then sends Rama and Lakshmana to train at an ashram; there, Rama is further exposed to sexist beliefs.\nDasharath tells Kaikeyi that he will abdicate in favor of Rama. She realizes that Rama's divine powers are allowing him to unconsciously manipulate others in the Binding Plane. Kaikeyi's twin brother Yudhajit now rules Kekaya. He states that Kaikeyi should not have released Dasharath from his promise to make Bharata his heir. Yudhajit threatens war if his biological nephew (Bharata) fails to assume the throne.\nKaikeyi tries to convince Rama to step aside in favor of Bharata, but he refuses. As the pressure of the impending coronation grows, Rama snaps and threatens his wife Sita. Kaikeyi decides that he must become more mature before assuming the throne. She uses the boons that Dasharath once granted her to demand Rama's exile and to place Bharata on the throne as his regent.\nRama leaves the city, accompanied by Lakshmana. Dasharath dies of grief. Bharata rejects the throne and curses Kaikeyi. Yudhajit prepares to go to war against Kosala. Shatrugna kills Yudhajit against Bharata's wishes. Bharata forgives Kaikeyi and agrees to rule during Rama's exile. Kaikeyi ponders how her story will be told in the future and hopes that Rama's time in exile will allow him to grow into the ruler he is meant to become.\nMajor themes\nA 2023 article in The Guardian examines the trend of feminist retellings of classic myths, writing that many such stories focus on western myths. The article specifically mentions novels like Kaikeyi and Daughter of the Moon Goddess which come from a non-western background. The article quotes author Sue Lynn Tan who stated that for myths \"that are less well-known, beyond the country of origin, retellings can introduce the culture to more readers\".\nPreeti Hay also commented on Kaikeyi's place in the genre of retellings, specifically drawing reference to Madeline Miller\u2019s Circe, Anita Diamant\u2019s The Red Tent, and Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni\u2019s The Palace of Illusions. Hay writes that stories within this genre \"use the framework of fiction to reimagine an established narrative, often through the point of view of a minor or lesser-known character who may or may not be a woman, or a woman character who is the main counterpart to the hero of the story.\"\nBackground\nIn an interview with Literary Hub, Patel explained that she had to be careful regarding religious sensitivities while writing the story. Patel stated \"I don\u2019t feel like any element of the actual story has been changed becaus",
    "Single-species fungal genus\nMalvinia is a fungal genus of uncertain familial placement in the order Ostropales. It comprises the single species Malvinia endoderma, a moss-parasitising fungus found in the Falkland Islands.\nTaxonomy\nMalvinia was circumscribed by the mycologist Peter D\u00f6bbeler in 2003. It is classified within the order Ostropales and currently contains a single species, Malvinia endoderma. The type specimen of Malvinia endoderma was collected on 25 January 1968, by John Jay Engel in the Falkland Islands. Specifically, it was found on the east side of the summit ridge of Mount Adam in West Falklands, at an elevation between 2,200 and 2,297\u00a0ft (671 and 700\u00a0m).\nThe etymology of the genus name reflects its geographic origin. Malvinia is derived from Las Islas Malvinas, which is the Spanish name for the Falkland Islands where the type specimen was discovered. The specific epithet endoderma is a combination of two Greek words: endo, meaning 'within', and derma, meaning 'skin'. This name was chosen to describe the fungus's habit of forming its reproductive structures (ascomata) within the epidermis of its host plant.\nTaxonomically, Malvinia endoderma shares some similarities with Rogellia nectrioidea, another species described by the same author. Both are monospecific genera within the Ostropales and develop their fruit-bodies endobiotically within the abaxial (lower) side of their host plants' leaves. However, D\u00f6bbeler determined that the differences between these two species in key characteristics \u2013 such as excipular structure, spore type, and iodine reaction \u2013 were significant enough to warrant their placement in separate genera. The genus is variously classified as incertae sedis (of uncertain placement) in the either the order Ostropales, or in the subclass Ostropomycetidae.\nDescription\nMalvinia is characterised by its unique reproductive structures and parasitic lifestyle. The genus produces apothecioid ascomata, which are small, disc-shaped fruiting bodies typically measuring 65\u2013120 micrometres (\u03bcm) in diameter and up to 30\u00a0\u03bcm in height. These structures are roundish, uncoloured, and smooth, with an irregular or star-shaped opening. The excipulum, or outer layer of the ascomata, is greatly reduced, while the paraphyses are thread-like and approximately 1.5\u00a0\u03bcm wide.\nThe reproductive cells, or asci, are unitunicate (single-walled) and measure 22\u201326 by 6\u20137\u00a0\u03bcm. They are subcylindrical or narrowly ellipsoidal in shape and contain eight spores each. These asci do not react with iodine-based staining reagents, a characteristic used in fungal identification. The ascospores produced by the asci are ellipsoidal, single-celled, and uncoloured, measuring 6.5\u20138 by 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm. The fungal hyphae of Malvinia are extremely delicate, less than 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm wide, and colourless, growing within the cell walls of the host plant.\nMalvinia is parasitic, specifically infecting the lower, older leaves of the moss Dendroligotrichum squamosum. The fungus develops its reproductive structures within the abaxial (lower) epidermal cells of the host's leaves, causing the cell walls to split and form distinctive tooth-like flaps that cover the developing hymenium (spore-producing layer).\n",

    "Series of forest fires in South AfricaThe 2024 Western Cape wildfires are a series of forest fires in the City of Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa. They led to the loss of 52,501 hectares of land, of which 15,587 hectares were on the CapeNature estate. 129 VIIRS fire alerts were reported between September 11, 2023, and September 16, 2024 (high confidence alerts), with 52 VIIRS fire alerts reported in 2024.\nDescription\nThe typical season of forest fires in the City of Cape Town is mid-November and usually lasts 21 weeks. On January 31, 2024, the Operational Land Imager captured this false-color image of a fire burning near Pringle Bay and Betty's Bay, communities about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Cape Town. However, sensors on NASA and NOAA satellites began to detect widespread fire activity near Pringle Bay on January 29, the same day that local authorities warned people in nearby communities to prepare to evacuate. The next day, Pringle Bay's 800 residents were ordered to evacuate, and firefighters fought the blaze along the southern edge of the town.\nA full evacuation was ordered for Pringle Bay, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Cape Town. The South African Weather Service (SAWS) issued the highest level 10 warning for veld fire conditions across central, eastern, and northern parts of the province. The fire season in the City of Cape Town began on December 1, 2023. There were a few small fires that continued till the first three weeks of January 2024, fueled by the hot, dry weather and strong coastal winds. According to Annelie Rabie, mayor of the Overstrand municipality, about six wildfires had broken out in the area. As of Jan. 30, two of the six fires remain uncontained; the fire of greatest concern was located in the Hangklip area between Pringle Bay and Betty's Bay. Later, the department was able to contain four, in Vrygrond, Masiphumelele, Broadlands, and Overcome Heights. One was heading straight for Pringle Bay.\nThe authorities issued a code red status due to the fire threatening homes and advised Silversands, Seafarms, and Blesberg residents to evacuate. An evacuation shelter was established at Kleinmond Town Hall. The fire was expected to spread along Brodie Link into Pringle Bay. On January 31, 2024, eight fires were burning on CapeNature land throughout the Western Cape. The first day where no fires were reported was February 7, 2024, marking a temporary end to a gruelling 15 days of firefighting by Cape Nature staff. On February 1, 2024, local authorities declared that all flare-ups were contained. Four homes were destroyed, according to news reports.\nThe most demanding period was between January 22 and February 15, 2024. The district suffered multiple major fires simultaneously, the most serious being the Kluitjieskraal and Brandvlei fires. These fires were triggered by extreme weather conditions, high temperatures, and strong winds, combined with the excessive fuel load provided by aged natural and alien vegetation, which made suppression operations exceptionally challenging.\nKluitjieskraal fire\nOn January 23, 2024, there was an ignition at Kluitjieskraal in the Wolseley area. Over the next three weeks, there were multiple ignitions throughout the Western Cape, with the concentration of conflagrations being the Boland and Whale Coast. It was one of the fires of greatest concern that had been burning since January 22 in the Kluitjieskraal area near Wolseley in the Cape Winelands District Municipality. The fire split into two fire-lines on either side of the Obiqua Mountain.\nFrom 1 July 2023 to 30 April 30, 2024, 1,435 fires were reported to the CWDM's control room. Most veld fire ignitions occurred within the boundaries of Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, accounting for 69% of all calls. The frequency of veld fires peaked from October 2023 to April 2024.\nThe fires in Overcome Heights and Masiphumelele reportedly damaged dozens of informal dwellings, displacing around 250 people.\nDamage\nIn total, 52 501 hectares of land were burnt, out of which 15,587 hectares were on the CapeNature estate.  As per the government reports, 95% of a nearby nature reserve had also burned.\nEven though there was property damage to vineyards, orchards, water infrastructure, and fences, there were no civilian or firefighter casualties.\n",

    "New Zealand motorcycle racer (born 1988)\nKatherine Prumm (born 4 June 1988), currently known by her married name, Katherine Oberlin-Brown, is a former New Zealand professional motocross rider. In 2006 and 2007, she won two consecutive Women's Motocross World Cups. In 2019, she was inducted into the MNZ Hall of Fame, the New Zealand Motorcycling Hall of Fame.\nCareer\nBorn in South Africa, Prumm emigranted with her family to New Zealand in 1995, when she was seven years old. The Prumms settled in Bombay, south of the Auckland Region. There, she took up motocross in 1998, at the age of ten, often competing against male rivals, and soon achieved notable victories, both domestically and in Australia and Japan. Thanks to her achievements, she joined the official Kawasaki team.\nIn 2005, at the age of 17, Prumm competed in the first Women's Motocross World Cup, the forerunner of the current World Championship (WMX) and finished second behind the German Stephanie Laier. In 2006 and 2007, she won the World Cup. In the 2008 season, Prumm left Kawasaki and signed with Yamaha. That year, when the World Cup became a World Championship, she came close to winning the title, but lost her chances when she broke her collarbone and wrist just two rounds from the end of the championship, during a training session in Belgium, and she had finished in the ninth position.\nPrumm's racing career was cut short shortly before the start of the 2009 season. In a training session in New Zealand she landed badly after a jump and broke her back in three places (specifically the vertebrae T6, T9 and T12). Although it appeared that she would never be able to walk again, she eventually fully recovered from her injuries, but her time as a motocross racer came to an end.\nLife after racing\nDespite having to retire from motocross, Prumm is still involved in the elite sport. After graduating from university with a degree in sport and exercise science she began working as a physiologist at High Performance Sport New Zealand (HPSNZ), from where she supports New Zealand's elite athletes.\n",

    "2024 documentary film\nChild Star is a 2024 American documentary film directed by American singer Demi Lovato and American cinematographer Nicola Marsh. The film centers on the subject of the tribulations of experiencing child stardom, fame, and working in the entertainment industry at a young age. It stars Lovato, Drew Barrymore, JoJo Siwa, Raven-Symon\u00e9, Christina Ricci, Kenan Thompson, and Alyson Stoner. The film was promoted by the release of the single \"You'll Be OK, Kid\", performed by Lovato.\nPlot\nChild Star opens with a group of children who answer questions regarding their aspirations, the meaning of fame, and how being on camera makes them feel. The film delves into the historical background and economic importance of child stardom in the United States, dating back to silent film actor Jackie Coogan and Shirley Temple. The film interweaves this historical context with discussions between Lovato with other former child performers including Drew Barrymore, JoJo Siwa, Raven-Symon\u00e9, Christina Ricci, Alyson Stoner, and Kenan Thompson, regarding their personal journeys and experiences with fame as children. Chris Columbus, who produced Home Alone and the first two Harry Potter movies, also participates in the film sharing details about castings and the impact that fame has on the lives of young actors. Throughout Child Star, Lovato also shares her own life experiences as a former child actor on Barney & Friends and as a singer and actor on Disney Channel. The film features Lovato's conversations with her family, including sister Madison De La Garza, who starred on Desperate Housewives. Towards the end of the film, Lovato meets with aspiring child actors who ask her personal questions. The film ends with sessions of her in the studio writing and recording \"You'll Be OK, Kid\".\nProduction\nThe production of Child Star, the American singer and actor Demi Lovato's directorial debut, was announced in March 2023. In an interview with magazine Billboard in December 2023, Demi Lovato expressed her excitement for the project, and stated: \"I'm having some deep and meaningful conversations with people that obviously were child stars previously\". On July 31, 2024, The Hollywood Reporter revealed the release date of the documentary, September 17, and the former child actors that would be appearing, including Drew Barrymore, Kenan Thompson, Christina Ricci, Raven-Symon\u00e9, JoJo Siwa, and Lovato's Camp Rock co-star Alyson Stoner. In a press statement about the film, Lovato said: \"There is no better film or topic for my directorial debut than this story, which is close to home\". It was produced by OBB Media' Michael D. Ratner, Scott Ratner, Miranda Sherman, Kfir Goldberg, and Lovato. It was executive produced by Marsh, Scooter Braun, Scott Manson, Jen McDaniels, and James Shin, while Glenn Stickley served as a co-executive producer.\nMarketing\nThe official trailer for the documentary film was released on September 5, 2024.

During an interview with Good Morning America on September 18, 2024, Lovato said her motivation underlying the film is to explore \"why people get into the industry at such a young age\" and \"how it affects us\", as well as the sharing the history of child stars \"dating back to Shirley Temple and Jackie Coogan\". Lovato also shared dissociation was a common thread between all the child stars, as there were \"chunks of time and memories and projects that we don't remember working on, which was really fascinating to me\".\n",

In 1287, after Sithu IV became a vassal of the Mongol Empire, Thihathu ambushed and killed his father. On his way back to Pyay, he built another stupa in Pandaung and prayed to the original stupa for forgiveness, asking that his father not be reborn into his own unborn child. The folk etymology of the town's name comes from this story, deriving from a shortening of the phrase \u1006\u102f\u1015\u1014\u103a\u1010\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a\u1038\u1015\u1014\u103a, 'Pray for forgiveness' (Su-pan-taung-pan).\nIn 1415, the governor of Pandaung was captured in a riverine naval battle during the Forty Years' War.\nThe modern town was created a town from the pre-existing village by the Ministry of Home Affairs in 1972. The town lies on the main road connecting Pyay to Rakhine State and is the namesake of the Taungup-Pandaung road.\nEducation\nThe Pandaung primary school was recognised as a \"rural model school\" by the Ministry of Education with community learning centres funded by various educational organisations from Pyay and Yangon. The learning centres in Pandaung support libraries and social activities for youth and was slated to be a model for rural educational access in Myanmar.\n",

    "Bernard Mongan was a British soldier who in 2020 was found dead in Catterick Garrison. Mongan had been missing for three weeks before his absence was noticed after his decomposing corpse was found in his bedroom in his barracks. Before his disappearance and death, there had been reports that Mongan had suffered from abuse from fellow British military staff.\nThe circumstances of his death were covered in multiple British newspapers and an inquiry was held which found that bullying and failure to notice signs of Mongan's mental health had contributed to his death.\nLife\nPersonal life\nBernard Mongan, often called Bernie, was born in Bristol, England, though he spent most of his childhood in Ireland. The newspaper IrishCentral reported that he had a \"\u201csoft southern Irish accent,\u201d \nHe had 3 children with a woman called Beth who he married and later separated with, though they remained on friendly terms.\nMilitary service\nAccording to the British tabloid newspaper the Daily Mirror, Bernard Mongan first joined the British Army's Irish Guards in 2004 and fought in the Iraq War, and that he later left the British Army in 2012 only to rejoin in 2015 where he joined the Intelligence Corps of the Royal Signals.\nAccording to the BBC, Mongan had allegedly made \"an attempt on his own life\" in 2016.\n2018 assault\nIn 2018 Mongan was the victim of a serious assault in Catterick Garrison in November 2018. According to the mother of his children Beth, Mongan had been \u201cviolently assaulted by two soldiers from Northern Ireland in November 2018.\u201d She went onto say of Mongan:\u201c...had been bullied quite a bit over the last couple of years. He was beaten up and as far as I am aware it is being treated as a racist incident. There were several other occasions when he felt he was being treated unfairly by senior members of his battalion.\"According to Bella Innes, a veteran support worker who had personally known Mongan for a decade, commented on the 2018 attack against Mongan:\u201cBernie was intensely bullied. He told me he was beaten up by two Irish Guardsmen because he had a southern Irish accent. He said they called him a terrorist, beat him to the ground and jumped on his head.

    "Annual horse competition in Las Vegas, NV\nThis article is about the equestrian competition. For the automobile competition, see IMSA Ford Mustang Challenge.\nThe Mustang Champions Western Challenge, or simply the Mustang Challenge, held in Las Vegas, is an equestrian competition that showcases the American Mustang. It is being held annually in July by the Mustang Champions organization, in conjunction with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. It is a sister event to the Mustang Classic held in Lexington, Kentucky during the fall, and both are intended to complement the Extreme Mustang Makeover events.\nThe event was created \"to showcase the skill and adaptability of the American mustang and the talented trainers that work with them in the Western discipline\".\nHistory\nWild mustangs on BLM land\nThe Wild Horse and Burro Program was created in 1971 by the Bureau of Land Management, part of the United States Department of the Interior. Its purpose was to manage the herds of feral horses and donkeys roaming lands in the Western US. This involves controlling the sizes of the herds so that they do not tax the natural resources too much and endanger themselves or other animals. Ideally the BLM tries to have the mustangs and burros that it removes from the wild adopted by individuals or organizations. This has become more challenging as the years have passed.\nIn 2001, the non-profit Mustang Heritage Foundation was established aiming to help the BLM find homes for mustangs and burros collected from the wild and to minimize the amount of time these animals have to remain in holding facilities. The organization has facilitated the adoption of thousands of animals.\nIn 2007, the MHF held its first Extreme Mustang Makeover event in Fort Worth. The Foundation arranged for 100 horse trainers to spend 100 days training 100 mustangs fresh from the wild. During the event, the trainers competed for prizes to demonstrate how domesticated their horses were and how ready for real-world use. The wildly successful event has since been held annually and similar events are now held across the country to promote interest in mustangs.\nTo further advance the cause and promote acceptance of mustangs in the equestrian community, the Mustang Champions organization was founded. The organization established twin competitions for mustang trainers: the Mustang Challenge in Las Vegas featuring Western skills tournaments, and the Mustang Classic in Lexington featuring English eventing. The inaugural events were held in 2024.\n2024 competition\nThe 2024 event featured US$125,000 in cash and prizes. It was sponsored by Western Horseman magazine. There were 64 entrants registered. The event consisted of three classes of competition: Reigning patten, Trail riding, Ranch riding. The top competitors from these classes went on to the finals competition.\nThe following were the leaders of each class:\nThe winners after the finals were:\nChris Phillips and Samantha Rock were additionally notable for having finished in the top 5 for both the Mustang Challenge and the Mustang Classic in 2024.\nSee also\nList of Bureau of Land Management Herd Management Areas",

At that time, the chairman of the union was referred to as the village president. In 1950, during Pakistan's rule, the title of village president was officially changed to Union Chairman. Subsequently, Golam Hossain Sarkar and Sadat Ali served as village presidents. In 1967, Dr. Reaz Uddin Sarkar, a member of the then Pakistan Sub-Divisional Jury Board, was the first to be appointed as Union Council Chairman, and he served as the chairman during the Liberation War. After the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, the subsequent chairmen included Taiyab Ali, A. Matin (acting), and Mazedul Islam Sarkar (elected for a second term), followed by Taiyab Ali again. In 1985, for administrative convenience, the then administrator separated Rasulpur village from Mandari Union to form a new union called Rasulpur. Currently, Mandari Union Council consists of the same 12 villages.\nThere are two local legends regarding the name of Mandari Union. Previously, Hindus were predominant in most of the villages in Mandari Union. Radha Ram Singh and Ashu Singh, among the wealthy individuals of Mandari village, were the first to propose the name of Mandari Union. At that time, boats were the only means of communication for Mandari Union.\nAdministrative\nBhatipara is a small union, it has only 17 villages and 9 wards (as all union council).\nEducation and culture\nEducation\nCulture\nThe traditional characteristics of a low-lying region surrounded by haor wetlands are prevalent here. The majority of the people in this area have been engaged in agriculture for a long time, making their daily lives and culture intricately linked with farming.\nThe locals generally use the Sylheti dialect, with some influence from the Mymensingh dialect.\n",
    "Continental wildfires in 2024\nThe 2024 South American wildfires refer to a mega colossal series of wildfires that significantly impacted several neighboring South American countries, including Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Based on Global Wildfire Information System satellite imaging, about 346,112 wildfire hotspots damaged or destroyed 85,866,867 hectares (~212,181,650 acres). The massive area burned was primarily caused by anthropogenic climate change and the resulting consequences of the 2023\u20132024 South American drought on fire conditions. The wildfires caused significant deforestation of the Amazon rainforest, and also impacted several other international biomes including the Pantanal wetlands, becoming the second largest series of wildfires in the 21st century next to the 2023\u201324 Australian bushfire season, with the 2024 Brazil wildfires alone reaching fourth in area burned.\nBackground\nSee also: 2023\u20132024 South American drought\nBeginning in 2023, prolonged drought conditions impacted most of South America as a result of lighter seasonal rainfall in the Amazon and \"warming of northern tropical Atlantic Ocean waters\" and the Equatorial Pacific due to the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation climate phenomenon. In addition, increased temperatures due to anthropogenic global warming from increased atmospheric CO2 and methane resulted in more severe climate phenomena, with September 2023 setting a global temperature record at the time.\nIn January 2024, the World Weather Attribution climate scientist initiative determined that the primary driver of the 2023 drought conditions was anthropogenic climate change as opposed to El Ni\u00f1o. The resulting increase in temperatures combined with a marked decrease in rainfall caused  widespread evaporation of moisture from soil and plants, which in turn significantly exacerbated drought conditions and resulting wildfires. In the central regions of Brazil, temperatures reached 1\u00a0\u00b0C above the 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C average global increase, resulting in large amounts of rain evaporating before it could move deeper into the soil.\nIn May 2024, the Brazilian savannah of the Cerrado suffered from its worst drought in over 700 years based on geological research of stalagmites in the open entrance On\u00e7a Cave.\nIn August 2024, the Amazon had several of its rivers reach critically low water levels in the first weeks of its dry season, with several rivers in the southwest Amazon reaching their lowest point on record for their respective times of the year. The Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization released a technical statement reporting that the Amazon basin had been significantly impacted by drought conditions, and anticipated that it would cause significant issues in its member states: \"Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela.\"\nWildfires\nSatellite imaging detected 346,112 fire hot spots in 2024 by 11 September, exceeding the prior 2007 record of 345,322 hot spots since data began in 1998. As a result of the blazes, a massive diagonal corridor of smoke spread across the continent from Colombia to Uruguay.\nBolivia\nForest fires in Bolivia began in June, and began to grow out of control by August and September, destroying 4 million hectares (10 million acres) of grassland and forest areas in the departments of La Paz, Cochabamba, Beni, Santa Cruz, and Pando, while emitting significant amounts of smoke and air pollution. Many of the fires also blazed in the Amazon rainforest next to the border of Brazil, and next to colossal wildfires located in Brazil. Of the area burned, 60% was grassland and 40% was forest, and multiple protected areas were impacted.\nResponse\nBy early September, The Bolivian government declared a state of emergency for the entire nation, and 5,000 volunteer firefighters were assigned to mitigate the blazes. Bolivian Minister of Defense Edmundo Novillo requested international support, of which Brazil, Venezuela, and France stated that they would offer assistance.\nBrazil\nMain article: 2024 Brazil wildfires\nSatellite imaging of wildfires and smoke trails in the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil, taken on 9 September 2024.\nIn 2024, 53,302 wildfires detected by the Global Wildfire Information System (GWIS) burned an estimated 37,578,692 hectares (92,858,970 acres) of tropical wetland in Brazil's Pantanal in Mato Grosso do Sul, the Amazon rainforest, and the Cerrado.\nThroughout the first two weeks of June, 2,639 fires burned 32,000 hectares (79,000 acres) of the Pantanal wetlands, six times the highest number of fires in the region for June compared to any prior year. The number rose to over 760,000 hectares (1.9\u00a0million acres) by 9 July, burning over 4% of the 16.9\u00a0million hectares (42\u00a0million acres) of wetland. The intensity and range of the wildfires were exacerbated by strong winds blowing at up to 40 km per hour. The prominent fires threatened many of the natural fauna including anteaters, jaguars, tapirs, caimans, and anacondas. A total of",

He married a woman named Leucone, but he often neglected her due to his frequent hunting in the woods. The suspicious Leucone followed him one day unbeknownst to him, and was attacked and killed by his hunting dogs in his absence. When he found her torn body, he killed himself in regret.\nFamily\nThe Thessalian Cyanippus was the son of a man named Pharax by an unnamed mother. Nothing more is known about his family or lineage.\nMythology\nThe myth goes that the hunter Cyanippus fell in love with the very beautiful Leucone, and begged her parents for her hand in marriage, which they agreed to. The couple was married soon enough but Cyanippus, being a hunter, greatly enjoyed hunting wild animals in the woods for large amounts of time each day. Often when he returned home at night he would be too tired to even say a word to Leucone, or sometimes he would spend the entire night in the woods and not come back home to her at all.\nTime passed, and as Cyanippus continued to neglect his home and wife, Leucone began suspecting that he was being unfaithful to her, and that he was using the forest and hunting as an excuse to meet another woman there, secretly from her. So one day she took the decision to dress up in hunting gear and follow him in secret as he went out to hunt, unwitting of her suspicions or intentions. When Cyanippus was not around, his hunting dogs, which were extremely savage, scented the hiding Leucone, and mistaking her for some wild animal, they attacked and tore her into pieces.\nSometime later, Cyanippus discovered his wife's lifeless body, torn to pieces. He was then consumed with immense grief, and proceeded to light Leucone's funeral pyre with the help of his hunting companions. He lifted her dead body up in the pyre, and then slew all of his hounds that had caused her death. After that, he took his own life as well.\nSee also\nAncient Greece portalMythology portal\nActaeon, another man who was devoured by his own hunting dogs\nCephalus, another man who killed his wife while hunting",
    "Dulkadirid prince (died 1426)\nAla al-Din Ali Beg (died June 1426) was a Dulkadirid prince who served the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt and Syria. During the reign of his father, Khalil (r.\u20091353\u201386), Ali received land around Aleppo from the Mamluk Sultan Barquq (r.\u20091382\u201389,\u00a01390\u201399), although it is unknown whether this was just an honorary rank or if some service was required. The Mamluk Sultanate an-Nasir Faraj (r.\u20091399\u20131412) appointed Ali as the governor of Aintab in July 1402, which he later lost on an unknown date. The new sultan al-Mu'ayyad Shaykh (r.\u20091412\u201321) instead transferred the city's rule to Ali's brother Nasir al-Din Mehmed in November 1411, the leader of the Dulkadirids as an appreciation of Mehmed's support for his rise to power. However, in the spring of 1417, al-Mu'ayyad Shaykh led two expeditions against the Dulkadirids, the first of which retook Aintab and Darende (which was lost after), and Ala al-Din Ali joined the latter campaign. The Mamluks then trusted Ali and Ali's son Hamza with the administration of Elbistan and Marash, respectively. This lasted a short period as Mehmed restored Dulkadirid rule in Elbistan. Afterwards, Mehmed sought more amicable relations with his relatives and the Mamluks, appointing Ali as the governor of Marash. Through the orders of the Mamluk Sultan Barsbay (r.\u20091422\u201338), Mehmed regained Aintab and Darende, which Ali had been reassigned as the governor of by the previous Mamluk ruler Sayf al-Din Tatar (r.\u20091421). Although Ali kept Marash, he was executed by Barsbay in June 1426. His son Hamza briefly controlled Marash but was succeeded by Mehmed's son Fayyaz.\n",

    "Slovak Roman Catholic martyr (1928\u20131965)\nJ\u00e1n Havl\u00edk (12 February 1928 \u00a0\u2013 27 December 1965) was a Slovak Lazarist. He was beatified by the Pope Francis in 2023 for his martyrdom under Communist rule of Czechoslovakia. His feast day is 12 February. He was dubbed the martyr of faithfulness by the Conference of Slovak Bishops.\nBiography\nEarly life and education\nJ\u00e1n Havl\u00edk was born on 12 February 1928 in the village of Dubovce in the Skalica District. He was the eldest of four children. His family was poor and very religious. As a child, he was influenced by his aunt Angela, who was a nun of the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul.\nHavl\u00edk started his education at the elementary school in Hol\u00ed\u010d, where he had to walk 8 kilometers daily from his home village to attend classes.  In 1943 he enrolled at the Lazarist missionary school in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, planning to study at a seminary and become a priest after graduation. Nonetheless, the school was evacuated following the breakout of the Slovak National Uprising and the students were sent home. Havl\u00edk was only able to return to Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica and resume his education after the war. By the time he eventually graduated in 1949, the seminaries were either closed or controlled by the agents of the Communist authorities and not recognized by the Vatican. Consequently, Havl\u00edk opted to instead enter novitiate with the Lazarist order and study at an underground seminary. Nonetheless, even this alternative plan did not go smoothly as the authorities forcibly removed all the novices from the cloister to a reeducation camp in the  Kostoln\u00e1 pri Dunaji village. There, Havl\u00edk was forced into hard manual labor building a dam. After the dam was finally completed in August 1950, he moved to a rented apartment in Nitra, found a laborer job while continuing to study at the underground seminary.\nArrest and persecution\nOn 29 October 1951, StB agents stormed the rented apartment and arrested Havl\u00edk and his roommates, who also studied at the underground seminary. Havl\u00edk was detained without trial for 15 months, while regularly tortured.\nIn February 1953 he was charged of treason and espionage for the Vatican. In spite of the harsh treatment he refused to admit guilt insisting \"My only goal was to become a priest. I acted according to my conscience. This is all I have to say.\" He was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor. He was transported to the work camp Equality in J\u00e1chymov, where he was forced to work at a uranium mine. While working at the mine, he was repeatedly injured and undergone a back surgery.\nIn spite of cruel treatment, Havl\u00edk continued to serve the Church by smuggling small pieces of sacramental bread hidden in cigarette papers into the camp and distributing them to his fellow prisoners. In 1958, the authorities learned about this. Havl\u00edk was placed in a solitary imprisonment and sentenced to another year of hard labour. His health quickly deteriorated and by 1960 he was nearly constantly in the hospital and clearly incapable of physical labour. Havl\u00edk formally applied for release due to his poor health but his application was denied.\nLate years and death\nThe grave of J\u00e1n Havl\u00edk.\nHavl\u00edk was finally released in 1962 after nine years of hard labour. He was assigned a disability pension of only 407 crowns, about a third of standard laborer's wage. When he complained, his pension was further decreased to 300 crowns. For the rest of his life, Havl\u00edk depended on his parents for financial support to afford life necessities.\nIn 1965 he was again hospitalized. He was released from hospital on Christmas Eve.

    "Musical artistCongolese singer and composer (1961\u20132011)\nCleophas Claude Dieka Mbaki (12 October 1961 \u2013 24 April 2011), known professionally as Debaba, Debaba El Shabab, or Debaba Mbaki, was a Congolese singer-songwriter and composer. Born and raised in Kinshasa, Dieka made his public musical debut with the band V\u00e9ritable Sakana Musica. In 1975, he became a member of Kanako Shiprike Bango orchestra, founded by Tonton Boutshie (often spelled Butshe).\nDieka gained widespread recognition through his work with musical groups like Viva La Musica, Victoria Eleison, Historia Musica, and Choc Stars, as well as for composing critically acclaimed hits \"Abidjan\", \"Terminus\", \"Type\" (alternately known as \"Tati Kond\u00e9\"), \"Zikondo\", and \"C\u00e9lio D\u00e9clar\u00e9\".\nEarly life and career\n1961\u20131977: Childhood, education and music debut\nDebaba was born Cleophas Claude Dieka Mbaki on 12 October 1961 in L\u00e9opoldville (now Kinshasa), in what was then the Belgian Congo (and was later the Republic of the Congo, then Zaire, and is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). His father, Simba Simba, served in the Zairean military, while his mother, Mbombo Pascaline, worked as a vendor at March\u00e9 Central. He grew up in Barumbu, living on Kindu Avenue with his cousin Hyppolite, and attended the Petit S\u00e9minaire Saint Jean Berchmans de Lemfu, a Catholic boarding institution operated by the Catholic Brothers, located 32 kilometers away from Kisantu. After his return to Kinshasa, he pursued his education at the Ngiri-Ngiri Athenaeum (Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e de Ngiri-Ngiri) and later at the Coll\u00e8ge Saint Pierre de Kinshasa, where he crossed paths with Derval, leading to the formation of the band V\u00e9ritable Sakana Musica.\nDebaba and Derval subsequently joined a youth group from the Lingwala commune known as Kanako Chipriquez Bango. This group soon caught the attention of the city's musical elites, earning performances as an opening act for Viva La Musica. Founded by Tonton Boutshie, Kanako became a fertile ground for up-and-coming Zairean artists, including Debaba, who thrived among peers like Derval, Adrida, Joly Mubiala, Wa Zinga, and Djodjo Monga Herion.\n1978\u20131981: Viva La Musica\nIn the late 1970s, Viva La Musica's bandleader and founder Papa Wemba was enduring the physical strain of angina; Debaba seized the opportunity to perform an improvised version of Derval's composition, \"Elu Sharufa\", during a public performance in Papa Wemba's presence. Impressed by Debaba's distinctively high-pitched tonality, Papa Wemba immediately sought his collaboration and invited him to the studio to record the piece together. This sparked a series of negotiations, which ultimately led to Debaba officially joining Viva La Musica in 1978.\nHe became part of a lineup that featured prominent Zairean musicians like King Kester Emeneya, Djuna Djanana wa Mpanga, Dindo Yogo, Bipoli, Esp\u00e9rant Djengaka, Fafa De Moloka\u00ef, and Rigo Star. He quickly made a name for himself, contributing vocals to almost every song released from late 1978 to 1982, with standout tracks like \"M\u00e9a Culpa\" and \"Ngonda\" gaining him wide recognition. Debaba was also one of the headlining acts at Papa Wemba's Village de Moloka\u00ef, a symbolic recreation of an African village in Matonge, where Papa Wemba enthroned himself as its customary chief. While with Viva La Musica, he composed the 1981 hit \"Abidjan\" accompanied by Bengali Petit Prince, Fafa De Moloka\u00ef and Maray Maray, featuring Huit Kilos Nseka on the guitar and Itshiari Mukulapio on percussion (lokole).\n1982: Victoria Eleison\nFollowing an internal rupture within Viva La Musica in 1982, Debaba departed and co-founded Victoria Eleison with King Kester Emeneya and Bipoli, with the endorsement of music journalist Jeannot Ne Nzau Diop. The newly established group also boasted an elite membership, including Petit Prince Bengali, Huit Kilos, Tofla Kitoko, Safro, Pinos, Patcho Star, Ekoko Mbonda, Mongo Ley, and Jolly Mubiala Baki Amen. Debaba's stint with Victoria Eleison was relatively short, and he soon left to create his musical group.\n1983\u20131984: Historia Esth\u00e9tique\nDebaba departed from Victoria Eleison to form the orchestra Historia Musica and proposed that Koffi Olomide, whom he had met a few years earlier, collaborate with him. The orchestra was established in 1983. Debaba became a founding member, while Koffi was appointed president and backup singer, with L\u00e9l\u00e9 Nsundi serving as the artistic director. Historia Musica included other members like Cele Le Roi, Desouza Santu, Koko Anana Efoloko, Muzola Ngunga (formerly of Orchestre Kiam), Laza le Chestre, Coco Coluche, Djoe Mile, Derval, Adamo Leovis, Moreno, Athos, Autri, Commando, and Lokombe Bola Bolite. Their collaborations yielded the album Sauvetage, which featured the widely recognized single \"L'amour Du Risque\" and subsequent tracks like \"Abidjan\" (revised), \"Wydeza\", \"Toli Ya Libala\", and the eponymous single.\nAfter Koffi Olomide departed a few months later to pursue solo ventures, Debaba and L\u00e9l\u00e9 Nsundi rebranded the",

    "British Army military unit\nMilitary unit\nThe Berwickshire Militia, later the Berwickshire, Haddington, Linlithgow and Peebles Militia (BHL&P Militia), was an auxiliary regiment of the British Army recruited across South-East Scotland. First organised after the restoration of Charles II, it was reformed in 1802 and later converted to artillery. It served in home defence in all of Britain's major wars until it was disbanded in 1909.\nScottish Militia\nThe universal obligation to military service in the Shire levy was long established in Scotland: all men aged from 16 to 60 were obliged to serve for a maximum of 40 days in any one year if required, and their arms and equipment were inspected at regular Wapenshaws. In time of war they would be called out by proclamation and by riders galloping through towns and villages bearing the 'Fiery Cross'. Following the restoration of Charles II, the Scottish Parliament passed an Act in 1661 to create a militia of 20,000 infantry and 2000 horse, available for Crown service anywhere in Scotland, England or Ireland. The contribution from the county of Berwickshire was to be 800 foot and 74 horse. Given the disturbed state of Scotland at this time, the Berwickshire Militia was frequently on active service between 1670 and 1685. During Argyll's Rising in 1685 King James II & VII ordered the disarming of many of the Scottish Militia for fear that they would join the rebel duke. However, the Scottish Militia were called out in 1689 during the Glorious Revolution that overthrew James.\nFollowing the Union in 1707, during the War of the Spanish Succession, the Parliament of Great Britain passed an Act in 1708 to re-arm the Scottish Militia. However, the Act was denied Royal assent because of fears that the new force would be disloyal (a Jacobite uprising in Scotland was expected in support of the French invasion fleet that was then at sea). In the aftermath of the Jacobite Rising of 1715 a Disarming Act was passed in Scotland and although some militia served in the government forces that fought against the Jacobite Rising of 1745 there was a reluctance to leave weapons in the hands of those who might rebel.\nThe English Militia were conscripted by ballot, and this system was revived in 1757 during the Seven Years' War. However, there were residual fears of Jacobitism in Scotland, so rather than extend the Militia Acts to Scotland, full-time home defence regiments of 'Fencibles' were raised for the duration of the war. These soldiers were recruited in the normal way under officers commissioned by the king, unlike militiamen who were raised by ballot and commanded by local officers appointed by the Lord-lieutenant.\nBerwickshire, Haddington, Linlithgow & Peebles Militia\nFrench Revolutionary War\nFear of Jacobitism had been replaced by fear of Jacobinism by the 1790s, and the Militia Act 1797 finally extended the county militia system to Scotland during the French Revolutionary War. Ten regiments of Scottish militia were raised in 1798 under the Act, including the 10th (or Edinburgh) Regiment of North British Militia under the command of Colonel Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch, appointed on 10 March 1798 and given the rank of Brevet Colonel in the army while the regiment was embodied. His son-in-law, Alexander Home, 10th Earl of Home, was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel. The regiment's recruiting areas and quotas were defined as:\nEdinburgh (county): 230 men\nEdinburgh (city): 83 men\nLinlithgowshire: 74 men\nHaddingtonshire: 144 men\nBerwickshire: 153 men\nThere was considerable opposition to the ballot in western Scotland, but the counties making up the 10th Regiment's recruiting area seem to have been little affected by disorder. The regiment served in various garrisons across Scotland until April 1802, when the militia was disembodied after hostilities ended with the Treaty of Amiens. The regiment was reduced to a permanent staff of 40 non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and drummers under the adjutant and the weapons were deposited at Edinburgh Castle.\nThe disembodied Scottish Militia regiments were reorganised under a new Militia Act in 1802, with the 10th Regiment split to form one unit centred on Edinburgh (the Edinburgh County Militia), while the other counties joined with Peeblesshire to form the 1st (or Berwickshire) North British Regiment of Militia, soon afterwards known as the Berwickshire, Haddington, Linlithgow and Peebles Militia (BHL&P Militia). The combined militia quota for the four counties was 448 men. The Earl of Home, as Lord Lieutenant of Berwickshire, was appointed colonel of the new regiment on 5 October 1802.\nNapoleonic Wars\nThe Peace of Amiens was short-lived and the reorganised Scottish Militia was\nembodied in 1803 when the quota for the four counties was raised to 674 men. During the Napoleonic Wars the militia were embodied for over a decade, and became regiments of full-time professional soldiers (though restricted to service in the British Isles), which the regul",

    "Genus of lichens\nPseudoleptogium is a fungal genus  in the family Collemataceae. It comprises the single species Pseudoleptogium diffractum, a saxicolous (rock-dwelling) crustose lichen that grows on calcareous rocks.\nTaxonomy\nThe genus was originally proposed by the Swiss lichenologist Johannes M\u00fcller Argoviensis in 1885 as a section of the genus Collema. The genus was resurrected and redescribed in 2014 as part of a molecular phylogenetics-informed reorganisation of the family Collemataceae, the jelly lichens.\nDescription\nThe thallus of Pseudoleptogium is made up of tiny to small squamules (scale-like structures) that range from 0.5 to 1.0\u00a0cm in diameter. These squamules create a patchy appearance, with two different types present. Along the edges, the squamules are tightly pressed to the surface, elongated like fingers, and range from 0.4 to 1.0\u00a0mm in length and 0.2 to 0.5\u00a0mm in width. In the centre of the thallus, the squamules are much smaller, resembling tiny, convex lumps (areoles) that are 0.1 to 0.3\u00a0mm across. Over time, the central squamules may wear away, leaving behind only the radiating marginal squamules.\nThe overall colour of the thallus is brownish-olive to black, and the surface of the squamules has a wrinkled and glossy texture, particularly at the tips. The thallus has a protective outer layer (cortex), but it lacks other common lichen structures like isidia (vegetative reproductive structures) or tomentum (a layer of fine hairs). The medulla has a paraplectenchymatous hyphal structure, in which the cyanobiont, Nostoc, occurs in clusters.\nApothecia, the structures that produce spores for sexual reproduction, are very rare in this genus. When present, they are located on the surface of the thallus (laminal) and have a convex, olive-brown disc. Each apothecium produces eight spores per ascus (the spore-producing cell), and the spores are ellipsoid in shape, with multiple internal divisions (muriform). The spores measure 22\u201325\u00a0\u03bcm in length and 8\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm in width.\nAsexual reproductive structures (pycnidia) are not known to occur in this genus.\n",
    "2024 single by Damiano David\n\"Silverlines\" is the debut solo single by Italian singer Damiano David. It was released on 27 September 2024, through Sony Music Italy and Arista Records, as the lead single from his upcoming debut studio album. David wrote the song along with Ferras Alqaisi, Sarah Hudson, and its producer Labrinth. A piano ballad ending with crescendos, it was marketed as a departure from his work with Italian rock band M\u00e5neskin, in order to express a more personal side of himself. A accompanying music video directed by the duo Nono + Rodrigo premiered alongside the song.\nBackground\nOn 10 November 2023, Italian rock band M\u00e5neskin released Rush! (Are U Coming?), the reissue to their third studio album, Rush!. In the following month, in an interview with The Allison Hagendorf Show, the band's frontman and lead vocalist Damiano David was asked about the possibility of starting his musical career as a solo artist; he replied, \"Why not? I think it could be a very healthy thing and a very destructive thing\". He added: \"I think that  comes a point where every artist should do his own thing\". David started working on his solo project while being on tour with the band promoting Rush!.\nIn September 2024, David started teasing his solo project on social media. The singer posted on Instagram a video of him entering a limousine, in which the driver asks him where he wants to go, and David answers \"Everywhere\", the same word that he used to caption the post. The video ends with the date \"Sept. 27\" flashing on the screen. At the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards red carpet, David said to the Associated Press: \"I've been working for a long, long time on a new project and September 27 is the date of release so I would love everyone to stay tuned\". He released a monologue to Spotify called \"My name is Damiano David\". \"Silverlines\" was announced via David's social media accounts on 18 September 2024, two days after teasing the participation of English singer and producer Labrinth on it. Pre-saves for the song were made available on the same date. Later, the production of Labrinth on the track was confirmed.\nComposition\nAmerican singer-songwriter Sarah Hudson was the first to work on \"Silverlines\"; she later connected Labrinth, David, and Ferras to shape the song. \"Silverlines\" was one of the first songs composed for David's debut studio album. It was labeled as a departure from David's work with M\u00e5neskin, expressing a more personal side of himself. He explained that the reason why he had not yet shared this side of him in the band was because he wanted to respect the band's strong identity. When asked by NME, he stated that he chose \"Silverlines\" to start his solo musical career because it is \"pretty unique compared to other songs on the record\".\nIt is a ballad led by a piano arrangement. The song ends with a series of crescendos, containing drums and choirs. It was described by NME's Andrew Trendell as bold and theatrical. Gabriel C\u00e1rcoba for Jenesaispop compared its effect to Harry Styles's \"Sign of the Times\", released in 2017. About the lyrics of the song, David explained: \"It's quite literal, it's about the rays of hope, about finding the positive side of things and finding what really makes us who we are\". In an interview with the Spanish edition of Rolling Stone, the singer explained that he wanted to show a more \"human and vulnerable\" part of himself. He also expressed his admiration for Labrinth and that it was \"a big dream\" to work with him.\nMusic video\nThe music video for \"Silverlines\" was directed by the duo Nono + Rodrigo. It depicts David exploring picturesque places. The video ends with David entering a limousine, in which the driver asks him where he wants to go, answering \"Everywhere\"; this part was previously used for the pre-release promotion of the track.\nLive performances\nOn 6 October 2024, David performed \"Silverlines\" for the first time in a televised performance on Che tempo che fa.\nCharts\n",

    "Legal activism\nThe 65 Project is a legal activism campaign seeking to \"disbar and discredit\" Trump-affiliated lawyers who worked on lawsuits supporting Trump's baseless attempt to overturn the 2020 election. It has been described as a \"dark money group.\"\nThe 65 Project's Managing Director is Michael Teter, an attorney suing Fox News as counsel for Ray Epps. The project was also devised by Democratic political consultant Melissa Moss, a former senior Clinton administration official, and operates through a not-for-profit named \"Law Works.\"\nMethods\nIn line with the group's mission, the 65 Project files ethics complaints with bar associations, some of which have been dismissed for lack of evidence. These complaints have included high-profile figures, such as Ted Cruz, John Eastman and Cleta Mitchell. The 65 Project has also stated its interest in changing lawyers's professional rules, including placing limits on lawyers's public statements about elections.\nThe group stated in early 2022 it planned to take action against 111 attorneys. \nAs of July 2023, all but one of the 65 Project's concluded complaints had been dismissed or found no punishable offense. In 2022, attorneys pursued by the group said they had received additional attempts after previous complaints were unsuccessful.\nThe group is advised by David Brock, who described the idea of the 65 Project as bringing attorney bar complaints, and to \"shame them and make them toxic in their communities and in their firms\". In the same 2022 interview with Axios, Brock said the project would target the livelihood and reputations of the attorneys.\nReactions\nConcerns over the methods of The 65 Project have been raised since at least March 2022. Bruce Green, the director of Fordham Law School's  Louis Stein Center for Law and Ethics, emphasized that the 65 Project's complaints were \"designed to embarrass\" lawyers, discouraging political work \"even if they're playing by the rules.\" CNN noted that the investigations sought by the 65 Project \"unfold in secret\" until claims are found meritorious in most states, but that, as Green raised concerns about, the 65 Projects \"heavily publicized allegations\" would harm lawyers reputations before claims were reviewed. Complaints filed by The 65 Project have been dismissed since the groups first public announcements, beginning with Georgia attorney Brad Carver, but has continued publish adversarial media targeting lawyers's professional communities, planning to run advertisements in law journals in late fall 2024.\nAlan Dershowitz, whose sanctions for \"frivolous\" election litigation followed complaints by Marc Elias's firm, compared the results of its work as similar to the \"ridicule\" faced by suspected communists during McCarthyism and Texas Congressman Lance Gooden described the 65 Project as \"a far-left activist group of lawyers actively engaging in partisan tactics.\" The 65 Project describes itself as \"bipartisan,\" and \"defending democracy and the rule of law.\" The 65 Project elicited criticism from ethics complaint respondent Cleta Mitchell for not also pursuing attorney Marc Elias who had challenged the Iowa election results of Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks previously.\n",
    "\nRuel P. Tolman (also known as Ruel Pardee Tolman, R. P. Tolman; Mar 26, 1878 \u2014 Aug 24, 1954) was an American painter, photographer, printmaker, and curator. He was best known for his work The Life and Work of Edward Greene Malbone, his etchings, and his Impressionist landscapes.\nEarly life and education\nOn March 26, 1878, Ruel P. Tolman was born in Brookfield, Vermont. From 1897 and 1902, Tolman studied at Mark Hopkins Institute of Art (now named San Francisco Art Institute), Pomona College Prep School, and University of California, Berkeley. After he graduated from Berkeley, Tolman moved to Washington, D.C. to continue his studies at Corcoran School of the Arts and Design. In 1906, Tolman pursued further education at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League while he began teaching at Corcoran, where he was later appointed assistant instructor at Corcoran.\nCareer\nArtist\nRuel P. Tolman worked both as an artist and a photographer. During his artistic career, Tolman mainly created paintings and etchings. His artistic style was influenced by contemporary movements in the United States, mainly American Realism and Impressionism. The influence of American Realism can be identified in Tolman's etchings and photographic works. The subjects of these works are mainly the cityscape and the people that live within it, including staff and faculty when he was working at the National Gallery of Art (see Trolley Line on Wisconsin Avenue and Clagett the Cabinet Maker). They particularly focus on depicting the realities of everyday life in metropolitans, resonating with the American Realist notion that all social lives are worthy of depiction.\nThe Matanza, 1912, https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.183610.html\nMan in Uniform Named Clark, c. 1930s, https://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_sic_13216\nMeanwhile, Tolman's paintings are distinctly Impressionist. His paintings mainly depict natural landscapes in swift brushstrokes, reflecting the Impressionist interest in the transient effect of color and light (see Untitled). His works often exhibit a similar sensitivity to light, capturing fleeting moments and the vibrancy of everyday scenes. This approach not only aligns with the impressionist ethos but also serves to elevate the mundane aspects of life into subjects worthy of artistic exploration. Moreover, his works reflect an emphasis on personal and immediate experiences, influenced by a shift from Romanticism to Realism and Impressionism.\nTrees and Reflection, n.d., https://americanart.si.edu/artwork/trees-and-reflection-24179\nComing Storm, n.d., https://americanart.si.edu/artwork/coming-storm-24180\nIn addition, his artistic career was potentially influenced by the art market during his time. The rise of impressionism was closely tied to the commercialization of art, a change that became closely tied to artistic creativity and agency have been impacted. His works appealed to both the aesthetic sensibilities of the impressionist movement and the social consciousness of realism, indicating a possible influence by the context of the early 20th century.\nCurator and director\nTolman also worked as curator and director, working with other artists' works. Tolman was appointed Assistant curator in the Graphic Arts Division at the National Gallery in 1920 and later promoted to Curator in 1932.\nRuel P. Tolman Examining Artwork\nTolman's career as curator reflects a deep understanding of the evolving role of curators in contemporary art, where they serve not only as caretakers of artworks but also as critical interpreters and facilitators of artistic dialogue. This shift in the curator's role is indicative of a broader \"curatorial turn\" in society, where curation has become integral to various fields, including art, media, and science. Tolman's approach aligns with the notion that curators are essential in shaping the narrative and context of exhibitions, thus influencing public perception and engagement with art.\n",
    "\nBetween November 1 and 17, 2019, French and G5 Sahel troops conducted an operation against the jihadist groups of Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin, Ansarul Islam, and the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara in Boulikessi, D\u00e9ou, and Boula along the Malian and Burkinabe borders.\nBackground\nThe northern border between Mali and Burkina Faso has been the epicenter of a jihadist insurgency launched by the Mali-based Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin, the homegrown Burkinabe Ansarul Islam, and the Niger-based Islamic State in the Greater Sahara since 2015. French and G5 Sahel forces organized for the operation on November 1, mobilizing 1,400 soldiers; 600 French and 800 from the Burkinabe, Malian, and Nigerien contingents of the G5. The French forces included two Acier battalions, soldiers from the 16th Foothunters Battalion, a subgroup of tactical group Walsh, and logistics support from the Marne and Salamandre subgroups. Burkinabe forces assessed that around 500 jihadists were based in the Tofagala forest.\nOperation\nThe operation began at 2:30 am on November 1, when a convoy of 450 French soldiers and 52 vehicles commanded by Thibaut Lemerle left Gao, Mali. The convoy headed southeast, traveling 380 kilometers in 18 hours to reach Niamey, Niger. The column then headed west into Burkinabe territory, reaching Dori on November 2. On November 4, five gendarmes and six civilians were killed in a jihadist attack in Oursi. The French and G5 soldiers entered Oursi several hours later, discovering the bodies of the victims lined up against a tree on the outskirts of the town. The convoy then reached Deou on November 5.\nBetween November 7 and 12, allied soldiers conducted reconnaissance operations in the Tofagala forest, checking several dozen camps on the outskirts of the forest. Most of the camps were empty, and the men they did find were searched and let go due to lack of evidence connecting them to the jihadist groups. The allied forces didn't venture far into the forest itself due to the thickness of the vegetation.\nOn the night between November 7 and 8, the allied forces were attacked by jihadists on the edge of the forest. The jihadists initially approached to several hundred meters away from the camp, but were spotted at 6:45 pm. French forces fired warning shots and illuminating shells. The fighters retreated, but returned to the camp later in the night, and French forces yet again fired warning shots and illuminating shells. At 1:30 am, the jihadists brought thirty pick-ups to the edge of the forest in preparation for an assault on the camp. The third time, French and Burkinabe forces shot at the jihadists with machine guns and mortars, forcing the jihadists to retreat. The following day, no bodies or destroyed vehicles were found by allied troops at the scene of the battle.\nSearch operations continued following the clash, and Burkinabe soldiers switched to motorcycles to get around. While the motorcycles made them more vulnerable, it allowed the soldiers to move more easily. In Mali, French and Malian troops reinforced the Boulikessi outpost which had been attacked by jihadists a month prior. The Franco-Malian forces then searched the forests around Boulikessi, destroying sixty motorcycles and cell phone communications. The final battle took place on November 17, the end of the operation, when French, Malian, and Burkinabe soldiers cornered a group of jihadists in a forest.\nAftermath\nThe French General Staff announced on November 18 that 24 jihadists were killed or taken prisoner during the operation, along with the telephones and motorcycles. The G5 Sahel then stated that 25 jihadists were killed or captured. Two Burkinabe soldiers were killed during the operation by an IED on November 5.\n",
    "German ironclad gunboat\nFor other ships with the same name, see SMS Basilisk.\nSMS Basilisk was an ironclad gunboat of the Wespe class built for the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) in the 1870s. The ships, which were armed with a single 30.5\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) MRK L/22 gun, were intended to serve as part of a coastal defense fleet.\nDesign\nMain article: Wespe-class gunboat\nPlan and profile of the Wespe class in their original configuration\nDevelopment of the Wespe class of ironclad gunboats began in the 1850s, after the first ironclads were introduced during the Crimean War. Through the 1860s, the Federal Convention examined various proposals, which included plans to build at least eight vessels, to as many as eighteen armored warships. The decision was finalized based on the fleet plan conceived by General Albrecht von Stosch, the new Chief of the Kaiserliche Admiralit\u00e4t (Imperial Admiralty), in the early 1870s. He envisioned a fleet oriented on defense of Germany's Baltic and North Sea coasts, which would be led by the ironclad corvettes of the Sachsen class. These were to be supported by larger numbers of small, armored gunboats, which became the Wespe class.\nBasilisk was 46.4 meters (152\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) long overall, with a beam of 10.6\u00a0m (34\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in) and a draft of 3.2 to 3.4\u00a0m (10 to 11\u00a0ft). She displaced 1,098 metric tons (1,081 long tons) as designed and 1,163\u00a0t (1,145 long tons) at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 3\u00a0officers and 73 to 85\u00a0enlisted men. She was powered by a pair of double-expansion steam engines that drove a pair of 4-bladed screw propellers, with steam provided by four coal-fired cylindrical fire-tube boilers, which gave her a top speed of 11 knots (20\u00a0km/h; 13\u00a0mph) at 800 metric horsepower (790\u00a0ihp). At a cruising speed of 7 knots (13\u00a0km/h; 8.1\u00a0mph), she could steam for 700 nautical miles (1,300\u00a0km; 810\u00a0mi).\nThe ship was armed with one 30.5\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) MRK L/22 gun in a barbette mount that had a limited arc of traverse. In practice, the gun was aimed by turning the ship in the direction of fire. The Wespes were intended to beach themselves on the sandbars along the German coastline to serve as semi-mobile coastal artillery batteries. The armored barbette was protected by 203\u00a0mm (8\u00a0in) of wrought iron, backed with 210\u00a0mm (8.3\u00a0in) of teak. The ship was fitted with a waterline armor belt that was 102 to 203\u00a0mm (4 to 8\u00a0in) thick, with the thickest section protecting the propulsion machinery spaces and ammunition magazine. The belt was backed with 210\u00a0mm of teak. An armor deck that consisted of two layers of 22\u00a0mm (0.87\u00a0in) of iron on 28\u00a0mm (1.1\u00a0in) of teak provided additional protection against enemy fire.\nService history\nProfile drawing of the Wespe class as they appeared c. 1900\nThe keel for Basilisk was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in September 1877, and she was launched on 14 September 1878. She was named after the earlier Basilisk, a steam gunboat from the 1860s. Work on the ship was completed nearly two years later, and she was commissioned into active service on 20 August 1880. She conducted her initial sea trials under the command of Leutnant zur See (Lieutenant at Sea) Emil Freiherr von Lyncker; this round of testing continued until 17 September, when she was temporarily decommissioned. She was reactivated just ten days later, again under Lyncker's command to participate in training exercises. She was decommissioned again for the winter months on 20 November.\nBasilisk was present (but not commissioned) for a fleet review held on 16 August 1881 held for Kaiser Wilhelm I. She was recommissioned again on 20 August for another period of training with other elements of the fleet. These maneuvers lasted until 18 September, when she was decommissioned again. By 1883, the ship had been refitted with an additional 8.7\u00a0cm (3.4\u00a0in) L/24 built-up guns, a pair of 37\u00a0mm (1.5\u00a0in) Hotchkiss revolver cannon, and two 35\u00a0cm (14\u00a0in) torpedo tubes in her bow, both of which were below the waterline.\nThe ship saw no further active service, however, and remained in the reserve fleet for more than twenty years. Basilisk was struck from the naval register on 27 September 1910. The navy used the ship for hull leakage tests, and in 1919, sold Basilisk for scrap. She was broken up the following year in Hamburg.\nNotes\n",

A tie-in to the Friday the 13th series of American horror films, it is the second in a series of five Jason X novels published by Black Flame and acts as a sequel to the 2001 film Jason X and its 2005 novelization, which was also written by Pat Cadigan and published by Black Flame.\nPlot\nUndead cyborg Jason Voorhees, sent hurtling towards Earth II after killing almost everyone aboard the spaceship Grendel, crash lands in Veronica Lake. The nanites in Jason's system reconstruct Jason's decimated body, energized by radiation produced by Three Mile Island, a nearby nuclear power plant being visited by Lynne Bowes, a graduate student and reporter for the Ramsey County Star. Jason goes on a rampage at the plant, butchering dozens of its staff as well as protesting environmental activists before being left stunned when his nanites are overloaded with excess energy channeled into them by the remaining personnel of Three Mile Island. The government covers up the attack on the plant and takes the survivors and the inert Jason into custody, but Lynn escapes with help from a sympathetic guard, Lieutenant Rena Sofira. The survivors, who are kept in drug-induced comas, and Jason are brought to a secret underground military complex run by Doctor Hyacinth Stein, an unethical scientist who believes she can reverse-engineer Jason's regenerative powers and nanite-enhanced physiology to produce super soldiers; the facility is infiltrated by Lynne, who has gone undercover as an intern brought in to replace one who was secretly murdered by Stein.\nJason's paralysis is maintained via constant electrocution as he is studied by Stein, whose disgruntled staff thwart her attempt to use the survivors of Three Mile Island as test subjects for her experiments with Jason. A guard and three interns, at the behest of one of Stein's suspicious subordinates, break into Stein's laboratory to acquire a sample of Jason's DNA. Jason kills the guard after being briefly unfrozen by Stein, while the interns are vivisected by Stein. After Stein tries and fails to graft the victims' tissue to Jason, a swarm of Jason's nanites, having overcome their paralysis, move from Jason's body to the corpses of the interns, which they reconstruct into a lesser copy of Jason. A recovered Jason and his doppelganger attack Stein, who pushes a panic button, signaling the military to \"sterilize\" the facility before she is murdered by the Jasons. The rest of the complex's staff, made aware of Stein's crimes and Jason's destructive capabilities through Stein's hacked files and information provided by Lynne, resuscitate everyone taken from Three Mile Island, including Sofira.\nThe second Jason, possessed by Stein's mind after assimilating her body, kills and devours people, while Doctor Omar Wing, a scientist whose bloodstream was contaminated by Jason's cells and nanites, morphs into a third Jason. Wing, his consciousness dwindling, forces Jason into a waste disposal rocket launched by Sofira and Master-Sergeant Black Carol before he, the Stein creature, and Corporal Daniel V. Numinen, a guard who was also infected by Jason's cells and nanites, are taken into military custody along with Sofira and Carol. Lynne and a few others who escaped Stein's facility, now fugitives wanted by the authorities, go on the run as Jason drifts through space, his presence noticed by a nigh-omnipotent alien intelligence known as the Most Ancient.\nPublication\nAuthor Pat Cadigan has stated she \"had a great time\" writing her two Jason X novels; one of the ways she met Black Flame's required number of words was by coming up with \"an explanation as to why Jason Voorhees was always killing people for having sex.\" In response to potential criticism over having authored Jason X novels and other media tie-ins, Cadigan declared, \"When people are done going to the gallery, and they've finished all the required reading, they've studied up on everything, they take their cues from popular culture.\" Cadigan further commented, \"They're fun and they remind me what I like about writing. And they reinforce lessons to me about narrative momentum and narrative structure. There are things that have to be different on the page rather than on the screen.\"\nReception\nDon D'Ammassa, in a review written for Science Fiction Chronicle, had a middling response to the novel, writing, \"Cadigan manages to provide an exciting story, mostly by avoiding the clich\u00e9s of the film, but her original work is obviously much better than this.\" Rod Lott of Bookgasm included The Experiment in his 2005 article \"9 Recent Books I Just Couldn't Bring Myself to Finish, No Matter How Hard I Tried.\" William Hutson, co-founder of the band Clipping and a fan of Cadigan, has commented positively on her two Jason X novels, stating, \"They are really silly and feel very tossed off, but it's kind of amazing.

    "\nThe A\u00e9roclub F\u00e9minin la Stella was founded on 10 February 1909 in Paris by Marie Surcouf, a French aeronaut and campaigner for women's rights. Known as La Stella, the organisation's membership included many of the women balloonists who had previously been members of the Comit\u00e9 des Dames of l'A\u00e9ronautique-Club de France (ACDF). La Stella was founded as a result of a long struggle by French women to be recognised as competent professionals and accomplished sportswomen in the field of flying, initially in balloons. The club offered restricted access to men, who could be members, but not decision-makers. They were allowed to accompany their wives on flights, but only as passengers.\nBackground\nFrench women were involved in balloon flights from very early in the development of the sport. The Marchioness and Countess of Montalembert, the Countess of Podenas and Miss de Lagarde ascended in a tethered balloon in Paris on 20 May 1784. On 4 June 1784, opera singer \u00c9lisabeth Thible made an ascent in an untethered balloon, dressed as Minerva, the Roman goddess, and sang two duets from Monsigny's La Belle Ars\u00e8ne with Mr. Fleurant to entertain Gustav III of Sweden during his visit to Lyon.\nIn 1798, after the French Revolution, Citoyenne Henri made an ascent with Andr\u00e9-Jacques Garnerin, after the dismissal of claims that female internal organs were not strong enough to survive such an experiment unscathed, and that a mixed crew was immoral. Sophie Blanchard was the first woman to pilot her own balloon and undertake ballooning as a career, making her first ascent in a balloon with her husband on 27 December 1804 and eventually dying in a ballooning accident in 1819.\nBy the start of the French Third Republic, (1870 - 1940) ballooning was seen as a sporting, scientific or military activity, rather than a spectacle for the entertainment of crowds. Women were therefore generally excluded from taking part in the sport, although some did manage to participate in events and public demonstrations, such as the actress L\u00e9a d'Asco in 1887 and the sportswoman Camille du Gast in 1895, although she used her maiden name to avoid social awkwardness.\nThe A\u00e9roclub de France, founded in 1898, was no different in their attitude to women flying in balloons, but did launch a Challenge des Femmes A\u00e9ronautes (Women Aeronauts' Challenge) in 1902, a distance event in which women were only permitted to be passengers for male pilots. These female passengers were wealthy members of high society. The competition was repeated in 1903 under the same conditions.\nIn January 1906, the A\u00e9ronautique Club de France (ACDF), founded in October 1897, instituted a women's section after much debate. The Comit\u00e9 des Dames was chaired by Madame Marie Surcouf.\nClub member Mrs \u00c9mile Carton, wife of Jules \u00c9mile Carton, who ballooned in the 1901 Olympics, made her first solo ascent on 6 May 1906. Marie Surcouf, who qualified as a pilot on 28 July 1906, made her first flight as a pilot on 23 August of the same year aboard the \u2018Bengali\u2019 balloon, accompanied by Miss Gache, the committee's secretary. This balloon flight, the first by a female crew, took the two women from the Parc des Coteaux de Saint-Cloud to Neuilly sur Marne in 2 hours 45 minutes.\nFollowing a dispute with the ACDF Executive Committee, Marie Surcouf resigned as President of the Comit\u00e9 des Dames on 6 April 1908, taking most of the committee's female members with her.\nMeanwhile, a new society, the Club Fran\u00e7ais des Touristes A\u00e9riens, was founded on 18 September 1908. This society had its own Ladies' Committee, called the F\u00e9mina Club A\u00e9ronautique, with Madame Allier as president and Madame Colin as secretary. From 20 September 1908, the head office of this women's club was located at 149 rue Saint-Honor\u00e9. However, this women's club seems to have been short-lived.\nCreation of the A\u00e9roclub F\u00e9minin la Stella and the rise of women's ballooning\nMarie Surcouf founded the A\u00e9roclub F\u00e9minin la Stella known colloquially as La Stella on 10 February 1909 and took on the role of President.\nThe members of La Stella's Board of Directors included Madame Alice Bl\u00e9riot, Madame Max-Vincent and former members of the Comit\u00e9 des Dames de l'A\u00e9ronautique-Club de France, Madame Airault, Madame Albufeda and Madame Desfoss\u00e9-Dalloz. On 15 April 1909, La Stella became a member of the A\u00e9ro-Club de France, the organisation which set many of the regulations that controlled aviation in France.\nThe head office of La Stella was initially located at Marie Surcouf's home, 92 bis boulevard Pereire in Paris, before moving successively to 25 rue de Marignan and 86 boulevard Flandrin. From March 1916, the head office was at 6 rue de l'Amiral-Courbet, in the private mansion provided by Mr and Mrs Richefeu, then at 5 rue Chernoviz in 1920, Surcouf's address after her 1916 divorce from Edouard Surcouf.\nMen were admitted as members of La Stella but were not allowed any decision-making powers; they could accompany their wives as passengers but not pilot t",

    "Upcoming film by H. Vinoth\nThalapathy 69 is the tentative working title for an upcoming Indian Tamil-language political action film directed by H.

In August, Vinoth confirmed his presence in the film, followed by KVN confirming the project in September. Principal photography commenced the following month in Payyanur.

Vinoth.\nOn 2 February 2024, Vijay announced through his social media accounts that he would be stepping into the politics arena after completing his current projects, The Greatest of All Time (2024) and an upcoming film, which was tentatively titled Thalapathy 69. The Times of India reported that the project would be directed by Karthik Subbaraj and produced by Sun Pictures, while Pinkvilla reported the director was not finalised with front-runners as H. Vinoth, Subbaraj or Atlee. However, Vetrimaaran was instead reported to be in talks. The project would also be reportedly funded by D. V. V. Danayya's DVV Entertainment, in their maiden Tamil-language film. In mid March, though, Vetrimaaran confirmed that he will not be directing the project, which led to Trivikram and Vinoth being the front-runners, followed by reports that the latter helming it becoming stronger.\nVinoth had initially narrated a script to Vijay, at the same time when the latter was working on Mersal (2017). The actor, however, declined the script and worked on Bigil (2019). Vinoth reportedly narrated the same script to Kamal Haasan which impressed the actor. Haasan finalised him as the director for his 233rd film in the lead; however, the project was shelved due to production delays of Indian 2. The director had then met Vijay again and narrated the same script to him.

The director said that the film would be completely made in Vijay's style, unlike his previous film's which he had considered as political films. However, the poster announcement of the film, which featured the tagline \"torch bearer of democracy arriving soon\", made some media question the film's genre.

Birch died at Thorseby on 23 February 1927 and her funeral took place at Old St Paul's in Wellington.\nOn 9 March 1881 Birch climbed Mount Ruapehu with her husband and George Beetham, becoming the first European woman to do so. She penned a letter to the Hawkes Bay Herald in 1886 regarding her observations of steam and clouds around Ruapehu.\nIn 1922 Birch donated watercolours by her mother Lydia Larden to the Sarjeant Gallery.\nSee also\nCaccia Birch House",
    "\nA child sexual abuse scandal involving Global Ikhwan Sdn. Bhd.\nOperation Global (Op Global; Malay: Operasi Global) was an operation conducted on 11 September 2024 by the Royal Malaysia Police. The operation investigated cases of child neglect and child sexual abuse in children's homes associated with Global Ikhwan Services and Business (GISB Holdings Sdn Bhd).\nBackground\nGISB Holdings Sdn Bhd (GISB) is a conglomerate reportedly holding assets valued at RM325 million, with business operations spanning 20 countries. The company was founded in 1997 by the remaining followers of Ashaari Muhammad, who also established al-Arqam in 1968. It was formed three years after the Malaysian government banned al-Arqam in 1994 over concerns regarding its teachings. Initially operating as Rufaqa' Corporation, the company changed its name to Global Ikhwan following the ban on Rufaqa', and adopted its current name, GISB in 2010. According to the company's chief executive officer, the group was cleared of any legal wrongdoing by the police special branch.\nGISB claims to employ 3,658 youth and 1,698 adults across its various businesses. However, it has faced allegations of using child labour by having minors sell goods through its business network, a claim the company denies.\nTimeline\nRaid on children's homes\nOn 11 September 2024, a police report triggered a Royal Malaysia Police raid on 20 children's homes associated with GISB around Selangor and Negeri Sembilan. The initial toll of children rescued was 402, in which was 201 boys and 201 girls aged between one and 17 years old, in addition 171 suspects including teachers and wardens were remanded. The children were believed to be offspring of GISB members currently outstation at GISB foreign premises. Some of the 402 children were sodomised and taught to sexually assault their peers according to the Inspector General of Police (IGP). Health screenings of the 384 rescued children reveal that they endured physical injuries and sexual abuse and 13 of them have been sodomised. All of the rescued children were bought to PULAPOL for documentation, out of 402 children, 10 were disabled and autistic and were handed over to Department of Social Welfare.\nAccording to the police, since 2011 until September 2024, they had received 41 police reports against GISB, they also addressed allegations that the police reacted late on the information stating that the police were compiling information. The IGP also said 159 individuals out of the 171 suspects detained during the operation were remanded while the rest are minors and no need to be investigated. On 17 September 2024, the police later froze 96 bank accounts held by GISB with a total of RM581,552 under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 (AMLA).\nGISB's response\nFirst press release\nThe day after the police raid, GISB ran a damage control campaign and uploaded a press release in Facebook strongly denying cases of sodomy in the children's homes. The company's chief coordination officer, Adib Attamimi also uploaded a video on Facebook stating 'It is astonishing that we would neglect them. We must consider how strong they are in facing these challenges.'\nSecond press release\nGISB later on changed their stance and made a press release with its chief executive officer, Nasiruddin Mohd Ali acknowledging there were sodomy cases in between the children while denying accusations of human trafficking.\n'Yes, there were one or two cases of sodomy among the children but why generalise all the other innocent children and accuse us of human trafficking?''I did not speak up earlier for fear of aggravating the situation. Our lawyers will start the legal process tomorrow.'\nArrests\nBorder arrest\nOn 18 September 2024, two motorhomes with GISB logos displayed on it were seen at Bukit Kayu Hitam ICQS Complex heading towards Thailand. According to the Immigration Department of Malaysia (JIM), the vehicles were there to renew their expiring International Circulation Permits. Upon being alerted by JIM about the vehicles' exit from the ICQS complex, Kedah Criminal Investigation Department stopped the vehicles and inspected it before seizing it and detaining the five drivers and passengers, among the detained were believed to be the son of a GISB leader.\nArrest of GISB leadership and members\nOn 19 September 2024, the firm's chief executive officer (CEO), his wife and two children were among the 19 GISB executives that were remanded, this comes after his press release acknowledging cases of sodomy in the children's homes. On 20 September 2024, seven members of GISB's Remaja Pembela Ummah was arrested to assist with an investigation into human trafficking. Those arrested include the sons of Ashaari Muhammad and GISB's CEO.\nRe-arrest of GISB members under SOSMA\nOn 25 September 2024, 34 members of GISB were re-arrested after their remand period ended under Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 (SOSMA) ",

    "Personality psychometric\nThe MACH-IV is a 20 question Likert scale psychometric designed to test levels of Machiavellianism in individuals. In personality psychology, Machiavellianism refers to a personality construct which comprises manipulativeness, deceitfulness, and a callous, calculating orientation. It is the most widely used Machiavellianism test by researchers.\nBackground\nMain article: Machiavellianism (psychology)\nSocial psychologist Richard Christie was interested in the motivations and underlying personality traits of manipulators. He proposed that they had certain characteristics that made them more willing to take advantage of others, such as having a lack of affect and empathy in interpersonal dealings, and a lack of concern for morality. He viewed Machiavelli as a source to gain ideas from and eventually wrote test items that were loosely based on what he wrote. He and his research partner Florence Geis published their results in the book \"Studies in Machiavellianism\" in 1970.\nFactors\nThe MACH-IV has 20 questions, all which are designed to tap into the following factors: \"Views\", \"Tactics\", and \"Morality\". The \"Views\" factor is related to beliefs that are self interested and cynical, the \"Tactics\" factor focuses on the endorsement of manipulation as a means to take advantage of others, and the \"Morality\" factor deals with one's adherence to moral scruple.\nItems\nItems featured on the test include questions such as \"most people who get ahead in the world lead clean, moral lives\" and \"P.T. Barnum was wrong when he said that there's a sucker born every minute\".\nHigh vs low scorers\nThose who score high are classified as High Machs, while those who score low are classified as Low Machs. High scorers were more likely to win experimental games by deceiving the other person, while low Machs tried playing by the rules of the experiment. Overall, High Machs are more likely to be manipulative, exploitatve, and callous, while Low Machs are the opposite-viewing others in more of an empathetic viewpoint. Research has consistently shown that men score higher than women in Machiavellianism.\nKiddie Mach\nThe Kiddie Mach is a variant of the MACH test, but for children. The test features questions simple enough for a child to understand,  such as \"the best way to get along with people is to tell them things that make them happy\". The Kiddie Mach features 20 questions, similar to the regular MACH-IV.  High scores on the Kiddie Mach were negatively correlated with the Basic Empathy Scale. Children who score high on the Kiddie Mach also score low on other empathy scales. Studies have reported internal consistency reliability coefficients ranging from 0.70 to 0.76 for the Mach IV scale.  The Kiddie Mach Scale, however, demonstrated lower internal reliability, with coefficients between 0.60 and 0.70.  Via studies on Machiavellianism in children, it was found that the trait is influenced by both genetics and the environment (especially the shared environment).\nValidity and criticism\nThere have been questions raised as to the validity of the MACH-IV. Because of this MACH-IV has been the subject of criticism by researchers over the years. One such criticism is that the test does not measure anything different from narcissism and psychopathy. John McHoskey even stated that the MACH-IV could be used to evaluate psychopathy in a non-criminal population. It has also come under criticism for simply being outdated. For example,\nDaniel Jones has stated that the scale, while it is commendable in many ways, is \"not helping the field with precision\". He ultimately states that it  \"should be replaced by assessments that are more precise reflections of the construct.\"John Rauthmann and others have stated that, while the MACH-IV is \"a generally reliable and valid scale\", it has its shortcomings. These include the response styles of the test takers, the varying factor structures, the scale merely being a measure of cynicism only and \"insufficient content and construct validity\". The researchers developed their own scale instead to study Machiavellianism multidimensionally instead of unidimensionally to prevent the construct from becoming hard to study effectively. Psychologist Jason Dahling and others have created another measure of Machiavellianism, dubbed the Machiavellian Personality Scale (or MPS for short). Scholars point out that while the construct is named after Machiavelli, the scale is not related to him outside of bearing his name, and that his political ideas are irrelevant.\nSee also\nDark Triad Dirty Dozen\nMachiavellianism in the workplace\nPsychopathic Personality Inventory\nNarcissistic Personality Inventory\nLight triad",

    "German ironclad gunboat\nNot to be confused with the earlier steam gunboat SMS Cam\u00e4leon.\nSMS Camaeleon was an ironclad gunboat of the Wespe class built for the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) in the 1870s. The ships, which were armed with a single 30.5\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) MRK L/22 gun, were intended to serve as part of a coastal defense fleet.\nDesign\nMain article: Wespe-class gunboat\nPlan and profile of the Wespe class in their original configuration\nDevelopment of the Wespe class of ironclad gunboats began in the 1850s, after the first ironclads were introduced during the Crimean War. Through the 1860s, the Federal Convention examined various proposals, which included plans to build at least eight vessels, to as many as eighteen armored warships. The decision was finalized based on the fleet plan conceived by General Albrecht von Stosch, the new Chief of the Kaiserliche Admiralit\u00e4t (Imperial Admiralty), in the early 1870s. He envisioned a fleet oriented on defense of Germany's Baltic and North Sea coasts, which would be led by the ironclad corvettes of the Sachsen class. These were to be supported by larger numbers of small, armored gunboats, which became the Wespe class.\nCamaeleon was 46.4 meters (152\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) long overall, with a beam of 10.6\u00a0m (34\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in) and a draft of 3.2 to 3.4\u00a0m (10 to 11\u00a0ft). She displaced 1,098 metric tons (1,081 long tons) as designed and 1,163\u00a0t (1,145 long tons) at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 3\u00a0officers and 73 to 85\u00a0enlisted men. She was powered by a pair of double-expansion steam engines that drove a pair of 4-bladed screw propellers, with steam provided by four coal-fired cylindrical fire-tube boilers, which gave her a top speed of 11.2 knots (20.7\u00a0km/h; 12.9\u00a0mph) at 800 metric horsepower (790\u00a0ihp). At a cruising speed of 7 knots (13\u00a0km/h; 8.1\u00a0mph), she could steam for 700 nautical miles (1,300\u00a0km; 810\u00a0mi).\nThe ship was armed with one 30.5\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) MRK L/22 gun in a barbette mount that had a limited arc of traverse. In practice, the gun was aimed by turning the ship in the direction of fire. The Wespes were intended to beach themselves on the sandbars along the German coastline to serve as semi-mobile coastal artillery batteries. The armored barbette was protected by 203\u00a0mm (8\u00a0in) of wrought iron, backed with 210\u00a0mm (8.3\u00a0in) of teak. The ship was fitted with a waterline armor belt that was 102 to 203\u00a0mm (4 to 8\u00a0in) thick, with the thickest section protecting the propulsion machinery spaces and ammunition magazine. The belt was backed with 210\u00a0mm of teak. An armor deck that consisted of two layers of 22\u00a0mm (0.87\u00a0in) of iron on 28\u00a0mm (1.1\u00a0in) of teak provided additional protection against enemy fire.\nService history\nProfile drawing of the Wespe class as they appeared c. 1900\nCamaeleon was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in 1878, and she was launched on 21 December that year. Alexander Georg Mosle, the director of the shipyard and also a member of the Reichstag (Imperial Diet), gave a speech during the launching ceremony. The ship was named after the earlier steam gunboat Cam\u00e4leon, built in the early 1860s. Work on the ship was completed the following year, and she was commissioned on 10 November 1879. She remained out of active service, however, and was first activated on 20 August 1880 for sea trials in company with her sister ship Basilisk. After trials were completed, the navy decided to station Camaleon in the Baltic Sea, and so on 8 September, she left to sail around Denmark. While on the way, she encountered severe storms that forced her to shelter in Kalundborg, Denmark. After arriving in Kiel, she was decommissioned at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) there and placed in reserve.\nThe ship next returned to service on 19 September 1881 for training exercises. These were concluded by 15 October, when Camaeleon was decommissioned again. By 1883, the ship had been refitted with an additional 8.7\u00a0cm (3.4\u00a0in) L/24 built-up guns, a pair of 37\u00a0mm (1.5\u00a0in) Hotchkiss revolver cannon, and two 35\u00a0cm (14\u00a0in) torpedo tubes in her bow, both of which were below the waterline. The ship next commissioned on 22 April 1884 for training exercises with the newly created Armored Gunboat Flotilla, which was led by the aviso Grille. After the end of exercises in late August, Camaeleon steamed to Wilhelmshaven for periodic maintenance. She was decommissioned there on 4 September for the work, and she was assigned to the Marinestation der Nordsee (North Sea Naval Station) at that time.\nCamaeleon was recommissioned again on 11 May 1886 for another stint in the Armored Gunboat Flotilla, which was led that year by her sister M\u00fccke. The unit also participated in the main fleet maneuvers that year, and Camaeleon was decommissioned again on 9 June. The ship's next period of active service lasted from 16 August to 14 September 1887, and again, Camaeleon took part in the fleet maneuvers. The year 1888 passed similarly, with the only period of active training beginning ",
    "Norwegian suffragist and writer (1866\u20131937)\nJenova Martin (1866 \u2013 March 5, 1937) was a Norwegian-born American suffragist and writer. She was one of the founders of the Scandinavian Voting Association and from 1907 to 1913, she was the first president of the Scandinavian Woman Suffrage Association (SWSA), which fought for universal suffrage in the United States.\nEarly and personal life\nNot much is known about Jenova Martin's early life. It is known that she was born in Norway and emigrated from Oslo to the United States in 1882. She is said to have been married, however her husband's name is unknown. She had a daughter.\nCampaigning for women's suffrage\nMartin was one of the founders of the Scandinavian Voting Association. From 1907 to 1914, Martin took an active part in the campaign for American women's suffrage. When the Scandinavian Woman Suffrage Association was founded in 1907 by Ethel Edgerton Hurd, Martin became its first president, a role she held from 1907 to 1913. After her retirement, she was succeeded by suffragette Nanna Mattson Jaeger.\nWhile she was president of the SWSA, Martin placed a large focus on the association's ethnicity. By looking at all the Scandinavian immigrant group (Norwegian, Swedish and Danish) as a whole, the membership would surpass all Scandinavian individual groups. As a Norwegian, Martin recruited many other Norwegians through various Norwegian cultural events, such as plays, speeches and lobbying campaigns. She was concerned with preserving the Scandinavian cultural heritage, in contrast with her successor Jaeger who championed the assimilation into American populace. In 1913, Martin told the Minneapolis Tribune that Scandinavian women in Minneapolis \"had no interest in woman suffrage\" as Scandinavians in this country have been so busy making money that they are 50 years behind the times\", a statement she retracted two days later with an explanation.\nMartin gave speeches in both Norwegian and English while garnering support for women's rights. When Minnesota's neighbouring state of North Dakota prepared to vote on a women's suffrage amendment to the state constitution, Martin travelled there to give speeches in both languages and to advise local suffragettes. Her most famous speech was The Great Awakening, which she delivered at the annual meeting of the Minnesota Woman Suffrage Association in 1908.\nBetween 1909 and 1922, Martin often contributed editorials to newspapers such as the Star Tribune and Minneapolis Star, expressing her progressive ideas. Martin also was a part of several clubs such as the Progressive Literary Club.\nLater life\nAfter leaving the SWSA in 1913, Martin shifted her focus onto the socialist movement. She wrote and lectured on these subjects as well as focusing more on her writing, and spent less time on the suffrage movement after 1914.\nIn 1917, she published the play Zoharita under the pseudonym Mistocles.\nMartin died on March 5, 1937, in Hennepin County, Minnesota, at the age of 71.\n",

This was during a period when bus services were becoming increasingly important for connecting suburbs and smaller towns to the main city centers. Altrincham, in particular, was an important hub, and the route helped provide vital connections. In 1969, the bus service came under the control of the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE), following the nationalization and reorganization of public transport. Under GMPTE, route 263 became a crucial link between Altrincham, Sale, Stretford, and Manchester, serving a mix of residential and commercial areas.\nIn 1986, the bus industry in the UK was deregulated, which meant that private companies could operate bus services under competition with public operators.\nFollowing deregulation, the 263 route was eventually taken over by GM Buses then Stagecoach Manchester in 1996, one of the largest private bus operators in the region. Over the years, Stagecoach introduced modern buses and frequent services, which helped solidify the 263 as an essential route.  \nIn October 2009, the operations of route 263 was taken over again by Arriva North West, becoming the current operator of this route. Since takeover, a fleet of brand new Wright Pulsar 2 bodied VDL SB200, were deployed on this route and currently in service.\n",

The League's forces were commanded by Castilian general Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba, who received the nom de guerre El Gran Capit\u00e1n (\"The Great Captain\") for his success in the siege.\nBackground\nFerdinand II had managed to drive French general Gilbert, Count of Montpensier back to his base in Atella, exciting the Neapolitan troops by making up a promise of German reinforcements sent by Maximilian I. However, he decided not to try to take the place without the presence of Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba, who at the time operated in Calabria. The Castilian considered eminent to secure thheir Calabrian rear guard before attempting a final attack on the French base, but he accepted to rendezvous with Ferdinand.\nC\u00f3rdoba left Calabria with a small force of 400 cavalry and 1000 infantry handpicked by him. He marched through land, but the renown gained with his success in guerrilla warfare against the French gave him pass led several French-aligned positions to surrender on the way. After being reinforced by another 500 men sent from Spain, he reached Atella seventeen days later. Awaiting for him were Ferdinand II, the Papal captain Cesare Borgia and the Venetian commander Francesco II Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua, who agreed to hand command to C\u00f3rdoba.\nSiege\nC\u00f3rdoba's first action was to evaluate the city's defenses with a cavalry troop. He found the city's weak spot in a series of mills that supplied the city with water and food, which he intended to capture. When Montpensier found out about his intentions, he guarded the mills with a force of Swiss pikemen and Gascon archers, against which C\u00f3rdoba issued a mixed body of rodeleros protected by mounted jinetes, clashing on July 1.\nThe battle was not lengthy, as the French contingent, probably demoralized by their dire strategic situation, withdrew quickly to Atella in various degrees of order. The Spanish light cavalry cut their retreat in a pincer movement before they could reach the city, upon which the French were almost annihilated. The heavy French cavalry of gendarmes sallied out of the city in their help, leading C\u00f3rdoba to call his cavalry back and regroup with his infantry, managing to hold off together the French counterattack. The French cavalry eventually routed and returned to Atella.\nC\u00f3rdoba initiated then a campaign to take the surrounding cities of Ripacandida and Venosa, which had remained in French control. With Atella virtually isolated, Montpensier decided to surrender the city if French reinforcements didn't arrive in 30 days. As this never happened, he finally surrendered in August. Montpensier would die of illness in the way back to France.\n",
    "Galaxy in the constellation of Bo\u00f6tes\nMarkarian 463 (Mrk 463) known as UGC 8850, is a galaxy merger located in the constellation Bo\u00f6tes. It is located 706\u00a0million light years from Earth. It is classified a double nucleus Seyfert galaxy.\nCharacteristics\nMarkarian 463 is a late stage galaxy merger, a product of two gas-rich spiral galaxies colliding with one another. According to optical and near-infrared observations, the galaxy is shown to have a complex morphology with star forming clumps and curved tidal tails. It has a luminosity of LIR (8-1000\u03bcm) = 1011.8 L\u0398 making it a luminous infrared galaxy. It contains a compact radio flux in either linear or elongated structure. Using spectra captured by the Infrared Spectrograph installed on Spitzer Space Telescope, emission lines are detected in Markarian 463 hinting a warm supply of molecular gas.\nA broadband X-ray spectral analysis revealed obscured two nuclei designated as Markarian 463W and Markarian 463E, with an estimated projected separation of ~ 3.8 kiloparsec.  This finding makes the galaxy a dual active galactic nucleus and is the third closest physical pair known after NGC 6240 and NGC 3758. The two nuclei has a luminosity of L2-10keV = 1.5 \u00d7 1043 and 3.8 \u00d7 1042 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 and 3.8 \u00d7 1042 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121. Both are active and are expected to drawn close to each other over timescales of 108 years.\nFurther investigations also notes the two nuclei. The western nucleus has a moderate radio luminosity equivalent of an extremely luminous starburst galaxy or a Seyfert galaxy through imaging detections at 6 and 20 centimeters. The eastern nucleus however, is much brighter compared to the western nucleus, and is classfied a type II Seyfert galaxy. It is found offset from its peak flux and shows polarized conical wind. With a half-opening angle of ~ 15 degrees, its wind displays three mass ejection periods. Using infrared spectroscopy, the eastern nucleus hosts a hidden Seyfert 1 nucleus located southwards but not co-spatial.\nAccording to Chandra X-ray data, the supermassive black hole in the nucleus of Markarian 463E has a much higher accretion rate of ~ 5x. It is also associated with emission and continuum lines. it is also shown it is older compared the nucleus of Markarian 463W, given the northern outflowing cloud and southern emission region appears generally aligned with the biconical gradient. An ALMA 12CO (2\u20131) observation also finds the two nuclei have molecular gas reservoirs estimated of ~ 109 M\u0398 and ~ 5 \u00d7 108 M\u0398 respectively. Given enough molecular gas provided, it is enough to feed both black holes in the galaxy.\nMarkarian 463 has an optical jet originating from the Seyfert nucleus according to Hubble Space Telescope imaging. The jet is found to reach the end at the radio source found 1.2 arcsecs away, and is measured 0.84 arcsecs with a position angle of 182 degrees.\nPart of the galaxy shows emission due to oxygen, first identified with Hubble. This was interpreted as a possible extended emission-line region (EELR).\nGallery\nHubble image of Mrk 463, with oxygen being green.\nVLT MUSE image of Mrk 463, with H-alpha being orange and oxygen being green.\nMrk 463 in wide view with legacy surveys, showing the tidal arms\n",

    "\nPhilippine law\nThe Intramuros Register of Styles is the main architectural code of Intramuros, the historic core of the City of Manila, Philippines. It became part of Presidential Decree No. 1616, as amended, when it was gazetted by the Official Gazette of the Philippines on June 17, 2022. The Intramuros Administration is the agency of the Philippine Government responsible for the implementation of the Register of Styles.\nIntramuros in Manila is the only locality in the Philippines where, for cultural reasons, the use, height, scale, and aesthetics of all new constructions and development are pre-determined and strictly regulated under the force of a national law. The Register of Styles, as an integral part of Presidential Decree No. 1616, is the main legal document prescribing and guiding the implementation of pre-war architectural colonial styles in Intramuros.\nThe Register of Styles is the first document to detail the historical styles of Intramuros. It was authored by Rancho Arcilla, who was then the Archivist of the Intramural Administration, and under the initiative of Guiller Asido, the former Administrator of Intramuros. Being an integral part of Presidential Decree No. 1616, the Register of Styles is the only architectural stylebook in the Philippines with the force and potency of a national law. \nBy form, the urban landscape of Intramuros mostly lacked setbacks, with buildings that were mostly terraced (rowhouses). Courtyards or backyards were exceptionally well adapted to the climate. By style Intramuros was described as both vernacular and cosmopolitan. While its Church and State buildings were European in orientation, albeit adapted and localized, most of the buildings enclaved within its walls embraced tropical vernacular constructions as exemplified by the Bahay na bato. Churches, fortifications, and palaces fashioned in European styles, though few, became icons and objects of popular imagination. In contrast, the vernacular Bahay na Bato, which was adopted in majority of buildings, prevailed in terms of number of constructions.\nThe Register of Styles prescribes the Bahay na bato as the default style for new constructions in Intramuros. It explicitly recognized the Bahay na Bato as the dominant architectural typology of Intramuros during the Spanish colonial era until the destruction of the Walled City in 1945 during the Second World War. Pursuant to the Intramuros Register of Styles, new constructions in Intramuros that do not follow the Bahay na Bato typology may only be allowed only in specific locations where a Non-Bahay na Bato structure (e.g. a Neoclassical building) was known to exist. Otherwise, new constructions are required to follow the Bahay na Bato type.\n",

    "1824\u201325 work of literary criticism by John Neal\nThis article is about the 1824\u201325 publication. For a list of American-born writers, see Lists of American writers. For the 2001\u201302 C-SPAN series, see American Writers: A Journey Through History.\nAmerican Writers is a work of literary criticism by American writer and critic John Neal. Published by Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine in five installments between September 1824 and February 1825, it is recognized by scholars as the first history of American literature and the first substantial work of criticism concerning US authors. It is Neal's longest critical work and at least 120 authors are covered, based entirely on Neal's memory; having no notes or books for reference contributed to Neal's disproportionate coverage of many figures and much disinformation about them. Modern scholars nevertheless praise the staying power of Neal's opinions, many of which are reflected by other critics decades later, notably \"Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses\" by Mark Twain. Theories of poetry and prose in American Writers foreshadowed and likely influenced later works by Edgar Allan Poe and Walt Whitman. Neal argued American literature relied too much on British precedent and had failed to develop its own voice. He offered sharp criticism of many authors and urged critics not to offer writers from the US undeserved criticism, lest it stifle the development of a truly distinct American literature. Poe's later critical essays on literature reflected these strictures.\nNeal wrote the series in London, where he lived between 1824 and 1827. Having moved there from Baltimore, his goals were to establish himself as America's leading literary figure, encourage the development of a uniquely American writing style, and reverse British disdain for literature from the US. He soon became the first American published in any British literary journal, American Writers being the longest and best-remembered of his works on American topics in multiple UK periodicals. He wrote for Scottish publisher William Blackwood under an English pseudonym, which Neal assumed was convincing. Blackwood and British readers likely realized they were reading the work of an American, and multiple leading American periodicals outed Neal before the series was completed. \nThe series was well received in the UK and exerted measurable influence over British critics, some of whom copied Neal's analyses and misinformation into their own essays. It conversely drew considerable ire from US journalists, none more severe than William Lloyd Garrison, who warned Neal to be on guard should he return to his home country. When he did, Neal found inflammatory broadsides and in-person hostility in his hometown of Portland, Maine, leading to a fistfight. In defiance, he decided to stay in Portland, where he lived until his death forty-nine years later. The first postmortem republication of a substantial work by Neal was 1937, when Fred Lewis Pattee collected American Writers for the first time into one publication. That 1937 edition remains the most accessible of Neal's literary productions.\nBackground\nBlackwood engages Neal\nJohn Neal c.\u20091823, by Sarah Miriam Peale\nAfter eight years in Baltimore, in late 1823 John Neal sailed to England. He pursued three primary goals: supplant Washington Irving and James Fenimore Cooper as the leading US literary figure, usher into existence a new uniquely American literary style, and reverse British disdain for American literature. To accomplish the third goal, Neal sought publication in British literary journals to expose UK readers to writing from the US and convince them of its value. A \"man of grievances\" according to English scholar George L. Nesbitt, Neal envisioned those journals as a \"blazing rocket-battery\" he could turn to fire upon the readership of \"swarming whipper-snappers\" in Great Britain. Thinking highly of his own abilities, he was confident he would fast become a leading literary figure in London.\nWilliam Blackwood c.\u20091830\nNeal's resources were running low after three months in England with no income. Capitalizing on Europeans' interest in US politics sparked by recent news of the Monroe Doctrine, he wrote an article on the five US presidents and current presidential candidates and submitted it to Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine. His letter said he was about to leave London to explore Europe, but: \"In the mean time, I must have some sort of employment to keep me out of mischief.\" Biographer Donald A. Sears says \"the situation was desperate\" when Neal received a response from Scottish publisher William Blackwood: \"You are exactly the correspondent that we want\". The payment of five guineas was more than Neal had ever received for any magazine submission.\nEarly American literature scholar William B. Cairns considered Blackwood's the most important literary periodical in 1820s Great Britain, a period when such periodicals were more influential than ever before. Neal was already famil",
    "2024 homicide in Kentucky, U.S.\nNot to be confused with Kevin Mullin.\nOn September 19, 2024, Letcher County, Kentucky, District Judge Kevin R. Mullins was shot and killed. Letcher County Sheriff Mickey Stines was arrested in connection with the shooting.\nBackground\nKevin R. Mullins (June 25, 1970 \u2013 September 19, 2024) was a district judge for the 47th Judicial District in Letcher County, Kentucky since 2009 following his appointment by former Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear. Mullins then won the election the following year and had been re-elected since. Before becoming a district judge he had served as an assistant commonwealth's attorney in Letcher County, starting in 2001. Mullins was a native of Pikeville and a graduate of the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville School of Law.\nShawn M. \"Mickey\" Stines was the Letcher County Sheriff and had previously served as a bailiff for the Letcher County District Court before being elected sheriff in 2018. He was reelected in 2022.\nIn 2022, Stines was sued by a woman, alleging that a sheriff's deputy had pressured a woman into having sexual intercourse with him for favorable treatment. Stines was alleged to have not trained the deputy properly and to not have responded to reports appropriately. The suit says the abuse occurred in the chamber of Judge Mullins but did not allege that Mullins was aware of the assaults or allege he was involved in any wrongdoing.\nShooting\nAt around 3:00\u00a0p.m., Stines walked into the outer chambers of Mullins and told courthouse employees that he needed to talk with Mullins privately and the two walked into inner chambers of the judge's office, closed the door behind them, and several minutes later shots were heard. Stines subsequently walked outside of the courthouse and surrendered himself to the police. Kentucky State Police did not release a motive for the shooting. Stines has been charged with one count of first-degree murder. A school in the area was subsequently put under lockdown due to the shooting.\nReactions\nGovernor Andy Beshear released a statement on Twitter: Sadly, I have been informed that a district judge in Letcher County was shot and killed in his chambers this afternoon. There is far too much violence in this world, and I pray there is a path to a better tomorrow.\nChief Justice of the Kentucky Supreme Court Laurance B. VanMeter said the state court system was \"shaken by the news,\" while the Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman said his office will work with a regional prosecutor as special prosecutor. County prosecutor Matt Butler recused from the case citing his social ties with Mullins.

    "Woman in Greek mythology\nDetail of Camiro and Clytie in a reconstruction of the Nekyia by Polygnotus, 1892\nIn Greek mythology, Cleothera (Ancient Greek: \u039a\u03bb\u03b5\u03cc\u03b8\u03b7\u03c1\u03b1, romanized:\u00a0Kle\u00f3th\u0113ra, lit.\u2009'glory seeker') is one of the daughters of Pandareus and Harmotho\u00eb, natives of western Asia Minor or the island of Crete. After the deaths of their parents, she and her sister Merope were adopted by Aphrodite, the goddess of love and sensuality, and in time they came to serve the Furies, goddesses of rage and revenge.\nFamily\nCleothera was a daughter of Pandareus by his wife Harmotho\u00eb, and thus sister to A\u00ebdon and Merope. In some authors, Pandareus is also said to have also been the father of Chelidon and an unnamed son, though those versions do not include Cleothera and Merope.\nMythology\nCleothera was born to Pandareus and Harmotho\u00eb who were from either in western Asia Minor or Crete, but her parents were soon forced to flee to Sicily when her father incurred the wrath of the king of the gods Zeus by trying to steal from him a golden dog that guarded his temple in Crete. They eventually perished there.\nAfter the deaths of their parents, the orphaned Cleothera along with Merope were raised by the goddesses Aphrodite, while A\u00ebdon, the eldest daughter, married Zethus, the king of Thebes. The other Olympian goddesses also blessed the girls with gifts and blessings; Hera gave them wisdom and beauty, Artemis high stature, and Athena taught them women's arts and crafts. Cleothera and her sister both grew to be beautiful women, so when they were of age Aphrodite tried to seek suitable husbands for them. But while she was away in heaven trying to consult Zeus in order to secure them happy marriages, they were kidnapped by the Erinyes with the help of either the winds or the Harpies, and were made handmaidens to them, never to be seen again.\nIn another version, after the theft of the dog, Pandareus fled with his entire family to Athens and then Sicily, where he and his wife were killed as punishment by Zeus; Zeus then set the Harpies on all three of the girls, including A\u00ebdon. They snatched and carried them off to the Erinyes, who then made them work for them.\nThe second-century traveller Pausanias mentions an ancient painting of the myth made by Polygnotus, who has labelled the maidens as Cameiro and Clytie instead, and are depicted crowned with flowers and playing dice.\nSee also\nMythology portalAncient Greece portal\nHilaeira and Phoebe\nPersephone\nEuropa",
    "Annual memorial day observed in Israel\nMemorial Day for Ethiopian Jews is an annual memorial day held on the 28th of Iyar, coinciding with Jerusalem Day. This day commemorates the thousands of Ethiopian Jews who died during their journey to Israel, particularly during the mass aliyah operations in the 1980s.\nBackground\nThe Ethiopian Jewish community, known as Beta Israel, faced significant hardships during their migration to Israel. The most notable events include Operation Moses in 1984, which facilitated the migration of approximately 8,000 Jews from Ethiopia through Sudan, and Operation Solomon in 1991, which brought an additional 14,324 Ethiopian Jews to Israel in just 36 hours. During the journey, it is estimated that around 4,000 individuals died, with approximately 1,500 having been named and memorialized.\nAs of 2021, approximately 160,000 individuals of Ethiopian descent resided in Israel, with just over half born in Ethiopia and the remainder born in Israel to immigrant parents.\nObservance\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaking at a memorial service in May 1998\nThe first memorial ceremony for the 4,000 Ethiopians who died on the way to Israel was held in 1986 near kibbutz Ramat Rachel, south of Jerusalem, coinciding with Jerusalem Day, which is observed on the 28th of Iyar in the Hebrew calendar. This choice indicates a desire to identify with Israelis who lost their lives in the struggle for Jerusalem and to assert a shared sense of belonging within the national narrative and collective memory. Three years later, in 1999, the Ministry of Immigrant Absorption, with support from the Jewish Agency and the Israel National Fund, established a temporary memorial near Ramat Rachel. Each year, state representatives promised the community that the site would be made suitable for larger gatherings. When efforts to compel the state to fulfill its commitments failed, a High Court petition was submitted in July 2002. Following the court's recommendation, the issue was referred to mediation by Minister of Immigrant Absorption Tzipi Livni in March 2003. During the Sigd festival in Jerusalem, the minister announced a cabinet decision to create a memorial at the National Civil Cemetery on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. Simultaneously, the government designated the memorial ceremony to coincide with Jerusalem Day. Four years later, in March 2007, the permanent memorial was completed.\nThe annual commemoration ceremony is held at Mount Herzl, Israel's national military cemetery in Jerusalem, where a memorial resembling a deserted Ethiopian village displays the names of over 1,500 deceased individuals. The event includes memorial prayers and moments of reflection on the struggles faced by Ethiopian Jews, particularly the difficult conditions during their transit in Sudan. It is attended by families who lost relatives, members of the Ethiopian Jewish community, heads of state and politicians, and public figures, among others. President Shimon Peres maintained a yearly tradition of honoring the deceased.\nSome activists contend that Jerusalem Day overshadows this observance, limiting its visibility. A 2017 opinion piece by activist Efrat Yerday published in Haaretz criticized the scheduling of Memorial Day for Ethiopian Jews on the same day as Jerusalem Day. She highlighted that the overlap leads to the memorial receiving inadequate attention and coverage, effectively making it a private observance for Ethiopian Israelis, while broader Israeli society remains largely unaware. A 2021 opinion piece emphasized the need to separate the memorial day from Jerusalem Day. The author reflected on the painful juxtaposition of a national celebration and a day of mourning for those lost and asserted that by aligning these two significant days, the memorial often goes unnoticed, overshadowed by festivities. However, various institutions\u2014including schools, universities, and community centers\u2014have started recognizing Memorial Day for Ethiopian Jews, gradually incorporating it into the Israeli public consciousness.\nIsraeli president Reuven Rivlin during the national memorial ceremony for Ethiopian Jews in May 2018 \nIn 2015, during the memorial service, President Reuven Rivlin acknowledged the state's failures in supporting the Ethiopian community, stating that Israel had not listened or acted adequately to their needs. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, also present, promised to form a ministerial committee to address discrimination and racism, emphasizing a commitment to combat these issues. The memorial came amid protests against police violence following the surfacing of footage of police beating a black soldier.\nOn May 21, 2020, the memorial service was attended by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Immigration and Absorption Minister Pnina Tamano-Shata, Israel's first Ethiopian-born minister, and Eden Alene, Israel's first Ethiopian Eurovision representative. The ceremony, led by Ethiopian journalist Almaz Mangistu, included perform",

It comprises three connected stories that involve the supernatural.\nGameplay\nThree short point-and-click adventure games comprise The Charnel House Trilogy: Sepulchre, which was previously released as a standalone game; Inhale, a prequel to Sepulchre; and Exhale, a sequel. Inhale is about Alex Davenport and why she boards a train.  Sepulchre is a ghost story about a doctor on the same train.  Exhale completes Alex's story.  Players interact with the characters and learn more about the characters' motivations.  There are few puzzles.\nDevelopment\nMastertronic Group released The Charnel House Trilogy for Windows on April 16, 2015.\nReception\nThe Charnel House Trilogy received mixed reviews on Metacritic. Rock Paper Shotgun found Inhale to have too many immersion-breaking inside jokes.  Sepulchre, which the reviewer previously enjoyed, felt weaker coming back Inhale.  Exhale, to them, felt like a tonal mismatch with its focus on teen horror.  However, Rock Paper Shotgun praised the trilogy's art and score. GameSpot criticized Inhale for having \"out-of-place humor\" and puzzles that did not seem to follow its story.  They felt Sepulchre lacked subtlety, but they enjoyed Exhale  and Alex's character growth.  They concluded that the trilogy has a \"mishmash of themes and tones\". Adventure Gamers recommended it to \"anyone who values atmospheric storytelling over gameplay\", though they disliked the ending, which they said felt like a cop-out. RPGFan called it \"short but highly repeatable\" and recommended it to players who like to think about and try to piece together vague stories.  According to Paste, the stories are at their best when they are open-ended and weird, but it is much weaker when it begins providing answers.\n",
    "Species of bird\nThe southern nutcracker (Nucifraga hemispila) is a passerine bird in the crow family Corvidae.\nIt was formerly considered to be conspecific with the northern nutcracker (Nucifraga caryocatactes) and the Kashmir nutcracker (Nucifraga multipunctata) under the English name \"spotted nutcracker\".\nTaxonomy\nThe southern nutcracker was formally described in 1831 by the Irish zoologist Nicholas Vigors under the binomial name Nucifraga hemispila. He specified the type locality as the Himalayas but the locality has been restricted to the Shimla and Almora districts of northern India. The genus name Nucifraga is the Latin name given to the northern nutcracker by the English naturalist William Turner in 1544, as a translation of the German name Nussbrecher meaning \"nut-breaker\". The specific epithet hemispila combines the Ancient Greek \u1f21\u03bc\u03b9-/h\u0113mi- meaning \"half-\" or \"small\" with \u03c3\u03c0\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2/spilos meaning \"stain\" or \"spot\". The southern nutcracker was formerly considered to be conspecific with the spotted nutcracker (Nucifraga caryocatactes) now renamed as the northern nutcracker.

    "\nOn August 4, 2021, jihadists from the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara attacked several towns and Burkinabe bases in Markoye Department, Oudalan Province, Burkina Faso. Several rural villages were raided and civilians were killed, and the jihadist raids on Burkinabe bases in Tokabangou sparked battles that killed dozens of Burkinabe soldiers and ISGS fighters. The attacks were the deadliest day for the Burkinabe government since the Solhan and Tadaryat massacres in June 2021.\nBackground\nMarkoye Department is located in Oudalan Province, the northernmost part of Burkina Faso and on the borders of Niger and Mali. Since 2015, north and northeastern Burkina Faso has been embroiled in an insurgency by the Mali-based Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin, the Niger-based Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, and the homegrown Burkinabe Ansarul Islam. In the neighboring S\u00e9no Province, eighteen people were killed in the Yattakou massacre in April 2021. In February 2021, eight people were killed and nine were injured in an ambush on a civilian convoy between Markoye and Tokabangou.\nAttacks\nThe jihadists launched several attacks against villages in Markoye department at around noon on August 4, 2021. The villages of Dambam, Guevara, and Tokabangou, all of which are located ten kilometers from the department capital of Markoye, were attacked, along with the villages of Badnoogo, Bassian, and Gadba. The attackers stole livestock and raided and torched homes.\nPro-government Volunteers for the Defense of the Homeland (VDP) militants based at the Burkinabe garrison in Markoye were dispatched to combat the attacks, but were ambushed near Tokabangou. On August 5, the Burkinabe Ministry of Defense stated that the area that was attacked was under government control, and that government forces had launched a counteroffensive to find the perpetrators.\nAftermath\nThe Burkinabe Ministry of Defense stated that fifteen Burkinabe soldiers, four VDP militiamen, and eleven civilians were killed in the attacks throughout the department. Burkinabe officials and RFI stated that at least ten jihadists were killed or injured during the attack. A fifth VDP militiamen was killed in a jihadist attack that same day in Pensa, Centre-Nord Region. The attacks were the deadliest day for the Burkinabe government since the Solhan and Tadaryat massacres in June 2021.\nThe Burkinabe Chief of Staff Moise Miningou visited Markoye on August 7 and spoke to the survivors. The fallen soldiers were buried in the Dori Military Cemetery in Dori on August 8, with their funerals being attended by various high-ranking military officials.\nOn November 1, 2021, ten civilians were killed in an attack between Dambam and Markoye by jihadists.\n",
    "\n\u00a0This article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the Library of Congress.\nThe Washington Journal was a German-language newspaper published in Washington, D.C..\nFront page of the first Washington Journal published after the German surrender in World War One, edition of November 15, 1918\nIn March 1871, Nehemiah H. Miller, Assistant District Attorney for the District Government, created a Republican German daily in Washington called T\u00e4glicher Washingtoner Anzeiger, a newspaper published daily except Sunday. Unlike Werner Koch's newspapers, which avoided politics and political parties, the Anzeiger was openly political. In 1873, the Anzeiger ran into financial difficulties before Miller decided to sell his newspaper to Koch. On March 31, 1873, Koch merged the Columbia and the T\u00e4glicher Washingtoner Anzeiger to become the Washingtoner Journal, published daily except Sunday.\nThe Journal promoted the social and cultural activities of German Americans. Because it openly opposed the Temperance Movement, the newspaper saw an increasing number of advertisements from Washington breweries, bars, and beer gardens, all of which provided income for the newspaper.\nIn April 1885, Koch reduced the publishing frequency of the Journal from six to three days a week. Two years later, the Washingtoner Journal (following German grammar) was renamed the Washington Journal and reduced to a weekly. In 1892, Christian Strack became editor, and the paper began including popular conservative serialized novels along with short stories, poems, and jingles produced by local talent.\nOn March 8, 1911, Werner Koch died from a lung tumor. In the March 11, 1911 issue of the Journal, Strack wrote a tribute to Koch. In that same issue, an advertisement was placed for the sale of the Washington Journal and its assets. The Journal was not profitable and was run at a loss for many years. The Journal ceased publishing March 25, 1911 when it could no longer pay the typesetters.\nWithout the Journal, there was no longer a German newspaper in Washington and over 30 German American societies felt this loss. Events and services for the German American community were not listed anywhere else and readers realized the impact on the community. Members of the National German-American Alliance came together to raise funds to save the Journal. On May 27, 1911, the Journal reappeared, eight weeks after it had shut down, with new management, the Washington Journal Co., under publisher Charles T. Schwegler, a leading German American businessperson in D.C. Unfortunately, Strack became ill and ended his tenure as editor in 1912. He later died on November 29, 1914. From 1912 to 1915, various members of the German American community and the Alliance took on the role of editor, including Max Hesselbach, Kurt Volkner, and Gustav Bender.\nDuring World War I, the Alliance felt it was their duty to defend Germany's position in the war. Because of this, the Journal promoted the propaganda campaign created by the Alliance on behalf of the German cause. Many English articles from other publications such as the Fatherland, the official mouthpiece of the National German-American Alliance, and the Crucible, the statewide Alliance news bulletin for Virginia, were included in the Journal. Unfortunately, the Journal suddenly found itself denounced as \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201cpro-Kaiser.\u201d\nIn 1915, the Journal faced bankruptcy; however, Hermann G. Winkler, who was working as a printer for the Washington Journal, used all his savings to acquire the rights and assets of the Journal and take on the roles of publisher and editor, paralleling Koch's career with the newspaper.\nDue to the Trading with the Enemy Act of October 1917, the Journal and other German-language newspapers in the United States had to provide exact English translations of all news and editorial matters related to the war to the local postmaster. Furthermore, public sentiment for German Americans was at an all-time low. Most advertisers withdrew because they feared being identified as un-American. Hate due to World War I eventually subsided, but many German-American societies had disbanded. To avoid a financial crisis, publishers of the Journal appealed to citizens for funding. Winkler also installed modern printing equipment, which enabled him to print and publish books. In 1923, Paul Gleis became editor.\nAt the onset of World War II, Winkler steered the Journal away from any involvement relating to the growing Nazi culture in Germany and the upcoming war. In its December 12, 1941 issue, published five days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the newspaper took a clear stance with a front-page English- and German-language editorial titled \u201cWe are all Americans, standing united in the defense of our country\u201d which stated: \u201cll Americans, regardless of place of birth or former nationality, all American citizens of German blood, stand as one behind their Government in this crisis.

    "Mosque in Basqal, Azerbaijan\nSheikh Muhammad Mosque is a historical mosque and architectural monument dating from the 16th century. It is located in the \"Basqal\" State Historical-Cultural Reserve in Azerbaijan.\nAbout\nSheikh Muhammad Mosque was built in 1531 under the orders of Pir Muhammad, the son of Sufi Dervish Ali. The mosque is located in the K\u0259l\u0259k\u00fc\u00e7\u0259 neighborhood of Basqal. A madrasa operated in the mosque's courtyard.\nAfter the Soviet occupation in Azerbaijan, the official campaign against religion began in 1928. In December of that year, the Central Committee of the Azerbaijan Communist Party transferred many mosques, churches, and synagogues to the balance of clubs for educational purposes. While there were 3,000 mosques in Azerbaijan in 1917, this number dropped to 1,700 in 1927, 1,369 in 1928, and 17 in 1933. Sheikh Muhammad Mosque was closed for worship during this period. About twenty stone inscriptions in the mosque's courtyard were destroyed, and the twin minarets were dismantled. The mosque building was repurposed as a club. In 1975, the building was completely destroyed by a fire caused by a short circuit in the electrical network. In the 1980s, local people carried out restoration work on the mosque. During this work, they discovered an inscription about Pir \u00c7inar, which was planted beside the mosque. The inscription noted that Pir \u00c7inar was planted by Sheikh Safayi in 1568. In 1989, the \"Basqal\" State Historical-Cultural Reserve was established in the area including the mosque.\nArchaeological excavations\nIn 2019, at the request of the State Tourism Agency of the Republic of Azerbaijan, an expedition from the Archaeology and Ethnography Institute of the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences, led by Prof. Dr. Qafar C\u0259biyev, conducted archaeological research inside and in the courtyard of Sheikh Muhammad Mosque. Inside the mosque, remains of a smaller, square-shaped mosque in the style of Shirvanshahs period Islamic architecture were uncovered.

    "Deadly wildfires in north and central Portugal\nThe 2024 Portugal wildfires were a series of more than 1,000 wildfires, at least 128 labeled as devastating, that spread through central and northern Portugal between 15 and 20 September 2024, although the fires were controlled by 20 September, authorities and firefighters remained on the ground in order to be vigilant for several more days, burning more than 135,000 hectares of land, resulting in the deaths of at least nine people - amongst them were four firefighters -, the evacuation of several villages, and a response of over 5,000 firefighters with assistance from the European Union.\nWildfires\nSee also: 2024 European heatwaves\nWildfires began in mid-September and spread across central and northern Portugal, with at least 128 separate fires being reported by 16 September that had burned about 10,000 hectares (39 square miles) between the northern municipalities of Aveiro District and Porto District. Blazes reached Albergaria-a-Velha in Aveiro District and burned down multiple houses.\nThe triggering and rapid spread of the wildfires were caused by \"unusually dry conditions\" and strong gusts of wind that reached up to 70\u00a0km/h (43\u00a0mph), in addition to temperatures reaching or exceeding 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) from 14 to 16 September. At the same time, police has also arrested several people for suspected arson which, combined with the unusual weather and high temperature conditions, aggravated considerably the scale of the wildfires.\nImpact\nAt least nine people were killed due to the wildfires, including three firefighters who were trapped inside a vehicle in T\u00e1bua, and five civilians. Portuguese police found the body of a victim of the wildfires, who worked at a logging company and was helping rescuing material when the fire came. Nearby, one firefighter died in Oliveira de Azem\u00e9is after suffering from cardiopulmonary arrest as he battled nearby fires. Two more people suffered serious injuries which included burns and respiratory difficulties, requiring them to be hospitalized. Twelve more firefighters were injured while combating blazes, four of whom were injured severely.\nThe mayor of Albergaria-a-Velha, Ant\u00f3nio Loureiro, reported that four houses had burnt down and at least twenty more were in danger in the town's residential and industrial perimeters, requiring the evacuation of several districts. Two more homes were destroyed in Cabeceiras de Basto, in Braga.\nResponse\nSatellite image showing the burned areas after the fires were controlled.\nA \"special red alert\" status was implemented across all of continental Portugal. Portuguese authorities issued evacuation orders for several villages close to the wildfires. Authorities also shut down several roadways close to ongoing wildfires and thick smoke, including sections of the main highway connecting Lisbon and Porto. At least 70 residents were forced to evacuate in the Aveiro region.\nOver 5,000 firefighters and 1,500 fire engines were assigned to combat spreading fires across the nation. Of these, about 1,100 firefighters and twelve firefighting aircraft were assigned to fight four fires in and around Aveiro district, including the one that entered Albergaria-a-Velha. Eight more firefighting aircraft were requested by Portugal from the European Commission under the RescEU program. Spain sent two aircraft while France and Greece both stated that they would send two more each. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen stated that the EU was \"urgently mobilising\" and requested that other EU member states also send assistance.\nSee also\n2024 European floods \u2013 Concurrent European climate-related disaster\n2024 Attica wildfires\n2024 Russian wildfires\n2024 Turkey wildfires",
    "German ironclad gunboat\nSMS M\u00fccke was an ironclad gunboat of the Wespe class built for the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) in the 1870s. The ships, which were armed with a single 30.5\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) MRK L/22 gun, were intended to serve as part of a coastal defense fleet.\nDesign\nMain article: Wespe-class gunboat\nPlan and profile of the Wespe class in their original configuration\nDevelopment of the Wespe class of ironclad gunboats began in the 1850s, after the first ironclads were introduced during the Crimean War. Through the 1860s, the Federal Convention examined various proposals, which included plans to build at least eight vessels, to as many as eighteen armored warships. The decision was finalized based on the fleet plan conceived by General Albrecht von Stosch, the new Chief of the Kaiserliche Admiralit\u00e4t (Imperial Admiralty), in the early 1870s. He envisioned a fleet oriented on defense of Germany's Baltic and North Sea coasts, which would be led by the ironclad corvettes of the Sachsen class. These were to be supported by larger numbers of small, armored gunboats, which became the Wespe class.\nM\u00fccke was 46.4 meters (152\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) long overall, with a beam of 10.6\u00a0m (34\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in) and a draft of 3.2 to 3.4\u00a0m (10 to 11\u00a0ft). She displaced 1,098 metric tons (1,081 long tons) as designed and 1,163\u00a0t (1,145 long tons) at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 3\u00a0officers and 73 to 85\u00a0enlisted men. She was powered by a pair of double-expansion steam engines that drove a pair of 4-bladed screw propellers, with steam provided by four coal-fired cylindrical fire-tube boilers, which gave her a top speed of 11 knots (20\u00a0km/h; 13\u00a0mph) at 800 metric horsepower (790\u00a0ihp). At a cruising speed of 7 knots (13\u00a0km/h; 8.1\u00a0mph), she could steam for 700 nautical miles (1,300\u00a0km; 810\u00a0mi).\nThe ship was armed with one 30.5\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) MRK L/22 gun in a barbette mount that had a limited arc of traverse. In practice, the gun was aimed by turning the ship in the direction of fire. The Wespes were intended to beach themselves on the sandbars along the German coastline to serve as semi-mobile coastal artillery batteries. The armored barbette was protected by 203\u00a0mm (8\u00a0in) of wrought iron, backed with 210\u00a0mm (8.3\u00a0in) of teak. The ship was fitted with a waterline armor belt that was 102 to 203\u00a0mm (4 to 8\u00a0in) thick, with the thickest section protecting the propulsion machinery spaces and ammunition magazine. The belt was backed with 210\u00a0mm of teak. An armor deck that consisted of two layers of 22\u00a0mm (0.87\u00a0in) of iron on 28\u00a0mm (1.1\u00a0in) of teak provided additional protection against enemy fire.\nService history\nProfile drawing of the Wespe class as they appeared c. 1900\nThe keel for M\u00fccke was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in 1876, and she was launched on 5 May 1877. She was named after the German word for mosquito. Work on the ship proceeded more slowly than her sister ships, and she was briefly commissioned into active service on 25 February 1878 for sea trials. She saw no further activity for the next eight years, and in that time, she was refitted with an additional 8.7\u00a0cm (3.4\u00a0in) L/24 built-up guns, a pair of 37\u00a0mm (1.5\u00a0in) Hotchkiss revolver cannon, and two 35\u00a0cm (14\u00a0in) torpedo tubes in her bow, both of which were below the waterline. Despite her lengthy period of inactivity early in her career, M\u00fccke would be the most active member of her class.\nM\u00fccke commissioned for her first period of service with the fleet on 1 May 1885. She initially conducted individual training exercises, beginning in mid-June. For the fall fleet maneuvers, she served as the flagship of a division of gunboats that included her sisters Viper, Wespe, and Salamander. The ships took part in combined fleet training maneuvers, which saw the gunboats defend the mouth of Jade Bight against a simulated attack by the main units of the German fleet. Following the end of the maneuvers on 7 September, M\u00fccke was assigned to the Reserve Division of the North Sea, serving as its flagship. At that time, Kapit\u00e4nleutnant (Captain Lieutenant) Richard Hornung served as the ship's commander.\nFor the 1886 training year, an Armored Gunboat Flotilla was created on 11 May; M\u00fccke again served as the flagship for the unit, which also included Viper, Salamander, and their sister Camaeleon. The ships conducted training exercises until 9 June, when the unit was disbanded. M\u00fccke thereafter served in the Training Fleet for the annual maneuvers, which were carried out in July and August. The ship trained individually from May to early August 1887, after which she joined the Training Fleet as in previous years. The fleet maneuvers, which lasted from 3 to 14 September, consisted of another simulated attack on Jade Bight, along with blockade operations in the area. M\u00fccke thereafter returned to the Reserve Division for the winter months. In April 1888, now-Korvettenkapit\u00e4n (KK\u2014Corvette Captain) Hornung was replaced by KK Alfred Herz.

    "Sri Lankan hairstylist\nRamani Fernando is a Sri Lankan beauty hairstyle fashion designer, entrepreneur, hairdresser and hairstylist. She is widely acknowledged as a prominent stalwart in pioneering the field of hair and beauty. She is considered as a prominent key figure in the beauty culture of Sri Lanka. She is the founder and managing director of Ramani Fernando Salons. She is married to former Sri Lankan cricketer and commentator Ranjit Fernando.\nBiography\nShe was raised up in Kuliyapitiya, a town which was predominantly known for having a population mostly composed of professionals like doctors and lawyers. Ramani's father was also reportedly a lawyer. She grew up during an era when there was no access to both television or fashionable magazines in Sri Lanka.\nCareer\nShe pursued her primary and secondary education at St. Bridget's Convent, Colombo. Soon after completing her primary and secondary education at school level, she immediately made a life changing decision by venturing into the field of hairdressing and hairstyling. She actually began hairdressing as a passion and hobby and she subsequently joined a local training college. However, she later revealed that her initial passion was fashion and design, but she acknowledged that there was far more demand and scope for hair and beauty, hence she switched her mindset oriented towards hair and beauty. To be precise, she was supposed to pursue her interest in fashion designing, but due to the absence of schools specifically focusing the subject genre of fashion designing, she moved on to prioritise hairdressing.\nShe admitted that she learnt the real experience of hairdressing during her brief but productive stay in England alongside her spouse Ranjith. She gained her firsthand experience in hairstyle related job at Gerard Martin \u2013 London Gold where she received a job offer in the role of a stylist's assistant. Her first job had hardly anything to be memorable of as she was only given minor roles including sweeping, shampooing, cleaning and making cups of coffee to clients as well as to walk-in customers. She then endured a brief stint at Raymond's salon in England where she worked as a junior stylist. After gaining a valuable exposure abroad, she returned to Sri Lanka and started her own business model right from the scratch initially at her own house located at Elibank Road. Ramani eventually launched the Ramani Fernando Salons to kickstart her dream career in the field of hairstyling. Ramani Fernando Salons eventually picked up gradually and branches were established in across various parts of Sri Lanka.\nRamani Fernando Salons has notably forged a long collaboration with HSBC Colombo Fashion Week for a duration of over 18 years with the set agreement of preparing of hair and makeup looks for models. She was eventually the first ever recipient of the Woman Entrepreneur of the Year when such award was launched in Sri Lanka. She won the inaugural Woman Entrepreneur of the Year Award from the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry. She was also conferred with the prestigious Zonta Woman of Achievement during the 1990s.\nShe has worked alongside many female hairstylists in the country in her illustrious career spanning over a period of five decades. Ramani has predominantly given her focus and priority related to the aspect of crafting bridal hairstyles for brides who are gearing for weddings. In 2016, she was invited as one of the judges to officiate in the bridal section of the 40th Anniversary Asian Hairstyling and Beauty Competition which was held at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium in Hong Kong. Furthermore, her organisation Ramani Fernando Salons was eventually adjudged as the recipient of an award for Outstanding Business Achievement during the 40th Anniversary Asian Hairstyling and Beauty Competition.\nHer technical prowess in the hair and beauty industry had eventually opened floodgates for more upcoming aspiring budding female hairstylists in Sri Lanka to stamp their authority and as well to challenge the status quo with regards to the barriers and stereotypes surrounding around women. In 2014, writer and author Dila Hettiaratchy launched a biography titled A Journey with Style based on the life trajectory of beautician Ramani Fernando.\n",

    "\nThe B\u00e1thory of Gagy (Hungarian: gagyi B\u00e1thory) was a Hungarian noble family, which descended from the Szal\u00e1nc branch of the powerful Aba clan. They became extinct in 1689. They were not related to the B\u00e1thory family of the Gutkeled kindred.\nBackground\nKing Samuel Aba\nThe B\u00e1thory name is associated with four major historical families, as indicated in the index of noble names: Page: 20  \nB\u00e1thory of Somly\u00f3\nB\u00e1thory of Ecsed\nB\u00e1thory of Szaniszl\u00f3fi\nB\u00e1thory of Gagy\nThe three branches of the B\u00e1thory family from the Gutkeled clan played a pivotal role in Hungary's medieval and early modern history, while the B\u00e1thory of Gagy family remained marginal. By the late 17th century, all four lines of the B\u00e1thory family had died out on the male side, leading to the complete extinction of the name. Some people with different forms of the B\u00e1tori name still live today, but most of them have nothing to do with the historical families, since King Joseph II issued a name order in 1787, and it became necessary for people to have German or Hungarian names, so in the middle of the 19th century many people were given permission to take even historical names. \nAba clan\nBattle of Rozgony\nThe Sixtus branch of the Aba clan including voyvode Nicholas  (Mikl\u00f3s I) the father of the B\u00e1thory branch. (Csoma J\u00f3zsef: The Noble Families of Aba\u00faj and Thorna Counties page 27. ) \nThe B\u00e1thory family of Gagy was connected to the illustrious Aba clan, a prominent kindred in Hungary. The Abas descended from King Samuel Aba, the brother-in-law of Saint Stephen, the first king of Hungary. Samuel Aba's reign was marked by efforts to consolidate and strengthen the nascent Hungarian state, laying foundational structures for future governance. The Abas' prominence was further enhanced by the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty, which granted them numerous fiefs and lands. \nFinta Aba\nThe eldest son of D\u00e1vid Aba, who played a significant role in Hungarian history. Initially, he served as the palatine under King B\u00e9la IV. In 1270, he was allegedly involved in a palace coup aiming to kidnap the young prince Ladislaus (later King Ladislaus IV), possibly intending to place B\u00e9la of Macs\u00f3 on the throne with the support of the Czech King Ottokar. However, there is no evidence that Fintha fled after the rebellion was suppressed, suggesting he may have returned to serve King Ladislaus. During Ladislaus IV's reign, Fintha remained a loyal and influential figure. In 1277, he led troops to suppress an uprising in the north, and by 1278, he had become the Voivode of Transylvania. Fintha later took a stand against the king's actions, particularly regarding the capture of the papal legate. Alongside others, he arrested the king and took him to Buda, but released him after securing promises that Ladislaus would not harm the church or his adversaries. As a result, Fintha was appointed palatine once again. Conflict arose when the king's behavior alienated the Cumans, leading to their rebellion. Fintha helped the king win a decisive victory against the Cumans at the Battle of Lake H\u00f3d, restoring internal peace. However, the relationship between Fintha and the king eventually soured, resulting in Fintha's removal as palatine and a military campaign against him in 1281. The king besieged Fintha in Szal\u00e1ncz Castle, and although details of Fintha\u2019s fate remain unclear, and he disappeared from historical records.Palatin Finta died without male heirs, leaving only a daughter, Kl\u00e1ra. The Szal\u00e1nc castle and estate passed to his brother, Peter, whose descendants became the founders of the Szal\u00e1nc branch.\nAmadeus Aba\nThe youngest brother of Palatine Fintha, was a notable Hungarian noble during the late 13th and early 14th centuries. He first gained prominence in 1278 when he fought for King Ladislaus IV against King Ottokar II of Bohemia, losing a finger in the battle. Amadeus held various important positions, including governor of Szeben and Palatine of Hungary. He was instrumental in several military campaigns, including the suppression of rebellious Cumans and Tatars. Loyal to the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty and later to King Andrew III, Amadeus played a crucial role during the turbulent succession disputes after the extinction of the \u00c1rp\u00e1d line. His influence grew as he governed from his seat at G\u00f6nc Castle, becoming a powerful oligarch akin to a regional ruler. Despite occasional conflicts with other nobles and internal family issues, he remained loyal to the ruling monarch. Amadeus was eventually killed during a confrontation in Kassa in 1311, and his sons continued his legacy but ultimately lost their power after a series of conflicts with King Charles I.\nPeter Aba\nThis text (XXXIII) records an exchange of properties in 1330 between Count William Drugeth and the family members of Count Peter of Szal\u00e1nc, with the approval of King Charles of Hungary.

He was the eldest son of Ag\u00e9nor de Gramont, 10th Duke of Gramont, and Emma Mary Mackinnon (1811\u20131891), a member of the Scottish nobility. His younger brothers were Armand de Gramont, Duke of Lesparre (who married H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Louise Eug\u00e9nie Duchesne de Gillevoisin), and Antoine Albert de Gramont (who married Jeanne Marie Sabatier).\nHis paternal grandparents were H\u00e9raclius de Gramont, 9th Duke of Gramont and Anna-Quintina-Albertine Grimod, Countess d'Orsay (daughter of Albert Gaspard Grimod, Comte d'Orsay). His maternal grandparents were Emma Mary Palmer (the only daughter and heiress of writer Joseph Palmer of Rush House), and William Alexander Mackinnon, 33rd Chief of the Scottish Clan Mackinnon.\nGramont excelled in mathematics and graduated first from the \u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr.\nCareer\nAfter attending the \u00c9cole, he entered the French cavalry and became a Second lieutenant in the 4th Hussars, a regiment in which he served during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, during which time his father was France's Minister for Foreign Affairs. After France's defeat, his uncle, General Auguste de Gramont, Duke of Lesparre, refused to introduce him to the Jockey-Club de Paris as the son of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who was blamed for the war of 1870.\nFrom 1855 until 1880, as the eldest of the Gramont family and heir presumptive to the title of Duke of Gramont, he used the courtesy title Duke of Guiche. Upon his father's death in 1880, he became the 11th Duke of Gramont and left the army. He was also known as the Prince of Bidache (the principality of Bidache maintained de jure sovereignty from 1570 until 1790 when, by royal edict, the territory of the principality was declared to be a part of France by Louis XVI, although his ancestor, Antoine de Gramont, wasn't ousted until 1793).\nFrom 1890 to 1895, he was general councilor of the canton of Bidache.\nResidences\nThe main fa\u00e7ade of the Ch\u00e2teau de Valli\u00e8re, with the entrance facing northeast\nFor a period, he lived in Melun in Seine-et-Marne. In Paris, he lived in an apartment at 1 Rue Fran\u00e7ois-Ier in the 8th arrondissement. In 1887, he acquired a h\u00f4tel particulier in the 7th arrondissement of Paris at 17 Rue de Constantine, on the corner of Rue Saint-Dominique near the Prince of Sagan's H\u00f4tel de Monaco). He later had a h\u00f4tel particulier on the Rue de Chaillot (today known as the Rue Quentin-Bauchart) at the corner of Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es (now destroyed). In 1894, the Duke's h\u00f4tel in Paris was the site of Consuelo Vanderbilt's debut.\nAfter becoming Duke, he resided at the Ch\u00e2teau de Mang\u00e9, in Verneil-le-Ch\u00e9tif in Sarthe, bequeathed by his father-in-law, the Prince of Beauvau, to his granddaughter, \u00c9lisabeth.\nUpon marrying his second wife, who had inherited substantial property after the death of her father in 1886, the newly wealthy Duke decided to restore his family's former seat, the Ch\u00e2teau de Bidach. First, however, he bought the Ch\u00e2teau de Cr\u00e9nille in Chaumes-en-Brie in 1880, before having the Ch\u00e2teau de Valli\u00e8re built in Mortefontaine in 1894 in the Grand Parc of the former the Mortefontaine estate.\nPersonal life\nPortrait of his second wife, Baroness Marguerite, by Philip de L\u00e1szl\u00f3, 1902\nThe Duke was married three times during his lifetime. His first marriage, when he was styled Duke of Guiche, was on 20 April 1874 in Paris to Princess Isabelle Marie Blanche Charlotte Victurnienne de Beauvau-Craon (1852\u20131875), who reportedly gave up marrying the very rich Count de Gramont d'Aster to marry Ag\u00e9nor. Princess Isabelle was a daughter of Marc de Beauvau, 5th Prince of Beauvau (son of Charles Just de Beauvau, 4th Prince of Beauvau) and, his first wife, Marie d'Aubusson de La Feuillade. While married, they lived apart as the Duke was stationed in Melun and his Duchess lived with her parents in Nancy. She died of puerperal fever a few days after the birth of their only daughter:\nAntonia Corisande \u00c9lisabeth \"Lily\" de Gramont (1875\u20131954), a writer who married Philibert de Clermont-Tonnerre, 8th Duke of Clermont-Tonnerre, in 1896. They divorced in 1920.\nSecond marriage\nThe Duke remarried on 9 December 1878 in Paris to Marguerite, Countess de Liedekerke (n\u00e9e Baroness Marguerite de Rothschild) (1855\u20131905), a daughter of Louise von Rothschild and, her cousin, Baron Mayer Carl von Rothschild, founder of the \"Naples\" branch of the Rothschild Family. Marguerite had been disinherited by her father for converting to Catholicism to marry the Belgian Count de Liedekerke, a Catholic who died shortly thereafter in a hunting accident, but the disinheritance was annulled after her father's death in 1886. Before her death in 1905, they were the parents of three children:\nAntoine Ag\u00e9nor Armand de Gramont, 12th Duke",
    "Rediscovered composition by W. A. Mozart\nNot to be confused with Eine kleine Nachtmusik.\nGanz kleine Nachtmusik (German for Quite (or Very) Little Night Music), K. 648, also known as Serenade in C, is a composition for string trio by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756\u20131791), written in the mid to late 1760s. It was named by the Leipzig municipal libraries, where the piece's re-discovery was announced in September 2024.\nComposition\nThe piece itself is a string trio (for two violins and one cello) written while Mozart was a young teenager, and was apparently created prior to Mozart's first trip to Italy. It consists of \"seven miniature movements for a string trio lasting about 12 minutes\" according to the Leipzig libraries.\nRediscovery\nWhile compiling the K\u00f6chel catalogue's newest edition\u00a0\u2013 an authoritative list of all of Mozart's documented musical works\u00a0\u2013 classical music researchers rediscovered the manuscript of the previously unknown piece from the Carl Ferdinand Becker collection in Leipzig's music library. The researchers reported that the manuscript was in \"dark brown ink on medium-white handmade paper\" with individually bound parts. The manuscript was believed to not be an original manuscript written by Mozart, and was instead believed to be a copy produced in 1780.\nGerman musicologist Ulrich Leisinger, speaking for the International Mozarteum Foundation in Salzburg, stated that the piece was unique compared to other pieces produced by Mozart at the time, which were primarily arias, symphonies, and piano music.\nOn 19 September 2024, the rediscovered piece was first played for a modern audience at the Mozarteum in Salzburg, Austria, by Haruna Shinoyama and Ne\u017ea Klinar (violins), Philipp Comploi (cello) and Florian Birsak (harpsichord), with a further performance in Germany on 21 September by Vincent and David Geer (violins) and Elisabeth Zimmermann (cello) at the Leipzig Opera.\n",

    "The Septilici family (also spelled \u0218eptilici, \u0218aptelici, \u0218eptelici) was a boyar (noble) family from Bukovina, in the Principality of Moldavia. It played a significant political, military role in the history of Moldavia, especially in the medieval and early modern periods.\nOrigin\nThe origins of the \u0218eptilici family date back to the 15th century. The \u0218eptilici were included by Dimitrie Cantemir among the most important boyar (noble) families of Moldavia. The name of the family appears in internal documents as early as the 16th century, with reference to the reign of Petru Vod\u0103 Rare\u0219.\nThe \u0218eptilici family was mentioned in royal documents during the reign of Stephen the Great (1457\u20131504), when the family began to gain recognition and influence.\nAssasination of Voivode Gaspar Graziani\nGaspar Graziani\nOne of the most controversial events in which the noble family was involved was the assassination of ruler Gaspar Graziani (ruler of Moldavia between 1619 and 1620).\nAccording to historical accounts, members of the \u0218eptilici and Goia families conspired against Graziani because of his dangerous policies and authoritarian tendencies. They saw in his elimination a way to prevent a possible Ottoman invasion and restore order in the principality.\nHis death was a landmark event in Moldavian history, and the \u0218eptilici family apparently played a significant role in the plot that led to his murder.\nNotes\n",

    "\nCorruption in East Timor (Timor Leste) has been described as a critical and alarming problem because it has been institutionalized in the country. It undermines the governance of the nascent state, which only obtained its independence in 2002. Corruption affects East Timorese socio-economic development and public trust in government institutions.\nHistory\nThe history of corruption in East Timor dates back to its colonial past. It was also culturally institutionalized during the Indonesian occupation as a range of illegal business activities emerged such as the cases of coffee and sandalwood smuggling. It is claimed that corruption was primarily an Indonesian legacy as corruption in the country was considered a principle means of greasing the wheels of government and business. The customs agency during the first constitutional administration of East Timor by the Frente Revolucionario do Timor-Leste Independente was racked with allegations of corrupt practices. During the second colonial administration under the Alianca para a Maiora Parlamentar (AMP), corruption already spread into a range of ministries at the highest level.\nThe culture of corruption in East Timor is reinforced by the traditional cultural forms of patron-client relations. It involves an expectation from the powerful and the wealthy to look after the poor and the weak so that corrupt practices as well as illegal sources of money and resources are tolerated and overlooked.\nPost-independence\nCorruption persisted as a major issue in East Timor post-independence. President Jose Ramos-Horta, himself, acknowledged that corruption in East Timor is rampant, specifically citing cases in customs, procurement, public works, and rice distribution. Lack of transparency at the ministerial level of the government was also cited leading to corruption. This was demonstrated in the case of rice distribution corruption. Ramos-Horta identified less than 10 percent of civil servants are responsible for this scandal including the AMP Minister of Tourism, Commerce, and Industry, who acted in collusion with his extended family, for personal gains.\nThe administration of the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (FRETILIN), which covered 2002 to 2007, was also racked with numerous allegations and instances of corruption. This was highlighted in the controversial case in 2012 involving the Minister of Justice, Lucia Lobato, who served under Xanana Gusm\u00e3o\u2019s administration. She was found guilty of corruption and abuse of power after the minister was found to have manipulated public tenders and misappropriation of funds that were intended for prison construction projects.\nAnother notable scandal occurred in 2008. Allegations of corruption against the incumbent administration emerged after the leading FRETILIN opposition accused the minister of finance of doling out lucrative consultancies to underqualified friends. These include the government's purchase of questionable and heavily polluting power plants from China in a transaction that avoided mandatory environmental impact study. The government awarded a $300 million project to the Chinese Nuclear Industry Construction Company No. 22 (CNI22) for the construction of power and national energy facilities. The lack in transparency and poor procurement policies led to the inability of said company to meet contractual obligations and increased the costs of the project, which was further exacerbated by project delays.  In addition to issues of transparency, critics also blamed political considerations rather than economic efficiency as the reasons for governmental decisions on the project.\nThe development of East Timor's oil resources has also contributed to corruption in East Timor. This is demonstrated in the case of the Petroleum Fund, which was established in 2005 to manage the country's gas revenues. It initially posted early successes in terms of the Fund's capability to support the nascent state's economic stability. In 2007, oil and gas revenues from overseas investment allowed it to shoulder 87 percent of state expenditures, paying for a wide range of services, infrastructure, and other government projects. Later, however, allegations of corruption and mismanagement emerged.  By 2013, international observers had confirmed this. According to Transparency International:\nWhile the growth in oil revenues has allowed the government to invest in much-needed infrastructure and human development initiatives, it has also created new opportunities for corruption and administrative \u2018malpractice\u2019, as reflected in the increasing number of high-level corruption cases being brought to court.\nCritics also cited the Fund's involvement in the Greater Sunrise project, which attempted to develop gas reserves on East Timor's southern coast. It was noted that the Fund heavily invested in the project despite high risk and uncertain returns as indicated by a study conducted by Woodside Petroleum. As a result of the politically mo",
    "Lord Shiva Stotram by Rishi Asita\nSee also: Rishi Asita\nAsitakrutam Shivastotram (Sanskrit: \u0905\u0938\u093f\u0924\u0915\u0943\u0924\u0902 \u0936\u093f\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094b\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092e\u094d) is a Sanskrit stotra composed by the Vedic sage Asita in the devotion of Lord Shiva.\nDescription\nIn Brahmavaivart Purana,  the  Vedic sage Asita composed a stotra devoted to Lord Shiva. This stotra is known as Asitakrutam Shivastotram. It is Sanskrit hymns for the salutations to Lord Shiva.\nThere are nine verses in the Asitakrutam Shivastotram. In the first verse, sage Asita has praised Lord Shiva as the great teacher. He has prayed to Lord Shiva by pronouncing his name Jagadguru and Yogendra. In the second verse of the stotra Lord Shiva has been praised as the destroyer of the universe and the God of Death. In the third verse Lord Shiva is praised in the form of Kalrupam (Time God) and the supreme god of time. He is also saluted as timeless for time. In the fourth verse, Lord Shiva is praised as the God of virtues and qualities. He is described as the seed of qualities and the teacher of all the quality person. In the fifth verse, Lord Shiva is praised in the form of absolute truth Brahman, the knower of Brahman and the seed of Vedas. In the sixth verse, after praising and paying obeisance to Lord Shiva, he stood in front of him and started shedding dew from his eyes like a poor person.  His entire body was feeling excitement.\nIn the verses from 7th to 9th, the fruitfulness of chanting the stotram is explained. In the seventh and  eighth verses, it is mentioned that whoever do the chanting of the Asitakrutam Shivastotram daily for one year continuously is blessed by a wise, Chiranjeevi and Vaishnava son. Similarly who is touchered  by wealthy, becomes self a wealthy and who is dumb, becomes wise Pandit. In the last verse, the fruitfulness for a wifeless man is told. According to the verse, the wifeless man gets a virtuous and faithful wife and after enjoying happiness in this world, he finally attains the company of Lord Shiva.\n",
    "The Holzgerlingen figure.\nThe Holzgerlingen figure is a two-faced anthropomorphic statue of the early to middle La T\u00e8ne culture. The statue depicts a human figure from the belt up, each side carved with a mirror image of the other, wearing a horn-like headdress which is probably an example of the Celtic leaf-crown motif. The figure is thought to be a Celtic cult object, perhaps representing a god, though it is less often identified as a funerary monument. Over 2 metres tall, the Holzgerlingen figure is the largest known Iron Age statue. The statue is presently at the Landesmuseum W\u00fcrttemberg.\nDiscovery\nThe circumstances under which the Holzgerlingen figure was found are very uncertain. The stone was apparently excavated from a spot near the municipality of Holzgerlingen, but the exact site of its discovery is not now known.:\u200a279\u200a It was found either in 1838 or 1848. It is now in the collection of the Landesmuseum W\u00fcrttemberg.:\u200afn 82\u200a\nDescription\nDrawing of the front and side of the Holzgerlingen figure's head, showing the original damage to its crown.\nThe figure is carved from sandstone local to Holzgerlingen. It measures 230cm by 32cm by 21cm.:\u200a279\u200a\nAll four sides of the stone are carved, but only the upper half of the figure's features have been rendered, beginning at the belt (although the base has a rebate carefully carved into it). Two arms, hanging from the figure's square shoulders, symmetrically wrap around the figure. On both of the broad sides, the right forearm is visible, bent horizontally over its chest. Its hand rests on the right of the figure's torso. The thumb of each hand is slightly raised. On opposite sides, identical faces are carved into the stone (hence the metonymic reference to the figure as \"Janus-faced\"). One side's face has suffered much worse damage than the other. The heavy eyebrows and trapezoid nose are connected in a T-shape; the eyebrows cast a deep shadow over where the eyes should be. The figure's mouth is represented by a deep, horizontal slash in the rock. The twin horns of the figure have been identified with a Celtic leaf-crown, a common La T\u00e8ne motif. Unusually, in this figure, the leaf-crown appears to grow out of the shoulders. This crown was badly damaged when found and has since been restored.:\u200a281\u200a:\u200a206\u2013208\u200a\nDating and interpretation\nThe Holzgerlingen figure besides the Glauberg prince in the Bern Historical Museum.\nOriginally, the date of the statue was entirely uncertain. The figure was even identified as early medieval or Slavic.:\u200a16\u200a Deeper understanding of Celtic sculpture in the 20th century allowed motifs, like the figure's leaf-crown, to confidently classify this figure within the La T\u00e8ne culture.:\u200a16\u200a However, it's dating within that culture is still insecure.:\u200a279\u200a J. V. S. Megaw calls it the \"most archaic in aspect\" of the La T\u00e8ne sculptures known, citing such features as the T-shaped eyebrows and nose. He classifies it within the very early La T\u00e8ne culture and assigns it a date between the 5th and 6th centuries BC. Paul Jacobsthal also classifies it within the early La T\u00e8ne, though not as early as Megaw.:\u200a279\u200a However, some, such as Pieter Lambrechts, have classified it within the middle La T\u00e8ne culture on the basis of stylistic similarities with contemporaneous southern French and Spanish sculptures. Such scholarship dates the stone to after the 3rd century BC. Archaeologist Josef R\u00f6der has noted marks of both pointed and flat chisels on the stone, which he claims was not possible before the Hellenistic period (that is, before the 4th century BC).:\u200a279\u200a\nAs stylistic analogues of the Holzgerlingen figure within the La T\u00e8ne culture, the Hirschlanden warrior, Glauberg prince, and the Waldenbuch pillar have been especially cited. The relief arm of the Hirschlanden warrior is carved in a similar position, bent with a raised thumb.:\u200a378\u200a The Glauberg prince is similarly tall and wears a leaf-crown. The Waldenbuch pillar, found about 10km from the Holzgerlingen figure, is probably a bust figure like the Holzgerlingen figure but only survives as far up as a slender arm reaching around itself.:\u200a281\u2013284\u200a The Janus head of the Holzgerlingen figure is an unusual feature. Most Iron Age statuary was intended to be viewed from only one direction. The Janus head has been assumed to represent Etruscan influence on the design.:\u200a269\u200a Another unusual feature is its height. At 2.3m, the Holzgerlingen figure has been identified as the largest known Iron Age statue.:\u200a279\u200a\nThe statue is often suggested to have been a cult image, perhaps featuring in a Celtic shrine (akin to that found at \u00c9cury-le-Repos).:\u200a145\u200a:\u200a18\u201319\u200a Kurt Bittel suggested that the figure represents a deity, its Janus face a symbol of power and omniscience.:\u200a273\u200a However, it has also been suggested that the stone crowned an Iron Age burial mound, as the Hirschlanden warrior once did.:\u200a145\u200a:\u200a375\u200a\nNotes\n",

    "Television station in Para\u00edba, Brazil\nTV Borborema (channel 8) is a Brazilian television station based in Campina Grande, Para\u00edba. serving as an affiliate of the  SBT television network. It was founded in 1966, being the first television station in the state, and is owned-and-operated by the Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1-based Sistema Opini\u00e3o de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o. Its studios are in the Jo\u00e3o Rique Building, in the city center, and its transmitter tower is at the top of the building.\nHistory\nCampina Grande was the first city in Para\u00edba and in the interior of a state in the Northeast to have a television station, unlike other northeastern states, in which the first stations were installed in the capitals. Jo\u00e3o Pessoa would only have a local station in 1986. TV Borborema was one of the first broadcasters in the North/Northeast. Before, in 1960, TV Itapoan, in Salvador, Bahia, and TV Jornal do Commercio and TV R\u00e1dio Clube de Pernambuco in Recife, had already been opened.\nAccording to historical accounts, Assis Chateaubriand ordered the inauguration of a TV in Campina Grande in 1961. The city was one of the main places for Di\u00e1rios Associados in the Northeast. There are records that R\u00e1dio Borborema at the time had enviable revenue, to the point of supporting the Clube de Pernambuco and Tamandar\u00e9 radio stations, both installed in Recife, capital of Pernambuco.\nTV Borborema entered its experimental phase on September 15, 1963,when it produced its first programs. The associated station was officially opened on March 14, 1966.\nThe station was part of Rede Tupi until July 18, 1980, when it was shut down, but its license was not revoked due to the broadcaster being financially healthy at the time, and due to political alignments, which allowed the broadcaster to remain in the air and later, install repeaters in the interior of Para\u00edba. For a short period, it began broadcasting content from TV Record and TVS Rio de Janeiro, where the remaining Tupi affiliates were housed. Then, on September 8, it joined Rede Globo, remaining with the network until December 31, 1986, when TV Para\u00edba went on air. On January 1, 1987, it became an affiliate of Rede Manchete. In 1989, he switched from Rede Manchete to SBT, where it remains today.\nOn January 16, 2015, the broadcaster had 57.5% of its shares sold by Di\u00e1rios Associados to Sistema Opini\u00e3o de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o, owned by C\u00e2ndido Pinheiro, and who also owned part of the shares in TV Ponta Negra and TV Ponta Verde. The sale was approved by CADE on January 19, through a note published in the Official Gazette of the Union. In 2019, the Opini\u00e3o Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o System started to hold 100% of the shares.\nOn March 14, 2016, the date on which the station celebrated its 50th anniversary, TV Borborema renewed its programming, with the debut of new scenarios and new programs, as well as a new graphics package. A solemn session was also held at the Municipal Chamber of Campina Grande, where the Medal of Honor for Municipal Merit was awarded to the broadcaster, for 50 years of services provided, and the title of citizen of Campina Grande to the president of the Sistema Opini\u00e3o de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o, C\u00e2ndido Pinheiro J\u00fanior.\nIn November 2016, the station debuted the local version of the program Tudo De Bom, present for 8 years in Natal on TV Ponta Negra and for 2 years in Macei\u00f3 on TV Ponta Verde.\nTechnical information\nThe station began its digital transmissions on an experimental basis on March 9, 2016, on UHF channel 30 in Campina Grande and nearby areas, and on March 14, date of the station's 50th anniversary, the digital signal was officially launched.

    "Public transit payment system in Belgium\nMOBIB, also written as MoBIB, is a contactless smart card used as an integrated ticketing system for 'travel products' of most public transport in the Belgium. First introduced by Brussels' MIVB in 2008, it has since has expanded to include the public transport operators NMBS, De Lijn, and TEC. Each operator issues a MOBIB card with a unique design, but it can be used with all four operators. Transport tickets are usually specific to each operator, though some subscriptions, such as 'Brupass' and 'Brupass XL', are valid across multiple operators.\nThe card contains a near-field communication (NFC) tag and is compatible with the ISO 7816 contact interface. It can store up to eight tickets, including single trips, multi-trip passes, and subscriptions. Additionally, bicycle-sharing (like Villo! and Blue-Bike), car-sharing (such as Cambio), and station parking subscriptions can also be loaded onto the card.\nUnlike the Dutch OV-chipkaart, the MOBIB card is not a stored-value card and therefore does not support loading a monetary balance. For all journeys, a pre-purchased ticket, specific to the trip, must be loaded onto the card.\nThe card can be held a few centimeters away from the reader and uses the Calypso standard, similar to the French Navigo card. With an NFC-enabled smartphone and the MOBIB app, users can check the card's contents. This can also be done via the info button on validation devices, at ticket machines, or at service counters.\n",

    "\nSouthampton F.C. 1987\u201388 football season\nThe 1987\u201388 Southampton F.C. season was the club's 87th season of competitive football and their 18th in the First Division of the Football League. The season was a difficult one for the Saints, who finished in the same league position as the previous campaign (12th), and were eliminated from all other tournaments in the early stages \u2013 they only progressed to the fourth round of the FA Cup, and were eliminated from both the League Cup and the Full Members' Cup at the first hurdle.\nSouthampton had a busy summer transfer window in 1987. Leaving the club were several first-team starters, including two-time Player of the Season winner Peter Shilton, 15-year veteran Nick Holmes and key centre-back Mark Wright. Additions to the squad included returning midfielder Graham Baker, new first-choice goalkeeper John Burridge and left-back Derek Statham. The team struggled in the First Division throughout the campaign, picking up only a few wins now and then to ensure they kept clear of the relegation zone. 1987\u201388 was Southampton's last season with chairman Alan Woodford, who died in February 1988; he was succeeded by Guy Askham.\nOutside the league, Southampton had a disappointing season. In the FA Cup, the club edged past Second Division strugglers Reading in the third round, before suffering elimination at the hands of top-flight rivals Luton Town in the fourth. In the League Cup, the Saints were knocked out by local Second Division side Bournemouth; and in the Full Members' Cup, they faced elimination in their opening second round match against Bradford City, another second-tier club. The 1987\u201388 season included the first league matches between Southampton and Portsmouth since 1976, with a 2\u20132 draw at Fratton Park followed by a Pompey away win later in the season.\nSouthampton used 20 players during the 1987\u201388 season and had 14 different goalscorers. Their top scorer was again Colin Clarke, who scored 16 times in the league and once in the FA Cup. Danny Wallace was second on seven goals. Clarke also made the most appearances (44), followed by Derek Statham and Glenn Cockerill on 43 each \u2013 Statham won the club's Player of the Season award at the end of the year. The average league attendance at The Dell during the campaign was 14,532. The highest attendance was 21,214 in the opening day tie against Manchester United and the lowest was 11,890 in a 3\u20130 win over Chelsea on 24 October 1987.\nBackground and transfers\nStriker Kevin Phillips signed as a youth player in 1987. He would later leave before making a first team appearance, but returned in 2003 for two years.\nSaints sold key centre-back Mark Wright to Derby County for \u00a3750,000 in the summer of 1987, after a five-year tenure.\nDuring the 1987 close season, Southampton faced a number of changes amidst rumours of \"dressing room unrest\" sparked by the public dismissal of Mark Dennis late the previous season. Following the departure of third-choice goalkeeper Phil Kite in May, who made his loan move to Third Division outfit Gillingham permanent, the Saints also lost first-choice goalkeeper and two-time Player of the Season award winner Peter Shilton, who left for Derby County following their promotion to the top flight as Second Division champions. Also released in the summer were David Armstrong, who had been a mainstay for the team for six years, but moved on a free transfer to Bournemouth for their first season in the Second Division; Jon Gittens, who had struggled to break into the Saints first team and moved on a free transfer to Swindon Town, another new arrival in the second flight; and George Lawrence, who ended his second spell at The Dell to join Millwall a division below for a fee of \u00a3160,000.\nTo replace the outgoing players, Chris Nicholl's Saints made a number of signings ahead of the 1987\u201388 campaign. First to arrive was midfielder Graham Baker, who had previously played for the South Coast side between 1977 and 1982, before spending five years with Manchester City. In July, centre-back Kevin Moore made the step up from Second Division side Oldham Athletic in a deal worth \u00a3150,000, and in August the club signed goalkeeper John Burridge from Sheffield United and left-back Derek Statham from West Bromwich Albion. The same month, centre-back Mark Wright was sold to Derby County for \u00a3750,000. Also signed in the summer were two youth players \u2013 Nicky Banger and Jeff Kenna \u2013 with striker Kevin Phillips added in October. Also in October, Saints veteran Nick Holmes left the club for a year with East Cowes Victoria Athletic, although he would later return as reserve team manager. Keith Granger moved to Darlington in March 1988, after a short emergency loan spell with the Fourth Division side.\nPlayers transferred out\nPlayers transferred out\nPlayers loaned out\nNotes\n",

Roosevelt reflected on the previous year's key military developments, celebrated the bravery of American and Allied forces, and outlined the challenges and strategies for the ongoing global conflict. He also discussed the broader goals of the war, including securing freedom and peace for all nations.\nRoosevelt began by honoring the valor of American forces who had fought in the war's first major battles, such as Wake Island, Bataan, and Midway. He praised their \"unconquerable spirit\" and noted the growing strength of the Allied forces against the Axis powers. He highlighted the importance of the Battle of Stalingrad and the Soviet counteroffensives, which he described as the most significant military developments of 1942.\nRoosevelt emphasized that the Axis powers had failed to win the war in 1942, marking a turning point in favor of the Allied forces. He reviewed strategic successes, such as the Allied landings in North Africa and the defense of the Pacific. He also acknowledged the sacrifices made by American forces during defensive campaigns in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea.\nOn the economic front, Roosevelt praised America's rapidly expanding war production, noting that in 1942, the United States had produced 48,000 military planes, surpassing the combined production of Germany, Italy, and Japan. He outlined ambitious production goals for 1943, including increases in aircraft, tanks, and other war materiel.\nRoosevelt also discussed the Four Freedoms, reiterating that the United States was fighting for freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. He stressed that the nation must not only win the war but also secure a lasting peace that ensured these freedoms for all people.\nThe president concluded by calling for unity on the home front, acknowledging the inconveniences and sacrifices Americans would face as the war effort intensified.

    "Method of preparing and drinking tea\nDian cha (Chinese: \u9ede\u8336), is a method of preparing and drinking tea in Sinosphere includes China, Japan, and Vietnam. It later evolved into the Japanese tea ceremony using matcha.\nThis art originated in China. It was popular in China during the Song dynasty and was one of the \"Four Arts\" of the Song dynasty. In Vietnam, dian cha (Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t: \u0111i\u1ec3m tr\u00e0) was probably popular during the Tr\u1ea7n and L\u00ea dynasties.

Today, the art of dian cha in which using matcha is still popular and preserved in Japan. This is the main art used in Japanese tea ceremony.\nMethod\nDian cha in the picture \u64b5\u8336\u56fe\u8f74 in Song dynasty\nThe original matcha in Song era was often made in the form of tea bricks or cakes. The tea cakes were made of matcha pressed into bricks. In the Song era, serving the tea from tea bricks or cakes required the following steps:\nWater was boiled in a porcelain ewer (pitcher).\nToasting: Tea bricks are usually first toasted over a fire to destroy any mould or insects that may have burrowed into the bricks during storage.\nGrinding: The tea brick was crushed and ground with a tea grind tools includes mill or nian (Chinese: \u78be) to a fine powder which was placed in a bowl called chawan.\nWhisking: The powdered tea was mixed with hot water and beaten with a bamboo whisk called Chaxian (\u8336\u7b45) or in Japan called Chasen before serving.\nTea utensils\nJapanese chasen (\u8336\u7b45)\nTwo important tools in dian cha are:\nChawan (Chinese: \u8336\u7897): East Asia tea bowl\nChasen (Chinese: \u8336\u7b45): a bamboo whisk\nTea grind tool (Chinese: \u78be - \"ni\u1ec3n\") in Tang dynasty, Famen  (\u6cd5\u95e8\u5bfa)\nThe full tools set for preparing tea according to Lu Yu (733 - 804) the author of \"The Classic of Tea\" in Tang dynasty includes 24 tools.\nDian cha in the countries\nChina\nDian cha in \"Eighteen Scholars\" (\u5341\u516b\u5b78\u58eb\u5716\u5377) of the Tang, re-drawed in Huizong of Song era.\nDian cha was one of the two popular methods of making tea during the Song dynasty. Drinking tea was also one of the important elegant pleasures, forming a typical lifestyle for literati and scholars.\nSong dynasty matcha was made into tea cakes. Before drinking, it would need to be ground and sifted into a fine powder. It was also necessary to warm the cup before brewing the tea, otherwise the matcha would not float easily.\nThe froth, colour and patterns formed by the whisked tea were aesthetically important for the elites and whisking was considered a gentleman's skill. The whisked frothy teas led to the rise in popularity of dark patterned bowls in which the texture of the thick whisked tea could be more easily judged, as the white froth contrasted more easily with dark bowls.\nThe best of these bowls were the Jian ware made in the Jianzhou kilns, glazed in patterns with names like oil spot, partridge feather, hare's fur, and tortoise shell. These styles are still highly valued today. The patterned holding bowl and tea mixture were often lauded in the period's poetry, with phrases such as \"partridge in swirling clouds\" or \"snow on Hare's fur.\" A popular pastime was to create use various implements like spoons to create art on the tea froth which would depict things like birds, fish, flowers and plants.\nJapan\nJapanese tea ceremony uses the Dian cha method with matcha as the ingredient. This method was introduced from China during the Tang and Song dynasties. Today, tea pointing is still preserved and developed in Japan, making matcha famous worldwide.\nVietnam\nIn Vietnam, dian cha method was popular during the Tr\u1ea7n and Initial L\u00ea dynasties, alongside the practice of boiled tea method. The tea-lighting method was recorded in \"Qu\u1ea7n th\u01b0 tham kh\u1ea3o\" and \"B\u1ecb kh\u1ea3o l\u1ee5c\" (\u5099\u8003\u9304) written by Ph\u1ea1m \u0110\u00ecnh H\u1ed5 (\u8303\u5ef7\u7425, 1768 - 1839).

    "Marietta Thomas Webb (1864\u20131951) was a Christian healer. She was one of the first Black Americans listed in The Christian Science Journal as a practitioner of healing through prayer, and the only Black American to have a personal healing testimony selected to appear in Mary Baker Eddy's seminal book Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures.\nBiography\nWebb was born in Petersburg, Virginia in 1864 to Randall and Georgiana Jones, a little over a year after Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. She was one of five children, made up of three sons and two daughters. In 1869 the family relocated to Boston, where Webb received a substantial secondary education. In 1892 she married an engineer named Hiram Webb. They had one child together, Hiram Orlando, who they called \"Orlando.\"\nThe Mother Church\nBy age four, Orlando suffered from a host of physical maladies, the most serious of which was rickets, a disease that softens and weakens bones in children. Constantly hovering between life and death, physicians pronounced him incurable, and said that if he survived he would be an invalid. In early 1897, Webb was invited by a friend to a Wednesday evening testimony meeting at a nearby church called Church of Christ, Scientist, also known as The Mother Church. As Webb wrote nine years later in the Christian Science Journal, after attending the meeting she felt that she had found \"the religion for which I had been searching for years.\"\nHealing of Orlando\nWebb sought healing help from a Christian Science practitioner, and borrowed a copy of Science and Health from her friend. As she began reading, she noticed Orlando getting better, and within a week he was able to get up and play. As she read on, she said his limbs grew straighter and stronger until in less than a month he had fully recovered. Orlando would end up living a natural, healthy life until 1979, when he died at age 87. After her son's recovery Webb said she found Christian Science to be \"the only salvation of my race.\" In 1907 Mary Baker Eddy put Webb's testimony of Orlando's healing in the final chapter of her book, where it remains today.\nChristian Science Practitioner\nWebb joined the Church of Christ, Scientist in 1899. That same year she wrote her first article in The Christian Science Sentinel, called \u201cThe Protecting Power of Truth\u201d, about her allegiance to the \"Science of Christianity\", and the \"prejudice which exists throughout the United States.\" She later wrote that she found Christian Science the basis for \u201cgetting out of the old prejudiced self and into the spiritual sense of man\u2019s union with God,\u201d and saying that according to Mary Baker Eddy and Science and Health, she was a \"child of God, not a colored child of God.\"\nIn 1900, Webb relocated her family to Los Angeles, California. In 1911, at the age of 47, she became one of the first African Americans to be a journal-listed practitioner of Christian Science.\nInfluence on the Black American Christian Science Community\nIn 1934, Webb became a founding member of a Christian Science congregation in East Los Angeles made up of almost entirely Black Americans. The press called her a \"world known church worker,\" and in 1950, a year before her death, she was the subject of an article in Ebony Magazine featuring Black American Christian Scientists whose numbers had \"burgeoned.\" The photograph the magazine used for the feature shows Webb reading the Bible without glasses, confirming a healing of vision troubles she had written about in her 1906 Journal testimony.\nWebb's ardent participation in the Christian Science movement influenced a host of Black American adherents in the music world in the early to mid-20th century, most notably actor and singer Pearl Bailey, Jazz percussionist Lionel Hampton, violinist and conductor Everett Lee, musician Cornelius Bumpus, and singer and composer Blanche Calloway.\nAcademy award-nominated actor Alfre Woodard has been public about her practice of the religion for years.\n",

    "In July 2009, Ethiopia passed Anti-Terrorism Legislation to counter insurgencies and terror acts. The legislation is heavily criticized by opponents who argued the legislation is a cornerstone for government to initiate crackdowns and jailing opposition leaders and dissents. Proponents defended that the law combats terrorist acts in the country in accordance with the  United Nations Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). The Ethiopian government often used to justify political repressions by limiting freedom of expression wherein many journalists and critics jailed for many years. In addition, the EPRDF regime used to dismantle propaganda against certain political parties such as the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), which was designated as terrorist group until 2018.\nAn act of terrorism is manifested through the armed rebellion of Al-Shabaab since War in Somalia. Al-Shebaab has been fighting the Ethiopian security forces since the late 2000s. Al-Shabaab made major incursion to the Ethiopia's Somali Region in July 2022 which killed 17 people including three civilians and Ethiopian police officers inside Somali territory and 63 of its fighters.\nDomestic terrorism\nIn July 2009, Ethiopia passed anti-terrorism law which has been subjected to criticism and accusations.

Opponents argued the implementation would bring an opportunity for government to initiate crackdowns and jailing opposition leaders and dissents.  It has raised a concern of justifying an oppression through limiting freedom of expression and press. Fetah weekly newspaper editors Woubshet Taye, Reyot Alemu, Zerihun Gebre-Egzabher was arrested by Addis Ababa Police in June 2011 for alleged terrorist act. Following their arrest, police searched their homes, documents and equipment were reportedly confiscated, including copies of their respective newspapers. On 2 January 2020, lawmakers adopted the Anti-Terror Legislation as human rights groups called it ineffective reform from the previous one. Amnesty International highlighted that the new law failed to protect government critics from crackdown.\nIn 2011, the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) was designated as terrorist group by the former EPRDF government.  Following Abiy Ahmed's premiership, the Ethiopian parliament delisted OLF, alongside ONLF and Ginbot 7 from terrorist organization database on 5 July 2018. A ceasefire agreement took place on 7 August 2018 between the government and OLF leaders in Asmara, leading up to the formation of Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), an armed resistance movement that dissatisfied by the signatory term of disarming its members. In August 2020, the OLA announced that they forged alliance with TPLF \u2013 which opposed the central government at that time \u2013 fought the Tigray War. OLA has been designated as a terrorist group in May 2021 by the Parliament following the war.\nWar in Somalia\nIn December 2006, Ethiopia invaded Somalia to oust the Islamic Courts Union (ICU). An armed engagement occurred as a result of Ethiopian military occupation between the Islamic militant groups and the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) peacekeepers in the next two years, leading to the formation of Al-Shabaab, serving as the wing of ICU. Hence, when most members of ICU fled to neighboring countries, the militant began retreating to south, organizing guerilla tactics, bombing and assassinating the Ethiopian forces.\nAl-Shabaab invaded the Somali Region of Ethiopia on 20 July 2022 during the Tigray War as the militant taking advantage from the war in order to establish its province in southern Ethiopia. it raided to Yeed and Aato villages in Somalia's Bakool region, killing 17 people including three civilians and Ethiopian police officers inside Somali territory while 63 of its fighters were killed.

The program is specifically designed to equip women in the agriculture value chain with the essential skills and knowledge needed to thrive. Participants of the Ignite Fellowship benefit from expert-led training, access to valuable networks, and practical insights into the industry. In 2023, the 7th cohort of the Ignite Fellowship took place within ten days of physical training, where 105 accomplished women from 15 countries graduated out of the 128 who commenced the program, representing 21 African countries. In addition to Ignite, Nana has initiated several impactful programs, including the Africa Women in Agribusiness Awards, the Women in Agribusiness Week, She Farms, and the Women in Food and Agriculture Industry. Each of these initiatives has shaped the lives of many women in Africa, inspiring them to contribute positively to their communities and fostering a culture of excellence and empowerment.\nSocial impact\nNana dreams to make farming attractive to the young women. In 2017, Nana promoted youth involvement in agriculture through her Ghanaian incubator, branding the sector as \"agribusiness.\" She called for political support and market access, highlighting the need for greater opportunities for women. Her efforts aligned with initiatives by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and the G20 to boost rural economies and attract young people to agriculture. In 2017, Nana was in a group that presented The Berlin Charter: Putting rural development on the G20 agenda at the G20 meeting in Berlin.\nIn 2023, Nana, through Guzakuza, raised concerns about the gender imbalance in Ghana's Farmers Day awards, noting that only one woman had won the top prize in the past 20 years. She advocated for addressing this disparity with targeted solutions to support women in agribusiness and ensure equal recognition. Her efforts aim to highlight the contributions of women and promote gender equality in agriculture.\nPublic Speaking and Advocacy\nNana was invited to speak on the G20 panel with the likes of Muhammad Yunus. She has been speaking on panels such as the EU-AU panel, African Union events, Malabo Montpeilla Panel and continues to advocate for women's rights in agri",
    "1997 hammer killing of a 73-year-old man in Oklahoma.\nOn March 6, 1997, seven days before his 74th birthday, Albert Troy Hale (March 13, 1923 \u2013 March 6, 1997) was attacked and murdered by a friend in his house at Oklahoma City over Hale's refusal to give his friend money to buy cocaine. The killer, James Allen Coddington (March 22, 1972 \u2013 August 25, 2022), was charged and convicted of the murder, and sentenced to death in 2003. After exhausting all his appeals (which ended in failure) and losing his clemency plea, Coddington, whose death sentence was overturned in 2006 before it was restored in 2008, was executed via lethal injection on August 25, 2022.\nMurder\nOn March 6, 1997, a 73-year-old man was attacked and killed by his friend inside his home at Oklahoma City.\nOn the day in question, Albert Troy Hale, whose 74th birthday was one week away, was accompanied by his 24-year-old friend and co-worker James Allen Coddington, who had a history of cocaine abuse, and both Hale and Coddington, who had a close friendship, were in the living room watching television when Coddington asked to borrow money from Hale to buy drugs. Earlier on that day, Coddington had robbed a convenience store to get money to buy drugs, but he did not have enough money to get enough cocaine to feed his drug addiction, which returned a few days before due to a relapse.\nReportedly, Hale refused to lend Coddington money, and advised him to not continue consuming drugs. Coddington was said to have been angered by the rejection, and just when he was about to leave, Coddington grabbed a claw hammer and wielded it at Hale, battering the elderly man to death by inflicting three to four blows to the head.\nAfter the act was done, Coddington stole a sum of US$520 from Hale's home and fled the scene; the body of Hale was later discovered by one of his sons. Coddington would later go on to rob at least six separate gas stations and convenience stores before he was finally arrested for the killing of Hale.\nTrial of James Coddington\nBackground\nBorn on March 22, 1972, James Allen Coddington came from a family of nine children, and when he was a toddler, Coddington's mother went to prison for an unspecified offence for nearly the first eight years of Coddington's life. Coddington's father, who took care of Coddington during his wife's incarceration, was reportedly an alcoholic who often put alcohol inside the baby bottles of Coddington, and he also severely abused Coddington, beating him and sometimes drawing blood. Coddington's father would often spend the money received from welfare assistance on alcohol, forcing Coddington and his siblings to live off scraps from the dumpster outside fast food restaurants. Eventually, Coddington's father abandoned him when he was seven, and Coddington, who was placed under foster care, gradually went astray and get addicted to drugs from a young age.\nBefore his involvement in the murder, Coddington has five other felony convictions from 1990 and 1991 on charges of burglary and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.\nConviction and sentence\nA day after he murdered Albert Hale, on March 7, 1997, James Coddington was arrested for the murder of Albert Hale, and charged for the crime.\nSix years after his arrest, on April 24, 2003, Coddington stood trial for the murder of Albert Hale. Prior to his 2003 trial for murder, Coddington was first tried and convicted of six separate robbery cases, and sentenced to six consecutive life sentences on November 26, 1997.\nOn April 29, 2003, Coddington was found guilty of murder in the first degree by an Oklahoma County jury.\nOn May 2, 2003, the same jury recommended the death penalty for Coddington, who was formally sentenced to death in a subsequent formal court session.\nRe-sentencing bid and appeals\nOn August 16, 2006, James Coddington's appeal was granted by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, which ordered Coddington's death sentence to be set aside and sent the case back to the lower courts for re-sentencing, after they found that the videotaped testimony of Coddington's mother Gayla Hood should have been admitted during the trial and the exclusion of this crucial evidence hindered the jury from making due consideration to decide on his sentence, and was constitutionally unfair for Coddington.\nA re-sentencing trial by jury was conducted two years later before a different jury in an Oklahoma County courtroom. After hearing all the evidence, on June 16, 2008, the jury of seven men and five women deliberated for more than four hours before they returned with their verdict, once again recommending the death penalty for Coddington, a decision which Hale's son Mitch described as a sign of justice for his late father.\nOn July 2, 2008, Coddington was re-sentenced to death during a formal court hearing, in which he apologized to the Hale family once again and sought forgiveness for murdering Hale back in 1997. Hale's grandson and son declined to come to court, but Hale's daughter and son",

It is the second book in the planned Magic of the Lost trilogy, following Clark's 2021 novel The Unbroken. The novels follows the characters in the aftermath of a rebellion from the first novel, as they grapple with independence and their new political realities.\nPlot\nTouraine and Aranen go to Balladaire to meet with Luca and pursue diplomacy as official ambassadors of an independent Qaz\u0101l. A young girl named Ghadin is sent as Touraine's page.\nDuke Nicholas Ancier plans to hold a Trial of Competence, legally usurping the throne from Luca. Luca's friend Bastien has been helping her research the lost Balladairan religion. Luca finds Bastien murdered outside the palace. Luca and her friend Sabine du Durfort suspect that Nicholas is behind Bastien's death.\nNicholas offers Touraine a new contract which acknowledges Qaz\u0101li independence, but gives harsh terms and continues to extract tribute. If Touraine refuses to sign it, he threatens a reconquest of the former colony. Luca learns that Balladaire's lost magic required child sacrifice to ensure good crops. She is unsure if she should continue to research the religion if the price is so high.\nLuca's carriage is attacked. Ghadin is separated from Luca and Touraine. Ghadin meets Fili, a carpenter's apprentice and member of the Fingers. The Fingers are a revolutionary group who want to overthrow the Balladairan monarchy. Fili has access to Balladairan magic; she can make plants grow at the cost of her own blood. Fili helps treat Ghadin's injuries and returns her to the palace guards. However, Ghadin is given to Duke Nicholas as a prisoner.\nNicholas breaks Ghadin's arm and threatens to torture her. Touraine agrees to sign his modified treaty. Luca goes to Nicholas and agrees to abdicate in exchange for becoming minister of Sh\u0101lan affairs and also for Ghadin's safety. Luca secretly plots to poison Nicholas with Touraine and Sabine.\nGhadin tells Touraine about Fili and the Fingers. Luca publicly announces her abdication. Fili stabs Luca multiple times. Touraine is able to access Sh\u0101l's magic to heal her.\nNicholas's young son Tiro drinks the poison and dies instead of Nicholas. Luca's guards arrest Nicholas as part of a coup. Luca is crowned queen of Balladaire. She proposes to Touraine, who accepts. Luca's reign immediately faces dual threats: the return of a plague known as the Withering, and an uprising in the city of Samra\u2019.\nReception\nAlana Joli Abbott of Paste praised the characterization of both the major and minor characters in the novel, writing that \"each of these characters is their own universe, with struggles and decisions to weigh, and ethical dilemmas that make them choose, with their actions, who they will be on the next page.\" Abbott felt that The Faithless surpassed the expectations set by the first novel. Martin Cahill praised both the plotting and characterization, stating that \"Clark employs an expert level of finesse in the machinations of each of these complicated, complex women.\" In a review for Locus, Leslye Penelope writes that \"Clark wields a deft hand, painting characters who are nuanced, scarred inside and out, and deeply human.\" Penelope wrote that \"fans of romantic fantasy will yearn for more fireworks in the chemistry between Touraine and Luca\", but overall praised the complicated romance between the two characters.\nBrigid Flanagan of Grimdark Magazine gave the novel four stars, praising the \"brutal intensity\" of Clark's prose and writing that \"The Faithless intentionally shows with great intensity the actions of colonizers in a narrative that neither forgives, softens, or redeems.\" Flanagan criticized the inclusion of Fili's chapters and the meandering subplots, feeling that The Faithless was inferior to its prequel.\n",

The party stands on a hard anti-establishment and anti-corruption platform, promising to fight organised crime and restore the rule of law in the country. It also advocates for traditional family values, while opposing the LGBT community, a eurosceptic approach to Bulgaria's membership in the European Union, and a neutral stance towards the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nHistory\nBackground and foundation\nMorale, Unity, Honour was officially registered as a political party on 9 February 2024, after its founder, Radostin Vasilev, launched its platform in the fall of 2023. Vasilev, formerly a member of the ITN and We Continue the Change parties, had left the latter in May 2023 following a wiretapping scandal involving him. On 21 May the party held a national video conference with about 50 people participating where it discussed the opportunity of forming a government in a coalition with GERB\u2014SDS. As the conference was running late at night, Vasilev proceeded to record it and, to his words, go to bed. The following day he leaked the recording to the press, claiming he has lost confidence in party leaders Kiril Petkov and Asen Vasilev, who, unaware of being recorded, can be heard making controversial statements on multiple occasions in the tape. While the scandal stalled government talks, they concluded in the formation of the Denkov Government. As a result, Vasilev declared his independence from the PP-DB group in the National Assembly and served as MP until the dissolution of the 49th National Assembly, where he would actively criticize the government and use his position to increase the popularity of his newly formed party.\nPolitical positions\nElection results\nNational Assembly\nEuropean Parliament\n",
    "Brahuistan, also known as Brahvistan (Brahui: \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06be\u0648\u0626\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646; lit.\u2009'Land of the Brahuis') is a region in Balochistan in what are now Pakistan and Afghanistan primarily inhabited by the Brahuis, an ethnic group which natively speaks the Brahui language. In the twenty-first century, Brahui nationalism has been developed around the idea of a separate Brahuistan, consisting of Kalat in Pakistan and Registan in Afghanistan.\nIn the Brahui poetry and literature, Brahuistan was one of the names with which the Brahuis used to call their homeland, the others being Kalat and Mash (mountain). Historically Brahuis were pastoralists primarily confined to the Kalat region; in the 17th century various Brahui tribes were unified by the Brahui Ahmedzai dynasty which led to the creation of Khanate of Kalat or the \"Brahui Confederacy\". At its greatest extent in the 18th century, the Brahui confederacy controlled the wider Balochistan region. However, the traditional Brahui homeland or Brahuistan is a narrow corridor stretching from Nushki in the north to Khuzdar in the south, separating the Pashtun-majority regions in the northern Balochistan from the Baloch-majority Makran. During the British colonial period, several British ethnographers suggested the Kalat state to be renamed as Brahuistan, but the suggestion was ultimately not implemented due to the ongoing Great Game.\nThe Brahui Khanate of Kalat (dark green) in Baluchistan Agency (1931), subdivided into Sarawan, Jhalawan and Kacchi\nBrahuistan is further divided into two major parts, Sarawan in the north and Jhalawan in the south, inhabited by the Sarawani and Jhalawani Brahui tribes, respectively. Today most of Brahuistan, with the exception of Nushki, is part of Kalat Division. According to the 2023 Census of Pakistan, the districts of Khuzdar, Nushki, Kalat, Mastung and Surab have Brahui majority. Kalat Division, which consists of most of the former state of Kalat, is the only Brahui-majority division of Balochistan.\n",

    "Walk in New South Wales, Australia\nThe South Lawson Waterfall Circuit, officially the South Lawson Circular Waterfall Track or informally the Five Waterfall Walk, is a walk in Lawson, New South Wales, Australia. It is a 2.6 kilometres (1.6\u00a0mi) track that bypasses five waterfalls and an optional sixth one. The landscape changes a lot in the walk, ranging from wet, temperate forest, to dry forest with blue gums and wildflowers around. The track follows the banks of Lawson and Cataract Creek, and is rated as easy to medium. It has an elevation gain of 117 metres (384\u00a0ft) along the track.\nOverview\nA video showing a brief walk of the circuit, with an Eastern Whipbird calling at the end.\nJust south of the town of Lawson in the Blue Mountains, The South Lawson Waterfall Circuit is a popular walk in the town. The whole walk is in a temperate biome, and has a large diversity of fauna and flora, including the Musky Rat-Kangaroo, Eastern Whipbird, rarely the Superb Lyrebird, Golden Wattle, Fern, and the Blue and Red Gums. The walk is dog-friendly, because it is owned by the local council, not NPWS, and therefore is not a national park.\nHistory\nA sign showing a map and a brief history recount in the Northern Entrance of the walk.\nIn the late 1800s, early European settlers recognised the area as a great wonder, and started cutting the track in 1878. Earlier, in 1876, the settlers established the first reserves around the area of the falls, for public viewing. During the construction of the trail, they initially built bridges across the streams, but they were destroyed in floods or wildfires. Today, bolts and remnants of wood of the bridges can still be found in the creek crossings. Construction of the track finished in 1900.\nDescription\nHalf of the track follows the banks of Lawson Creek, while the other half has a steep ascent at first, and then follows Cataract Creek. There are two carparks to the north and south, each one of these on Honour Avenue, the main road in Lawson. The walk is directly south-west from the southern residential area of Lawson, the two areas only being separated by Honour Ave.\nWaterfall list\nAdelina Falls\nJunction Falls\nJunction Falls II\nFederal Falls\nCataract Falls\nLeslie Falls (optional)\nSee also\nLawson\nHazelbrook",

She grew up in Jutland, Denmark. From 1979 to 1985, she studied economics, English, and French at Aarhus University, earning a master's degree in 1985.\nShe moved to Sweden in 1987 and began working at F\u00f6rsta Sparbanken (First Savings Bank), which later became Swedbank. From 2009 to 2011, she was head of the bank's internal audit. Between 2011 and 2014, she was head of Swedbank's operations in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. In 2015, she became head of the bank's Swedish operations. She served as CEO of Swedbank from 2016 to 2019.\nDeparture in 2019 and legal aftermath\nIn the autumn of 2018, Bonnesen assured that Swedbank did not have foreign customers in the Baltics who merely transferred money through the bank. However, following an investigative report by the Swedish television program Uppdrag granskning on 20 February 2019, which examined Swedbank's Baltic customers during previous years, Bonnesen's earlier statements were questioned, and she was forced to step down on the morning of the annual general meeting on 28 March 2019.\nShe also left her position as chairperson of the Swedish Bankers' Association when she was dismissed as CEO of Swedbank.\nOn 23 March 2020, Swedbank announced that its board had decided to unilaterally revoke Bonnesen's severance agreement. According to the bank's annual report, she was to receive severance pay of 18 months' salary, approximately 21.5 million SEK.\nChief prosecutor Thomas Langrot at the Swedish Economic Crime Authority decided on 4 January 2022 to indict Bonnesen for gross fraud, alternatively gross market manipulation. The indictment concerned Bonnesen's statements during 2018 and 2019 about the bank's work against money laundering in the Baltics. The prosecutor alleged that Bonnesen had intentionally or through gross negligence spread misleading information that affected investors' assessment of the company. This was the first time a former CEO of one of the Swedish major banks was indicted for crimes committed in office. The prosecutor requested a two-year prison sentence during the district court proceedings, but on 25 January 2023, Bonnesen was acquitted on all charges by the Stockholm District Court.\nThe verdict was appealed, and on 10 September 2024, the Svea Court of Appeal sentenced Bonnesen to one year and three months in prison for gross fraud. She was acquitted of the charges in other parts.\n",

Women should be endowed with all virtues.  Let all the charioteers be victorious, mighty and Yajman's sons be civilized.  Let the clouds rain from time to time as needed in our nation.

    "Seyfert 1 galaxy in the constellation Bo\u00f6tes\nIRAS 13349+2438 is a Seyfert galaxy located in the constellation of Bo\u00f6tes. It is located 1.45 billion light-years from Earth and a prototype infrared-luminous low-redshift quasar with a projected luminosity of 2 x1046 erg s-1 according to Beichman who discovered it in 1986.\nIRAS 13349+2438 has a spiral-like appearance according to digital imaging made on the galaxy's host and the nearby environment. It has a companion galaxy, suggesting the galaxy might have interacted with it, given the evidence of tidal structures. It is likely the interaction has given rise to its quasar activity as interstellar dust and gas are supplied to the galaxy's nucleus. Additionally, IRAS 13349+2438 shows increasing high optical polarization at declining wavebands. It is a radio-quiet quasar despite weak radio emission being reported at 6 GHz.\nThe galaxy has strong properties of Fe II emission and weak  that is relative to H\u03b2. A study made by Chandra X-ray spectrum with the HETGS grating spectrometer, also confirms IRAS 13349+2438 has a rich absorption spectra of quasar outflows. It is also said the object contains a double-peaked absorption measure distribution whom researchers finds the object has an ionized column density of NH = (1.2  \u00b1 0.3) x 1022 cm-2.\nIRAS 13349+2438 has been observed by XMM Newton Observatory a few occasions. In 2000, XMM Newton discovered the galaxy contains several broad absorption lines from various ionized elements like nitrogen, oxygen and iron L-shell ions. Further evidence shows, IRAS 13349+2438 also has an unresolved transitional array of an inner-shell absorption, possibly misidentified to be an OVII edge through observations made by moderate resolution spectrometers.  In 2018, IRAS 13349+2438 was observed again, which it contains large numbers of absorption lines originating from warm absorption zones with measured velocities of ~-600 km s-1. A joint study by NuSTAR and XMM Newton confirms presence of iron absorption lines at both 8 and 9 keV, with velocities of 0.14c and 0.27c. Based on findings, IRAS 13349+2438 shows possible detections of multiphase ultra-fast outflows.\nIn a study sample of narrow-line Seyfert galaxies, IRAS 13349+2438 contains an unresolved core region with an approximate size of 540 x 235 parsecs. It has a high brightness temperature of ~72,000 K, indicating the galaxy has a low-power relativistic beamed jet. Furthermore, it has an average star formation rate over 100 Myr of 105.8 \u00b1 29.5 M\u0398 yr-1 and mass of 21.44 \u00b1 2.68 1010 M\u0398.\n",
    "Senapati of the Maratha Empire\nAnandrao (also Anandrau, Marathi pronunciation: ; was a Maratha general who briefly held the position of Senapati. He led several successful Maratha raids and military campaigns in the territories of the Mughal Empire and the Bijapur Sultanate, demonstrating his military skills and prowess. He assisted Prataprao Gujar in various campaigns and accompanied Chhatrapati Shivaji on numerous expeditions. In 1674, he avenged the death of Prataprao Gujar by defeating Bahlol Khan near Bankapura and looting his jagir.Later, he assisted Shivaji in Maratha southern conquest.\nEarly life\nLittle is known about the early life of Anandrao. According to Sabhasad Bakhar, he initially served Shahaji, the father of Shivaji. Later, along with Venkaji Datto, Anandrao entered the service of Shivaji himself. Shivaji appointed him as Hapt Hazaari, placing him in command of seven thousand cavalry. The Bakhar also refers to Anandrao as the \"Palalela Farzand\" (fostered son) of Shahaji. In a 1674 letter, he is mentioned in an assembly as \"Anandrao bin Lakhmoji Naik\" (meaning Anandrao, son of Lakhmoji Naik), suggesting that Lakhmoji Naik was his father. Lakhmoji Naik, who held the title of Dinkarrao, was initially in Shahaji\u2019s service and later served Jijabai. He is sometimes referred to as Lakhmoji Raje. It is also believed that Raghoji Mitra, mentioned in the Sabhasad Bakhar, was none other than Lakhmoji Naik himself, who accompanied Shivaji to Agra. The titles \"Dinkarrao\" and \"Mitra\" both symbolize the Hindu sun god, Surya.\nMilitary campaigns and wars\nBattle of Devrukh\nMilitary campaign of Khandesh\nIn August 1668, following the Treaty of Purandar, Chhatrapati Shivaji dispatched Anandrao and Prataprao Gujar with cavalry forces to serve under the Mughal prince stationed in Aurangabad. However, the treaty did not last long, and in December 1669, both commanders returned to Rajgad without informing the Subahdar of Aurangabad.\nAfter the treaty with the Mughals was broken, Shivaji launched a large-scale military campaign against the Mughal Empire in 1670, which he had been preparing for some time. Anandrao accompanied Shivaji in this campaign. The Marathas first attacked Junnar in August 1670 and then advanced north through Nashik towards Baglan. The Maratha forces under Anandrao, successfully raided Mughal camps and outposts in the Baglan and Khandesh regions.\nSecond sack of Surat\nBattle of Salher\nMain article: Battle of Salher\nBattle of Umrani\nMain article: Battle of Umrani\nSack of Sampgaon\nBattle of Bankapura\nAppointed as Senapati\nConquest in southern India\nMain article: Shivaji's Southern Campaign\nSiege of Vellore\nSiege of Balapur\nLegacy\nSeveral branches of the Thorat clan trace their lineage to Anandrao or assert their affiliation with his ancestral line.\n",

When the team won the Kloof High School Football Tournament in, Boshoff was named player of the tournament as the first goalkeeper to become so. Boshoff also attended the Westville United Football Academy and the Sharks Academy before joining AmaZulu. Here, he played in the Diski Challenge while goalkeepers came and went in the senior squad.\nFollowing several years at AmaZulu without playing time, Boshoff made his first-tier debut in the 2019\u201320 South African Premier Division. He was surprisingly substituted in for Siyabonga Mbatha who injured himself during warmup. Boshoff held a clean sheet in that match, against Orlando Pirates.

His playing time was very limited, and he went on to Cape Town Spurs after one year. The 2023\u201324 South African Premier Division ended in relegation for Cape Town Spurs, but Boshoff added another clean sheet to his name as the team beat Kaizer Chiefs 2\u20130 in May 2024, at the same time cementing Kaizer Chiefs' worst-ever league position of 10th.\n",
    "Qu\u00e9bec d'abord (previously known as \u00c9quipe Labeaume) is a municipal political party in Quebec City.\nFounded by R\u00e9gis Labeaume, it was registered with Elections Quebec June 5, 2008. During the 2021 Quebec City municipal election, under a new leader, the party took the name \u00c9quipe Marie-Jos\u00e9e Savard. With the results of the 2021 election, the party became the official opposition and again changed its leadership. On February 21, 2022, the party changed its name to Qu\u00e9bec d'abord.\nHistory\nR\u00e9gis Labeaume was elected Mayor of Quebec City the first time as an independent candidate during the 2007 municipal by-elections with 59% of the vote. Upon his arrival to the Quebec City Council, he formed an executive council with municipal councillors who were favourable to him. These alliances became a political party on June 5, 2008. During the 2009 Quebec municipal elections, \u00c9quipe Labeaume had 25 councillors elected out of a possible 27 seats, making it the only party sitting on the Council. During the 2013 and 2017 elections, new parties reduced the vote and seat share for the party. By June 2021, the party held 14 seats of a possible 21 on the council.\nAs the 2021 Quebec City municipal elections approached, R\u00e9gis Labeaume announced that he was retiring from public life. On May 12, 2021, he endorsed Marie-Jos\u00e9e Savard, a member of his party and vice-president of the executive committee.. On May 20, 2021, Elections Qu\u00e9bec officially registered the name change of the party from \"\u00c9quipe Labeaume\" to \"\u00c9quipe Marie-Jos\u00e9e Savard\".,. The party's headquarters remained at 840 rue Raoul-Jobin. All the municipal councillors for the party participated in the announcement for the change. Nevertheless, several councillors for the party took the opportunity to also leave political life, allowing for a renewal of the team. In the election, the party won the largest number of seats in the council (10 out of a possible 21), but leader Marie-Jos\u00e9e Savard was not elected mayor. New councillor Claude Villeneuve, former advisor to Premier Pauline Marois, was designated by his colleagues to succeed Savard on November 10, 2021. The party changed its name to better reflect the results of the election and identity, renaming itself \"Qu\u00e9bec d'abord\" on February 21, 2022.\nWeakened by the move from government to opposition, the party lost three councillors over the span of six months following the 2021 election. Steeve Verret, for Lac-Saint-Charles-Saint-\u00c9mile, left the party to sit as an independent less than ten days after the election, followed by David Weiser  and Claude Lavoie in the spring. These moves changed the balance of power in the City Council, causing the ruling Qu\u00e9bec forte et fi\u00e8re and the second opposition party Qu\u00e9bec 21 to have a majority of seats in the council.\nParty leaders\nR\u00e9gis Labeaume in 2011.\nElection results\n",
    "Ukrainian attack on Russian ammunition depot\nOn the night of 17\u201318 September 2024, during the Russo-Ukrainian War, Ukraine launched a drone attack on the Main Missile and Artillery Directorate (GRAU) 107th arsenal ammunition depot in Toropets, causing a massive series of explosions and fires and shattering of windows across nearby towns. The main explosion caused a 82m-wide crater and a seismic wave of magnitude 2.5~2.8 on 18 September, 3:56\u00a0am, local time. Such supply chain disruption contributed to reduce Russia's firepower in its war on Ukraine.\nContext\nMain article: Russian invasion of Ukraine\nFollowing more than two years of war, Ukraine recently moved the conflict into Russian territories. On 6 August 2024, Ukraine launched an incursion into Kursk Oblast. Ukraine also argues with allies providing weapons for longer range munitions and the right to use them deeper into Russia with the purposes of attacking legitimate military targets used by Russia to attack Ukraine and putting political pressure on Putin. Claimed by Ukraine and led with domestically-manufactured airborne drones, this strike would aim at normalizing such in depth attacks in order to ease allies stances. Ukrainian representatives stated that more attacks of this kind are expected in order to \u201cmethodically\u201d reduce Russia\u2019s missile potential.\nTarget\nEuronews reported that the military ammunition depot had been renovated in 2018, and that the Russian deputy defense minister claimed that \"the site met the 'highest international standards' and could defend against weapons such as missiles and 'even a small nuclear attack.'\"  Euronews also reported that approximately 30,000 tonnes of military munitions were stored at the facility, including \"fuel tanks, as well as missiles intended for Iskander and Tochka-U missile systems, guided aerial bombs and assorted artillery ammunition... Russia had also started to store North Korean munitions in Toropets.\" NBC reported that KAB missiles were also stored at the facility.\nDepot contents\nFuel tanks\nMissiles and explosive warehouses\nS300 missiles\nIskander tactical missile systems\nTochka-U tactical missile systems\nGuided aerial bombs / KABs\nNorth Korean KN-23 missiles\nArtillery ammunition\nNorth Korean munitions\nAttack\nUkrainska Pravda cited Ukraine's Security Service, Defence Intelligence and Special Operations Force as the author of the nighttime attack. According to Russian Defense Ministry, all of the 54 Ukrainian drones aimed at western Russian regions were successfully intercepted. According to Igor Rudenya, governor of Tver Oblast, debris of a successfully downed Ukrainian drone caused the fire, igniting the ammunition depot and the series of explosions.\nOn 22 September 2024, media reported that Ukrainian drones had struck a second ammunition depot located south of Toropets, again causing a large fire.\nExplosions\nNASA FIRMS imagery from 21 September 2024 showing the newer, extensive fire south of Toropets with first detections at 00:18:00 (UTC) and the still ongoing fire from the first attack east of Toropets\nThe attack resulted in multiple secondary explosions, the largest being an earthquake-magnitude blast.  The blast wave spread up to 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) and was estimated to have a TNT equivalent of 200-240 tons of high-explosives. Resulting fires were detected from NASA's fire monitoring systems as covering an area of approximately 13\u00a0km2 (5\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\nConsequences\nIgor Rudenya, governor of Tver Oblast, announced a partial evacuation of the town but that there were no serious injuries nor fatalities. Russian officials later reported that 13 people had been injured.\nHowever, according to pro\u2013Russian milblogger Anastasia Kashevarova, hundreds of Russians may have been killed in the strike, with the facility's utility block alone accommodating 200 people.\nOn 20 September, colonel Kiviselg, head of the Estonian Defense Forces Intelligence Center, estimated that the strike had caused 30,000 tonnes of munitions to explode, the size of which he equated to 750,000 shells adding that the strike destroyed two to three months of Russia's ammunition supply. The depot reportedly stored not only artillery shells, but also Iskander missiles, Tochka-U ballistic missiles and glide bombs and it is unclear if his bomb damage assessment includes both missiles and artillery ammunition.\nSee also\nRAF Fauld explosion\n2020 Beirut explosion\n2022 Crimean Bridge explosion\nRaids on the Tendra Spit\n2014 Vrb\u011btice ammunition warehouse explosions\nAttacks in Russia during the Russian invasion of Ukraine",
    "\nPrabh\u0101karamitra (564\u2013633 CE) (also known as Prabh\u0101mitra) was an Indian Buddhist monk and translator from the monastery of Nalanda who was active in Tang China where he was responsible for translating important texts belonging to the Mahayana tradition into Chinese.\nLife\nThe ruins of Nalanda\nDetails of Prabh\u0101karamitra's life can be found in multiple sources, most notably the Xu gaoseng zhuan of Daoxuan.\nPrabh\u0101karamitra was born in Central India in 564 CE. He was ordained as a monk at the monastery of Nalanda at the age of 10 in 574 CE where he was a student of \u015a\u012blabhadra who would later go on to teach the Chinese monk, Xuanzang. During his time at Nalanda, he studied not just the sutras of the Mahayana like the Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi-\u015a\u0101stra but also texts relating to Hinayana Buddhism and Vedic thought. The biographical material also states that he had three disciples of his own, Praj\u00f1a, Indra and Varman. Despite the high regard he held in India, receiving a large group of followers and patronage from a local king, he also wished to proselyte Buddhism among the \"northern barbarians\". Together with a group of 10 followers, which included Buddhists and non-Buddhists, they reached the headquarters of the Western Turkic Khaganate which was at the time ruled by Yehu Khan, where he was held in high esteem by the Turks after just 10 days of staying with them.\nThe Mahavira hall at Daxingshan Temple\nThere is uncertainty as to the exact year that he arrived in China although some scholars state it to be around 626/627 CE. Around this time, an envoy, Prince Gaoping of Tang, was sent to the Western Turks and encountered Prabh\u0101karamitra. Impressed by his knowledge, he wished to bring Prabh\u0101karamitra back with him to China. Once in China, was ordered by Emperor Taizong of Tang in 629 CE, to translate Mahayana scriptures into Chinese. He carried out his work at Daxingshan Temple and Xiantong Temple and was assisted by 19 monk-scholars. It is possible that Xuanzang learned of Nalanda through his interactions with Prabh\u0101karamitra during this time which may have been a motivating factor in wanting to travel there.\nHis biography states that his continuing work in translating Buddhist texts prompted the ire of Confucian Scholar-officials who spoke negatively of Prabh\u0101karamitra to the Emperor. The result of this was that the Emperor ceased to take an interest in the translation project and Prabh\u0101karamitra died in 633 CE at the age of 69.\nTranslation work\nPrabh\u0101karamitra was considered a pioneer of the \"team-based translation model\" for Buddhist scriptures. This involved selecting translators based on skill and under the previous Sui dynasty, \"Eight Preconditions\" were introduced which set out the essential skills for Buddhist translators however Prabh\u0101karamitra selected his team based on those who possed specific moral qualities and \"great virtue\" in addition to knowledge of Buddhism and familiarity with scriptures. A selection process was used to select the final nineteen members of the team. The names of some of the other translators that he worked with include Huicheng\u6167\u4e58, Xuanmo \u7384\u8b28, Huiming\u6167\u660e and Falin.\nThe prominent texts translated by Prabh\u0101karamitra and his team from Sanskrit into Chinese were:\nRatnaketuparivarta \u5bf6\u661f\u9640\u7f85\u5c3c\u7d93\nM\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101 \u822c\u82e5\u71c8\u8ad6\u91cb\nMah\u0101y\u0101nas\u016btr\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101ra \u5927\u4e58\u838a\u56b4\u7d93\u8ad6\n Praj\u00f1\u0101prad\u012bpa \nPrabh\u0101karamitra's model for translation marked a significant shift in how translations were carried out in medieval China. The model refined the role of the translator introducing more organisation and procedures. Prabh\u0101karamitra later advocated for large-scale translation teams that were prominent in the Qin dynasty in the early medieval period and saw the involvement of up to 3000 translators which helped with the spread of Buddhist texts in the early medieval period. However, his proposal was criticised by contemporaries in the Tang court who believed that this was an attempt for Prabh\u0101karamitra to extend his own influence and seek disciples. Amid the public criticism, Prabh\u0101karamitra's proposals were ignored.\n",
    "\nRhoda Barry (7 February 1916 \u2013 14 July 2011) was a librarian, composer, and poet, best known for her contribution to Afrikaans children's songs. She composed the well-known song \"Eendjies, eendjies\", which is often considered a traditional song of unknown origin. Her work had a lasting influence on early childhood music education in South Africa.\nEarly life and career\nRhoda Barry was born on 7 February 1916 in Wakkerstroom, then part of the Transvaal. Her father, Cyril Kershaw Barry, was an English-speaking lawyer, and her mother, Eugenie Goddard Knobel, was a survivor of the concentration camps during the Anglo-Boer War. Rhoda matriculated from Ellerslie High School for Girls in Sea Point, Cape Town. Music was one of her school subjects.\nMusic and compositions\nRhoda's most well-known contribution to the Afrikaans musical heritage is the children's song \"Eendjies, eendjies\", which was initially published in her collection \"Sangstukke vir Kindertjies\" and later included in the FAK-Songbooks of 1961 and 1979. Another composition of hers, \"Wiegelied\" (Lullaby), was also included in the 1961 FAK-Songbook. Her music was considered instrumental in the development of school music programs and childhood education in South Africa. Although Rhoda herself did not teach music, her inclusion in the FAK-Songbooks gave her work a certain institutional recognition.\nLibrarianship and literary contributions\nRhoda Barry earned her master's degree in library science from the University of Illinois in the USA, where she wrote a thesis titled A Century of Books: 1814-1914; A Preliminary Survey of Literature Suitable for Children in South Africa. After working for a year at the New York Children's Library, she returned to South Africa. She played a key role in making children's literature available in South Africa by designing practical layouts for children's sections and selecting appropriate children's literature. Her expertise in children's library sections was documented in 1956 and applied in every library in the Cape Provincial Library Service. She was also responsible for establishing a children's library section on Robben Island, which was inaugurated on 10 November 1956.\nIn 1958, she published a revised edition of G.R. von Wielligh's Afrikaans Dierestories (Animal Stories). This publication was included in the reading list for Afrikaans literature students at the University of the Witwatersrand in 1962.\nSelected publications\nSangstukke vir Kindertjies (1943) \u2013 A collection with six children's songs and two piano pieces.\nWiegelied \u2013 included in the FAK-Songbook (1961).\nSuid-Afrika, my Volksland (South Africa, My Homeland) \u2013 A song that won a prize in a competition organized by the South African Broadcasting Corporation.\nKom, Kom Boere \u2013 A boeremusiek song.\nDierestories: 'n Keuse uit die Versameling van G.R. von Wielligh (1958) \u2013 A revised edition of G.R. von Wielligh's Afrikaans animal stories.\nO Canto da Terra do Natal (The Christmas-Land Carol) \u2013 A Christmas carol with a South African character that won a prize.\nLater life and death\nIn her later years, Rhoda Barry focused on her writing and her opposition to the modernization of her hometown, Wakkerstroom. She passed away on 14 July 2011 at the age of 95.\nLegacy\nRhoda Barry's composition \"Eendjies, eendjies\" remains one of the most well-known Afrikaans children's songs and is still frequently sung today. Her work had a significant impact on Afrikaans culture, particularly in the area of children's music and literature.\n",
    "American judge\nJerome B. Abrams is an American judge who served as a district court judge in Minnesota for 14 years. He has been involved with studying and implementing changes to the civil litigation process in Minnesota and nationally.\nJudicial service\nIn 2007, Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty appointed Abrams as a judge to Minnesota's First Judicial District court, effective January 11, 2008. This is a trial level court with jurisdiction over civil, criminal, family, juvenile, probate, and traffic cases. It encompasses Scott and Dakota Counties, among other Minnesota counties. In 2010, Abrams was elected to the First Judicial District and was reelected in 2016. He retired on February 2, 2022, and was succeeded by Stacey Sorenson. Abrams was appointed a senior judge statewide, for a term running from March 7, 2022, to June 30, 2025. Senior judges are \"retired judges subject to recall\" who can serve as judges, or as mediators or arbitrators when they are not actually serving as judges in a particular case.\nCivil justice activity in Minnesota\nAbrams was a member of the Minnesota Supreme Court's Civil Justice Reform Task Force, created in late 2010. The task force reviewed earlier Minnesota studies, and civil justice reforms in courts outside of Minnesota, to develop recommendations for improving Minnesota's court practices and procedures to \"facilitate more effective and efficient case processing.\" The task force issued its reports and recommendations in December 2011 and May 2012.\nAmong its recommendations were creating a pilot program to expedite civil cases, and a specialized statewide complex case program. The pilot program recommendation became the Expedited Civil Litigation Track Pilot Project, commonly called the \"rocket docket\". In 2013, the first rocket dockets were established in Duluth and Dakota Counties. Abrams was judicial manager of the original rocket docket in Dakota County. Those two expedited dockets still exist (2024), and the rocket docket has been expanded into other Minnesota county courts, with an opt-in potential for all other judicial districts.\nThe task force recommendations also led to a statewide set of rules creating Minnesota's Complex Case Program. Abrams was likewise involved in shaping this specialized docket. Among other things, the Supreme Court proposed a model case management order for mandatory use in the new program. Abrams wrote to the Supreme Court suggesting that a single standardized form would be inappropriate in complex cases, and the text of case management orders should be entrusted to the trained specialist complex litigation judges who would be overseeing a given case. The final rules follow Abrams' advice.\nAbrams is a co-author of the Minnesota publication, Business Disputes: Claims and Remedies Deskbook, writing the chapter on insurance coverage.\nCivil justice activity nationally\nIn 2013, the Conference of Chief Justices (CCJ) created the Civil Justice Improvements Committee (CJI), as part of its civil justice initiative. The CCJ is a national organization whose members include the highest judicial officer of each state. This initiative aimed to develop innovations and best practices in civil courts to reduce costs and delays in rendering justice, while still preserving fairness, access to courts, and due process. The CCJ worked with the National Center for State Courts (NCSC) and the Institute for the Advancement of the American Legal System (IAALS) in putting together a widely experienced 23-member committee to carry out research and make recommendations. Abrams was selected as a member of the committee, and chaired its Rules and Litigation Subcommittee, one of the two subcommittees that carried out the bulk of the CJI's work (the other subcommittee being chaired by Judge Jennifer D. Bailey). In 2016, the CJI issued its report, Call to Action: Achieving Civil Justice for All, Recommendations to the Conference of Chief Justices by the Civil Justice Improvements Committee.\nAbrams has been an NCSC board member. He is also a council member of the NCSC's Just Horizons Initiative. This initiative is \"dedicated to helping courts anticipate and prepare for future challenges and opportunities affecting the delivery of high-quality justice to all who use our courts.\" Abrams serves as a liaison between the NCSC and the American College of Business Court Judges.\nAbrams has been involved nationally with the study and development of specialized business courts, which were also a subject of the Minnesota task force's study on court practices and efficiency. He is vice-president of the American College of Business Court Judges (2024). He was a Business Court Representative to the American Bar Association's Business Law Section (2014\u20132016). He is a co-author of The Business Courts Benchbook, writing chapters on discovery management and electronic discovery. He also is co-author of An Electronic Discovery Primer.\nInternationally, Abrams contributes to the Judicial Integrit",

    "Building in Manhattan, New York\nUnited States historic place\n45 East 66th Street (also known as 777 Madison Avenue) is a cooperative apartment building on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City, United States. It was built between 1906 and 1908 and was designed by the firm of Harde & Short. The building is one of a few luxury apartment buildings that were developed in the surrounding area prior to World War I. It is a New York City designated landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nThe building, located at the northeast corner of Madison Avenue and 66th Street, is ten stories high. The facade is made of red brick, with light-colored French Gothic\u2013style terracotta details spread across the facade. The Madison Avenue and 66th Street facades are both divided vertically into three bays and are ornamented with details such as band courses, ogee arches, finials, crockets, and tracery. Initially, the building had 20 apartments,  surrounding a light court at the center; the typical apartment included three to four bedrooms and several family rooms. The ground-story apartments were replaced with retail in 1929, and the apartments were subdivided in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Over the years, architectural critics such as Paul Goldberger and Christopher Gray have praised the detailing on the facade.\nThe building was developed by Parkview Real Estate Company, which was led by Charles F. Rogers. The structure was sold in 1912 after going into foreclosure, and it was resold twice more in the next decade. Bing & Bing owned the building from 1929 to 1973, when the racehorse owner Sigmund Sommer bought it. Sommer fired several employees and made other changes to the building, triggering rent strikes and lawsuits. Bing & Bing ultimately repurchased 45 East 66th Street in 1977 and resold it to Martin J. Raynes in 1985. Raynes converted the building into a housing cooperative, and the facade was renovated in the late 1980s. After Raynes ended his involvement with the building in 1990, Classic Properties sponsored the co-op conversion and sold the retail space. A penthouse structure atop the building was erected in the 2010s.\nSite\n45 East 66th Street is on the northeastern corner of 66th Street and Madison Avenue on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City. The building has an alternate address of 777 Madison Avenue. The rectangular land lot covers 10,042 square feet (932.9\u00a0m2), with a frontage of 100 feet (30\u00a0m) on 66th Street to the south and 100.42 feet (30.61\u00a0m) on Madison Avenue to the west. The building itself measures approximately 100.5 by 89.1 feet (30.6 by 27.2\u00a0m) across. Nearby structures include the Sara Delano Roosevelt Memorial House at 49 East 65th Street, on the block to the south, and the Seventh Regiment Armory between 66th and 67th streets, on the block to the east.\nPrior to the current building's construction, the site at 777 Madison Avenue had been occupied by a four-story stone house and a brick-and-stone church. When the building was developed in the 1900s, the surrounding area was occupied by rowhouses. A small number of luxury apartments were built nearby before World War I, including the Verona two blocks south.\nArchitecture\nThe building was designed by Harde & Short and rises 10 stories. It contains decorative details inspired by the French Gothic style. The decorations are spread across the entire facade, unlike in other buildings built in New York City before World War I, where the decorations were typically confined to the bottom and top stories. According to the historian Christopher Gray, the decorations are similar to that of the Leuven Town Hall in Leuven, Belgium.\nRounded corner\nThe decorations at 45 East 66th Street resemble those of several other buildings designed by Harde & Short. Before designing 45 East 66th Street, Harde & Short had designed the Red House at 350 West 85th Street, which also included large amounts of Gothic decoration. The turret at the building's corner was adapted from another Harde & Short building at West End Avenue and 80th Street; the firm later used a similar rounded corner in the Alwyn Court. The building's decorations also influenced the design of 44 West 77th Street, which was built shortly afterward.\nFacade\n45 East 66th Street is mostly clad in red brick, with light-colored terracotta details inspired by the French Gothic style, in addition to pieces of blackened mortar. The facade's two primary elevations\u2014the western elevation on Madison Avenue and the southern elevation on 66th Street\u2014which are connected by a rounded turret at the corner. The turret rises the entire height of the building and curves 180 degrees counterclockwise from the northwest to the southeast. Each elevation is divided vertically into three bays. The northernmost bay on Madison Avenue and the easternmost bay on 66th Street protrude slightly from the facade, with twisting engaged columns on either side, and consist of five windows on ea",

For the Swiss comedy film, see Der grosse Sommer.\nOne Grand Summer (German: Der gro\u00dfe Sommer) is a 2021 coming-of-age novel by German author Ewald Arenz. Set in the 1980s in West Germany, the story follows 16-year-old Frieder B\u00fcchner as he spends a transformative summer with his grandparents, with themes of first love, friendship, and family relationships. It became a bestseller in Germany and has been translated into several languages.\nPlot\nThe novel is set in the early 1980s in an unnamed South German town, following 16-year-old Frieder during a transformative summer. After failing his ninth-grade year and needing to retake exams in Math and Latin, Frieder is sent to stay with his grandmother Nana and step-grandfather Walter, a strict medical professor, for six weeks to ensure he studies. Before leaving, Frieder meets Beate, a girl his age, at a local swimming pool while attempting a dive and immediately falls for her. With help from his sister Alma and best friend Johann, he manages to find out where she lives but doesn't get a chance to see her again immediately. As summer begins, Frieder's family, except for Alma who's doing an internship at a retirement home, goes on vacation.\nInitially struggling with his strict grandfather, Frieder gradually develops a closer relationship with him, especially as Walter teaches Math and Latin in an unusual way. Frieder discovers and secretly reads his grandmother's diaries, learning about his grandparents' post-war love story, and sees his own feelings for Beate reflected in these accounts.\nDuring a night-time break-in at the swimming pool, Frieder, Alma, Johann, and Beate are caught by the pool attendant. Frieder is given a choice: either he dives from the high board, or all four will be reported. Despite his fear, Frieder agrees, and is surprisingly joined by Beate. After the successful dive, they share their first kiss, beginning their relationship.\nAfter Johann's father suddenly dies during a family vacation to Italy, his behavior becomes increasingly erratic. The friends end up accidentally damaging a digger in an abandoned quarry and flee the scene. Frieder and Beate have sex for the first time in his parents' empty apartment.\nJohann, becoming increasingly unstable, suffers a psychotic episode where he falsely accuses Frieder and Alma of having an incestuous relationship, causing Beate to angrily break up with Frieder. As Johann's condition worsens, Frieder and Alma seek help from their grandfather. Johann is diagnosed with schizophrenic psychosis and forcibly hospitalized, a traumatic experience for the siblings who feel they've betrayed him. During this time, Frieder's relationship with his grandfather deepens as Walter helps him navigate the consequences of the damaged digger. With his grandmother's help, Frieder also reconciles with Beate.\nThe novel concludes with Frieder passing his resit exams, supported by Beate and Alma. The four friends, including a recovering Johann, reunite at a gravesite they had bought together during Johann's psychosis. An epilogue shows an adult Frieder meeting Beate at this same grave, leaving their current relationship status ambiguous.\nBackground\nOne Grand Summer draws inspiration from author Ewald Arenz's personal experiences and observations. Born in Nuremberg in 1965 and residing in F\u00fcrth, Arenz incorporated elements from his own youth into the novel. While the protagonist Frieder is not a direct representation of Arenz, the character benefits from the author's adolescent experiences, including academic struggles and the impact of loss. Arenz noted that he felt increasingly connected to his youth in recent years, recognizing how formative these experiences were for his entire life. The novel also reflects real-life events, such as the death of a friend's parent during their teenage years, which Arenz described as a life-altering experience that influenced the narrative.\nStyle\nArenz's writing style is characterized by its subtlety and evocative prose. The narrative structure combines present-day reflections with extended flashbacks to the pivotal summer. Critics have noted the author's ability to capture the atmosphere of a warm, long summer and the mood of 1980s Germany with well-observed details. The novel employs a light, accessible language that has been described as \"light-footed\" with \"poetic, sometimes quite familiar images.\"\nThemes\nOne Grand Summer is primarily a coming-of-age story, exploring the transformative experiences of youth. The novel delves into the themes of first love, friendship, and family relationships, set against the backdrop of 1980s Germany. Nostalgia plays a significant role in the novel. The novel also explores the lingering effects of historical events, such as World War II, on family dynamics.\nReception\nOne Grand Summer received largely positive reviews from critics. The novel quickly became a bestseller in Germany, with critics prais",

    "GALEX J2339\u20130424 is a white dwarf in the constellation Aquarius.\nGALEX J2339\u20130424 (GALEX J233917.0\u2013042425, GALEX J2339) is a white dwarf that is suspected to be polluted with material originating from an icy exomoon. This is evident from the first detection of beryllium in this white dwarf, together with GD 378.\nGALEX J2339 was first identified as a possible quasar with GALEX in 2007. It was identified as a white dwarf candidate from Gaia and virtual observatory data in 2018. In 2020 it was identified as a DBAZ: white dwarf, which means that it had helium, hydrogen and metal absorption lines. In 2021 the white dwarf was observed with Lick, Magellan 1 and Keck. The observations showed that the object had absorption due to hydrogen, helium, beryllium, oxygen, magnesium, silicon, calcium, titanium, chromium, manganese and iron. The oxygen is present in excess, which indicates a water ice-rich body. The accreted parent object had a chondrite-like composition and was 85% water ice in volume. The accretion event lasted for 2\u20134 Million years and the parent body had a mass of 3 \u00d7 1020\u20131 \u00d7 1021 kg, or between about the mass of Vesta to about the mass of Ceres.\nExomoons as a source of white dwarf pollution has been proposed since 2016/2017 and their fate around white dwarfs was further studied later, showing that around 1% of polluted white dwarfs should be polluted with exomoons. The presence of beryllium is thought to be the result of spallation of heavier elements (especially oxygen) on the surface of an icy dust belt around a giant planet. The icy dust belts enriched in beryllium will then form exomoons, which might pollute white dwarf. These icy dust belts are comparable to Saturns rings and rings around J1407b. Other scenarios are mentioned, such as the radiation of a Wolf-Rayet star. But these environments are less favourable to produce the observed beryllium excess. The spallation should also produce lithium and boron, but (as of September 2024) these are not detected around GALEX J2339 or GD 378.\nSee also\nList of exoplanets and planetary debris around white dwarfs\nList of exomoon candidates",

    "\nDjamel Okacha, nom de guerre Yahia Abou al-Hamman, was an Algerian jihadist who fought in the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) and later Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM). Okacha served as the commanders of Katiba al-Furqan and Katiba al-Mulathamoun within AQIM, and was appointed as the co-governor of Tombouctou Region during Ansar Dine's capture of the region during the 2012 Tuareg rebellion. Okacha was then appointed as the second-in-command of AQIM between 2012 and 2017, where he co-founded JNIM alongside Iyad Ag Ghaly and Amadou Kouffa. Okacha served as the second-in-command of JNIM until his death in 2019.\nBiography\nOkacha was born on May 9, 1978, near Regha\u00efa, Algeria. He was close with either the Islamic Salvation Front or Armed Islamic Group as a teenager during the Algerian Civil War, which earned him an eighteen-month prison sentence in 1995. After Okacha's release, he befriended Abdelmalek Droukdel as the both of them grew up in Algiers. He joined the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) at its creation in 1998. Within the group, he served as a sniper due to having a lame right foot. In the early 2000s, Okacha was appointed the commander of Zone 2, which consisted of Tizi Ouzou Province. He also became a qadi, or judge, of the GSPC.\nOkacha entered northern Mali in 2003 or 2004. Under the command of Mokhtar Belmokhtar, Okacha co-founded the Katiba al-Mulathamoun, one of the brigades of the GSPC. Okacha was sentenced to death in absentia in Algeria for his activities in the GSPC (later renaming to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in 2005). During the GSPC's insurgency in the Sahel in the early 2000s, Okacha took part in several operations. In 2005, he fought in the Lemgheity attack on a Mauritanian army barracks, and in 2009 he helped assassinate American aid worker Christopher Leggett. In August 2009, he led an attack on the French embassy in Nouakchott, Mauritania, and the kidnapping of an Italian-Burkinabe couple in December 2010. During hostage negotiations, Okacha determined the final ransom prices.\nIn 2009, Okacha also commanded Katiba al-Furqan. Under his leadership, the katiba assassinated Malian colonel Lamana Ould Bou in Timbuktu. Bou's assassination sparked a falling-out with Belmokhtar. However, he was still on good terms with Abou Zeid, the head of another katiba within AQIM.\nMali War\nOkacha led jihadist forces of Ansar Dine and AQIM alongside Iyad Ag Ghaly, Abou Zeid, and Belmokhtar during the Tuareg rebellion in 2012. The jihadist offensive captured Timbuktu and drove out the MNLA and MAA. Okacha was appointed as co-governor of Timbuktu following it's capture, and his reign in the city suppressed looting and distributed food, although enforced extremist interpretations of Sharia law and destroyed world heritage sites in the city.\nAfter the death of Nabil Abou Alqama in September 2012, Droukdel appointed Okacha as \"Emir of the Sahara\", effectively making him second-in-command of AQIM. Okacha commanded all AQIM forces in the Sahel. In late 2012 and early 2013, Okacha helped Belmokhtar plan and perpetrate the In Amenas hostage crisis. At this time, Belmokhtar was expelled from AQIM and had founded his own group Signatories By Blood.\nOkacha left Timbuktu with his men in January 2013 at the start of Operation Barkhane. He reportedly fought at the battle of Ifoghas that same year. On August 10, 2014, French forces captured an AQIM cell near Timbuktu, including a close confidant of Okacha named Abou Tourab.\nIn January 2016, Okacha applauded the November 2015 Paris attacks and welcomed Belmokhtar's return to AQIM in an interview with Mauritanian news agency al-Akhbar. He deplored Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahrawi's defection to create the predecessor to the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, but stated he was still in contact with Sahrawi.\nOkacha appeared alongside Ghaly, Kouffa, Abu Hassan al-Ansari, and Abu Abderrahman El Senhadji in a video announcing the merger of several Malian jihadist groups into Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) on January 2, 2017. Ghaly led the new group, and Okacha was appointed second-in-command and commander of Tombouctou Region.\nDeath\nOkacha was killed on February 21, 2019, during the battle of Elakla when a group of jihadist vehicles were intercepted by French forces. Another prominent jihadist within JNIM, Seifallah Ben Hassine, was killed during the battle as well. Okacha's death was confirmed in a video released by Sedane Ag Hita, who would later succeed Okacha as JNIM's second-in-command. Droukdel also confirmed Okacha's death in February 2020.\n",

    "Territorial-era blockhouse\n1819 map by John Melish of Adams County, Mississippi\nFort Dearborn (Mississippi) location map created 1974\nFort Dearborn, also known as Washington Cantonment, was a U.S. Army base in Mississippi Territory on the Natchez Trace in Adams County near the territorial capital of Washington. Established in 1802 or 1803, the fort was used as a base during the War of 1812.\nHistory\nWith approval from Thomas Jefferson and U.S. Secretary of War Henry Dearborn, territorial governor William C. C. Claiborne ordered construction of a blockhouse \"about 400 yards from his house\" on land donated by Joseph Calvit. According to Mississippi historian Dunbar Rowland, \"Fort Dearborn and Jefferson College were the outstanding institutions of the territorial capital,\" which also hosted \"the land office, the Surveyor-General's office, the office of the Commissioners of Claims,  the Courts of the United States.\"\nThe fort held British prisoners during the War of 1812 but was abandoned between the end of the war and Mississippi statehood in 1817.\nThe fort was sited on the \"north bank of St. Catherine's Creek\" in the vicinity of present-day U.S. Route 61. According to the U.S. National Park Service, \"The site of Fort Dearborn is near the end of a plateau which is surrounded by ravines on three sides. The ravines were used by the garrison as dumps during the fort's occupation. The fort was constructed of wood with the exception of the fireplaces which were brick. The site of Fort Dearborn has changed little since 1858, when Benjamin L. C. Wailes described it in his diary: 'The outline of the barracks can be seen by scraps of nails, pieces of brick, fragments of glass, pottery and crockery and military buttons, etc.\"\n",

    "2018 video game\n2018 video game\nValthirian Arc: Hero School Story is a video game developed by Agate and published by pQube.  It combines gameplay from management sims and role-playing video games.  Players run a school that teaches adventurers, who eventually go on quests.\nGameplay\nPlayers control the principal of a school for heroes.  Players must train various aspiring adventurers in typical role-playing classes in a management sim-like mode.  They occasionally get requests for specific classes, and they get bonus rewards if they fulfill the requests.  Players can also support various factions in the kingdom after its ruler dies.  Once the adventurers are ready, players are responsible for putting together teams of adventurers and equipping them.  There are two kinds of quest that adventurers can go on: missions that play out without player interaction, and those where players control one of the adventurers alongside three computer-controlled non-player characters.  The non-interactive quests work on a timer.  Over time, players can unlock new classes, and the students graduate as they become more experienced.\nDevelopment\nThe Valthirian Arc series began as flash games.  pQube released Valthirian Arc: Hero School Story for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Switch on October 2, 2018. Agate, an Indonesian video game studio, made a sequel that was released in June 2023.\nReception\nValthirian Arc: Hero School Story received mixed reviews on Metacritic.  Though they found some of the gameplay to be simplistic, Digitally Downloaded said it is a charming game that is fun to play in short bursts.  They felt it was difficult to become attached to the characters given the ephemeral nature of the parties.  However, they enjoyed the dungeon crawls and the world itself. Nintendo World Report said it is enjoyable but suffers somewhat from having too many unpolished, disparate gameplay elements.  Both Digitally Downloaded and Nintendo World Report complained of difficulty spikes. TouchArcade only played the early game.  They sent all their students out on non-interactive adventures, which caused the game to disallow them from playing until 15 minutes had passed.  They said the early game could be \"slow and plodding\", but they enjoyed leveling up their students.\n",
    "\nSpeech by US president George Washington\nThe 1794 State of the Union Address was delivered by the 1st President of the United States, George Washington, to a joint session of the Third United States Congress on November 19, 1794. The speech came in the aftermath of the Whiskey Rebellion, an armed insurrection in the western counties of Pennsylvania against the federal excise tax on whiskey.\nIn his address, Washington expressed regret that \"some of the citizens of the United States have been found capable of insurrection.\" He explained the necessity of enforcing the law through military action, emphasizing the importance of maintaining order and the rule of law, while lamenting the need to summon the militia to quell the rebellion.\nWashington highlighted the failure of peaceful measures, noting that the government's attempts at moderation and reconciliation were misinterpreted as weakness. He described how, despite offering pardons and seeking negotiations, the insurrection continued, leading to the deployment of 15,000 militia troops.\nThe address also stressed the importance of upholding the Constitution, warning against the dangers posed by lawlessness and sedition. Washington praised the militia for their dedication and perseverance, remarking on the \"patriotic cooperation\" between the federal government and the states.\nIn addition to addressing the Whiskey Rebellion, Washington briefly touched upon other issues, including relations with Native American tribes and the nation's foreign policy, particularly the need to avoid entanglements in European conflicts.\n",

    "Russian ice dancer\nIn this name that follows Eastern Slavic naming customs, the patronymic is  Evgenyevich and the family name is  Desyatov.\nIvan \"Vanya\" Evgenyevich Desyatov (Russian: \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0415\u0432\u0433\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0414\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0432; born February 6, 2001) is an American ice dancer. With his current skating partner, Isabella Flores, he is the 2023 CS Golden Spin of Zagreb bronze medalist.\nPersonal life\nDesyatov was born on February 6, 2001, in Moscow, Russia. His parents passed away when he was a young teenager, survived by Desyatov and his brother, Valentin. He graduated from high school in Odintsovo, Russia in 2019.\nCareer\nEarly years\nDesyatov began learning how to skate in 2005 at age four. He was scouted at a public rink in Moscow by his first coach, who encouraged his mother to put him in figure skating. He later began training as an ice dancer at the age of 11, coached by Alexei Gorshkov. Desyatov's early skating partners included Anna Bogomolova and Irina Khavronina, with whom he competed at the novice level. He teamed up with long-time partner Ekaterina Andreeva in 2014, and together they competed at the novice and junior levels for Russia until the end of 2021. Andreeva/Desyatov received a handful of junior international assignments during their seven-year career for Russia, including the 2018 JGP Lithuania where they finished fifth. They also earned podium placements at the 2017 and 2018 Golden Spin of Zagreb and the 2018 Ice Star.\n2021\u201322 season\nAndreeva/Desyatov petitioned the Russian Figure Skating Federation for release to represent Belarus, and their request was granted in advance of the 2021\u201322 season. The team made their debut for Belarus at the 2021 JGP France II where they finished 5th. They followed this performance up with a 7th-place finish at the 2021 JGP Poland and were slated to next compete in the junior ice dance event at the 2021 Denis Ten Memorial Challenge but withdrew ahead of the competition. They concluded their season at the 2022 Belarusian Figure Skating Championships, where they won the junior dance title.\n2022\u201323 season: Debut of Flores/Desyatov\nThe 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted the International Skating Union to exclude athletes representing Russia and Belarus from international competition indefinitely as of March 1, 2022, effectively halting Andreeva/Desyatov's career. The team split after eight years together and, encouraged by his older brother, Desyatov left Belarus, flying to the United States in April with only a loose plan for his future there in place. He ended up in Colorado Springs, Colorado at the Thunderbirds Figure Skating Club, training under former Russian ice dancer Elena Dostatni. There he met his current skating partner, Isabella Flores, who had recently returned home after several months abroad in search of a new partnership. The two skaters tried out and skated together for several months before officially committing to competing together, having both recently gone through major periods of transition. Flores/Desyatov confirmed their partnership for the U.S. in June 2022.\nFlores/Desyatov were initially unable to compete internationally for the U.S. as Desyatov was still awaiting release from the Skating Union of Belarus. They qualified to the 2023 U.S. Figure Skating Championships by placing second in the senior ice dance category at the 2023 Eastern Sectional Championships. Flores/Desyatov finished 10th at the U.S. Championships in late January 2023.\nNegotiations for Desyatov's release from Belarus began at the end of the 2022\u201323 season. The process proved more complicated and financially burdensome than the team initially expected, as the Belarusian federation requested US$25,000 in restitution for Desyatov's training expenses incurred during the season prior. Flores and Desyatov were able to crowdfund the majority of the cost requested, and Flores announced their success in securing Desyatov's release on July 16, 2023.\n2023\u201324 season\nFlores/Desyatov opened their season late, debuting on the ISU Challenger Series at the 2023 CS Golden Spin of Zagreb in early December. They placed third in the rhythm dance and climbed to second in the free dance, ultimately finishing third overall behind Lithuanian champions Allison Reed / Saulius Ambrulevi\u010dius and American compatriots Emilea Zingas / Vadym Kolesnik. The pair also competed in the 2024 U.S. Figure Skating Championships where they finished seventh and received a standing ovation for their free dance.\nPrograms\nWith Flores\nWith Andreeva\nCompetitive highlights\nGP: Grand Prix, CS: Challenger Series, JGP: Junior Grand Prix\nWith Flores for the United States\nWith Andreeva for Belarus\nWith Andreeva for Russia\nDetailed results\nIce dance with Isabella Flores\nSenior results\nExternal links\nIsabella FLORES / Ivan DESYATOV at the International Skating Union\nEkaterina ANDREEVA / Ivan DESYATOV at the International Skating Union",

He has been an Orthodox bishop of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople since September 2000.\nEarly years and education\nTheoliptos was born as Iakovos (Jacob) Fenerlis (Greek: \u0399\u03ac\u03ba\u03c9\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a6\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03bb\u03ae\u03c2, I\u00e1kovos Fenerl\u00eds) on April 17, 1957, in Tarabya (Therapia), a suburb of Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), Turkey. He was the eldest son of Georgios Fenerlis and Olga Vlachopoulou. Raised in a traditional Orthodox Christian household, Iakovos completed his primary education locally before attending the prestigious Zographeion Lyceum in Constantinople, from which he graduated in 1975.\nIn the same year, he moved to Thessaloniki, Greece to pursue higher education in theology. He enrolled in the Faculty of Theology at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, graduating with a bachelor's degree with distinction in 1979 as a scholarship recipient of the Ecumenical Patriarchate.\nOrdination and Early Ecclesiastical Service\nOn April 27, 1977, Iakovos Fenerlis was ordained as a deacon at the St. George's Patriarchal Cathedral, by his spiritual mentor, Metropolitan Bartholomew of Philadelphia (later Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople). Upon his ordination, he assumed the ecclesiastical name of 'Theoliptos'. Theoliptos began his service at the Ecumenical Patriarchate in various roles, initially as a Patriarchal Deacon. He progressed through the ranks, serving as Third Deacon, Second Deacon, and ultimately as Grand Archdeacon (Megas Archidiakonos) from 1995 to 1997. His duties included overseeing many of the administrative and liturgical functions within the Patriarchal court.\nOn November 21, 1997, he was ordained as a presbyter by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, who also appointed him as Grand Archimandrite of the Ecumenical Throne. Theoliptos was further elevated to the role of Grand Protosyncellus (chief administrative officer) of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, a position he held until February 2008.\nMetropolitan of Iconium\nOn September 4, 2000, the Holy and Sacred Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, elected Grand Archimandrite Theoliptos as Metropolitan of Iconium (Greek: \u039c\u03b7\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0399\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03bf\u03c5, Turkish: Konya Metropoliti (Ba\u015fpiskopos)), with the additional titles of Hypertimos and Exarch of All Lycaonia. His election was made at the recommendation of Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, who highly valued Theoliptos\u2019 administrative skills and spiritual dedication. Theoliptos was consecrated as a bishop on September 10, 2000, at the St. George's Patriarchal Cathedral in the Fener. His consecration was officiated by Patriarch Bartholomew and was co-officiated by several metropolitans. Despite his elevation, he continued to serve as Grand Protosyncellus until 2008.\nThroughout his ecclesiastical career, Metropolitan Theoliptos has been known as a close collaborator of Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and has played an important role in the administration of the Ecumenical Patriarchate.\n",

    "Cult mass murder-suicide\nFrom 30 September to 5 October 1994, 53 members or former members of the Order of the Solar Temple died in a series of mass murders and suicides in Morin-Heights, Quebec, Canada, and in Cheiry and Salvan in Switzerland. The Solar Temple, or OTS, was founded in 1984, active in several Francophone countries. The group was led by Joseph Di Mambro with Luc Jouret as a second in command;  the group had a theological doctrine that by committing suicide, one would not die, but \"transit\"; they conceptualized the transit as a ritual involving magic fire, where they would undergo a spiritual voyage to the star Sirius, where they would continue their lives. \nFollowing several scandals and outside pressures the group faced, this idea became more prominent. They began to plan the \"transit\" and wrote a letter declaring their intents and purposes in the act, called The Testament. On 30 September 1994, the Dutoit family, former members, were ritualistically murdered in Morin-Heights alongside their infant child by members Jo\u00ebl Egger, Jerry Genoud, and Dominique Bellaton; Di Mambro held a grievance against the Dutoits for past betrayal and may have believed their child to be the antichrist. On the night of 2 to 3 October, 23 members in Cheiry in Switzerland, many of those considered \"Traitors\" to the movement were killed via gunshot by Egger and Jouret. The members in Salvan, numbered 25, died from poison injections. \nThe bodies in Switzerland were found on 5 October. In all, 53 people died, including several children. Both Jouret and Di Mambro died in the mass suicide in Salvan. Some of the deaths were genuine suicides, but others were murdered for betraying the movement; many members had been lured into death with the promise that money they had given to the group would be returned to them. Others may have consented to being killed by other members, but it is not known how many agreed to die. The locations were then set on fire with an automated ignition system triggered by telephone. The investigation was criticized for some of its decisions, and several aspects spawned conspiracy theories.\nThe group was obscure prior to the deaths, but following the discovery of the bodies and the suicides it became notorious, resulting in a media frenzy. The events strengthened the anti-cult movement in Europe and abroad. Though the group's leaders died in the incident, mass suicides/murders of remaining members followed in 1995 in France and in Canada in 1997.\nBackground\nThe Order of the Solar Temple was a cult active in several French-speaking countries, led by Joseph Di Mambro and Luc Jouret. Founded in 1984, it was a Neo-Templar secret society with eclectic beliefs sourced from many different movements like Rosicrucianism, Theosophy, and the New Age. The group reached its peak of membership in January 1989, with 442 members but following scandals, it began to decline. The group was quite obscure prior to the events that would occur.\nCheiry is a hamlet of about 280 people, about 30 kilometres (19\u00a0mi) south of the Swiss city of Fribourg, while Granges-sur-Salvan is a resort town about 90 kilometres (56\u00a0mi) away from Cheiry. Morin-Heights is a resort town near Montreal, Quebec, in the Laurentian Mountains, then with a population of 4,000. Jouret, Di Mambro, and Camille Pilet (a retired sales direct of the Piaget SA watch company) owned 3 villas in Granges-sur-Salvan, as well as a luxury condominium complex in Morin-heights. The group owned a farm called La Rochette in Cheiry.\nThe \"transit\" concept had first been brought up by Di Mambro in 1990 or 1991. It was to mean a voluntary departure of the members to another dimension in space, or an act of consent to bring the \"germ of life\" to another planet. He told the members that they would be summoned on short notice, and would need to be ready as this could occur any day. They conceptualized the transit as a ritual involving magic fire, where they would undergo a spiritual voyage to the star Sirius. According to the later testimony of members, they did not interpret it as mass suicide. According to Di Mambro, he did not know yet how they would transit, though he metaphorically evoked the ideas of being picked up by a flying saucer or passing across a mirror.\nBeginning in the late 1980s, several members began to doubt Di Mambro, and several scandals and issues rocked its membership. In March 1993, Jouret and several other members became embroiled in a gun scandal. Jouret had asked members Hermann Delorme and Jean-Pierre Vinet to buy three semi-automatic guns with silencers, illegal in Canada, resulting in the three being arrested. Properties were raided by police in March of that year, and several members were arrested. Jouret and the other two men were given only light sentences after the crime (one year of unsupervised probation and a $1000 fine intended to be paid to the Red Cross), but in the aftermath the media took interest in the group.

    "\nEduardo Caturla V\u00e1zquez (born 25 November 1953) is a Spanish former football manager. His managerial career, beginning in his late 20s, was mostly spent in the lower leagues, besides spells in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n with Salamanca (1989) and M\u00e9rida (1991).\nCareer\nBorn in Madrid, Caturla was managing Pegaso before signing for Rayo Vallecano of Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B in June 1984. He achieved promotion in his only season, but subsequently said that he wanted to remain as manager only if the new president could solve the club's financial issues.\nCaturla moved in June 1985 to Calvo Sotelo, newly relegated to the third tier. A year later, with the club having gone down another division, he returned to the national capital and became manager of Atl\u00e9tico Madrile\u00f1o, the reserve team of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. In July 1987, he moved on to Getafe and was replaced by Isel\u00edn Santos Ovejero.\nIn March 1989 Caturla reached the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n for the first time, signing for Salamanca for the rest of the season. The club from Castile and Le\u00f3n paid compensation to Getafe for him to succeed Jos\u00e9 Luis Garc\u00eda Traid. On his debut on 2 March, he won 2\u20130 at home to Figueres. He was sacked by the Charros at the end of October for not meeting the expectations of the board.\nCaturla's only other spell in the second tier was for the first 11 games of 1991\u201392, in charge of M\u00e9rida. He was sacked in November, with the executive saying that it was to prevent his \"suffering\", and he was replaced by former Real Madrid player Juanito in his first managerial job. Caturla called the decision \"unfair, hasty and even strange\".\nAs president of the Royal Spanish Football Federation's Committee of Managers, Caturla spoke out against unlicenced managers, accusing them of \"professional intrusion\". In September 2018, he and former players Fernando Giner and Vicente Engonga were named delegates to the Spain national football team.\n",

The film was developed to exploit and replicate the box office success of The Awful Dr. Orloff (1962). It was initially made with he title of Robot in November 1962, and financed by Claude Makovski when the previous film was screened in Paris. Director Jes\u00fas Franco wrote the script and story himself, despite the Spanish print crediting Nicole Guettard on the film prints.\nIn an interview published in 1991, Franco said he could not get Howard Vernon to play the role of Professor Fisherman as he could not afford Vernon's plane ticket, let alone his airplane ticket. Years later, Franco alternatively said it would have been wrong to use the actor, saying for the role he wanted something \"dirtier, something \"lower.\"\"\nShooting began on January 26, 1964 and lasted until March 28. THe film was shot in Aranjuez, El Escorial, San Mart\u00edn de Valdeiglesias, Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Barajas, and Guadarrama. While filming at Castillo de Alconchel, the castle's second flat floor collapsed under the feet of make-up artists Pilar Echevarr\u00eda, who suffered consequences so severe that Franco said \"She never fully really recovered.\"\nRelease\nIn June 1964, Leo Films sold the rights to Dr. Orloff's Monster to distributor Nueva Films. The Madrid-based Compa\u00f1\u00eda Cinematogr\u00e1fica Exportadora took care of foreign sales. Film historians Francesco Cesari and Roberto Curti described the film as having troubled release in Spain, with no release in Madrid, and being distributed by Valencia by Viuda de Jos\u00e9 Mateu, an obscure one-man distributor that covered the Eastern region of Spain. The two authors said a screening had allegedly happened in Oviedo at Cine Campoamor on January 16, 1965, while other screenings happened on October 12, 1965, in Las Palmas in the Canary Islands.\nThe film was released abroad, including in France on January 16, 1966, as Les Ma\u00eetresses du Docteur Jekyll. Franco was adamant about how he disliked the title, saying it was a \"crazy idea\" and he \"didn't think it's a good title. It would have been more successful if we had called it 'Orloff.'\" The French version of the film was also released in Ottawa, Canada at Cin\u00e9ma de Paris. It was released in the United States on television in English as Dr. Orloff's Monster on April 3, 1966.\nDr. Orloff\u2019s Monster was released on blu-ray on February 7, 2017.\nReception\nThe Madrid-based newspaper El mundo deportivo described the film as \"the best film helmed by Jes\u00fas Franco\" comparing the film to the work of Orson Welles stating the Franco's admiration of the director is patent, 80% of the film being shot in the same style as Welles' The Trial (1962).\n",
    "Spanish businessman (1946\u20132024)\nFernando Puche Do\u00f1a (2 September 1946 \u2013 14 September 2024) was a Spanish businessman. He was the president of football club M\u00e1laga from 1997 to 2001, a period in which the club achieved consecutive promotions from the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B to La Liga.\nPuche had other business interests, including the Plaza de toros de La Malagueta, and hotels in Cuba and Spain. He was indicted in an operation against tobacco smuggling in 1999 and was convicted in 2010, being fined \u20ac16.6 million. He was sentenced to two years in prison in 2019 for concealing his assets in relation to the fine.\nBusiness career\nBorn in M\u00e1laga in Andalusia on 2 September 1946, Puche was raised in the neighbourhood of Huelin\u00a0. When he was 5, his mother died and he moved to La Trinidad (M\u00e1laga)\u00a0. He began working at age 10, washing glasses at his father's bar. A gifted student, he was unable to continue his studies due to his work.\nReturning to Huelin, Puche worked as a waiter in a restaurant where he became manager at 17. He married at 24 and had two sons and two daughters. A friend proposed a new business, supplying food and daily items to ships docked in the harbour, and their enterprise became the second-largest in Europe in its sector. Other business interests included the management of the Plaza de toros de La Malagueta and the M\u00e1laga Carnival.\nPuche's property company Edisol built 1,000 social housing units in Antequera, as well as a barracks for the Civil Guard. As of 2010, he owned nine hotels in Cuba and two in Torremolinos, employing 1,100 people and hosting 4,000 beds.\nPresidency of M\u00e1laga CF\nIn 1992, after the dissolution of the local football club CD M\u00e1laga, he became part of the board at the new M\u00e1laga CF, serving as vice president to Federico Beltr\u00e1n. In 1997, Puche bought out Beltr\u00e1n and became president of the club, who were in the third-tier Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B. He fired manager Tolo Plaza and hired Ismael D\u00edaz. His first signing was former Boca Juniors player Pablo Trobbiani, who hardly played, while other signings such as Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Movilla and Sandro played a bigger part in the team's promotion as champions.\nWith the team playing in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n for 1998\u201399, Puche brought in Joaqu\u00edn Peir\u00f3 as manager. Mass media company Grupo Zeta, owned by Antonio Asensio, provided the investment for 19 new players, including Catanha and Francisco Rufete. Puche predicted that the club would be promoted on 30 May, his name day after Ferdinand III of Castile; this came to be with a 3\u20132 home win over Albacete with three games remaining.\nIn preparation for playing in La Liga, Puche signed Ajax-trained midfielder Kiki Musampa, a deal that he called \"a milestone in the history of milestones\". Peir\u00f3 wanted to sign Pedro Munitis from Racing de Santander, a player he had trained at Badajoz; Puche met the player's \u20ac13 million release clause but he chose not to leave.\nPuche sought for M\u00e1laga CF to pay for the 3 billion Spanish peseta renovation of La Rosaleda Stadium, in exchange for its owners \u2013 the city and provincial councils and the Regional Government of Andalusia \u2013 ceding the property to the club. This proposal was vetoed by the mayor, Celia Villalobos. In September 1999, the three public bodies reached an agreement in which a new public limited company would be in charge of renovating the stadium, while operation of the ground would be leased to the football club for 50 years and an annual rent of one peseta.\nWith M\u00e1laga secure in the top flight but facing financial issues, Puche resigned in 2001 during a dinner at a fan club in Manzanares, Ciudad Real. Seraf\u00edn Rold\u00e1n\u00a0, already 92% shareholder in the club, took over as president.\nTobacco smuggling\nIn 1999, Puche was indicted in an operation against tobacco smuggling. He was convicted in 2010 and fined \u20ac16.6 million. In 2019, he was convicted of concealing his assets in relation to this fine and given a suspended sentence of two years in prison. He was called to prison in April 2021 for non-payment, but appealed on claims of having an incurable disease. This was rejected on lack of evidence in November 2022 and he voluntarily entered the prison in Alhaur\u00edn el Grande.\nDeath\nPuche died at home on 14 September 2024, at the age of 78. His former football club paid tribute before their match against Huesca that day. His funeral was held privately.\n",

    "Record label\nPPX Enterprises, Inc. was the umbrella organization for various PPX entities which includes P.P.X. and PPX Productions. The label, like its Founder Ed Chalpin is quite likely remembered for its dealings Jimi Hendrix and producing cover versions of past hits.\nBackground\nPPX Enterprises, Inc. provided cover versions of top hits from the 1950s to the present in various genres. These could be obtained for use by record companies, duplicators, for films use, background music, radio and television.\nThe company was formed by Ed Chalpin in 1961, who had been in the music business since 1956.\nKnown for turning out cover-versions of songs, it was estimated in 1975 that PPX had a catalogue of around 5,000 titles. Subsidiaries of PPX Enterprises include Dimensional Sound which was located at 301 W 54 St., New York, NY 10019.\nMusic trade magazine Billboard once referred to Ed Chalpin as a pioneer of cover version recordings. Cover versions are sometimes referred to as exploito, and in reference to psychedelic rock cover versions, the term is part of the title of the album, I Said, She Said, Ah Cid: The Exploito Psych World Of Alshire Records 1967-71.\nArtists who were signed over the years to PPX include, Jimmy Cliff, Jimi Hendrix, Curtis Knight, Anthony Swete and Ella Moore.\nHistory\n1960s\nIn 1962, Ed Chalpin had signed contracts with RCA Mexicana and Gamma Records to promote his pre-recorded tapes catalogue.\nIt was reported by Cash Box in the magazine's 18 November 1962 issue that PPX Enterprises were expanding their business into Latin America. Under Ed Chalpin's supervision, Stanley Steinhouse would be covering the development of PPX in all the Latin American markets. Representing PPX Enterprises in Venezuela was Fabrica Venezolana de Discos which Steinhouse was also involved with. Also the Hitsvillve series of records with PPX recordings had been issued.\nThe 4 November, 1967 issue of RPM Weekly wrote that PPX Enterprises had announced the finalization of their national negotiations for two new Jimi Hendrix LPs. The English Decca and London labels were set to run with them. There were also negotiations in process for release Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\nChalpin had announced that P.P.X. Enterprises, Inc. had opened an office in Canada at 2050 Stanley Street, Montreal on 12 August 1967. Starting off with French Canada, the territory was to be overseen by Andre Montell. The plan was to later expand to include the rest of the country.\n1970s to 1980s\nAccording to Cash Box in the magazine's May 9, 1970 issue, Anthony Swete along with Curtis Knight and Ella Moore were to have releases in the near future on the Paramount label. They were to be promoted under the wing of Bill Gallagher of Famous Music. With Knight's album Down in the Village already released, Swete and Moore were to have their recordings released in the near future.\nIt was reported by Billboard in the magazine's 17 February, 1973 issue that PPX Enterprises, Inc. had taken legal action against the administrator of Jimi Hendrix's estate, Polydor Records; Track Records, Michael Frank Jeffery, of London, and Yameta Ltd., Nassau, Bahamas. The case came about as a result of Hendrix who was making a living as a guitarist and a member of The Squires had made a recording at PPX Studios with a member of the group and on October 15, 1965, had entered into a contract for three years.\nAs of July 1979, PPX Enterprises, Inc. was located at 301 West 54th St., New York, N.Y. 10019.\n1990s to 2020s\nIn April 1999, Chuck D, the frontman for the group Public Enemy and their producer, Hank Shocklee were directed by a judge to pay PPX more than $87,120 due to a violation of an agreement. Apparently PPX was denied $65,881.30 in revenue from recordings on Def Jame that Public Enemy made between 1994 and 1998.\nAccording to the 6 July 2021 issue of Fader, PPX Enterprises owner Ed Chalpin had been enlisted by A Tribe Called Quest to oversee their deal with Jive Records. Apparently, founding member Ali Shaheed Muhammad and the rest of the group were unaware that Chalpin had added a clause to the deal that with the next five records, his company PPX Enterprises would be getting a percentage of the royalties. When the band were recording their Low End Theory album they embarked on a mission to have the clause erased. A court case involving Jive Records ensued. They later discovered that PPX had sold their share of a settlement they made with Jive Records to a party who entered into a partnership with the music royalties portal, Royalty Exchange.\nArtists\nJimmy Cliff had signed with PPX in 1973. It was reported in the 12 May 1973 edition of Billboard that Chalpin was now the manager of singer Cliff and had signed deals with Warner Brothers, and EMI.\nJimi Hendrix had signed a contract with PPX in 1965 when he was Curtis Knight's side man.\nThe Hubs were an unnamed group of studio musicians who recorded instrumental cover versions for PPX.

Reznik filed a lawsuit for the protection of honor and dignity, but lost the case. The court denied his claim to declare Vakhrusheva's words untrue.\nOn December 8, 2012, he was expelled from the party (according to the Federal Bureau of the party, for actual consent to falsifications when counting votes in the elections of deputies of the Legislative Assembly of St. Petersburg). He was accused of supporting close friends who received fake mandates: Olga Galkina and Vyacheslav Notyag. According to some observers, the falsifications could have been beneficial to United Russia. Maxim Reznik himself considers this a political reprisal. Supporters of the expelled associate this with the fact that Reznik was the leader of the intra-party opposition, and this was a continuation of the story with attempts to jointly expel him from the party along with Ilya Yashin.\nWith Yevgeny Roizman and Ilya Yashin at the Forum of Independent Deputies \"Municipal Russia\", 2021\nOn March 23, 2021, Reznik moved to a meeting of the Legislative Assembly of St. Petersburg with deputies from Yabloko and announced his disagreements with the head of the Party of Growth faction Oksana Dmitrieva.\nI moved, as they say, forever. I was just looking for a reason: our political paths diverged from the moment Dmitrieva supported Alexander Beglov, and I immediately said that he was not suitable for St. Petersburg. The second point is that she supports the foreign policy of Vladimir Putin. And thirdly, the nomination of the Sukhodolsky candidates, who contribute to the victory of United Russia in the districts, the destruction of the policy that seems right to me - the joint struggle against United Russia ...\nLater, a deputy from Yabloko Boris Vishnevsky said that Yabloko was re",

    "Appendix N is a list of books and authors which informed the creation of Dungeons and Dragons. The term now covers a loose literary aesthetic of pulp fantasy and planetary romance.\nHistory\nThe Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Dungeon Master's Guide (1979) was a book written by Gary Gygax to help people run games of Dungeons and Dragons (D&D). It contained a series of appendices, including one titled \u201cAppendix N: Inspirational and Educational Reading\u201d. Appendix N was a list of authors and works that were identified by Gary Gygax as the source of many concepts, tropes, spells and monsters that were used in the development of D&D.\nThe list specifies 28 authors, 22 specific books, and 12 different book series; it is one of the foundations on which fantasy roleplaying was built. A revised and expanded version of the list was published as \u201cAppendix E: Inspirational Reading\u201d, in the 5th Edition Player's Handbook (2014).\nAppendix N is now used to describe a subset of imaginative fantasy and science fiction from the early-to-mid 20th Century that predates the global mass media popularity of the genre; much of the work in the list was originally published as serials in pulp magazines of the 1930s.\nImpact on D&D\nAppendix N set the tone for fantasy roleplaying. The early design of D&D drew so widely from Appendix N influences, that very few of the classic monsters are even claimed as Product Identity by Wizards of the Coast (notable exceptions including the Beholder and the Mind Flayer).  According to Appendix N researcher, Jeffro Johnson, if you read Appendix N then a great many of the oddities of classic D&D will start to make sense.\nGary Gygax has stated that D&D was not meant to recreate the work of any one specific author in the Appendix, but his list singled out the impact of L. Sprague de Camp & Fletcher Pratt, Robert E. Howard, Fritz Leiber, Jack Vance, H. P. Lovecraft, and A. Merritt over the others. The impact of J.R.R. Tolkien is also evident in races such as the Halfling (originally Hobbit), the division of elves, the ubiquitous orc, and the Ranger character class (after Aragorn), although Gygax professed Tolkien's impact was \u201cminimal\u201d and dismissed the Ring Trilogy as \u201ctedious\u201d.\nD&D's influential alignment system of Law vs Chaos was derived from the Elric stories of Michael Moorcock and their precursors in Poul Anderson\u2019s Three Hearts and Three Lions, which also inspired the player character class of Paladin. The player character class of Barbarian is a direct nod to Robert E. Howard\u2019s Conan stories, although this remains the subject of debate amongst fans who class the character variously as a fighter, thief, or hybrid of the two. The concept of dungeons with multiple levels connected by secret doors is derived from Margaret St. Clair, especially Sign of the Labrys, while the inspiration for the Drow and the Underdark were derived from both Merritt and St Clair.\nD&D\u2019s engine of memorised spells is known as the \u201cVancian magic system\u201d after the work of Jack Vance, who also inspired the Thief player class, and several early spells. Vance freely gave permission to Gygax to use his Ioun Stones as a magical item in the game on the condition that his books received a mention (as they then did in the Appendix).\nHowever, not everyone was as happy to be so influential: the first edition of the Deities & Demigods reference book  included statistics for nonhuman characters from the Cthulhu Mythos of H.P. Lovecraft and the Melnibon\u00e9an mythos from Michael Moorcock, both of which were the subject of legal threats and were removed from subsequent editions. TSR was served with papers threatening damages to the tune of half a million dollars by Elan Merchandising on behalf of the Tolkien Estate in connection with D&D and a Five Armies game. TSR were told to removed Balrog, Dragon, Dwarf, Elf, Ent, Goblin, Hobbit, Orc, and Warg from the game, but eventually all but Hobbit, Ent and Balrog were ruled as public domain.\nWorks listed in Appendix N\nWorks cited but not formally listed include EC Comics books, medieval bestiaries and fairy tales.  The original list did not feature Clark Ashton Smith, which Gygax later addressed as an omission. Some of the books and series include an \u201cet al\u201d, indicating that their further works were also partially included in the list.\nAuthors\nLeigh Brackett\nFredric Brown\nAugust Derleth\nLord Dunsany\nH.P.

    "Judicial building in Dornoch, Scotland\nDornoch Sheriff Court, also known as County Buildings, is a former judicial building on Castle Street in Dornoch in Scotland. The building, which is now used as a restaurant, is a Category B listed building.\nHistory\nThe courtroom with its pointed arch ceiling\nIn the first half of the 19th century, court hearings were held in a room in the tower of Dornoch Castle, accessed by a spiral staircase. However, in the mid-19th century, the Sutherland Commissioners of Supply decided to procure a dedicated courthouse for the county. At that time, Dornoch was the county town of Sutherland and the site they selected was on the south side of Castle Street, between Dornoch Jail and Dornoch Castle.\nThe new building was designed by Thomas Brown in the Gothic Tudor Revival style, built in ashlar stone and was completed in 1850. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of five bays facing onto Castle Street. The central section of three bays, which was projected forward, featured a loggia formed by three round headed openings with hood moulds. On the first floor, there were three closely-set round headed lancet windows with a stepped gable above, flanked by two square-headed lancet windows with smaller gables above. The outer bays were fenestrated by round-headed windows on the ground floor and by sash windows on the first floor with small gables above. Internally, the principal room was a courtroom, which featured a pointed arch ceiling, on the first floor.\nIn 1890 county councils were established in each county of Scotland under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889. It also directed that the existing clerk to each county's Commissioners of Supply should automatically become the first clerk to the county council. Whilst the Sutherland commissioners met at the Sheriff Court, by then known as County Buildings, in Dornoch, their clerk at the time, George Tait, was based in Golspie. His offices therefore became the county council's first offices. The first provisional meeting of the council was held on 13 February 1890 at the County Buildings in Dornoch, but it was decided that a more accessible location was needed for the council's meetings. Although Dornoch was the county's only burgh, it was in the extreme south-eastern corner of the county and lay some seven miles from its then nearest railway station at The Mound. The council's first official meeting was held on 22 May 1890 at Bonar Bridge, and subsequent meetings were generally held at various premises in Lairg, with occasional meetings in other places, including Dornoch, Golspie, Brora and Lochinver. In 1892, permanent offices for the administrative staff were established in a building in Main Street, Golspie, which became known as the County Offices.\nMeanwhile, the building in Dornoch continued to serve as the local sheriff court until hearings were transferred to Tain Sheriff Court in 2014. The Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service subsequently disposed of the building and it now operates as a restaurant known as \"Green's at the Courthouse, Dornoch\".\nSee also\nList of listed buildings in Dornoch, Highland",
    "Geological formation in Morocco\nThe Akrabou Formation is a Late Cretaceous (latest Cenomanian to early/mid Turonian)-aged geological formation and Konservat-Lagerst\u00e4tte in Morocco. It overlies the slightly older freshwater deposits of the Kem Kem Group, which it was once thought to be apart of. It was deposited over following the Kem Kem ecosystem's submergence by the Tethys Ocean during a marine transgression from the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event, as part of a wider deposition of carbonate platforms across the region from the event.\nLocalities\nThe Akrabou Formation has outcrops across the Anti-Atlas, but it has two especially prominent localities: Agoult and Goulmima (also known as Asfla). The Agoult locality is also commonly referred to as Gara Sbaa due to it outcropping at the hill of the same name, but this name is also used for the underlying freshwater-based deposit of the Kem Kem Group at the same locality, which may lead to nomenclatural confusion. Both localities are considered lagerst\u00e4tten due to their excellently preserved fossils, but they differ in time period, paleoenvironment, and preservation of fossils.\nThe Agoult locality is the older of the two and appears to have been deposited around the time of the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event, dating it to latest Cenomanian or earliest Turonian. It is a plattenkalk that contains excellently preserved two-dimensional fossils of fish, land plants, marine and terrestrial invertebrates, and some terrestrial reptiles. The presence of a significant terrestrial component indicates it was deposited in a shallow marine environment close to shore, although the deposits record the gradual deepening of the habitat as the sea level rose.\nIn contrast, the Goulmima locality is younger, dating to the early or mid Turonian, and appears to have been deposited in an offshore environment on the continental shelf. Fossils from this locality, which include fish and marine reptiles, are found in concretions and have a unique three-dimensional preservation akin to that of the older Santana Formation in Brazil.\nIn addition, several other localities are also known, some of which cross the border into Algeria, which have a rich fauna of ammonites and nautiloids.\nPaleoenvironment\nIn the basal Agoult horizons of the formation, a number of plant remains are known, which are similar to those found in southern Europe at the same time, suggesting floristic exchanges between northern Africa and southern Europe. Based on these, the paleoclimate of the ecosystem, at least earlier during its deposition, is suggested to have been a mildly dry subtropical climate akin to that of the modern western Canary Islands.\nPaleobiota\nMost fish are documented in a species list from Amalfitano et al (2020) & Cooper et al (2023):\nVertebrates\nCartilaginous fish\nBony fish\nReptiles\nMollusks\nBased on Kennedy et al (2008) & Meister et al (2017):\nArthropods\nPartially based on Garassino, Angeli & Pasini (2014):\nPlants\nBased primarily on Krassilov & Bacchia (2013):\n",

The E10 EV gained a 1.08 meter narrow body that could accommodate only the driver, which was distinguished by its characteristic angular design and small wheels. A simple, minimalist dashboard has only a small, monochrome display in front of the steering wheel and two physical switches for manual air conditioning to the right of the driver.\nBehind the passenger cabin there is a transport compartment with a capacity of 1.7 cubic meters in the form of a permanently attached box with a regular, shapely shape. Access to it was made possible not only through the rear swing doors, but also through the same pair located on the side of the vehicle. With a relatively low weight of 620 kilograms, the load capacity of the Wuling E10 EV was 200 kilograms, and thanks to its small dimensions, the turning radius was 4.3 meters.\nSpecifications\nThe Wuling E10 EV was powered by a fully electric system created by a 29 HP engine, the maximum speed of which was limited to 70 km/h. According to the manufacturer, a small battery with a capacity of 9 kWh will allow you to travel up to 150 kilometers on a single charge at an average speed of 40 km/h in urban conditions.\n",
    "Judicial building in Oban, Scotland\nOban Sheriff Court is a judicial building on Albany Street in Oban in Scotland. The building, which remains in use as a courthouse, is a Category B listed building.\nHistory\nThe current building was intended to replace an earlier courthouse and prison in Argyll Square, which had been designed by David Rhind and completed in 1856. In the 1880s the Argyll Commissioners of Supply decided to procure a more substantial courthouse for the county. The site they selected was on the southeast side of Albany Street.\nThe building was designed by David MacKintosh in the Italianate style, built in ashlar stone and was completed in 1889. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of five bays facing onto Albany Street. The central bay featured a square-headed doorway flanked by pilasters and brackets supporting a balcony with urns and a balustraded front. The other bays on the ground floor, which was rusticated, were fenestrated by square headed sash windows, while the bays on the first floor were fenestrated by round-headed windows with archivolts. The first floor windows were separated by pilasters with imposts supporting the archivolts. At roof level there was a modillioned cornice and a parapet. Internally, the principal area was the main courtroom on the first floor extending right across the main frontage. The courtroom featured finely carved palmettes on the wooden bench, the jury box and the dock.\nNotable cases which appeared in front of the court included the trial and conviction of the Scotland international rugby union player, John MacCallum, who was a conscientious objector during the First World War. He was fined \u00a32 for being absent without leave. In March 1953, the court was the venue for the inquest into the deaths of two crew members from the Islay lifeboat, who died from carbon monoxide poisoning during an attempt to save the lives of 15 fishermen on the fishing trawler Michael Griffiths. The whole crew of the Michael Griffiths were also died.\nThe building was refurbished in 1990 but in such a way that its original internal finishings were largely retained. More recently, the building was the venue for the claim by a retired lawyer, Ian Hamilton, against Royal Bank of Scotland for failure to disclose its true financial position prior to is collapse in 2008. Hamilton abandoned the case when the sheriff ruled that the case was too complex to proceed without going before a higher court.\nSee also\nList of listed buildings in Oban",

The author of the coat of arms and flag project was Dr. Alberto Rosa Fioravanti, at the request of the then Governor of the State, General Paulo Torres. The flag was re-confirmed on 23 July 1975 following the state's merger with Guanabara.\nPrevious flags\nDuring the period of the Empire, the then-province of Rio de Janeiro used an informal nautical flag, similar in design to the current one, but without a coat of arms and with the upper left and lower right rectangles in blue.\nAfter the creation of the state of Rio de Janeiro with the constitution of 1891, the old provincial flag was used, with a change in the position of the blue and white quarters, and with the addition of the state coat of arms.\nUntil 1937, when the Vargas Government prohibited state symbologies through the 1937 Constitution, Rio de Janeiro used a very similar flag and coat of arms, as described in the legislation of the coat of arms of the state of Rio de Janeiro. In 1947, after the edition of a new state constitution and the authorization for the use of symbols by states and municipalities by the 1946 Brazilian Constitution, the old flag returned to use, until 1965, with the edition of the aforementioned law, which regulated and regularized the use of that flag.\nGallery\n Unofficial flag of the province of Rio de Janeiro\nFlag of the State of Rio de Janeiro from 1891 to 1937 and 1947\u20131965, depicting a different version of the state coat of arms\n",
    "Species of conifer/fern/flowering plant\nRhodamnia sessiliflora, commonly known as iron malletwood, is a small tree in the eucalyptus family Myrtaceae, found only in the Wet Tropics bioregion of Queensland, Australia.\nDescription\nRhodamnia sessiliflora is a small tree up to 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) tall, and the trunk may be buttressed. The new shoots and young twigs are clothed in very fine pale or white hairs, and leaves are simple (undivided) and without lobes or teeth on the margins. They are arranged in opposite pairs on the twigs, on petioles up to 8\u00a0mm (0.31\u00a0in) long. Leaves are ovate to elliptic and measure up to 13\u00a0cm (5.1\u00a0in) long by 6\u00a0cm (2.4\u00a0in) wide. They have two intramarginal veins, a feint one very close to the margin and a conspicuous one about 5\u00a0mm (0.20\u00a0in) inside the margin.\nFlowers are produced in small clusters in the leaf axils \u2014 i.e. in the angle between the petiole and the twig. They are have four cream or white petals about 3\u00a0mm (0.12\u00a0in) long. The fruit is a globose, purple or black berry about 1\u00a0cm (0.39\u00a0in) diameter, containing anywhere from 14 to 40 small seeds about 3\u00a0mm (0.12\u00a0in) long.\nPhenology\nFlowering occurs from October to July and fruit appear from December to June.\nTaxonomy\nThis species was first described in 1867 by the English botanist George Bentham, and published in his book Flora Australiensis: a description of the plants of the Australian territory. He chose the species epithet sessilis due to the plant having sessile (i.e. stemless) flowers and fruit.\nDistribution and habitat\nRhodamnia sessiliflora is restricted to coastal and subcoastal parts of northeastern Queensland, extending from about Rossville south to the Paluma Range National Park. It grows in well developed rainforest and monsoon forest on various soils, at altitudes from near sea level to about 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft).\nEcology\nFruit of this tree are eaten by cassowaries (Casuarius casuarius), figbirds (Sphecotheres vieilloti), spotted catbirds (Ailuroedus maculosus) and Lewin's honeyeaters (Meliphaga lewinii).\nDiseases and conservation\nAs a plant in the Myrtaceae family, this species is susceptible to the introduced pathogen Puccinia psidii \u2014 commonly known as myrtle rust \u2014 and is in rapid decline. It is listed as endangered under the Queensland Government's Nature Conservation Act. As of 17\u00a0September\u00a02024, it has not been assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\nGallery\nTrunk\nFoliage, and twigs covered in fine hairs\nUnderside of leaf, showing intramarginal veins\nSessile flowers\nLeaves with myrtle rust damage\n",

    "Organization dedicated to promoting the welfare for American Mustangs\nThe Mustang Heritage Foundation, is an American organization dedicated to supporting the welfare of feral horses (mustangs) and donkeys (burros). The organization works closely with the US Bureau of Land Management to support its efforts.\nAs of 2016, programs run by the Mustang Heritage Foundation had resulted in over 6300 mustangs being adopted. These adoptions saved the BLM (and consequently taxpayers) over $217 million. The most famous of its programs is the Extreme Mustang Makeover, a competition among horse trainers to quickly train mustangs and showcase their skills. As of 2024 more than 25,000 adoptions have been facilitated, though still 60,000 mustangs remain in BLM holding facilities.\nThe MHF receives substantial funding from the BLM, $4 million in 2023. It also receives funding from various industry sponsors including Western Horseman magazine, Dodge, Purina, and many others.\nNote that the Mustang Heritage Foundation is separate from the Mustang Champions organization, which runs the Mustang Magic, Mustang Challenge and Mustang Classic events.\nHistory\nThe Wild Horse and Burro Program was created in 1971 by the Bureau of Land Management, part of the United States Department of the Interior. Its purpose was to manage the herds of feral horses and donkeys roaming lands in the Western US. This involves controlling the sizes of the herds so that they do not tax the natural resources too much and endanger themselves or other animals. Ideally the BLM tries to have the mustangs and burros it removes from the wild adopted privately. This has become more challenging as the years have passed.\nWild mustangs\nIn 2001, the Mustang Heritage Foundation was established aiming to help the BLM find homes for mustangs and burros collected from the wild and to minimize the amount of time these animals have to remain in holding facilities. The organization has facilitated the adoption of thousands of animals.\nIn 2007, the MHF held its first Extreme Mustang Makeover event in Fort Worth. The Foundation arranged for 100 horse trainers to spend 100 days training 100 mustangs fresh from the wild. During the event, the trainers competed for prizes to demonstrate how domesticated their horses were and how ready for real-world use. The wildly successful event has since been held annually and similar events are now held across the country to promote interest in mustangs.\nAt the same time that the Extreme Mustang Makeover was founded, the Trainer Incentive Program was also founded. The TIP program provided funds to horse trainers who choose to take on mustangs. In conjunction with the EMM, TIP helped indirectly encourage many adoptions. The TIP program was discontinued in 2023 because of a withdrawal of funding by the BLM.\nExtreme Mustang Makeover\n Logo of the Extreme Mustang Makeover\nThe signature creation of the Mustang Heritage Foundation has been the Extreme Mustang Makeover. Talented trainers from around the country compete to train newly acquired mustangs from the Bureau of Land Management in 100 days and showcase their skills in arena competitions. The \nshowcased horses are then auctioned for adoption. The proceeds from the sales of these trained horses are split between the trainers and the BLM. Not only this, the publicity generated by the competition helps spark interest in other mustangs that the BLM brings to these events.\nHorse and rider in Extreme Mustang Makeover event\nStarting from one event in 2007 this concept has blossomed into multiple events across the country, some directly sponsored by the MHF and some sponsored by other organizations. In 2024, there was:\nMustang Magic, Forth Worth, TX - Jan 19-21\nMustang Heritage Spectacular, Franklin, TN - Jun 11\nMeeker Mustang Makeover, Seeker, CO - Aug 24\nFort Worth Mustang Show, Fort Worth TX - Sep 6-7\nEMM New Jersey, Logan Township, NJ  - Oct 20-24\nEMM, Glen Rose, TX - Dec 6-7\nIn addition to the regular Extreme Mustang Makeover programs, the MHF  also runs an EMM Youth Division that allows teenage mustang enthusiasts to train mustangs and compete for prizes.\nOther programs\nThe MHF has maintained various other programs over the years, including:\nTrainer Incentive Program\nTrainer's Council\nVeterans and Mustangs\nYouth Scholarship Program\nMustang Million\nMustang Storefront\nAmerica's Mustang Campaign\nMustang Heritage Open\nMeet the Mustang\nSee also\nFree-roaming horse management in North America\nList of Bureau of Land Management Herd Management Areas\nMustang Challenge\nMustang Classic",

    "Canadian politician\nDaniel Webster Clendenan (or Clendennan), commonly known as D. W. Clendenan (1851\u20131913) was a US-born, Canadian barrister and land speculator who founded the village of West Toronto Junction. He became the first mayor of the town of the Junction and is namesake for a local street.\nBorn in Detroit, Michigan to travelling ministers of the Disciples of Christ Church, he lived in Toronto but later moved to various cities where his father was called to preach. He returned to Canada to study law. In 1876, after graduation, he was called to the bar  and soon joined a law firm downtown Toronto. He eventually moved to the city's western outskirts with his wife Clarinda (n\u00e9e  McMillan). In 1882, through business partnership, D. W. Clendenan purchased tracts of land from William Conway Keele in anticipation of the  completion of the intercity suburban rail lines.\nClendenan subdivided the Keele estate, site of the former Carlton Race Course, into lots for sale. The village, then known as West Toronto Junction after the Canadian Pacific Railways station, rapidly grew in population and industrialized. In 1885, he was elected deputy reeve and became reeve of the village three years later. He also served as chairman of the school board. By spring of 1889, the village was chartered into a town.  Clendenan was elected as the founding mayor of Toronto Junction. A Conservative-Equal Rights politician, he became a prominent early figure  before the Junction was amalgamated into the city of Toronto.\nBy the late 1890s, he relocated to the US after he was involved in a domestic affairs scandal that broke in public. He continued to work as a lawyer in Nebraska, where he married again and had a son. In 1913, Clendenan died in Lincoln, Nebraska at 61 years old. He was buried in Wyuka Cemetery. In his lifetime, while facing court charges, Clendenan's cousin Dr. George Washington Cledenan served as mayor of the Junction. Clendenan Avenue, running north\u2013south from the Canadian Pacific tracks to Bloor Street and ending at the northwest corner of High Park, continues to bear the family's name.\n",

    "1987 boxing match\nKhaosai Galaxy vs. Ellyas Pical was a professional boxing match held at the Senayan Stadium (now Gelora Bung Karno Stadium\n), Jakarta, Indonesia on February 28, 1987, for the WBA super flyweight (then junior bantamweight) championship.\nBackground\nAt that time, Khaosai Galaxy successfully defended his title for the 4th time by knocking out via 5-rounds the local challenger Israel Contreras on the island of Cura\u00e7ao in a spectacular manner at the end of 1986. This was Khaosai's first fight outside of his country. He has therefore become the favorite of Thais.\nAs for Ellyas Pical, he was also considered an Indonesian national hero. He was the first Indonesian boxer to hold a world champion, winning the  IBF 115 lb, (super flyweight) title, the same division as Khaosai. \nPical (as a champion for the second period) recently defended his title by knocking out South Korean Dong Chun Lee in the 10th round, who was Khaosai first title defense challenger, just about 3 months before that.\nTherefore, this battle was like a proof of who was the real best boxer in Southeast Asia.\nPical boasted that he would be the one to approach Khaosai. Niwat Laosuwannawat and Phong Thawornwiwattanabut, Khaosai's manager and trainer, believe Khaosai will be able to easily defeat Pical.\nIt was originally agreed that this fight would be an unification bout for the WBA and IBF titles. But after the fight was over, the IBF did not approve it, so Pical was effectively stripped of the title, and the fight became a match for the WBA's championship only.\nThe fight\nWhen the two actually fought, Pigal, as the IBF champion, wore white trunks with vertical blue stripes and yellow boots. He did not take the initiative to approach as previously discussed, but instead retreated. Khaosai took the initiative to move forward instead. Khaosai uses his signature fighting style, which was drive the opponent into the ropes and alternately punch him both above and below the body. \nWhile Pical rarely throws a punch, when he hits the target, the cheers of the hundreds of thousands of locals in the arena were deafening.\nAs the fight progressed, Pical, who was on the defensive, began to have a swollen face from the power of Khaosai's punches. In addition, his eyebrow was cut open and bleeding. He began to have difficulty escaping and often leaned against the ropes or cornered to receive Khaosai's punches.\nShortly after the bell rang for the start of round 14, Japanese referee Ken Morita temporarily halted the fight and called for a doctor to come and examine Pical's wounds. When the doctor allowed the fight to continue, Khaosai did not let this golden opportunity slip away. He continued to batter and blast Pical until he was barely able to fight. Suddenly, Morita separated the two and chased Khaosai into the corner, counting the exhausted Pical in the corner to eight, and let them continue fighting.\nKhaosai then unleashed another round of punches on Pical, this time causing him to collapse to the ring floor. Morita ended the contest, giving Khaosai the TKO win at 2:45 of round 14.\nAftermatch\nAfter Khaosai decisively defeated their favorite, the Indonesian fans booed Khaosai and his staff fearfully, fearing that something dangerous was about to happen. Khaosai and his staff had to rush out of the circus and return to their hotel with relief.\nIt was later revealed that Pical's staff performed a black magic ritual before the two boxers entered the ring to intimidate Khaosai and encourage Pical.\nIn addition, Khaosai himself revealed many years later that someone had offered him $500,000 to fix the fight, but he refused and chased the person away.\nEllyas Pical, after this disastrous defeat, continued to box and was able to regain his IBF 115 lb title, becoming a 3-time world champion.\nFor Khaosai Galaxy, after this, he continued to win many more fights in a row until he was able to defend his title 19 times. After the 19th defense in late 1991, he announced his retirement and gave up his title. His record of title defenses is considered the highest among world champions in the 115 lb division and is number one among Asian boxers to this day.\nMoreover, Kongtoranee Payakaroon, Khaosai's next challenger for the title defense, said that after he lost to Khaosai in the WBA title challenge, he had not returned to Muay Thai at that time. He was contacted from his promoter Songchai Rattanasuban to go to Indonesia to challenge Pical, who was then the IBF champion for the third time, but he refused because he believed that he would not receive the purse that had been discussed and agreed upon, \u0e3f800,000.\nBroadcasting\nNotes\n",
    "Greek-Italian creole socialite (born 1842, New Orleans)\nRandolph Natili (October 24, 1842 - May 10, 1915) was a mixed-race Louisiana Creole author, politician, diplomate, special railroad agent, art collector, and socialite. He was a member of the prominent New Orleans mixed Greek Creole family known as the Dimitry Family.  His father-in-law French-American composer Eugene Chassaignac desegregated Scottish Rite Freemasonic lodges in New Orleans around 1867 and Randolph's first cousin George Pandely was involved in a racial incident entitled the Pandelly Affair.  Natili worked in the railroad enterprise because of his cousin superintendent Pandely.  Natili was a patron of the arts and by 1900 published a book entitled Martin H. Colnaghi, Marlborough Gallery.  Natili's first cousin once removed  Alice married Italian American composer Giuseppe Ferrata.  Natili dedicated over twenty years of his life as Ferrata's staunchest supporter.  Natili was close friends with the  Huntington family and at the time of his death is listed as receiving a salary of 25,000 a year close to one million dollars adjusted for 2024 inflation.\nRandolph was born in New Orleans to Doctor Auguste Natili and Mathilde Elizabeth Theophanie Dimitry their union was an interracial marriage.  Randolph was raised in New Orleans his uncle was Alexander Dimitry the first state superintendent of public instruction in Louisiana and represented the United States as Ambassador to Costa Rica and Nicaragua.  Randolph adopted the nickname the Baron and eventually was surrounded by America's elite.  In the 1890s he toured the southern United States with President Benjamin Harrison.  Randolph was closely associated with Ferrata's musical career for the last twenty years of his life.  Randolph had an exceptional life, due to his ethnic background it was very difficult for people of color living during the Jim Crow era because states eventually instituted the one-drop rule.  Ferrata named several pieces after him and his cousin Alice.  His grandson was Major League Baseball pitcher and manager Eddie Dyer.  A fountain was dedicated to Randolph in Morgan City around 1916 at Lawrence Park.\nEarly life and ancestory\n Natili's grandmother Marianne C\u00e9leste Dragon Randolph Natili was born in New Orleans to Italian Doctor Auguste Natili and Mathilde Elizabeth Theophanie Dimitry.  His father Auguste was born in Pisa in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany Italy and educated in Paris France around 1837.  Randolph's parents were married on April 22, 1839, in New Orleans.  Randolph's mother was Mathilde Elizabeth Theophanie Dimitry she was a member of the prominent Greek Creole Dimitry family and the ninth child of Marianne Celeste Dragon and Andrea Dimitry.  Randolph's mother was the progeny of an interracial marriage.  The family was involved in countless racial encounters during the 19th century.  Two incidents were chronicled by the courts entitled Forstall, f.p.c. v. Dimitry (1833) and Pandelly v. Wiltz (1854).\nRandolph's grandmother Marianne C\u00e9leste Dragon passed as a white person on public records because it was necessary to own property and have certain rights.  Strict laws persecuted people of color and passing as white was a legal solution and her marriage records indicate that she was white.  The Forstall sisters Pauline and Josephine brought Marianne to court in the 1830s because she inherited property from the Forstall family but the property was left to a woman of color named Marianne, not a white woman. The court revealed that she was posing as two different people and they wanted the white woman to return the property; consequently, the court sided with Marianne allowing her to keep her property and white status, ruling that the family had been in possession of the right to be categorized as a person not born of Negro extraction.\nRandolph was around eleven years old when his first cousin George Pandely was ejected from public office due to his African heritage.  Pandely was elected to the office of assistant alderman on  March 28, 1853, a role similar to a city council member.  Victor Wiltz accused him of not meeting the qualifications to hold public office because he was of African descent.  Wiltz and a small group of concerned citizens published a detailed account of Pandely's ancestral records while Pandely falsely asserted his family was of American Indian descent.  Pandely eventually resigned from public office to avoid arrest.  Weeks later Pandely took Wilz to court in case Pandelly v. Wiltz (1854) and he sued for the right to claim American Indian ancestry and for monetary damages. The court allowed Pandely to claim American Indian ancestry but did not issue financial damages.  The incident led the Dimitry family to claim descent from a fictitious, Indian princess of the Alibamu tribe named Malanta Talla to maintain their social status.\nRandolph's uncle Giovanni Pieri was also a doctor who married Clina Angelica Dimitry the sixth child of Marianne Celeste ",

    "Peruvian politician (born 1959)\nLuis Alberto Emilio Kouri Bumachar (born November 6, 1959) is a Peruvian lawyer and former member of the Congress of the Republic of Peru during 2000. He is known for being the protagonist of the first widespread \"vladi-video\", which initiated the fall of Alberto Fujimori's government.\nPolitical career\nKouri began his political career in the municipal elections of 1998, where he was a candidate for mayor of the district of Magdalena del Mar for the independent list Magdalena S\u00ed, but was not elected.\nIn the 2000 general elections, Kouri registered with Alejandro Toledo's Possible Peru party and ran for Congress, where he was elected congressman with 36,213 votes for the 2000-2005 parliamentary period. In June 2000, Kouri was elected congressman for the 2000\u20132005 term.\nOn 22 June of the same year, Kouri resigned from Possible Peru, justifying his decision by internal discrepancies. During the traditional date of the installation of the new legislature, on 28 July, Kouri, along with 18 other congressmen, joined the ranks of the ruling Peru 2000 party, which gave the political grouping a large majority. After this event, Kouri was criticised by the various opposition benches as a defector, as were the other 18 congressmen.\nControversies\nVladivideo\nOn 14 September of that year, at a press conference at the Gran Hotel Bol\u00edvar, the then congressmen Fernando Olivera, Luis Iberico and Susana Higuchi, of the Independent Moralizing Front, presented a video recorded with a hidden camera showing Kouri receiving 15,000 dollars from Vladimiro Montesinos, presidential advisor and head of the National Intelligence Service (SIN), to leave Possible Peru and join the ranks of Peru 2000. In the VHS recording, later known as Kouri-Montesinos, the congressman-elect can be seen haggling for more money. The press conference was broadcast on Canal N while the Congress of the Republic was in session.\nThe \"vladi-video\" had been filmed on 5 May 2000 at the National Intelligence Service and Kouri defended himself against accusations of corruption and transfugism by claiming that the money received was a loan to buy a refrigerated truck to deliver fish to economically depressed areas, but days later, the Peru 2000 bench itself withdrew him from its ranks and called for him to be sanctioned. Subsequently, Kouri appeared on the news programmes 24 Horas and Am\u00e9rica Noticias to justify his meeting with Montesinos, where in the latter programme he was surprised to be wearing a hearing aid during the interview.\nOn 28 September 2000, the Congress of the Republic suspended Kouri for 120 days and then he was declared vacated and his post was replaced by Luis Pella Granda, however, Kouri had already fled to Miami. In January 2001, he was disqualified from holding any public office for 10 years and prosecuted by the Judiciary.\nJudicial process\nAs a result of these events, he was prosecuted. During the trial, it became known that he had gone to the SIN to meet with Montesinos on two more occasions, receiving a total of 32,000 dollars. He was sentenced on 21 March 2001 to six years in prison for corruption of officials and illicit enrichment. He was also ordered to pay 200,000 nuevos soles to the Peruvian State as civil reparations. In 2004 he was acquitted of the crimes of influence peddling and illicit association to commit a crime.

    "Maldivian presidential administration from 2013-2018\nAbdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom's tenure as the 6th President of the Maldives began on 17 November 2013 after he won the 2013 Maldivian presidential election against then-President Mohamed Waheed Hassan and ended on 17 November 2018 after he lost to Ibrahim Mohamed Solih in the 2018 Maldivian presidential election.\nDuring Yameen's presidency, there have been major infrastructure projects as well as alleged human rights infringements.\n2013 elections\nProgressive Party of Maldives (PPM) elected Abdulla Yameen as their candidate for the 2013 election, which had gone through many delays.

    "Television station in Par\u00e1, Brazil\nBoas Novas Bel\u00e9m is a Brazilian television station based in Bel\u00e9m, capital of the state of Par\u00e1. It operates on channel 4 (36 digital UHF) and is Boas Novas' own broadcaster. The station belongs to the Boas Novas Foundation, and is controlled by the Assembly of God Church in Bel\u00e9m. It was opened in 1967 as TV Guajar\u00e1, being the second television station in the state and the oldest in operation, and was acquired by the church in 1995.\nHistory\nTV Guajar\u00e1\nThe concession for the second television station in Bel\u00e9m was granted by President Humberto Castello Branco on December 15, 1964 to businessman and federal deputy Lopo de Castro, owner of R\u00e1dio Guajar\u00e1, founded on December 28, 1960. They were invested 2 million Cruzeiros in the implementation of the station, which, as per its founder's wishes, was the first to be set up entirely with national equipment, manufactured by Maxwell. Only the Ampex videotapes, acquired later, were foreign-made.\nDue to its low budget, the broadcaster was installed on the 25th floor of the Manoel Pinto da Silva Building, in Pra\u00e7a da Rep\u00fablica, at the time the tallest building in Bel\u00e9m and the North of the country. The location was ideal for the transmission tower, placed on top of the building, but it also had problems assembling the studios, crossed by the building's columns, forcing camera operators not to let them leak into the air during local programs. The offices were separated by wooden partitions, from the same crates through which the transmission equipment had arrived.\nTV Guajar\u00e1 was inaugurated on March 27, 1967, operating on VHF channel 4, six years after the pioneer TV Marajoara, Rede Tupi's owned-and-operated station. Its name derived from the radio station, which in turn referred to the bay that bathes the city of Bel\u00e9m, and its first logo, chosen by Lopo de Castro, was a saci, in reference to the legends of the Amazon. As the mandate of federal deputy required Lopo's constant presence in Bras\u00edlia, the presidency of the station fell to his wife, Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Lobato de Castro, who had the distinction of being the first woman to run a television station in Brazil.\nTV Guajar\u00e1 was one of the first affiliates of Rede Globo, which had signed a six-month experimental contract with the broadcaster, soon afterwards extended to a fixed contract with a longer duration, and also showed content produced by TV Record, which headed REI. The local programming schedule, which at the time aired between 5 pm and midnight, was basically made up of talk, music and news programs, such as Atualidades Guajar\u00e1, shown at the end of the schedule before sign-off, and the local version of the children's Capit\u00e3o Furac\u00e3o, in addition to films and series.\nIn its first years on the air, there was intense rivalry with TV Marajoara, to the point that, at the time satellite transmissions began, it reserved all the times made available by Embratel for the retransmission of Rede Tupi, forcing TV Guajar\u00e1 to broadcast all recorded Globo programming. Together with the station's management, strategies were drawn up to attract viewers. The first was to change the route for sending the tapes, so that they no longer passed through affiliates in the Northeast region before arriving in Bel\u00e9m, which began to receive them directly from Rio de Janeiro, shortening the delay in showing the programs in relation to the competitor. The programming was also reinforced with a special film package, and Globo stars recorded exclusive calls for TV Guajar\u00e1 viewers. The measures had an effect and consolidated the station's leadership.\nThe broadcaster also broadcast together with TV Marajoara the C\u00edrio de Nazar\u00e9, where the channels were united in a pool called Rede Paraense de Televis\u00e3o. Guajar\u00e1 benefited most from the transmission, since its headquarters, until then located on the 25th floor of the Manoel Pinto da Silva Building, was located between Avenidas Presidente Vargas and Nazar\u00e9, where the final stretch of the procession begins. The channel used the building's terrace and installed cameras for more vertical coverage of the pilgrimage.\nIn 1975, Rede Globo broke its affiliation contract with TV Guajar\u00e1 due to pressure exerted by President Ernesto Geisel, which benefited its newest competitor, TV Liberal, in the implementation phase. At the time, TV Liberal had as its director and partner the journalist Ossian Brito, who became a fundamental character not only in the bidding that gave rise to the broadcaster's concession but also in the relationships that motivated the change of affiliation, since he was the brother of technical engineer at Rede Globo, Colonel Wilson de Souza Brito, and brother-in-law of General Gustavo Moraes Rego Reis, President Geisel's trusted man, later becoming his military chief of staff. Another additional reason was the fact that TV Guajar\u00e1 gave unconditional support to one of the president's political enemies, senator Jarbas Passarinho, who in turn was married to Rut",

    "British legal scholar\nMargaret Valentine Latham Korah, commonly known as Val Korah (1928\u20132023), was an English legal academic. She was the emeritus Professor of Competition Law at the Faculty of Laws, University College London (UCL).\nEarly life and education\nKorah was born in London and educated there at convent schools, although was evacuated to the countryside and during the wartime years. She read for an LLB (1949), LLM (1951) at UCL, took a position at UCL as a lecturer in 1951, after a summer of unsuccessful interviews elsewhere where she was asked if her sex was a 'fatal objection' to such employment.\nAcademic career\nWhile she was called to the bar in 1954, she focussed on academia, completing a PhD on trade control at UCL. In 1964, Korah established a graduate course in competition law at the Faculty, the second such course on law and economics in the world after an early law and economics of antitrust course at the University of Chicago Law School. Her 1968 monograph, Monopolies and restrictive practices, which coincided with her promotion to Reader, led to her advising Parliamentary Counsel on the creation of the Commission of Industry and Manpower Bill and the Price Commission. In 1971, she was one of only 4 female legal academics with a rank above lecturer in the United Kingdom. She was promoted to Professor of Competition Law in 1982 under the deanship of Jeffrey Jowell.\nKorah's influence extended to teaching around the world, from early in her career in tax law at the University of Khartoum, to the College of Europe in Bruges, Fordham University School of Law, Lund University (from where she received an honorary doctorate), Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, Monash University, University of Melbourne, University of Macau, University of Michigan, Case Western Reserve University, and the University of Valencia.\nShe was instrumental in shifting the legal, formalistic view of the European Commission (now DG COMP) to pioneering economic analysis through constant correspondence, education, conferences and engagement. Important to this were her classes jointly taught with Ren\u00e9 Jolivet at the College of Europe, who later became a judge at the European Court of Justice. In the 1990s, particularly through the \"new wave\" block exemptions on vertical agreements and new guidelines on merger control and competition enforcement priorities, the European Commission's thinking began to shift towards the arguments of Korah and Jolivet.\nKorah formally retired from UCL in 1993, but continued to be active in teaching and research part-time for many years following her retirement.\nPersonal life\nKorah lived in Hampstead, and regularly swam in Hampstead Heath Ponds. She had 4 children, and regularly recalled that she came to realise the importance of competition law by watching her children compete with each other.\nSelected works\nValentine Korah, \u2018EEC Competition Policy\u2014Legal Form or Economic Efficiency\u2019 (1986) 39 Current Legal Problems 85.\nValentine Korah, An Introductory Guide to EC Competition Law and Practice (9th edn, Hart Publishing 2007)\nValentine Korah, \u2018The Interface between Intellectual Property and Antitrust: The European Experience Symposium: The Federal Circuit and Antitrust\u2019 (2001) 69 Antitrust LJ 801\nValentine Korah, \u2018Concerted Practices\u2019 (1973) 36 The Modern Law Review 220\nValentine Korah and Denis O\u2019Sullivan, Distribution Agreements Under the EC Competition Rules (Bloomsbury Publishing 2002)\nValentine Korah, \u2018The Rise and Fall of Provisional Validity--The Need for a Rule of Reason in EEC Antitrust Antitrust\u2019 (1981) 3 Nw J Int\u2019l L & Bus 320.",

On the evening of 1st November 1984, a mob of about 150 people attacked the house of Balbir Singh, a neighbour of Vijay Jagirdar. The ferocious mob, armed with knives and sticks, sought to kill Balbir Singh and his family. During this violence, Jagirdar's family, who lived opposite Lalbagh Palace, gave shelter to the Sikh family. Seeing the gravity of the situation, Jagirdar came forward to confront the mob. He pleaded with them not to harm the innocent Balbir Singh and his family. However, the mob ignored his request. When Jagirdar tried to forcibly stop them, he was severely beaten, losing consciousness.

    "Cloud formation in New Zealand\nAerial view of Strath Taieri, near Middlemarch, showing the Taieri Pet\nSatellite photo of elongated lenticular cloud over inland Otago\nThe Taieri Pet is a lenticular cloud formation that occurs in the Strath-Taieri region of Otago in the South Island of New Zealand. The cloud formation is created when north-westerly winds are forced upwards over the Rock and Pillar Range.\nThe Rock and Pillar Range lies almost perpendicular to the direction of the prevailing north-westerly Foehn wind. The range is steep-sided and has a flat top. Lenticular clouds form when strong northwesterly winds flow up and over the mountain range, creating a standing wave. The air cools as it rises, and the water vapour in the air condenses to form clouds. The Taieri Pet cloud formation can sometimes appear in layers and has been described as a \"huge stack of plates\" in the sky. The cloud is a common feature in the skies near town of Middlemarch in the Strath-Taieri, a large glacial valley and river plateau in inland Otago.\nA Landsat 8 satellite image taken on 7 September 2024 showed the Taieri Pet as an elongated cloud lying parallel to the Rock and Pillar Range and to the north of Middlemarch.\nThe name Taieri Pet given to the cloud formation appears in mentions of the weather in Otago newspapers as early as the 1890s.  One report suggests that the name was given because the locals consider the cloud formation as their pet, being found only in their area. The Taieri Pet was also the name given to a local newsletter published by Middlemarch branch of Rural Women New Zealand for almost 40 years from 1982. The final edition was published in June 2021.\nSee also\nNor'west arch, a related effect over the Southern Alps",

    "Former unincorporated community in Tennessee, United States\nUnincorporated community in Tennessee, United States\nModel was an unincorporated community in  Stewart County, Tennessee, United States.  The community is one of several communities and towns in the general area that has become a part of the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area.\nHistory\nThe settlement was originally known as Pryor's Creek at its founding in the early half of the 19th century. A post office was established as Bass in July 1846, named after the area's first postmaster, Jethro Bass. It was renamed Great Western in 1854 after a furnace that was established that year, only to be fallen victim of the shut down of the furnace industry in the area due to a panic related to slave insurrection in late 1856.\nIn the 1860s after the American Civil War, the Cincinnati Copperage Company established the area as a real estate operation, or \"model town,\" which is how the community got its final name in 1887. People who came to work for the furnaces in the area relocated to the area, many of whom became farmers, blacksmiths, or timber workers. The depletion of timber, along with the farming becoming less productive, has cause the town to lose population throughout much of the 1930s and 1940s, until the Tennessee Valley Authority acquired all the properties around the community to create the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area in 1963. While most of the families in the areas relocated to other communities by 1964, one resident, Cleo Griffin, who served in the military during the second world war and fought in the Battle of Monte Cassino in 1944, was permitted to continue to live in his family home after countless negotiations. The Griffin house continued to be occupied until 1989, when he finally relocated to a nearby nursing home, where he remained until his 2000 death; his home is currently under preservation efforts. It and the Great Western Furnace were the only remaining landmarks still standing today.\nGeography\nModel was located at the coordinates 36.641754, \u221287.976829, which is about 17 miles (27\u00a0km) northwest of Dover along the Woodlands Trace National Scenic Byway, known simply as The Trace. It was originally signed as Tennessee State Route 49 at the time of the town's existence. The byway connects with Dover to the southeast and the Kentucky state line about 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km) to the north.\nPresent-day points of interest\nNear the original site of Model, there are two attractions operated by the Forest Service as part of the LBL:\n1850s Homeplace Living History Farm\nSouth Bison Prairie",
    "Spanish nun (born 1959)\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  Marcos and the second or maternal family name is  S\u00e1nchez.\nSor Isaura Marcos S\u00e1nchez (Los Santos, Salamanca, 13 January 1959) is a cloistered nun of the Poor Clares order at the Monastery of Pedralbes whose photographs are based on a peculiar reflection technique that avoids the use of digital retouching programs. The whole reality of the monastery is what shapes the subject matter of her works, which are dedicated exclusively to charitable purposes.\nBiography\nIsaura was the youngest of the six children of Benedicto Marcos Curto and Isaura S\u00e1nchez G\u00f3mez. As a teenager, she was attracted to monastic life. When in Barcelona, where one of her brothers lived, she decided to visit different ecclesiastical communities. She was deeply impressed by the Franciscan charism of the Poor Clare Sisters of the Monastery of Santa Maria de Pedralbes, founded in 1326 by Queen Elisenda of Montcada, and therefore decided to enter the order in 1976, when she was seventeen years old. In 2009, she was initiated into the field of photography in a self-taught way. Her creations are the expression of her way of understanding the contemplative life, following the rule of Saint Clare of Assisi of 1211.\nArtistic career\nIn 2009, she began her unique photographic work using a curious technique based on reflections. Although the result of her work might suggest otherwise, she never uses digital image retouching programs. Her work also includes abstract compositions.\nIn March 2019, on the occasion of Pope Francis' visit to Rabat, Morocco, 114 photographs taken by Sister Isaura illustrating the Canticle of the Sun of St. Francis of Assisi were exhibited at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium, where Pope Francis officiated a multitudinous mass to commemorate the 800 years of presence of the Franciscan Order in the African country.\nOn June 23, 2024, in the cloister of San Damiano, Assisi, she presented the photographic exhibition of the book Clara de As\u00eds, espejo fuera del tiempo (Clare of Assisi, mirror out of time), with 51 photographs taken in the monastery of Pedralbes. The photographs were also exhibited in the different rooms in which St. Clare stayed throughout her conventual life.\nShe has collaborated with several charities including: Caritas Internationalis, Acci\u00f3 Solid\u00e0ria, UNHCR, Fundaci\u00f3 Arrels, and Fundaci\u00f3 Convent de Santa Clara.\nSelected works\nClara de As\u00eds, espejo fuera del tiempo.

    "2022 single by Will Wood\n\"White Noise\" is a song by American musician Will Wood. It was released through the Say-10 label on July 8, 2022, as the sixth and final single for his fourth studio album \"In case I make it,\" (2022), where it appears as the last song. The track features a ballad composition centered around ukulele, strings and a choir. Lyrically, it explores modern aesthetics, using bland imagery to convey emptiness. The song's music video includes visuals of Wood pantomiming and various people celebrating nothing.\nBackground\nDuring writing, Will Wood reminisced about a college experience revolving around feeling empty during an acid trip in his plain-textured dormitory room near Atlantic City, New Jersey. He then began composing a soothing melody on the ukulele, preferring its modest sound to the domineering nature of the piano and acoustic guitar. Wood later conducted a Bulgarian choir via Zoom to create the backing vocals for \"White Noise\". On June 20, 2022, the track was teased as a single and music video for release on July 8, saying about the song that \"the beauty of the world is in the silence beneath it\". It appeared as the final track of \"In case I make it,\" (2022), following the orchestral themes of the penultimate track \"Willard!\"\nComposition\n\"White Noise\" is a ballad, beginning with solo tenor ukulele composed in 44 time signature. Once Wood enters, he softly sings portamento. The song builds in intensity throughout and climaxes during the second verse and chorus, introducing string instruments and a choir with the grandiosity of arena rock. Wood considered adding a key change during this section but thought it might be overblown. After this, the composition suddenly drops and slows, ending the song with a softened tone backed by ukulele.\nLyrics\nThe primary lyrical content of \"White Noise\" optimistically grieves complacency caused by recommender systems on social media, encouraging defiance of it. It additionally includes references to components of music, such as Dorian mode and audio file formats. Imagery of fluorescent lamps are used to mimic Wood's feeling of a \"hollow, cold, vibe\", while \"eggshell\" is used as a double entendre; both the off-white paint color seen in dormitory rooms and a reference to the phrase of walking on eggshells. A sense of meaninglessness is continued throughout the first verse, with some lyrics inspired by the intentional lack of affection derived from elevator music. In the second verse of \"White Noise\", Wood satirically promotes the qualities of white noise, calling it \"post-avant-garde\", and later using a Bulgarian choir to erroneously claim its ability to cure cancer.\nMusic video\nThe music video for \"White Noise\" was released on July 8, 2022, with co-direction by Will Wood and Jacob Feldman. The video begins with white noise, followed by Wood walking into the middle of an open space with a ukulele. He then lip syncs without his mouth, pantomiming to follow along with the song. Footage of Wood playing instruments with their musical components removed accompanies this, later introducing various Indiegogo contributors as partygoers who gift each other empty containers and celebrate nothing. Halfway through, Wood appears with a shaved head, beginning to sing while a mute un-shaved version of himself plays backing instruments. This precedes more footage of celebrating nothing, including a person receiving an oversized cheque worth $0 USD. The idea of Wood lip syncing without speaking was a previous idea planned for a performance video, which was recycled for \"White Noise\" as he and Feldman struggled to find other ideas.\nPersonnel\nMusicians\nWill Wood \u2013 lead vocals, piano, ukulele, production, strings arranger\nMike Bottiglieri \u2013 guitar\nMario Conte \u2013 drums\nZornitsa Getova \u2013 piano\nYoed Nir \u2013 strings\nVater Boris \u2013 double bass\nKevin Antreassian \u2013 mixing, mastering\nSimon Ficken \u2013 recording engineer\nJonathon Maisto \u2013 recording engineer\nChoir\nArrangement\nWill Wood \u2013 composer, arranger\nFour For Music Ltd. \u2013 arranger, recording, contracting\nAngelia Vihrova \u2013 sound engineer\nVladislav Boyadjiev \u2013 sound engineer\nPlamen Penchev \u2013 sound engineer\nGeorge Strezov \u2013 recording producer, team\nGeorgi Elenkov PhD \u2013 conductor, team\nBoris Radilov \u2013 team\nOgnyan Georgiev \u2013 team\nMiroslava Ananieva \u2013 team\nTsvetan Topalov \u2013 team\nVelislava Georgieva \u2013 team\nDelyan Kolev \u2013 team\nDeyan Velikov \u2013 team\nVocalists\nGayla Simeonova\nEmiliya Kirtcheva\nDenitsa Georgieva\nNikolina Pankova\nMaya Stoyanova\nSrebrina Mineva\nAtanaska Popova\nFlora Tarpomanova\nEva Perchemlieva-takanova\nNadya Pavlova\nVesela Todorova\nBilyana Mihaylova\nRositsa Kazakova\nDimana Todorova\nMaria Venkova\nYana Vasileva\nEvgeniy Dimitrov\nAtanas Yonkov\nOrlin Kamenov\nMihail Mihaylov\nDimitar Zashev\nKalin Dushkov\nTsvetomir Hristov\nNikolay Milev\nEmil Dakov\nPeter Petrov\nDimitier Stoyanov\nGeorge Beykov\nNikola Petrov\nDimiter Koprinkov\nNotes\n",

    "Historic building in North Hollywood, California\nNorth Hollywood Masonic Temple, also known as North Hollywood Masonic Lodge, is a historic former masonic temple located at 5122 Tujunga Avenue in the NoHo Arts District in North Hollywood, California. It was declared Los Angeles Cultural-Historic Monument #1078 in 2015.\nHistory\nNorth Hollywood Masonic Temple was designed by Robert Stacy-Judd in association with John Aleck Murrey. Built in either 1949 or 1951 and featuring an Exotic Revival design with elements of Mayan Revival and Art Moderne, the building helped solidify Stacy-Judd's reputation as southern California\u2019s most enthusiastic Mesoamerican-inspired architect.\nMany Hollywood actors, executives, and studio employees held membership at this temple, including Clark Gable, John Wayne, the Warner brothers (Harry, Albert, Sam, and Jack), Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, and more. World War II Medal of Honor recipient turned actor Audie Murphy was also a member, and a room upstairs was dedicated to him.\nIn 2014, the freemasons moved out of the building and it was turned into an event space. In 2022, the masons officially marked the move as permanent.\nIn 2015, the City of Los Angeles designated the building Los Angeles Cultural-Historic Monument #1078. Only the exterior was included in this designation, as the interior has been irreversibly altered and no longer contributes to the historical significance of the building.\nArchitecture and design\nNorth Hollywood Masonic Temple features a Mesoamerican-inspired motif combined with Art Moderne to create a \u201cthoroughly modern presence\u201d and \u201ca grandly scaled example of a Masonic lodge.\u201d The building features a simple rectilinear plan with an elaborate front fa\u00e7ade that consists of smooth white stucco walls punctuated by blue horizontal accents, a style that wraps around to the sides of the building. The main entrance features tall vertical elements and geometric motifs, all topped by a streamlined blue pyramid that evokes the temples of Palenque in Chiapas, Mexico. Integrity of the building exterior is considered excellent, while the interior has undergone irreversible alterations and is no longer considered historically significant.\nAdditional character-defining features of the building include: a centered and elevated entrance accessed by a flight of stairs, a faux-corbeled arch over the entrance, two colored friezes above the arch, geometric balustrade at the entrance stairs, fluted columns, repeating Mayan hieroglyph imprints, and a parapet wall running the circumference of the structure.\n",
    "Corsican politician\nAlain Orsoni (Corsican: Alanu Orsoni; born 1954) is a Corsican politician and former FLNC militant and former president of AC Ajaccio. Founder of the FLNC-Canal Habituel (Corsican: Canale Abituale, FLNC-CA) and its political wing, the Movement for Self-Determination (Muvimentu per l\u2019Autodeterminazione, MPA), Orsoni led the organization until its dissolution in 1997.\nOrsoni is called the \u201cman of seven lives\u201d or the \u201cCorsican godfather\u201d in some circles due to his criminal convictions and his tendency to create new lifestyles in new countries to flee persecution. Orsoni was born in the town of Vero, near the city of Ajaccio. His father, a war hero from the second world war, left when Orsoni was young to fight in Algeria, where he later joined the OAS. After a brief period as a far-right activist, Orsoni became an avid supporter of Corsican independence and moved left on the political spectrum. In 1976, a year after his participation in the Aleria standoff, he joined the newly-formed National Liberation Front of Corsica. In 1988, Orsoni took action during the fracture of the FLNC to preserve a ceasefire signed with the French. Later, Orsoni led the FLNC-CA, and formalized peace with the French government and began a war with the other FLNC splits. After a 7-year long war with the FLNC-Canal Historique (Canale Storicu, FLNC-CS), in which he played a major role, The Canal Habituel dissolved and Orsoni fled to Nicaragua where he began a gambling business and became involved in extortion. In 2008, Orsoni returned to Corsica and became president of the football club AC Ajaccio.\nEarly life\nOrsoni was born in 1954 to a Corsican family in the town of Vero. His father Andr\u00e9 (Andriu) Orsoni was a battle-hardened World War II veteran who had returned from the war in Indochina months before he was born. Shortly after, when Orsoni was very young, his father enlisted in the Algerian war, where he later joined the far-right pro-French terrorist group Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te (OAS). Orsoni grew up very close to his father, which is likely a reason his politics reflected that of his father's for most of his early years. His brother, Guy (Guidu) Orsoni was born 4 years after Alain. In 1972, Orsoni moved to Paris to peruse higher education at the Assas-Panth\u00e9on University. There, he joined the Union Defense Group, a far-right student union. However, his right-wing views began to change as he met with the left-wing Corsican nationalists at his school, particularly L\u00e9o Battesti, who would later become his close friend and fight with him in the Corsican conflict on the side of the FLNC. In the summer of 1975, Orsoni and Battesti returned to Corsica and joined a nationalist militant group, Azione Regiunalista Corsa (ARC). In August 1975, the ARC led the Al\u00e9ria standoff, a military standoff on the eastern coast of Corsica. The insuing chaos caused Orsoni to flee to a military camp before returning to Paris. In 1976, the FLNC formed, and Orsoni joined, quickly rising through the ranks to become the head of the FLNC's Paris division.\nIn The Original FLNC\nParis Division Leader\nOrsoni was head of the FLNC's Paris division for 6 years. During that time, large-scale and harsh bombing campaigns were carried out in the city. In 1979, a series of attacks occurred in a short span of time: On 10 April, three banks in Paris were bombed, and courts in Paris were bombed shortly after, including the Paris Palace of Justice, in which a bombing caused over 3 million francs worth of damage. On 6 May, 20 buildings, mostly financial institutions, were bombed in Paris and on 30 May, a new wave of bombings occurred. A bombing of the Paris police headquarters at the beginning of June caused a large setback in operations against the guerrillas, both in Paris and in Corsica.\nOn 14 May 1980, a commando of FLNC fighters, personally led by Orsoni, engaged in a shootout in front of the Iranian embassy in Paris. This left one gendarme dead and it caused Orsoni to be captured and sent to prison shortly after. His two-year stay at Fleury-M\u00e9rogis prison was marked by turbulence when, in June 1981, a prison revolt broke out. The demands of the revolt were to release Orsoni as well as another separatist militant, Serge Cacciari, arrested in 1976 for the murder of a gendarme during the Aleria standoff. After a year, Orsoni and Cacciari were released on 2 March 1982 due to the \"Defferre accords\", an agreement between the FLNC and Mitterand. Afterwards, he returned to Corsica, where he took charge of actions in Ajaccio.\nAjaccio Brigade Leader and the Murder of Guy Orsoni\nOnce returning to Corsica, Orsoni and his brother Guy Orsoni had become something of a folk hero in nationalist circles. His command in Paris and his role in the prison revolt of 1981 had gained him significant fame, and it didn't take much time before both of the Orsoni brothers had become brigade leaders in the FLNC. Orsoni had taken up the post of Ajaccio, and had begun coordinati",
    "\nThe Candelabrum is a 4,700-foot-elevation (1,433-meter) pillar in Grand County, Utah, United States.\nDescription\nThe Candelabrum is located within the Park Avenue section of Arches National Park and like many of the rock formations in the park, it is composed of Entrada Sandstone, specifically the Slick Rock Member overlaying the Dewey Bridge Member. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 300 feet (91 meters) above the Park Avenue Trail in 300 feet (91 meters) laterally. Precipitation runoff from Candelabrum drains to the Colorado River via Courthouse Wash. The first ascent of the summit was made in November 1986 by Charlie Fowler and Chris Goplerud via Play with Fire rock-climbing route. Kyle Copeland and Alison Sheets first climbed the class\u00a05.11c A2 Hall of Flame route in 1986. This landform was shown briefly in the opening scene of the 1989 American action-adventure film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\nClimate\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system, The Candelabrum is located in a cold semi-arid climate zone with cold winters and hot summers.

    "Lithograph by Josef Kriehuber\nFriedrich Beckmann (13 January 1803 \u2013 7 September 1866) was a German comic actor. He performed at the K\u00f6nigsst\u00e4dtisches Theater in Berlin, and in Vienna at the Theater an der Wien and the Burgtheater. He became famous in Germany through his play Eckensteher Nante im Verh\u00f6r.\nLife\nBeckmann was born in Breslau (now Wroc\u0142aw in Poland) in 1803, son of a small master potter. He was interested in the theatre as a youth, against his parents' wishes, and joined the chorus of the city theatre in Breslau, getting his first speaking role in 1820. His comic talent was recognised, and Heinrich Schmelka recommended him to the management of the K\u00f6nigsst\u00e4dtisches Theater in Berlin, where he was engaged from 1824. He initially  played small comic parts, but after Josef Spitzeder left the stage through illness he played leading roles.\nHe became famous particularly through his own play Eckensteher Nante im Verh\u00f6r (1833), in which he played the comic character Eckensteher Nante\u00a0. Beckmann based him on \"Woodcutter Nante\", a small role in Karl von Holtei's play Ein Trauerspiel in Berlin, and it was similar to the Viennese comic character Staberl\u00a0. The printed play went thorugh many editions, and was performed throughout Germany.\nHe made a guest appearance at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna in 1841; after a second appearance in 1845 he was engaged at the theatre by Franz Pokorny. He was a leading member of the company at the Burgtheater in Vienna from 1846, remaining there until his death in 1866.\nHe married in 1838 the opera singer Adele Muzzarelli. After his death she established the Friedrich Beckmann Foundation, to support German actors in need.\nHis acting qualities\nThe frontispiece to Eckensteher Nante im Verh\u00f6r (Berlin 1833)\nHis biographer in Biographisches Lexikon des Kaiserthums Oesterreich (1856) wrote: \"Beckmann is a great researcher of human nature, he listens to  people's drollest utterances, their comical nuances, their most humorous weaknesses and excesses, and gives them back again intact, unadulterated, with milder rather than more garish colours.... Beckmann is one of those artists of the Vienna Hofburgtheater who are always treated by the audience, in life and on the stage, with special benevolence and tremendous sympathy.\"\nHis biographer in Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie (1875) wrote: \"Beckmann was of irresistibly comic vigour, and in particular he did this by means of a cosy, comfortable quality, which was peculiar to his performances, and by a wealth of droll ideas with which he loved to dress up his roles. He was not exactly strong in character, but nevertheless his achievements pleased and were compellingly effective, because of the sunny cheerfulness that flowed from his whole personality.\"\n",
    "North Indian cyclone\nDeep Depression BOB 05 was a weak tropical cyclone that impacted Bangladesh and India. The seventh tropical cyclone and fourth deep depression of the 2024 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, BOB 05 originated from a broad area of cyclonic circulation partially related to the remnants of Typhoon Yagi in the Western Pacific. Moving generally northwestward, the depression failed to intensify further, reaching maximum sustained winds of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 989\u00a0hPa (29.21\u00a0inHg). It would weaken, becoming a remnant low on 18 September.\nHeavy rainfall from the storm led to severe flooding in southeastern Bangladesh, affecting over 50,000 people across 40 villages in Ukhia Upazila, with Haldia Palong and Jaliapalong areas being the most impacted, totaling 35,000 residents. Additionally, Chakaria Upazila experienced flooding that disrupted 20,000 residents and caused significant damage to agricultural land. Meanwhile, in Kolkata, 72.4\u00a0mm (2.85\u00a0in) of rain was recorded over a 24-hour period, with a total of 125.8\u00a0mm (4.95\u00a0in).\nMeteorological history\nMap plotting the storm's track and intensity, according to the Saffir\u2013Simpson scaleMap key Saffir\u2013Simpson scale  \u00a0 Tropical\u00a0depression (\u226438\u00a0mph,\u00a0\u226462\u00a0km/h) \u00a0 Tropical\u00a0storm (39\u201373\u00a0mph,\u00a063\u2013118\u00a0km/h) \u00a0 Category\u00a01 (74\u201395\u00a0mph,\u00a0119\u2013153\u00a0km/h) \u00a0 Category\u00a02 (96\u2013110\u00a0mph,\u00a0154\u2013177\u00a0km/h) \u00a0 Category\u00a03 (111\u2013129\u00a0mph,\u00a0178\u2013208\u00a0km/h) \u00a0 Category\u00a04 (130\u2013156\u00a0mph,\u00a0209\u2013251\u00a0km/h) \u00a0 Category\u00a05 (\u2265157\u00a0mph,\u00a0\u2265252\u00a0km/h) \u00a0 Unknown    Storm type  Tropical cyclone  Subtropical cyclone  Extratropical cyclone, remnant low, tropical disturbance, or monsoon depression \nThe weak remnants of Typhoon Yagi would begin tracking towards the North Indian Ocean, causing the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to start tracking it as a cyclonic circulation over Myanmar on 11 September. This disturbance coalesced into a low-pressure area the next day, further developing into a well-marked low-pressure just a few hours later. Soon after, it intensified into a depression. The following day, the depression further strengthened into a deep depression over Bangladesh and West Bengal.\nAs it was located in the westerlies of the southwest monsoon, on September 16, BOB 05 exhibited persistent deep convection driven by mid-level anticyclonic shear. A few hours later, the system weakened to a depression as it drifted slowly westward over western India. The depression subsequently lost organization, degenerating into a well-marked low pressure area over Madhya Pradesh by 00:00 UTC on September 18.\nImpact\nBangladesh\nThe storm produced heavy rainfall in southeastern Bangladesh. Seven people were killed by landslides in Cox's Bazar District. Rainfall flooded some 200 villages in Cox's Bazar Sadar. Six other upazilas remained flooded. In Ukhia Upazila, flooding affected over 50,000 people across 40 villages. Among them were the Haldia Palong and Jaliapalong areas constituting the most affected population of 35,000. Some 10,000 residents across eight neighbourhoods including Nuniarchara, which are flood-prone, were also affected. Flooding in Chakaria Upazila also disrupted 20,000 residents; agriculture land were also badly damaged. Eleven deaths were recorded and 100 missing fishermen in Noakhali District, 35,441 were relocated to camps, and 1.5 million people were trapped by floodwaters. Two people were killed when a boat capsized in Jagannathpur Upazila.\nOver a dozen fishing trawlers carrying an estimated 500 people off the coast of Cox's Bazar were unaccounted since 11 September. On 15 September, most of these fishermen returned to land but 250 others on 23 trawlers remained missing. At least eight trawlers capsized in rough seas; some fishermen swam to shore while many others were missing. Two bodies were found at Ukhia's Inani Beach while three were recovered along the shores of Nazirartek, Pechar Dwip and Kolatoli Square. A search operation for the missing was initiated by the Bangladesh Navy. Indian fishermen also rescued 12 Bangladeshi nationals stranded in the bay due to rough seas.\nIndia\nOn 14 September, the IMD said light to moderate rain was possible in West Bengal while some areas might experience extreme rainfall. Intense rainfall was expected in Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Mizoram, Tripura, Assam and Meghalaya from 14 to 16 September. A \"red\" alert was later issued for West Bengal and Odisha with a greater expectation for intense rain. In Kolkata, 72.4\u00a0mm (2.85\u00a0in) of rain was recorded over a 24-hour period. Over 125.8\u00a0mm (4.95\u00a0in) of rain was measured between 13 and 14 September in the city.\nDue to the heavy rains , the Damodar Valley Corporation released more than 3.5 lakh cusec (9,911 cubic metres per second) of water from its dams, resulting in inundation of Birbhum, Bankura, Howrah, Hooghly, North and South 24 Parganas, Purba and Paschim Medinipur, and Paschim Bardhaman districts of West Bengal. 28 people were killed due to these floods and 25,000 people had t",

    "American author, activist and teacher (1947\u20132024)\nElaine DePrince (n\u00e9e DiGiacomo, August 6, 1947 \u2013 September 11, 2024) was an American author, hemophilia activist, teacher, and advocate of adoptive parenting. The mother of 11 children, she is best known as the adoptive mother of ballet star Michaela DePrince and the co-author of her memoir, Taking Flight: From War Orphan to Star Ballerina (2014). She was interviewed in the 2011 documentary First Position, discussing the racism they encountered as Michaela pursued training in classical ballet. She was also the author of Cry Bloody Murder: A Tale of Tainted Blood (1997), which tells the story of her family's ordeal after their three hemophiliac sons were infected with HIV/AIDS in the 1980s. In the book, DePrince holds pharmaceutical companies, the Food and Drug Administration, and the National Hemophilia Foundation responsible for failing to ensure the safety of blood plasma products.\nEarly life and education\nBorn Elaine DiGiacomo on August 6, 1947, she attended Camden Catholic High School in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. She was a graduate of Rutgers University.\nShe was inspired to adopt in fifth grade, when she read The Family Nobody Wanted by Helen Doss. The book tells the true story of a family with 12 children, including children who had been considered \"unadoptable\" because they were non-white or had special needs.\nAdoption of sons\nDePrince said in interviews that she discussed her desire to adopt with Charles DePrince before they got married, and that he agreed. Elaine and Charles DePrince were married in May 1971 in Pennsauken, New Jersey.\nDePrince was born with Von Willebrand disease, a blood clotting disorder similar to hemophilia, and unknowingly passed it on to her two eldest sons, Adam and Erik. In 1980, DePrinces adopted their son Michael, nearly two, who had hemophilia and was deaf and disabled following a bus accident. Five years later, New Jersey officials asked them to adopt two more boys (Cubby and Teddy) with hemophilia who had been living in a hospital, knowing that the couple was familiar with the medical care required, which included mixing freeze-dried clotting factor with sterile water and injecting them several times weekly.\nIn May 1988, the DePrinces had their sons tested, and were devastated to learn that their three adopted sons were HIV-positive. Like roughly half of all 20,000 hemophiliacs in the United States, their adopted sons had contracted the AIDS virus from injecting contaminated blood-clotting products that were supposed to heal them. Their son Cubby died on June 9, 1993, at age 11, followed by Michael who died on March 14, 1994, at age 15. Their son Teddy battled the virus with the help of new protease inhibitor drugs, which initially reduced his viral load below detectable levels, but two years later the HIV infection returned; he died in 2004 at age 24.\nActivism and lawsuits\nDePrince wrote that the deaths of her two young sons left her wanting to die. Rather than succumb to grief, she decided to investigate how the tainted blood products had ended up being given to hemophiliacs, and to seek justice for them and their families. She lobbied successfully to have the New Jersey Legislature extend the statute of limitations so that hemophiliacs could sue for compensation.\nThe DePrinces joined more than 100 other New Jersey and New York families in a class action lawsuit filed in 1993. The suit accused clotting factor manufacturers of negligence in the early 1980s, when they failed to warn patients that their products were contaminated with hepatitis. Elaine DePrince emerged as one of the leading advocates for hemophiliacs and their families, repeatedly sharing the story of Cubby and Michael and her anger that their deaths were preventable.\nIn July 1997, DePrince joined other hemophilia activists in lobbying senators in Washington, D.C., to pass federal legislation awarding funds to AIDS-infected hemophiliacs or their survivors because the infected products had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Around that time, the DePrinces were among the families that turned down a proposed $100,000 settlement from the pharmaceutical companies for hemophiliac AIDS victims or their survivors, arguing that it was not enough.\nCry Bloody Murder\nDePrince's book, Cry Bloody Murder: A Tale of Tainted Blood, published by Random House in July 1997, wove the story of her family's ordeal with her argument that drug companies, the FDA, and the National Hemophilia Foundation were responsible. One of the central points in her book is that a technique for inactivating any hepatitis B virus or HIV in clotting factor products had been developed in Germany in 1978 and was marketed there in 1980, but was not used by the four pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. until 1986. DePrince argued that the quest for profit and collusion between government agencies and industry caused manufacturers to delay making their blood products safer. Manufa",

    "United States historic place\nThe Immanuel School of Industries, also known as I Street Relief Depot and Akers Taxidermy, is a historical building located in Bellingham, Washington. The building was completed in 1906.\nBackground\nThe Immanuel School of Industries was established in January 1896 in association with the Immanuel Baptist church. The first class consisted of 18 pupils. Enrollment in the school was free and the students came from a number of different social classes.  The school was co-ed and taught a variety of things, such as cooking, wood carving, leather making, clay modeling, basket weaving, and sewing. The school also offered a kindergarten for younger students which opened on September 10, 1904. Upon opening, the kindergarten was the only one in Bellingham. The school also occasionally offered classes to adults, such as dressmaking, for a fee. Before moving to the building on Astor street in 1906, the school met at the Knights of Pythias hall and the P.L.F clubhouse.\nHistory\nDue to increased enrollment and lack of space for classes, a permit for a dedicated building  was obtained in February 1905. The cost of the building was estimated to be about $7,000. The exterior of the building was completed in June 1906.  The first floor held seven classrooms and the cooking department. The second floor contained the kindergarten and an auditorium. The basement was used for manual training. By 1908, enrollment in the school had risen to over 100.\nThe school began to experience financial issues in the late 1900s. In 1909, it was decided that the kindergarten would not re-open the next school year unless 40 students paid tuition. Since many students came from a lower economic background, raising funds for the school was difficult. The school was subsequently closed in 1916.\nFrom 1916 to 1947, the building served as headquarters for many social agencies of Whatcom county, such as the Social Security, and the Works Progress Administration.\nIn January 1947 the Church of God took residence in the building, with the Reverend C.H Ford leading the church. The church also offered Sunday school. C.M Ruby became reverend of the church in September of 1950 In March 1969, the church began to construct a new building at Peabody street. In July of the same year the church moved service to Ferndale.\nBy August 1969, Akers Taxidermist had moved into the building from their old location at 1308 E. Street.\nThe building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 7, 2003.\n",

    "Trio of interacting galaxies in the constellation Cancer\nSDSS J0849+1114 (SDSS J084905.51+111447.2) is a late-stage galaxy merger forming from a trio of galaxies located in the constellation of Cancer. At the redshift of 0.077, they are located 1.06 billion light-years from Earth. First discovered as a triple active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidate in a Sloan Digital Sky Survey study published in 2011, they received significant attention when astronomers discovered it harbors three supermassive black holes in its center.\nCharacteristics\nSDSS J0849+1114 is made up of three closely spaced interacting spiral galaxies, all showing signs of distortion. It has tidal tail features indicative of a late-stage merger. The nuclei in SDSS J0849+1114 are considered active and the galaxies classified as type 2 Seyferts according to long-slit spectroscopy observations from Apache Point Observatory. A study also mentions out of the triple AGN candidates studied, SDSS J0849+1114 is also the first known triple Seyfert nucleus. In addition, they are classified as luminous infrared galaxies with luminosity of 8-1000 \u03bcm.\nAccording to a study published in 2022, the primary nucleus of SDSS J0849+1114 is more powerful compared to the secondary and tertiary nuclei. Further evidence also points out it has a double-sided jet with its orientation changing by 20 degrees, explaining the angular momentum of the black hole might be changed by a merger-enhanced accretion. The secondary nucleus shows absence of radio emission at all frequencies while the tertiary nucleus also has a two-sided jet but shown enlarging a radio lobe. Based on the internal energy of the lobe, it is estimated 5.0 \u00d7 1055 erg. Furthermore, the three nuclei showed extended disc and budge components which the two showed signs of tidal stripping by the main nucleus.\nSupermassive black holes\nThe three supermassive black holes in SDSS J0849+1114 are found colliding together with a separation gap of only between 10,000 and 30,000 light-years. All of them are surrounded by dusty structures and each of the black holes have a mass of ~1011.3 M\u2609, 106.4 M\u2609 and 106.7 M\u2609 respectively. According to Chandra and NuSTAR observations, one of the black holes showed large quantities of interstellar matter surrounding its torus. It is estimated that the black holes from the merging galaxies will form a gravitationally bound triple black hole system within a few billion years.\n",

    "Women's National Basketball Association team in Portland, Oregon\nThe Portland WNBA team is an American professional basketball team based in Portland, Oregon. The team is scheduled to begin play in 2026 as the 15th member of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). They will play in the Moda Center starting in 2026. It will be the second WNBA team located in Portland, following the Portland Fire in the early 2000s.\nHistory\nThe team will play at Moda Center (exterior pictured in 2017)\nThe Portland Fire were Portland's first venture with the WNBA. The team played from 2000 until 2002 when they folded. In February 2023, WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert visited Portland for an event at The Sports Bra co-hosted by US senator Ron Wyden, along with personnel from the Portland Trail Blazers, Portland Thorns FC, and Oregon and Oregon State's women's basketball teams. In October 2023, the WNBA was set to award a team to Portland with tech billionaire Kirk Brown as the planned owner of the team. Plans fell through days before a planned October 26 announcement when Brown pulled out which left the potential team without the required $50 million expansion fee. Brown and the league had a difference of opinion on the team's name branding, with Brown wanting the team to be called the Rose City Royalty, but Engelbert was \"uncomfortable\" with that idea. The league also found Brown's ownership stake in Shoot 360, a basketball training center with locations across the country, as a potential conflict of interest. The WNBA wanted him to give up his investment, but he refused and withdrew his bid with all of the conditions required.\nOn September 18, 2024, Portland was officially awarded a franchise, which will be the WNBA's 15th team. The team will be owned by Lisa Bhathal Merage and her brother Alex Bhathal via RAJ Sports, who also own the Thorns. They paid the WNBA $125 million for the franchise. Lisa Bhathal Merage will serve as controlling owner and WNBA Governor; Alex Bhathal will serve as Alternate Governor. The team will begin play in 2026. The Bhathals began conversations with the WNBA in late 2023 after the previous attempt to bring a team to Portland fell apart. On the decision to award Portland a team, Engelbert said \"I think Portland has proven they'll show up for women's sports and definitely for women's basketball, so we're excited to be coming back to the market\". Alex added that he and his sister became convinced that Portland was a great market for women's sports during their process of purchasing the Thorns.\n",

    "Mineral of the simple telluride class\nNot to be confused with Freibergite.\nFrohbergite (German: Frohbergit, title by proper name: Max Hans Frohberg), also iron telluride is a rare hydrothermal mineral from the sulfide class, in composition \u2014 iron telluride with the ideal formula FeTe2 (contains 82.05% tellurium and 17.95% iron).\nFrohbergite occurs in tellurium-rich veins of hydrothermal deposits, sometimes as a thin rim on the periphery of chalcopyrite or as inclusions in native gold, petzite or chalcopyrite. It belongs to the marcasite group and forms a mineral line with mattagamite. Frohbergite most often occurs as fine-grained aggregates.:\u200a93\u200a\nDiscovery history and name\nFrohbergite was first identified by Thompson in 1947 in the telluride-rich portion of the Robb-Montbray Mine in Quebec, Canada, which was then considered the only known occurrence of the mineral for nearly three decades.:\u200a93\u200a That same year, Thompson synthesized an artificial compound of the composition FeTe2 for control purposes. In terms of the features of the crystal structure and optical properties in polished sections, it turned out to be identical or similar to natural frohbergite.:\u200a93\u200a\nFrohbergite was found in polished sections as a rim up to 15 \u03bc wide around chalcopyrite at the contact with altaite (PbTe), native gold and melonite. Associated minerals: tellurobismuthite, petzite (Ag,Au)2Te, pyrite, marcasite, chalcopyrite, covellite etc.:\u200a20\u200a For a long time, frohbergite was observed only in polished sections as a fine-grained aggregate, so its macroscopic features remained unstudied.:\u200a93\u200a\nThe mineral was named in honor of the Canadian geologist and mineralogist of German origin, Dr. Max Hans Frohberg (1901\u20131970, Toronto, Canada).\nProperties\nFrohbergite is a mineral of orthorhombic syngony, dipyramidal. The crystal structure is similar to that of marcasite. The mineral is brittle, the hardness fluctuates between 3\u20134 on the Mohs scale.:\u200a19\u200a\nBased on its chemical formula and crystal structure, the mineral was initially assigned to the marcasite group, where it forms a continuous mineral line with mattagamite. Moreover, frohbergite and mattagamite respectively represent the extreme members of a series of solid natural solutions FeTe2 \u2192 CoTe2.:\u200a220\u200a\nAccording to another classification proposed in the 1970s by the Bulgarian mineralogist Ivan Kostov, plumbotellurides of gold, copper, iron and silver (Au\u2014\u0421u\u2014Fe\u2014Ag) were assigned to the bilibinskite group, as the most common mineral. Frohbergite was not assigned to this group directly, but its closeness to it was noted, it was established that plumbotellurides, rich in metal content, partially fill the gap in composition between pure tellurides (kostovite AuCuTe4, sylvanite AuAgTe4, frohbergite FeTe2, rickardite Cu5\u0422\u04353, altaite PbTe) and minerals in the gold-copper system (Au\u2014\u0421u).:\u200a141\u2013142\u200a\nMost often, frohbergite occurs as fine-grained aggregates,:\u200a93\u200a the mineral is opaque, the color on the polished section is whitish with a bluish or pinkish tint, the luster is metallic, the mineral is strongly anisotropic: from red-orange to ink-blue. In a polished section, the hue of frohbergite is reddish-pink, which distinguishes it from the similar, but yellowish-pink melonite (NiTe2). The anisotropy is indistinct. Bireflection ranges from orange-red to the color of blue ink. X-ray examination of a microscopic sample showed its identity with the artificially produced compound FeTe2.:\u200a20\u200a In terms of immediate visual impression, the color of frohbergite is very similar to the main variety of germanite from the Tsumeb deposit (Namibia), differing from it in lightness (germanite R is 25%, and frohbergite is 55%) and lower saturation of chromatic tone.:\u200a95\u200a\nSeveral iron tellurides were synthesized experimentally for crystallographic and chemical comparison. At temperatures below 519\u00a0\u00b0C, only two mineraloid compounds were stable: \u03b2-FeTe0,9 and, properly, FeTe2 (frohbergite).:\u200a20\u200a\nHydrochloric acid, potassium cyanide, iron trichloride, caustic potash and corrosive sublimate do not act on polished frohbergite. Diluted nitric acid (1:1) causes rapid boiling until a black spot is formed.:\u200a20\u200a\nIn its lilac hue and high relief, frohbergite resembles some minerals of the linnaeite-gersdorffite group. In isolated samples, frohbergite was sometimes confused with pyrrhotite. Frohbergite differs from the latter in its increased reflectivity and significantly lower saturation of the color tone, in which the bluish component noticeably predominates. With crossed nicols, the anisotropy of pyrrhotite is more pronounced, but the color effect is absent.:\u200a96\u200a\nFrohbergite differs little from gersdorffite in optical properties, especially since the main distinguishing feature \u2014 optical anisotropy of frohbergite - cannot always be detected due to the extremely fine-grained structure of its aggregates. In addition, gersdorffite often has anomalous anisotropy.:\u200a97\u200a\nMineral formation\nFrohbergite occurs in many tellurium-rich h",

    "Protected area in Northern Territory, Australia\nTanami Desert\nThe Southern Tanami Indigenous Protected Area (IPA) is Walpiri-managed region of the Tanami Desert in Central Australia. At 101,600 km2, it is Australia's largest IPA.\nIPAs are areas of land and sea Country managed by First Nations groups for biodiversity conservation and cultural outcomes through voluntary agreements with the Australian Government. These areas form part of Australia's National Reserve System.\nDedicated in July 2012, the area has significant cultural and natural value. It is managed by the Warlpiri Rangers, of the Central Land Council's ranger groups combining Yapa (Aboriginal) and Kardiya (non-Aboriginal) knowledges.\nThe Southern Tanami IPA includes the Reynolds and Truer ranges, as well as sand dunes and salt pans. It has large areas of spinifex hummock grassland with a flowering shrub overstorey. This provides habitat to threatened species such as the walpajirri (bilby), warrarna (great desert skink) and\u00a0jajina (brush-tailed mulgara).\n",
    "\nPeter J. Morin (born September 8, 1953) is an American ecologist known for his work in community ecology. He is a professor in the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Natural Resources at Rutgers University, where he has been since 1983.\nIn 1991, Morin responded to reports of fluctuation in amphibian populations by advocating for more information on population decline rather than simply concluding that extinction occurred at a \"higher rate\" than it had been. A 1997 study conducted on the predictability of ecosystems showed that the greater the number of species within the ecosystem, the more predictable the environment would be. Morin stated that this could be applied to creating ecosystems in space.\nMorin served as the director for the Hutcheson Memorial Forest in 2012.\nAwards\nHe received the George Mercer Award for 1985 from the Ecological Society of America for his article \"Predation, Competition, and the Composition of Larval Anuran Guilds\".\nIn 1999, he was elected as a fellow to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The story is that Pope Urban V (al secolo born Guillaume de Grimoard), was travelling from Avignon to Rome to assert his rule over papal territory, recently reacquired for the papacy by Cardinal Albornoz; the pope and his large entourage stopped in Viterbo, which had been dispossessed from the rule of the di Vico family. The accompanying French cardinals and troops were likely not very welcome to the population of Viterbo. Entering the walls of Viterbo through the Porta Carmine, after the pope had passed an aide to the Cardinal of Carcassonne washed a pet dog in the basin of this fountain. This provoked a rebellion by the local neighborhood, that beset the accompanying cardinals, in which the fountain was destroyed. Riots lasted two days, and the Pope and his Cardinals sought refuge in the Rocca Albornoz. The pope's response to the event was harsh; imprisoning over fifty citizens, razing houses and raising the walls protecting the neighborhood. After visiting Rome, Pope Urban V would die en route back to Avignon; the Di Vico family would briefly reassert itself in Viterbo.\nThe fountain has a round basin surmounted by a column with a circle of lions (symbol of Viterbo) inside individual porticos, and topped with a hexagonal cone with bas-reliefs of saints and bishops.\n",
    "High cross and attendant pillars.\nThe east face of the marigold stone.\nThe west face of the marigold stone.\nThe decorated lintel.\nThe Carndonagh stones are a set of five sculpted stones in the town of Carndonagh, County Donegal. All five stones are on the grounds of Donagh Church. The group consists of one free-standing high cross with two smaller, attendant pillars; a free-standing pillar known as the \"Marigold Stone\"; and a decorated door lintel. The pieces apart from the lintel are thought, on the basis of their stylistic similarity, to be roughly contemporaneous. These stones are generally now dated between the 9th and 10th century, though a minority date them to the 7th century on the basis of stylistic comparisons with the Book of Durrow.:\u200a167\u2013169\u200a\nFrench scholar Fran\u00e7oise Henry (who dated the stone to the 7th century) made the Carndonagh high cross famous by citing it prominently in her theory of the origin of Insular high crosses.:\u200a169\u200a She believed that high crosses gradually emerged from carved slabs (such as the St Mura Cross at Fahan) and that the Carndonagh high cross \"marks the final victory in the attempt to free the cross from the slab\".:\u200a128\u200a This theory gained few supporters, with later archaeological evidence substantially refuting it.:\u200a169\u200a Scottish archaeologist Robert B. K. Stevenson sharply criticised her interpretation of the Carndonagh stones.\n",
    "Television station in Jaru Rond\u00f4nia, Brazil\nRede Amaz\u00f4nica Jaru was a Brazilian television station based in Jaru, a city in the state of Rond\u00f4nia. It operated VHF analog channel 10 and digital UHF channel 23 and was affiliated with TV Globo. It was owned by Grupo Rede Amaz\u00f4nica.\nHistory\nTV Jaru (1979-2015)\nRede Amaz\u00f4nica received the authorization to operate a relay station in Jaru on June 13, 1979. This led to the creation of TV Jaru, which relayed programs from Rede Bandeirantes from tapes. Due to the lack of satellite signals until 1982, the station was waiting for the sale of all sponsorship quotas to show video tapes of soccer matches.\nOn January 24, 1983, following the decision taken from other stations of the network (except TV Amazonas and the stations in inland Amazonas), TV Jaru left Rede Bandeirantes and became an affiliate of Rede Globo.\nIn 2005, TV Jaru hired journalist Robert Muracami, who began producing reports for Rede Amaz\u00f4nica's news programs and the local news bulletins 24 Horas, shown during the station's commercial breaks. As a result, it also began to include local commercials.\n The production of these bulletins continued until 2007, when Robert left the station. Following his exit, TV Jaru stopped producing news items on its own, and the station was now being served by the news division of TV Ariquemes.\nRede Amaz\u00f4nica Jaru (2015-2023)\nAs of January 3, 2015, like the other stations on the network, the station stopped identifying itself as TV Jaru, starting to use the name Rede Amaz\u00f4nica Jaru. In 2018, the station once again had an exclusive reporter, when video reporter Rinaldo Moreira was hired. In March of that year, a live link from the reporter during Jornal de Rond\u00f4nia 1st Edition had national repercussions due to an accident with a Military Police vehicle, which hit him while he was on air. He, however, resumed participating in the news shortly afterwards, clarifying that he was fine.\nOn May 1, 2020, Rede Amaz\u00f4nica Jaru started to retransmit the local edition of Jornal de Rond\u00f4nia 2nd Edition produced by Rede Amaz\u00f4nica Ariquemes, presented by Luiz Martins. On May 24, 2023, Rede Amaz\u00f4nica Jaru had its commercial department closed, which marked its shutdown. With that, the station officially became a relayer of Rede Amaz\u00f4nica Porto Velho.\nTechnical information\nTV Jaru received the digital signal grant in Jaru for UHF channel 23 in May 2012. As Rede Amaz\u00f4nica Jaru, the station started operating with the technology on December 5, 2022.\nProgramas\nAs well as relaying Rede Amaz\u00f4nica Porto Velho's statewide programming and TV Globo's national output, Rede Amaz\u00f4nica Jaru inserted local commercials and aired the following programs:\n24 Horas\nJornal de Rond\u00f4nia 2\u00aa Edi\u00e7\u00e3o (generated by Rede Amaz\u00f4nica Ariquemes)\nStaff\nFormer members\nRinaldo Moreira\nRobert Muracami",

    "\nThe Coiffure (known as La Coiffure in French) is a drypoint and aquatint print by the American printmaker and painter Mary Cassatt. Made in 1890\u20131891, the work was inspired by Cassatt's attendance of an exhibition of Japanese woodblock prints, known as Ukiyo-e.\nHistory\nThe Coiffure is a print produced by American printmaker and painter Mary Cassatt in 1890\u20131891. It was part of a series of ten color prints depicting women in everyday activities. Cassatt was inspired to create the piece after viewing a Paris exhibition of Japanese woodblock prints organized by the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in April 1890. Cassatt wrote a letter later in the week to her friend and fellow painter, Berthe Morisot, expressing her fascination with the Japanese prints.\nIn the fall of 1890 and winter of 1891, Cassatt made hundreds of drypoint etchings in her studio, including The Coiffure. The dimensions of the The Coiffure vary depending on its version. Cassatt employed a drypoint and aquatint etching process in the print's production. One version was on laid paper. A study for The Coiffure was made with black crayon and graphite on wove paper.\nCassatt's piece was partially inspired by the 18th-century print Takashima Ohisa Using Two Mirrors to Observe Her Coiffure by Kitagawa Utamaro, which she had in her personal collection. Cassatt's Coiffure shows a nude woman adjusting her hair bun. The nudity of the model is intentionally abstracted, as a result of Cassatt's homage to the Japanese style. Cassatt also produced a companion piece to The Coiffure, titled Woman Bathing.\nSince Cassatt's death in 1926, different versions of The Coiffure have been exhibited at various museums and galleries. Its provenance includes one version being held by the estate of Charles T. Brooks in Cleveland, Ohio through 1941, when it was then moved to the Cleveland Museum of Art. The National Gallery of Art has exhibited it in 1948, 1950, 1963, and 1970. More recently, the Guggenheim Museum and Yokohama Museum of Art exhibited the work in 2009 and 2016, respectively.\nVersions\nNotes\n",

    "Street in London, England\nMansfield Road looking east towards Gospel Oak Station, 2006\nView of the Lismore Circus housing estate.\nMansfield Road is a street in the Gospel Oak area of Hampstead. It runs east to west from a junction with Fleet Road and Southampton Road to Gospel Oak Station where it becomes Gordon House Road which runs on as far as the Highgate Road. Today it forms part of the B518 route. \nLike Fleet Road to its east it follows an medieval track between South End in Hampstead and Gospel Oak. After Gospel Oak station it continues as Gordon House Road to the junction with Highgate Road, passing the southern edge of Parliament Hill on the way. Lissenden Gardens runs northwards off it.  \nPortrait of Lord Mansfield by John Singleton Copley\nThe road takes its name from the eighteenth century Lord Chancellor Lord Mansfield, the owner of Kenwood House whose estate stretched as far as the northern side of the road. The was street was laid out in 1806. Construction remained haphazard over the following decades until the Victorian era.\nThe area to the south of Mansfield Road was dramatically redeveloped during the 1960s as the nineteenth century Lismore Circus was replaced with modern buildings. Oak Village and Elaine Grove retain their older Victorian appearance. The Mansfield conservation area covers both the street and those directly north of it built in the late Victorian era, including All Hallows Church.\n",
    "\nSS Hayle was a steam vessel built by Harvey and Company, Hayle for Tom Mawr Company of Neath in 1867.\nHistory\nThe Hayle was launched by Miss Husband on 10 July 1867. She was fitted with water ballast filled by a valve in the bottom and emptied by engine pumps which took around 30 minutes. Her hold was divided into three water-tight compartments for cargo. \nIn December 1868 she was obtained by Messrs Adam & Co., Marischal Street, Aberdeen to carry coal to Aberdeen. This was to overcome difficulties during the winter in the delivery of coal to Aberdeen by sailing vessels which were frequently delayed and which increased the costs of delivery. The company purchased the Hayle and she left London on 24 November 1868 for Sunderland to take up her first consignment which was delivered to Aberdeen successfully. Two more trips were completed which delivered 1,500 tons of coal in the space of 21 days.  \nIn mid 1869 she returned to London and was fitted out for laying telegraphic cables. From August 1869 she was engaged by the Orkney and Shetland Islands Telegraph Company to lay submarine cables between Caithness, Orkney and Shetland. Much of 1870 was taken up with this work between the islands.\nOn 25 December 1869 during a storm she got stuck on Scroby Sand, but was refloated with the assistance of boatmen.\nOn 5 October 1882 the ship sustained damage whilst entering the dock gates in Aberdeen Harbour. The owners launched action against the Harbour Commissioners in pursuit of \u00a3527 7s 8d (equivalent to \u00a367,000 in 2023) of damages. On 6 December 1885 she was in collision with a vessel assumed to be the Leader of Lossiemouth in the vicinity of Bell Rock. She put into Arbroath Harbour but the damage to the vessel was significant and necessitated its return to Aberdeen for repairs.\nOn 15 March 1890 whilst sailing from Sunderland to Aberdeen with a cargo of coals, stranded on Bondiear Rocks near Amble. In August 1890, Adam and Co put the steamer up for sale.\nA steamer bearing the name Hayle is recorded as departing Liverpool on 13 January 1891 for Aviles, Spain. She was sold to Italian owners Carlo Chiappe of Genoa and named Luigia C. \nLater she was sold again to Gustaldi Company and renamed as Ville de Cannes. She collided with the British steamer Island on 19 January 1899 at the entrance to Cannes harbour.\nIn 1907 she was purchased by Italian owners and briefly named Providenza. By 1913 she was owned by Felix Ribera based in Palam\u00f3s, Spain and named the Nuevo Ampurdan\u00e9s.

    "\nThe 2027 Valencia City Council election, also the 2027 Valencia municipal election, will be held on Sunday, 23 May 2027, to elect the 13th City Council of the municipality of  Valencia. All 33 seats in the City Council will be up for election. The election will be held simultaneously with regional elections in at least eight autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain.\nElectoral system\nThe City Council of Valencia (Valencian: Ajuntament de Val\u00e8ncia, Spanish: Ayuntamiento de Valencia) is the top-tier administrative and governing body of the municipality of Valencia, composed of the mayor, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Elections to the local councils in Spain are fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years. Voting for the local assembly is on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprises all nationals over 18 years of age, registered and residing in the municipality of Valencia and in full enjoyment of their political rights, as well as resident non-national European citizens and those whose country of origin allowed Spanish nationals to vote in their own elections by virtue of a treaty.\nLocal councillors are elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with an electoral threshold of five percent of valid votes\u2014which includes blank ballots\u2014being applied in each local council. Councillors are allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale:\nThe mayor is indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause requires that mayoral candidates earn the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly is to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, the appointee will be determined by lot.\nParties and candidates\nThe electoral law allows parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election are required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election being called, whereas groupings of electors need to secure the signature of a determined amount of the electors registered in the municipality for which they seek election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. In the case of Valencia, as its population is between 300,001 and 1,000,000, at least 5,000 signatures are required.\nBelow is a list of the main parties and electoral alliances which will likely contest the election:\nOpinion polls\nThe tables below list opinion polling results in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The \"Lead\" column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a poll.\nVoting intention estimates\nThe table below lists weighted voting intention estimates. Refusals are generally excluded from the party vote percentages, while question wording and the treatment of \"don't know\" responses and those not intending to vote may vary between polling organisations.

    "Mandarin dialect of Fujian\nQinjiang Mandarin, simplified Chinese: \u7434\u6c5f\u8bdd; traditional Chinese: \u7434\u6c5f\u8a71; pinyin: Q\u00ednji\u0101nghu\u00e0, also known as the Bannerman Language of Changle (\u957f\u4e50\u65d7\u4e0b\u8bdd; \u9577\u6a02\u65d7\u4e0b\u8a71; Ch\u00e1ngl\u00e8 q\u00edxi\u00e0 hu\u00e0), is a Mandarin \"dialect island\", spoken in the Manchu village of Qinjiang, located in Changle, Fujian. It is considered to be derived from the Beijing Mandarin spoken by Manchu bannermen, and thus contains some Manchu loanwords, as well as having some influence from the neighboring Eastern Min varieties of Changle.\nHistory\nIn 1729, during the seventh year of the reign of Yongzheng, the Qing government built a castle in the Yangyu area of Changle County in response to frequent uprisings along the Fujian coast. This was situated at the confluence of three key tributaries of the Min River (\u95fd\u6c5f; \u95a9\u6c5f; M\u01d0n Ji\u0101ng), namely the Wulong River, Majiang River and Qinjiang River. The Bannermen and their families that were stationed there came mostly from the area near Beijing and established the Qinjiang Manchu Village (commonly known as \u65d7\u4e0b\u91cc; Q\u00edxi\u00e0 L\u01d0) there. Due to the unique status of these military families, as well as the ethnic and class tensions, they had limited interaction with the local population and did not intermarry, thus retaining the Mandarin dialect that they had spoken.\n",
    "2024 song by Future\n\"Plutoski\" is a song by American rapper Future from his seventeenth mixtape Mixtape Pluto (2024). Produced by Wheezy, Southside and Juke Wong, it samples \"I Got You (I Feel Good)\" by James Brown.\nCritical reception\nThe song received generally mixed reviews from critics. Robin Murray of Clash described it as \"stumbling\" and that it \"seems formless\". Gary Suarez of Vulture commented \"The utterly incoherent 'Plutoski' sounds like a rough demo, with a vocal take that seems like it was recorded from the bottom of a double cup.\" Alexander Cole of HotNewHipHop wrote \"One track that seems to be getting attention is 'Plutoski.' Once you hear this track, you will understand why this has been the case so far. It features some wild flows from Future, and one particular vocal quirk that has proven to be quite polarizing. Some are saying he's a genius for it, others are calling him washed. But that is the beauty of Future. He tries new things, regardless of what the backlash might be.\" Reviewing Mixtape Pluto for HotNewHipHop, Gabriel Bras Nevares stated \"As cringe as many find Future's chorus on 'PLUTOSKI,' and as much as that instrumental deserved better, it's actually one of the most fun parts of the mixtape, thanks to ditching the self-serious attitude.\" Paul A. Thompson of Pitchfork wrote, \"When he slips into slow, languid flows, as he does on 'Lil Demon' and 'Plutoski,' the writing is laid bare\u2014and is revealed, virtually without exception, as incisive and sometimes shockingly self-critical.\"\nCharts\n",
    "Jewish Synagogue located in Saint-Etienne, Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, France\nThe Synagogue de Saint-\u00c9tienne is a Jewish Synagogue located in Saint-Etienne, Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, France. \nHistory\nThe Jewish community of the Loire and Haute-Loire was created in 1868 by Alsatian Jews, who were jointed by others after the Franco-Prussian War. At the beginning of the 20th century, Jews from Russia and Poland moved to Saint-\u00c9tienne.\nThe Synagogue of Saint-\u00c9tienne was built in 1880.\nWorld War II\nApproximately twenty-five to one hundred Jewish families lived in Saint-\u00c9tienne at the beginning of the Second World War. They were joined by a number of refugee families from Alsace\u2013Lorraine and Germany, for a total of around 500 people. A portion of this population (71 people) were arrested during a roundup on August 26, 1942, and brought to Lyon, then Drancy, before being deported to numerous extermination camps., \nAfter the war\nFollowing the Liberation of France, the Jewish community restarted their activities.\nAndr\u00e9 Stora was the Hazzan for the Synagogue de Saint-\u00c9tienne from 1951 to 1956, before becoming the Hazzan of the Grand synagogue of Paris.\nDemolition and new community center\nIn the 1960s, the land under the synagogue started sinking. The building was destroyed and a community center was constructed in its place. Around the same time, North African Jews were integrated into the community.\nToday the synagogue is home to approximately sixty families.\nThe Rabbi is Michel Elharrar.\n",
    "Madagascar participated once in the Africa Cup of Nations in 2019 in Egypt. On 16 October 2018, Madagascar qualified to the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations for the first time in their history, after they won 1\u20130 against Equatorial Guinea. During their debut match against Guinea on 22 June 2019, Anicet Abel scored Madagascar's first-ever AFCON goal and secured their first point of the competition with a 2\u20132 draw against Guinea. The team defeated Burundi in their second match and followed it up with a 2\u20130 victory over the Super Eagles of Nigeria to top Group B. Then Madagascar advanced to quarter-finals after beating DR Congo in the round of 16. The team's successful performance was coined by pundits as the Iceland of Africa, resembling the shockingly successful debut of Iceland in UEFA Euro 2016.

    "Iranian femal musician, poet and visual artist (1930-2017)\nTalieh Kamran (Persian: \u0637\u0644\u06cc\u0639\u0647 \u06a9\u0627\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0646; b. 1930 \u2013 March 14, 2017) was an Iranian santur player, painter, and poet, and a pioneer of modern art in Iran. She earned the title \"Mother of Traditional Santur Playing in Iran.\" Kamran played a significant role in the evolution of Iranian classical music and left a lasting legacy through her art and music.\nBiography\nTalieh Kamran was born in 1930 in Tehran into an artistic family. Her father was a violinist and a student of Hossein Khan Esmailzadeh, while her mother was both musically inclined and engaged in painting. During her childhood, Talieh Kamran was taught to play the santur by Habib Samaei, who was a family friend. From around 1942, Samaei gave her lessons every two weeks, and later, she continued her musical education with Morteza Abdolrasouli, another student of Samaei. She also learned traditional rhythmic patterns and ensemble playing from Hossein Tehrani, who introduced her to Ruhollah Khaleghi.\nKamran became a featured performer in the Iranian National Music Association concerts, playing the santur alongside Tehrani's tombak. Her recorded performance in the Homayoun mode was even presented by Khaleghi in Russia as an example of Iranian female musicians' artistry. In the late 1940s, she studied music notation with Khaleghi and then with Abolhasan Saba. By the mid-1950s, Kamran had notated key pieces she had learned from Habib Samaei, including in the Shur, Avaz-e Abu Ata, Bayat-e Esfahan, and Chahargah modes, which she later published in her book Sections of Habib Samaei's Radif as Narrated by Talieh Kamran (Persian: \u0628\u062e\u0634\u200c\u0647\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0631\u062f\u06cc\u0641 \u062d\u0628\u06cc\u0628 \u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u06cc \u0628\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u06cc\u062a \u0637\u0644\u06cc\u0639\u0647 \u06a9\u0627\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0646).

    "White dwarf in the constellation Grus\nWD J2147\u20134035 (DES J214756.46-403529.3) is a very cold white dwarf with a temperature of about 3,050 Kelvin (2780 \u00b0C; 5030 \u00b0F). It also shows signs of pollution with planetary debris.\nWD J2147\u20134035 was first identified from Gaia data as a white dwarf candidate in 2019. In 2021 it was pointed out as an unusual faint white dwarf in the solar neighbourhood. The researchers found it could be extremely old (about 10 Gyrs). In 2022 results from observations with X-shooter on the Very Large Telescope were published. The object was identified as a white dwarf, likely with a helium-dominated atmosphere. The researchers also detected metal pollution in the form of sodium, lithium, potassium and possibly carbon. The lithium line shows Zeeman splitting, which indicates that WD J2147\u20134035 is a magnetic white dwarf. The researchers measure a magnetic field strength of 0.55 \u00b10.03 Megagauss. The magnetism can lead to inhomogeneous brightness distribution and the TESS light curve shows that the white dwarf has a rotation period of around 13 hours. The nature of the accreted parent body is unclear as of September 2024.\nWD J2147\u20134035 was once a main-sequence star with a mass of 2.47 \u00b10.22 M\u2609, which had a lifetime of about 500 Myrs. Once the star became an AGB star, it lost mass and became a white dwarf with a mass of 0.69 \u00b10.02 M\u2609. The white dwarf existed for 10.21 \u00b10.22 Gyrs, meaning the total age is 10.7 \u00b10.3 Gyrs.\nCold white dwarfs are often strongly affected by collision induced absorption (CIA) of hydrogen. This can lead to faint optical red and infrared brightness. These white dwarfs are also called IR-faint white dwarfs. WD J2147\u20134035 is however very red (r-z=2.29 mag) which is seen as evidence that it only has a low hydrogen to helium ratio, resulting in very mild CIA and therefore giving it the distinct orange color.\nSee also\nList of exoplanets and planetary debris around white dwarfs\nESO 439-26 is a cold white dwarf, once thought to be the faintest\nOther cool metal-polluted white dwarfs:\nWD J2356\u2212209\nWD 2317+1830",

    "Radio station in Havana\nRadio Suaritos was a radio station broadcasting from Havana, Cuba, owned by the Laureano Su\u00e1rez Vald\u00e9s (\"Suaritos\"), initially on AM 750\u00a0kHz and later on AM 860\u00a0kHz. The station broadcast for 21 years, between 1935 and 1956, until it filed for bankruptcy due to lack of advertisers and audience, being sold to new owners.\nHistory\nIn 1933, the CMCB was inaugurated on the top of a Vedadense building (Calle 25 number 1111, between 6 and 8), by Miguel Gabriel Juri and Angel Camb\u00f3. Later, CMCB changed its address to Monte y C\u00e1rdenas.\nIn 1935, Laureano Su\u00e1rez Vald\u00e9s (\"Suaritos\") purchased the old CMCB location and equipment, installed its radio there. Vald\u00e9s is a businessman, technician, recorder, announcer and advertiser. The new poseor increases the power of the station, bringing signals to the entire Caribbean area and further expanding the musical collection in the history of Cuban radio.\nFigures that achieved stardom were their first artistic weapons on Radio Suaritos: Merceditas Vald\u00e9s, Xiomara Alfaro, Celina y Reutilio, among others, thanks to the broadcaster. With the orchestra on the radio, they recorded global idols, such as Pedro Vargas, Tito Guizar and To\u00f1a la Negra.\nSuaritos created anti-pirate programming, as some Cuban stations recorded songs that were played exclusively on Radio Suaritos, when in the midst of any song, unexpectedly he heard his voice saying: \"\u00a1Aqu\u00ed Radio Suaritos!\" (\"Here Radio Suaritos!\"). Suaritos created a new advertising genre: double-meaning advertisements, with which the public rebels with laughter.\nIn 1956, due to administrative problems at Radio Suaritos, Goar Mestre (owner of Circuito CMQ) tried to buy the station, but Laureano Su\u00e1rez Vald\u00e9s rejected the offer. A few months later, the \"Cadena Suaritos\" went bankrupt and Suaritos was forced to file for bankruptcy. The station went bankrupt due to lack of advertisers, selling all its frequencies to other entrepreneurs. \"CMBL Radio Suaritos\" was renamed \"CMBL Radio Aeropuerto Internacional\" to broadcast flight departures and arrivals and interviews with travelers in the capital Havana.\nIn 1958, two years after the bankruptcy of \"Cadena Suaritos\" and its sale, Laureano Su\u00e1rez Vald\u00e9s dies.\nCollection\nLittle or nothing is known about the fate of the extinct broadcaster's collection, as it is shared among hundreds of people.

He started the season by winning and being named MVP in the Villaviciosa de Od\u00f3n Junior Tournament, thanks in large part to his performance in the final: 23 points, 8 rebounds and a PIR of 28 in 24 minutes. In January 2014, Real Madrid Junior won the Ciutat de L\u2019Hospitalet NIJT Junior Tournament, a championship that the white team had not won since 2006. On 13 April 2014, they were proclaimed champions of the Madrid Junior Championship by defeating Tuenti M\u00f3vil Estudiantes A and Espacio Torrelodones A in the Final Phase. On 10 May 2014, Real Madrid won the 2014 Spanish Junior Championship, held in Mar\u00edn (Pontevedra), after 14 years without winning in this competition.\nProfessional career\nIn total, Barreiro played 24 games with the EBA, averaging 13.4 points per game. In addition, during that 2013/14 season he debuted with the first team of Real Madri in the EuroLeague (on 28 February 2014 against KK Partizan, scoring one point), and in the Liga ACB (on 9 March 2014 against Obradoiro CAB). On 15 March 2014, Barreiro played his second game in ACB with Real Madrid, against CB Murcia, scoring 3 points. In the summer of 2015 he signed for Club Ourense Baloncesto, thus returning to his native Galicia.\nAfter his time with the Galician club, in August 2016, Barreiro signed a contract with Basket Zaragoza for four seasons.\nNational team career\nIn August 2012, Barreiro was crowned champion of the Mar\u00edn Friendship Tournament with the Spanish U-15 team, defeating the French team in the final.\nDue to various injuries, in the summer of 2013 he was unable to compete with the Spanish team in the U-16 European Championship in Ukraine 2013, or the U-17 World Championship, held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in the summer of 2014.\nIn 2016, Barreiro was part of the national team that won gold at the U-20 European Championship, held in Helsinki.\nHe made his debut with the senior team in February 2018 against Montenegro, in a World Cup qualifying match.\nPlayer profile\nA player with excellent potential, Barreiro can play in all positions. Very tall and with a great wingspan, his physical and technical conditions allow him to have a great advantage over his opponents. Excellent outside shooter, he is able to penetrate and pass, since he easily handles both hands and has a good vision of the game.\n",

    "\nPhotographic lenses for Hasselblad cameras have been designed and manufactured by several companies, primarily by Carl Zeiss AG; others include Fujifilm, Kodak, Nittoh, Rodenstock, and Schneider.\nAerial cameras\nThe first cameras assembled by Victor Hasselblad were supplied to the Swedish Air Force as the ROSS HK-7, which was reverse-engineered from a recovered German camera for aerial reconnaisance, the Handkammer Hk 12,5/7\u00d79. 240 handheld HK-7s were produced between 1941 and 1943. It captures 7\u00d79\u00a0cm (2.8\u00d73.5\u00a0in) images, giving it a crop factor of 0.38 for 135 film equivalent, and was fitted with one of three non-interchangeable lenses.\nAfter testing the HK-7, the Swedish Air Force commissioned Hasselblad to produce another aerial camera, this time mounted to the airplane. Hasselblad produced the Ross SKa\u00a04 and SKa\u00a04a, which both accept interchangeable lenses and film magazines, differing in how the standard (150\u00a0mm) lens was stored. Both cameras capture 12\u00d712\u00a0cm (4.7\u00d74.7\u00a0in) images, giving a crop factor of 0.25.\nThe SKa\u00a04/4a were re-engineered for land combat and the resulting camera, the MK\u00a080, featured tripod support and periscope attachments, along with a set of slower shutter speeds. Although the lens mount is physically compatible with the SKa\u00a04/4a, lenses were tested and paired to the camera body, so a lens from a different body may not have the correct focus distance. It captured 7\u00d712\u00a0cm (2.8\u00d74.7\u00a0in) images, giving a crop factor of 0.31.\nThe final cameras assembled by Ross for the Swedish military were labeled as the SKa\u00a05, intended for aerial photogrammetry. Only 24 were built. It captured 18\u00d724\u00a0cm (7.1\u00d79.4\u00a0in) images, giving a crop factor of 0.14.\nMedium format cameras\nThe traditional Hasselblad medium format film cameras capture images on 120 film in the 6\u00d76\u00a0cm (nominal) frame size; the actual frame size measures 56.5\u00d756.5\u00a0mm (2.22\u00d72.22\u00a0in), which is larger than small format 135 film, with a frame size of 36\u00d724\u00a0mm (1.42\u00d70.94\u00a0in). This means the crop factor for most film-based Hasselblad cameras (based on diagonal angle of view) compared to \"full-frame\" 135 is 0.54; for example, a V system lens with a focal length of 80\u00a0mm would have the equivalent coverage of a lens with a focal length of approximately 45\u00a0mm on a 135 film camera. If the square format images are cropped to an equivalent 3:2 aspect ratio, the resulting 56.5\u00d737.7\u00a0mm (2.22\u00d71.48\u00a0in) images would have an equivalent focal length multiplier of 0.64, so the 80\u00a0mm lens has the equivalent angle of view as a 50\u00a0mm lens on a 135 film camera.\nLenses for 1600F / 1000F cameras\n1600F with Kodak Ektar 2.8/80 lens\n1000F with Zeiss Tessar 2.8/80 lens\nP\u00e5l-Nils Nilsson with Cook & Perkins Dallmeyer Dallon Tele-Anastigmat 5.6/500 lens\nThe original normal lens for the 1600F and 1000F was the Kodak Ektar 80\u00a0mm f/2.8.

Hasselblad also made the Superwide camera (SW/SWC) line, which are each equipped with a fixed 38\u00a0mm Zeiss Biogon lens but omits the mirror and reflex viewfinder, as those are precluded by the symmetric wide-angle lens design.:\u200a41\u200a Other specialized bodies included the FlexBody and ArcBody, which permitted view camera-like tilt and shift movements using a front lens standard connected via a flexible bellows to a rear film standard which accepted V system film backs. While the FlexBody accepted standard V system interchangeable lenses from the C/CF series, the ArcBody used specialized Rodenstock Grandagon lenses to permit a wider range of movements.\nLenses for H system cameras\nH6D with 100C back, which has a 100\u00a0MP CMOS digital image sensor\nHasselblad and Fujifilm jointly designed the H system ca",
    "Military unit\nThe 163rd Rifle Division was formed as an infantry division of the Red Army just before the Second World War began, in the Tula Oblast, based on the pre-September 13, 1939 shtat (table of organization and equipment). As a reinforced rifle division, it took part in the Winter War with Finland, where it was encircled at Suomussalmi. Despite a rescue attempt by the 44th Rifle Division from the Raate Road (which was also the route used by some of the 163rd's forces) the division was largely destroyed in one of the best-known Finnish victories of the war.\nWhat little remained of the 163rd was moved postwar to Novgorod in the Leningrad Military District to be rebuilt as a motorized division. At the outbreak of war with Germany it was assigned to 1st Mechanized Corps and was part of the reserves of the redesignated Northern Front. In common with most Soviet motorized divisions it was significantly short of trucks and its outdated tanks were lost, mostly to breakdowns, before the end of August. During that month, as part of 34th Army, it took part in the Northwestern Front's counterstrike at Staraya Russa which briefly surrounded two German divisions and inflicted a considerable delay on Army Group North's advance on Leningrad, although at heavy cost.\nOn September 15 reality was acknowledged and the 163rd was again formed as a regular rifle division. Along with its Army it was forced back toward, and then past, the town of Demyansk, and it would be involved in the fighting around the German-held salient until early 1943. It was then removed to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command and moved south to join the 27th Army in Steppe Military District, soon renamed Steppe Front. By the time it entered the fighting after the German Kursk offensive it was in Voronezh Front and helped to create a major breach in the German lines in early August. As this was exploited the division was briefly transferred to 6th Guards Army and, before that Army was moved north, transferred again to 38th Army, still in Voronezh (soon 1st Ukrainian) Front. Under this command it gained a battle honor for taking the city of Romny. It then closed on the Dniepr south of Kyiv and prepared to force a crossing. After frustrating battles through October it played a leading role in taking the Ukrainian capital and was awarded its name as a second honorific. Following this, the 163rd was ordered to advance in the direction of Zhytomyr but was engaged by German counterattacks in the Fastiv area, being transferred to 40th Army as part of a general regrouping. In January 1944 it was diverted southward to take part in the encirclement battle near Cherkasy, and then advanced through western Ukraine toward the upper Dniestr River. In a period of less than 5 weeks the 163rd was awarded the Order of the Red Banner, the Order of Suvorov, and the Order of Lenin. Now part of 2nd Ukrainian Front it saw little service in the Front's spring campaign into Moldova, and was transferred back to 27th Army prior to the start of the August offensive toward Romania. It would remain in this Army for the duration of the war. The division took part in the defeat of the German 6th Army and earned its fourth decoration, the Order of Kutuzov, for its part in the capture of Ploie\u0219ti at the end of the month. After Romania came over to the Allied forces the 27th Army entered Hungary, but did not directly participate in the fighting for Budapest. The 163rd moved, with its Army, over to 3rd Ukrainian Front in February 1945 and remained under that command into the postwar. It was one of the most highly decorated regular rifle formations when the war ended, and was moved back into Ukraine, where it was converted into a mechanized division in March 1947.\nFormation\nThe division began forming in August 1939, in the Tula Oblast, based on a rifle regiment of the 84th Rifle Division. Col. Andrei Ivanovich Zelentsov was appointed to command that month; he had been serving as commander of tank forces of 3rd Rifle Corps. He was promoted to the rank of Kombrig on November 4 and this would be modernized to major general on June 4, 1940, the day he left the division.\nBy September the 163rd was already being concentrated on the border with Latvia. In late October - early November it was moved to East Karelia, first as part of the Special Rifle Corps of 8th Army and then into the 47th Rifle Corps of 9th Army, which was under command of Komkor V. I. Chuikov. Over the next weeks it was heavily reinforced, until it comprised:\n529th Rifle Regiment (from 54th Rifle Division)\n662nd Rifle Regiment\n759th Rifle Regiment\n593rd Rifle Regiment (from 131st Rifle Division)\n81st Mountain Rifle Regiment (from 54th Rifle Division)\n365th Reconnaissance Regiment\n365th Armored Car Battalion\nThese additional forces raised the personnel strength under Zelentsov to some 13,562 men.\nBattle of Suomussalmi\nThe provincial town of Suomussalmi, with a population of some 4,000 inhabitants, was a target for the Red ",
    "Norwegian footballer (born 1994)\nEmil Gundelach \u00d8degaard (born 29 April 1999) is a Norwegian footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Lillestr\u00f8m SK. He is best known from his period in Ull/Kisa, where he played every single minute from 2017 through 2023 and scored 5 league goals.\nCareer\n\u00d8degaard hails from Skjetten, and played briefly for Skjetten SK as a young child before joining regional powerhouse Lillestr\u00f8m SK at the age of 8. He won the Norwegian U16 Cup with Lillestr\u00f8m in 2015. \u00d8degaard was allowed on the bench for the senior team for the first time in April 2015, and featured more regularly on the bench in 2016. In July 2016, both Lillestr\u00f8m's goalkeepers Arnold Origi and Jacob Faye-Lund were unavailable, which could open the way for \u00d8degaard. However, the club chose to loan P\u00e5l Vestly Heigre instead.\n\u00d8degaard continued as Lillestr\u00f8m's reserve goalkeeper until the summer of 2017, when he was sent on loan to Levanger FK. He did not play a single league match here either. In 2018 he was loaned out to Grorud IL, making his senior debut in the 2. divisjon. He was praised by coach Eirik Kj\u00f8n\u00f8 and Norway U19 coach P\u00e5l Arne Johansen for his abilities to distribute the ball with his feet; \u00d8degaard tried to emulate Manuel Neuer and Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen in that regard. \u00d8degaard was a squad member for the 2018 UEFA European Under-19 Championship, and was capped for every Norwegian youth national team.\nThe loan to Grorud lasted three seasons, and included a promotion to the 2020 1. divisjon. Here, he played against Lillestr\u00f8m for the first time in his life. In 2021 he was instead loaned out to Stj\u00f8rdals-Blink. After four years out on loan, \u00d8degaard finally left Lillestr\u00f8m and signed for KFUM in the summer of 2021. He played regularly, but towards the end of the year, the coach preferred Jonas Brauti. In March 2022, \u00d8degaard ruptured his meniscus in a friendly match. It was reported that the injury would sideline him throughout 2022. He did return to play one match in the 2022 1. divisjon, keeping a clean sheet.\n\u00d8degaard returned as undisputed first-choice for KFUM in the 2023 1. divisjon, a campaign that ended in promotion to Eliteserien for the first time in KFUM's history. \u00d8degaard kept 12 clean sheets. After winning promotion, \u00d8degaard could play football full-time. When playing on the second tier, \u00d8degaard was a part-time shop clerk in Vinmonopolet.\nKFUM's 2024 Eliteserien season was marked by several victories over big clubs, the biggest being Rosenborg on away ground. \u00d8degaard was also injured, but did not miss any matches, after being kicked in the head by B\u00e5rd Finne.\n",

    "\nState Sovereignty Day (Azerbaijani: D\u00f6vl\u0259t Suverenliyi G\u00fcn\u00fc) is a day commemorating the reclaiming of Nagorno-Karabakh by the Republic of Azerbaijan following the 2023 offensive in the disputed region.\nIt is celebrated according to the decree \"On establishing the Day of State Sovereignty in the Republic of Azerbaijan\" signed by President Ilham Aliyev on September 19, 2024.\nHistorical context\nMain article: Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\nUnder the Soviet Union, the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh was established as an autonomous oblast of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, with a majority ethnically Armenian population. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the First Nagorno-Karabakh War began in 1988 between Armenia and Azerbaijan over control of the region, with the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh formally declaring its independence from Azerbaijan on January 6, 1992. During the war, Armenian forces captured most of Nagorno-Karabakh, alongside parts of seven Azerbaijani-majority districts surrounding the enclave. On May 5, 1994, the Bishkek Protocol, a Russian-mediated ceasefire protocol, ended the fighting along the Line of Contact, but did not provide a resolution to the larger conflict. Both sides engaged in ethnic cleansing during the war.\nThe Second Nagorno-Karabakh War took place between September and November 2020. Following the capture of Shusha by Azerbaijan, a ceasefire agreement was signed on November 10, 2020 under Russian mediation. Under the terms of the ceasefire, the Armenian-occupied territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh (with the exception of the Lachin corridor) and parts of Nagorno-Karabakh itself came under Azerbaijani control, while the remaining territories were to be patrolled by a Russian peacekeeping force. In December 2022, Azerbaijani protesters started a blockade of the Lachin corridor, with the backing of the Azerbaijani government.\nOn September 19, 2023, Azerbaijan launched a large-scale military offensive against the Republic of Artsakh. On September 20, a ceasefire agreement described as a written agreement for the surrender of Artsakh was reached at the mediation of the Russian peacekeeping contingent. The Artsakh Defence Army laid down their weapons and withdrew from combat positions and military posts. As a result, Azerbaijan fully reclaimed the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The offensive resulted in a flight of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians, in which nearly the entire population fled to nearby countries, primarily Armenia, which was described by international experts as a war crime.\nEstablishment\nState Sovereignty Day is observed based on the decree signed by President Ilham Aliyev on September 19, 2024, titled \"On the Establishment of State Sovereignty Day in the Republic of Azerbaijan.\" The decree states:\nThus, September 20 will be observed annually as the State Sovereignty Day in the Republic of Azerbaijan.\nThe Cabinet of Ministers is instructed to address issues arising from this order",

    "Campaign bus used by Vote Leave\nThe Vote Leave campaign used a large red battle bus in the lead up to the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. A decal on the side of the bus made the false claim and following pledge that \"We send the EU \u00a3350 million a week, let's fund our NHS instead\", accompanied with the slogan \"Let's take back control\". The bus became one of the most prominent symbols of the campaign.\nThe \u00a3350\u00a0million figure, conceived by Vote Leave campaign leader Dominic Cummings, was disputed by the UK Statistics Authority and Institute for Fiscal Studies as well as other media, though Vote Leave continued to stand by the figure, and the bus continued to be featured in news media. Cummings has credited the words on the bus for the Leave campaign's victory, and 42 percent of people who had heard of the claim still believed it was true by 2018.\nHistory\nThe bus in 2020 with Acklams Coaches branding, identifiable by the number plate E14 ACK\nThe bus was a Starliner luxury team coach which was manufactured by German company Neoplan, with its production beginning in Poland and finishing in Germany. Its interior contained air conditioning, multiple screens, DVD and CD player, a fridge and a boiler. It was owned by Acklams Coaches, a coach rental company in Yorkshire, and had previously been used to transport the Pakistan national cricket team during their UK tour. Vote Leave hired the bus for around 30 days according to an Acklams director, costing \u00a3400,000 to do so.\nOn 11 May 2016, the bus began a tour of the United Kingdom, beginning its tour in Truro, Cornwall. There, Boris Johnson stood on the steps of the bus and waved a Cornish pasty; this received criticism as the pasty was protected by the EU's Protected Geographical Indication rules, meaning it could not be made anywhere other than Cornwall while being named as such, though the Leave campaign stated these protections would remain in force.\nThe bus then set off for Dorset. Sky News reported on the origin of the bus in the European mainland the same day. The Britain Stronger in Europe campaign also stated that if the UK were not in the EU at the time, the bus would have cost \u00a3456,000, more than its actual \u00a3400,000 price, due to increased tariffs. Rob Oxley, Leave campaign media director, replied that \"Of course it\u2019s a German bus. We want it to run on time\", and that Germany would still sell their buses to the UK if it left the EU.\nAfter the referendum\nThe day immediately after the referendum, on 24 June 2016, the bus was stripped of its branding and was then used by Will Young as his Glastonbury Festival tour bus.\nThree weeks following the referendum, the bus was spotted in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London, with its Vote Leave branding restored; Paul Acklam of Acklam Coaches, when contacted by Buzzfeed News, claimed that the bus had been hired by \"some film company\". On 18 July 2016, The Daily Telegraph reported that Greenpeace had parked the bus outside the Houses of Parliament and had then rebranded its text with the words \"time for truth\" and the hashtag \"#comeclean\" and stating that it was \"covering up the bold-faced lie\" with \"messages of hope\". Greenpeace also asked members of the public to send in messages that would be written on the bus.\nOn 7 June 2017, the same bus used by Vote Leave with the number plate E14 ACK arrived at Edgbaston Cricket Ground for the ICC Champions Trophy match, again being used by the Pakistan national cricket team. The bus' decal had been changed to the team's colours.\nBy September 2017, London-based fintech startup company Monese had hired the bus from Acklams for a tour around Europe to promote its expansion into Europe, spending \u00a335,000 to lease the bus and design and print its decal. Text on the side of the bus, both in English and French, stated that Monese users would be permitted to transfer up to \u20ac350 million between the UK and the eurozone for no fee.\n\u00a3350 million figure\nThe most significant feature of the bus was the claim on its side which stated that Britain sent \u00a3350\u00a0million to the European Union every week. This was based upon the Treasury's estimation of the gross amount of money that the UK contributed to the EU in 2014, totalling to \u00a318.8\u00a0billion, or in 2015, totalling to \u00a317.8\u00a0billion, or \u00a3342\u00a0million per week.\nWhile Dominic Cummings is credited with the creation of the figure on the bus, which began its tour on 11 May 2016, Gisela Stuart, co-chair of Vote Leave, said on BBC Radio 4 on 15 April that \"Every week we send \u00a3350m to Brussels. I'd rather that we control how to spend that money, and if I had that control I would spend it on the NHS.\" This claim was disputed by BBC News the same day. Dominic Cummings intended that use of the figure would stoke up arguments concerning future payments to the EU, which would be beneficial for the Vote Leave campaign.\nOn 11 May, Boris Johnson admitted that \"we do get some of  back, but we get it at the discretion of EU officials who dec",
    "Municipal building in Golspie, Scotland\nCounty Offices is a former municipal building on Main Street in Golspie in Scotland. The building, which used to be the headquarters of Sutherland County Council, is now divided into seven residential properties known as 1-7 The Old Post Office.\nHistory\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, the county town of Sutherland was Dornoch; it was home to the Dornoch Sheriff Court (also known as County Buildings) and to Dornoch Cathedral. At that time, Golspie was regarded as no more than a holiday village. However, by the 20th century, Brora and Golspie were the more significant population centres.\nIn 1890 county councils were established in each county of Scotland under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889. It also directed that the existing clerk to each county's Commissioners of Supply should automatically become the first clerk to the county council. Whilst the Sutherland commissioners met at the County Buildings in Dornoch, their clerk at the time, George Tait, was based in Golspie. His offices therefore became the county council's first offices. The first provisional meeting of the council was held on 13 February 1890 at the County Buildings in Dornoch, but it was decided that a more accessible location was needed for the council's meetings. Although Dornoch was the county's only burgh, it was in the extreme south-eastern corner of the county and lay some seven miles from its then nearest railway station at The Mound. The council's first official meeting was held on 22 May 1890 at Bonar Bridge, and subsequent meetings were generally held at various premises in Lairg, with occasional meetings in other places, including Dornoch, Golspie, Brora and Lochinver.\nIn 1892 a new post office for Golspie was completed on the south-eastern side of the main street in Golspie, and from the outset part of the building served as the main administrative offices for the county council's staff. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of three bays facing onto Main Street. The central bay featured a doorway with a rectangular fanlight and a single sash window on the first floor. The outer bays were fenestrated by tri-partite casement windows on the ground floor and by bi-partite windows on the first floor.\nAround 1910 the post office moved to a new building next door, after which the county council expanded to take over the rest of the 1892 building, which became known as the County Offices. As the responsibilities of the county council grew, a modern extension was erected at the rear.\nThe County Offices did not include a council chamber, and throughout the county council's existence meetings were held in various hired premises across the county, usually in Lairg. In 1938 the council decided to combine its offices and meeting place in a new building at Dornoch, but following the outbreak of the Second World War the scheme was not implemented. In 1966 the council resolved to build itself a new headquarters in Lairg, but that scheme was abandoned due to budget pressures and protests from the council's staff, most of whom lived in the Golspie and Brora area.\nAfter the abolition of Sutherland County Council in 1975, the County Offices in Golspie served as the main offices of Sutherland District Council, before passing to the Highland Council when local government was reorganised into single-tier council areas in 1996. After the council acquired and refurbished Drummuie between August 2006 and March 2008, the building on Main Street became surplus to requirements, was sold and subsequently converted into seven flats, called 1\u20137 The Old Post Office, one of which (number 6) is used as holiday accommodation.\n",
    "United States historic place\nThe Berthusen Barn and Privy, also called the Berthusen Barn, is a historical structure located at the 236 acre Berthusen Park in Lynden, Washington. The barn was built by Hans Christian Berthusen, a pioneer resident of Whatcom County, and Jack Jensen. It was completed in early 1900's and was built from wood from the area.\nBackground\nHans C. Berthusen was born on January 20, 1860. When he was 4, his family immigrated from Norway to the United States during the Civil War and settled in Iowa. Hans moved to Seattle in 1883 before setting off to Whatcom County with a friend named Mark W. Stone. Berthusen and Stone built adjoining homesteads. In 1889, Hans married Lida Hawley, who was born September 30, 1864. Hawley's family had come to the area in 1872 from Iowa. They adopted a son named Peter Olia Berthusen who was raised on the homestead. \nHistory\nThe barn was completed in 1901, and was one of the largest barns in the area.\nIn 1944, the barn and the land it sat on was donated to the city of Lynden by the Berthusen's under the agreement that the park would be free to the public.\nIn 2002, the barn had become structurally unsound and fallen into disrepair. In order to secure fundings for repairs, a push lead by Nancy Norris was made to have the barn added to the National Register of Historic Places. Norris was Lynden's parks and recreation coordinator at the time. The barn was added to the register on April 22, 2003.\nThe barn and the associated park remain free to the public to current day. The barn contains several pieces of antique farm equipment donated by the Puget Sound Tractor and Machinery Association.\n",

    "Postcard of the Ch\u00e2teau de Suresnes, between 1900 and 1920\nThe Ch\u00e2teau de Suresnes was a French ch\u00e2teau in Suresnes, a commune in the western inner suburbs of Paris, France. Located in Hauts-de-Seine, 9.3\u00a0km (5.8\u00a0mi) from the centre of Paris.\nHistory\nIn 1826 Salomon von Rothschild (the founder of the Austrian branch of the Rothschild family) purchased the Suresnes ch\u00e2teau and estate along the banks of the Seine (across from his daughter, Betty's Ch\u00e2teau de Boulogne, today known as Ch\u00e2teau Rothschild). Sold as state property during the Revolution, it had been acquired by the Count de Lagarde who built a ch\u00e2teau there in the 19th century. On the estate, Rothschild built a farm and cultivated crops. Between 1832 and 1841, Swiss architect Joseph-Antoine Froelicher (the official architect to the duchess of Berry) built a number of conservatories which Rothschild used to grow exotic plants and fruits. Salomon was a shareholder of the de Rothschild Fr\u00e8res bank when it was opened in Paris by his brother James Mayer de Rothschild (considered founder of the French branch of the family).\nDuring the French Revolution of 1848, the estate was plundered, \"led by the local poultry butcher, smashing furniture and gilt mirrors while slashing paintings and stealing what the could carry, before then burning it to the ground.\" The royal Ch\u00e2teau de Neuilly was also sacked at the same time. Upon Salomon's death in Paris in 1855, the estate was inherited by his brother James, who reportedly considered restoring it, but instead, had the house was taken down and the land sold off in 94 parcels. James' son, Salomon James de Rothschild, retained land in \u00cele de Puteaux nearby, and built a model farm.\nGallery\nPostcard of the orangery at Suresnes, between 1900 and 1910\nPostcard of the Ch\u00e2teau de Suresnes, 1910\nMedal engraved from 1848\nSee also\nRothschild family residences",

It was originally established by the Mandatory Palestine government and has continued its operations under the judicial system of the State of Israel since its establishment in 1948.\nAfter the Six-Day War, the court relocated to a building located at Tzalach A-Din Street in East Jerusalem.\nAccording to Section 17 of the Basic Law: The Government, any indictment against a sitting Prime Minister must be submitted by the Attorney General to the Jerusalem District Court.\nHistory\nThe Jerusalem District Court has been involved in several high-profile cases in Israeli legal history.\nIn 1954\u20131955, Benjamin Halevy, then-president of the Jerusalem District Court, presided over the libel trial State of Israel v. Melchiel Greenwald, more commonly known as the Kastner trial. The case evolved into a broader examination of The Holocaust in Hungary, and in his controversial verdict, Halevy acquitted Greenwald of most charges and declared that Israel Kastner had \"sold his soul to the devil\". This statement stirred significant controversy, and Kastner was later assassinated. The Supreme Court subsequently overturned Halevi's decision by a narrow majority of three to two.\nIn 1961, the court hosted the trial of Adolf Eichmann, a notorious Nazi official war criminal. To accommodate the high-profile nature of the case, proceedings were held at Beit Ha'am in Jerusalem. The trial, which garnered international attention, resulted in Eichmann's conviction and a death sentence, marking a historic moment in both Israeli and global legal history.\nFrom 1987 to 1988, the court oversaw the trial of Ivan Demjanjuk, accused of being a guard at the Treblinka extermination camp. The trial, held at Binyanei HaUma (the International Convention Center), comprising Israeli Supreme Court Judge Dov Levin and Jerusalem District Court Judges Zvi Tal and Dalia Dorner. they concluded with Demjanjuk's conviction to death sentence. However, in 1993, the Supreme Court acquitted Demjanjuk on appeal, citing reasonable doubt.\nIn 2009, the court handled the trial of former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who faced charges including bribery, fraud, breach of trust, and falsification of corporate documents. He was ultimately convicted of fraud and breach of trust, receiving an eight-month prison sentence and a 100,000 NIS fine.\nMost recently, in 2020, the court began the trial of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, along with co-defendants Arnon Mozes, his wife Iris and Shaul Elovitch, in what has become a landmark case in Israeli politics and law.\nPresidents\n",
    "\nFort IJmuiden is a former fort, now heritage site and event location in IJmuiden North-Holland. It protected the entrance to the North Sea Canal. The fort was originally located north of the canal, but by the construction of a new branch, it became an island. Most of the old fort and some World War II additions have been preserved. A rare armored emplacement that protected five heavy guns, is still in place. \nContext\nModel of Fort IJmuiden\nPart of the dry moat\nIn November 1876, the North Sea Canal was opened. At about the same time, the construction of a fortification and inundation line around Amsterdam, the Stelling van Amsterdam was ordered. This line could only be effective if the North Sea locks at IJmuiden remained under control. Another threat to national security was a possible attack on the North Sea locks from the sea side.\nPlanning and construction\nThe timeline of the construction of Fort IJmuiden can be traced back to the government budgets and expenditure. In 1879, a change to the 1879 budget for the completion of the national fortification plan for the first time allocated money to start construction of Fort IJmuiden. This was 250,000 guilders of an estimated total of 1,150,000 guilders. In 1879 1,680 guilders were spent, in 1880 50,350, in 1881 88,200, in 1882 136,150, in 1883 706,530, and in 1884 194,720, while in 1886 expenditure for 1885 was estimated at 328,700 and for 1886 333,900.\nCharacteristics\nThe concept\nFort IJmuiden got the form of an irregular hexagon. On the side facing the entrance of the canal, there was an armored battery with five heavy guns against naval targets. On the land side, at the rear of the fort, there was an armored cupola with two medium guns. The latter primarily served to defend against overland attacks.\nThe rest of the fort was much like other forts of the time. It was built in brick and had three levels. The lowest level was the biggest and contained the quarters for the 325 men garrison and in the center, ammunition storage. The quarters adjoined the dry moat. In times of war, the windows were covered with steel plates that contained embrasures. On the small section of the dry moat near the cupola, there was a caponnierre, a gallery that contained two 8\u00a0cm guns that could enfilade fire shrapnel ammunition along the two longest dry moats. Three more contstructions inside the dry moat allowed the same for rifle fire. The second floor contained the ammunition storage for the heavy guns and the guns in the cupola. On top of the barracks, this level was a layer of earth. The highest level contained the main battery and the armored cupola.\nMain armament\nView of the armored gallery pantsergallerij from the sea side\nThe armament of Fort IJmuiden against naval targets consisted of five 24 cm MRK L/30 guns. At the time, this was a sound choice as armament, as it represented the latest technology. The 24\u00a0cm was an accurate gun with a range of about 8\u00a0km. For use against armored ships it penetrated 43\u00a0cm of wrought iron at 2,000\u00a0m. These guns were placed in the long room that is armored on the side facing the sea, the so-called pantsergallerij. The rate of fire of these guns was one shot per 5-6 minutes.\nAgainst land forces, the fort had a rotating armored cupola with two 15 cm MRK L/30. The rate of fire of these guns was one shot per 2.5 minutes.\nHistory\nUp to World War I\nIn 1886, the Dutch Ministry of War formed a new organization to man the three armored forts that were under construction: Fort Harssens, Fort IJmuiden, and Fort Hoek van Holland. Each of these would get a separate Pantserfort Compagnie. On 1 January 1887, the IJmuiden Company would be founded. The garrison would now and then practice with the big guns, which always posed a serious danger for shipping and was therefore announced in the press. \nAfter completion, Fort IJmuiden quickly became obsolete. Brick and earth forts became obsolete because of the invention of the high-explosive shell in the 1880s. The guns of the fort became obsolete when quick-firing guns of high caliber were introduced in the 1890s. In 1906, a writer noted that a King Edward VII-class battleship or a Braunschweig-class battleship could position itself 400\u00a0m before the fort without having to fear for serious damage. Meanwhile, their heavier guns could fire three shots every two minutes.\nWorld War I\nIn the runup to World War I, multiple plans were made to reinforce the Dutch coastal defence. For IJmuiden, there were plans to build a second fort, south of the canal. This plan also required inundations against overland attacks.\nThe plan for the second fort included two armored turrets with two 28 cm SK L/45 guns each. Lighter quick-firing guns and machine guns were planned for close defense. The decision to build the new fort was postponed multiple times. In 1917, the government did make a proposal  for a new lock and widening the canal. This again made the need for a new fort clear. Multiple proposals were made, but the high cost ",

After expressing allegiance to Rahman, Rahman would give Tasnim the task to expand JMB's student wing, Tasnim's two brothers, Abdullah al-Sohel and Taiyabur Rahman Hasan, would also join the JMB student wing. On 19 December 2006, Tasnim would be arrested by the police due to the 2005 bomb blasts that were done by JMB.\nTasnim would then be bailed out of jail in April 2014, Tasnim would try to go to Saudi Arabia before being approached by members of Neo-Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh who would ask Tasnim to join Neo-JMB. On 18 September 2014, Tasnim would be arrested again and be sent to Kashimpur High Security Prison.\nAfter arrest\nSeven years after his arrest, in 2021, Tasnim would be interviewed under special arrangements at the Kashimpur Prison, in the interview Tasnim would say:\nViolence can\u2019t promote Islam. The people who are working to establish Islam through violence are making a mistake. I got involved in militant activities in my youth but finally I\u2019ve realized that it was wrong. Many young people like me are misguided. Now I feel that no one can force anyone to continue religious activities through oppression; rather, the process should be simple and non-violent.\nTasnim would also say that he will probably never get out of jail.\n",

    "\u03a4he Adelstein-Lew controversy refers to a single hand of poker played on 29 September 2022 during a live stream from the Hustler Casino, in Gardena, California, US, which caused a sensation beyond the poker world.\nBackground\nMain article: Poker boom\nThe significant and sudden increase in poker popularity among the general public is said to have happened during the period between 2003 and 2006. The game, and particularly its hold 'em variant, was played at home, in poker clubs, in casinos, in television programs, or in online platforms. During that period, it was estimated that the number of online-poker players doubled every year. Despite the negative effect that the 2006 UIGEA legislation had on online poker, the game continues to be overall more popular than its \"pre-boom\" days.\nMain article: Poker on television\nMovies such as the 1998 Rounders had already brought the game to a wider audience. With the 2002 introduction of the World Poker Tour, televised poker became quite popular in the United States and around the world. By the end of its first season, the show's peak of 2.2m concurrent viewers was higher at the time than the viewership of a televised, regular-season NBA game. The growth of the internet made poker  more accessible worldwide than it had ever been before. Soon, tournaments and cash games were regularly shown on YouTube, on cable television, or on stream services. The personalities of some players  became a significant audience attractor draw in themselves. Charismatic poker professionals, such as Phil Hellmuth with a volatile temper at the table, Daniel Negreanu and his humorous comportement, or legendary figure Doyle Brunson became household names, and their televised action added a layer of drama and excitement to the broadcasts, cementing poker's place in the media landscape by deploying a strong human element, combined with insights to the strategic depth of the game.\nThe hand\nOn 29 September 2022, the Hustler Casino, in Gardena, California, started the live stream of a high-stakes, hold 'em cash game. The betting format called for three blinds of $100, $200, and $400 respectively, with a $400 big blind ante and an $800 straddle in play. The players seated at the table were a mix of professionals, such as Phil Ivey, perennial winner in both cash games and poker tournaments, Garrett Adelstein, a poker pro and former Survivor contestant, and Taiwanese-American Andy \"Stacks\" Tsai of GGPoker China, as well as recreational players such as Michael \"Mike X\" Farid, an Iranian-American fashion designer and entrepreneur, Jacob \"Rip\" Chavez, a former boxing trainer, Eric Persson, owner of Maverick Gaming, Robbi Jade Lew, a Saudi Arabia-born Los Angeles resident who started playing online poker during the covid pandemic, and an Asian regular playing under the pseudonym Ryusuke Daifuku.\nIn the specific hand, Adelstein was dealt 7\u26638\u2663 in the third blind and raised to $3,000 before the flop. Lew, holding J\u26634\u2665 in the straddle, called, while the rest of the table folded. The flop came T\u2663T\u26659\u2663. At that point, Lew was nominally the favorite, holding Jack-high against Adelstein's 8-high, but Adelstein had flopped a promising hand that contained a flush draw, an open-ended straight draw and an open-ended straight flush draw. The number of his outs actually made Adelstein a 65%/35% favorite against Lew at that point. Adelstein, first to act, bet $2,500 and Lew, with the pot at $9,200, insta-called.\nThe turn was the 3\u2665, improving neither player's hand. Adelstein bet $10,000, which was almost the size of the pot, making it $21,700. Lew raised the bet to $20,000 and Adelstein pushed all-in to Lew's remaining $109,000 stack. After taking some time to think and talk to Adelstein, Lew called and they ran the river twice. With the two distinct river-cards coming up 9\u2666 and A\u2660, neither player improved and Lew won the hand along with the $270,000 pot with Jack high.\nReaction at the table\nThe stream commentator was surprised, exclaiming \"I'm speechless!\" and \"My god! What is going on?\" and suggesting that Lew probably misread her hand. Adelstein remained silent and shocked, eventually getting up and walking away from the table. The commentator said he had never seen Adelstein so disturbed, though adding that there was nothing suspicious in Lew's previous plays.\nThe players at the table made various comments, such as \"That was not poker\" but did not claim anything untoward went on, except for Andy Stacks who stated the hand was \"odd\" and he wished for some explanation. Ryusuke complimented Lew for \"a great call.\"\nLew got up from the table at some point as well, and, as it later transpired, talked with Adelstein. He claimed that, along with stream producer Ryan Feldman, they wanted a conversation with Lew off camera, while Lew claimed she was \"cornered & threatened,\" and, as a result, she offered to return Adelstein the money he had lost in the hand. Both parties agree that Adelstein accepted the offer and that she paid ",

    "\nPartial general elections were held in Suriname in March 1888 to elect three of the nine elected members of the Colonial States.\nElectoral system\nThe Colonial States consisted of nine elected members and four appointed by the Governor-General. Elected members served six-year terms, with three members elected every two years. The 1888 elections were to replace the three members elected in 1882, Henry Barnett\u00a0, A.H. de Granada\u00a0 and A.J. da Costa\u00a0, all three of whom ran for re-election.\nThe elections were held using the two-round system, with suffrage restricted to men meeting certain criteria. Voters had multiple votes, and any candidate receiving a number of votes equivalent to over 50% of the valid ballots cast was elected in the first round. If not all seats were filled, a second round was held with twice the number of candidates as seats remaining, who were the candidates who received the most votes but failed to be elected in the first round.\nResults\nAs there were 221 valid ballots cast, candidates required 111 votes to be elected in the first round. Two of the three incumbents were unseated.\nAftermath\nGovernor-General Hendrik Jan Smidt reappointed David Juda\u00a0 and Wouterus van Esveld\u00a0 as nominated members, together with Isaac da Costa\u00a0 and Salomon Matthijs Swijt\u00a0.\nThe newly elected States met for the first time in May, with Juda remaining chairman.\n",

    "In social choice theory, star-shaped preferences are a class of preferences over points in a Euclidean space. An agent with star-shaped preferences has a unique ideal point (optimum), where he is maximally satisfied. Moreover, he becomes less and less satisfied as the actual distribution moves away from his optimum. Star-shaped preferences can be seen as a multi-dimensional extension of single-peaked preferences.\nBackground\nOften, society has to choose a point from a subset of an Euclidean space. For example, society has to choose how to distribute its annual budget; each potential distribution is a vector of real numbers. If there are m potential issues in the budget, then the set of all potential budget distributions is a subset of Rm - the m-dimensional Euclidean space.\nDifferent members of society may have different preferences over budget distributions. A preference is any total order over points. For example, a particular agent may state that he prefers the distribution  to , prefers  to , and so on.\nOften, agents express their preferences in a simplified way: instead of stating their preferred distributions for all infinitely-many pairs of distributions, they  state one distribution, which they consider ideal, which they prefer over all other distributions; this distribution is called their optimum or their peak. However, knowing the optimum of an agent is insufficient for deciding which of two non-optimal distributions they prefer. For example, if an agent's optimum is , in theory this tells us nothing about his preference between  and .\nWe say that an agent has star-shaped preferences if, informally, he prefers points nearer to his optimum to points farther from his optimum. Formally, denote the optimum by p, and denote some other distribution by q. Let r be any distribution on the line connecting p and q (that is, r\u00a0:= t*q + (1-t)*p, for some real number t in (0,1)). Then, star-shaped preferences always strictly prefer r to q.:\u200a4\u200a In particular, in the above example, when p=, star-shaped preferences always prefer r= to q=.\nNote that the star-shaped assumption does not say anything about the preferences between points that are not on the same line. In the above example, an agent with star-shaped preferences and optimum  may prefer  to  or vice-versa.\nSpecial cases\nSeveral sub-classes of star-shaped preferences have received special attention.\nSingle-peaked preferences are star-shaped preferences in the special case in which the set of possible distributions is a (one-dimensional) line.\nMetric-based preferences. There is a metric d on the Euclidean space, and every agent prefers a point q to a point r iff d(p,q) \u2264 d(p,r).  Metric-based preferences can be represented by a utility function u(q)\u00a0:= - d(p,q). Metric-based preferences are star-shaped if the metric satisfies the following property: if all coordinates of p move closer to q, then the distance d(p,q) strictly decreases. In particular, this holds for  metrics for all .\nQuadratic preferences. There is a matrix A, and the preferences can be represented by a function u(q)\u00a0:= - (q-p)T * A * (q-p). Note that if A is the identity matrix then u(q) is minus the Euclidean distance , so in this case the preferences are also metric-based.\nAlternative definitions\nFreitas, Orillo and Sosa define star-shaped preferences as follows: for every point q, the set of points r that are (weakly) preferred to q is a star domain. Every star-shaped preferences according to  are also star-shaped according to. Proof: for every point q, and every point r that is preferred to q, all points on the line between r and the optimum (p) are preferred to r, and therefore by transitivity also preferred to q. Hence, the set of all these points is a star domain with respect to the optimum p. It is not clear whether the converse holds too.\nLandsberger and Meilijson define star-shaped utility functions. A weakly-increasing function u is called star-shaped w.r.t. a point t, if its average slope / is a weakly-decreasing function of x on (-\u221e,t) and on (t,\u221e). They use this definition to explain the fact that people purchase both insurance and lotteries.\nResults\nBorder and Jordan characterize the strategyproof mechanisms for agents with quadratic preferences - a special case of star-shaped preferences (see median voting rule).\nLindner, Nehring and Puppe and Goel, Krishnaswami, Sakshuwong and Aitamurto study agents with metric-based preferences with the  metric.\n",
    "Ship class of Indonesian Navy\nThe Raja Haji Fisabilillah class, also known as OPV 90M, is a class of Indonesian offshore patrol vessels. The class are built by Noahtu Shipyard (formerly known as PT Daya Radar Utama) in Bandar Lampung, Lampung. The Indonesian Navy has ordered two ships of the class.\nAccording to the Indonesian Navy and the Indonesian Ministry of Defense, the combat capability of the ships are equal to light frigates.\nDesign and description\nShips of the class initially were designed with a length of 90\u00a0m (300\u00a0ft) and a beam of 13.5\u00a0m (44\u00a0ft) for the first ship, and a length of 60\u00a0m (200\u00a0ft) for the second ship. However, during the construction both of them were redesigned to a length of 98\u00a0m (322\u00a0ft) and a beam of 13.5\u00a0m (44\u00a0ft). The ships has a draft of 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft) and height of 6.5\u00a0m (21\u00a0ft). The class has a standard displacement of 1,800 tonnes and full displacement of 2,100 tonnes. The ships will be powered by four MAN 16V28/33STC diesel engines generating 7,280\u00a0kW (9,760\u00a0shp), with planned top speed of 28 knots (52\u00a0km/h), cruising speed of 20 knots (37\u00a0km/h), and economical speed of 15 knots (28\u00a0km/h). The class has a complement of 70 crew members with provision for 24 extra personnel.\nBased on a video released by the shipyard in 2019, the ships will be armed with one OTO Melara 76 mm, one 35\u00a0mm Rheinmetall Oerlikon Millennium Gun and two quadruple launchers for unspecified guided-missiles. In November 2022, the Indonesian government signed a contract for Atmaca missiles to be fitted to the ships. The class also able to carry a helicopter with flight deck and hangar facility.\nAfter the launching of both ships, the Indonesian Navy revealed that both OPVs would be armed with Leonardo's 76 mm and 40 mm guns, 20 mm Oerlikon KAA guns in Escribano's SENTINEL 20 RCWS mount, Roketsan's Atmaca missiles in two quad missile launchers, and torpedo launchers.\nThe planned sensors and electronic systems of the ships consisted of HAVELSAN Advent combat management system (CMS), Elettronica Group radar electronic counter-measures system and Terma A/S decoys.\nThe class also carried two rigid-hulled inflatable boats for visit, board, search, and seizure purpose, with the launch loading ramps for the boats located at the stern.\nHistory\nThe contract for the first ship was awarded on 16 April 2020, with the contract worth Rp 1,079,100,000,000. The contract of the second ship was awarded on 30 April 2020, which worth Rp 1,085,090,000,000. The construction of both ships was began with first steel cutting on 26 August 2021 at the then PT Daya Radar Utama (later renamed to PT Noahtu Shipyard) shipyard in Bandar Lampung, Lampung.\nThe keel laying for both ships was done on 16 November 2022. Both of the ships experienced delays during their construction, which drew some criticism. Although the ships were planned to be handed over in 2023, the construction progress was only at 35% by March 2023. The delays were probably caused by the ships' design revisions that happened during their construction.\nThe lead ship of the class, Raja Haji Fisabilillah, was launched on 18 September 2024. The second ship, Lukas Rumkorem, followed two days later on the 20 September. The Navy planned to assigned both ships into the Third Fleet Command in eastern Indonesia.\nShips in the class\nSee also\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Raja Haji Fisabilillah-class offshore patrol vessel.\nList of active Indonesian Navy ships",
    "German painter\nView of the Wetterhorn\nGustav Hausmann (23 July 1827, G\u00f6ttingen - 13 April 1899, Hanover) was a German painter; primarily of mountain landscapes.\nBiography\nBorn in a small village, he attended the gymnasium in Goslar, where his talent for painting was first noticed. This resulted in a scholarship, mediated by the Hannoverscher K\u00fcnstlerverein\u00a0 and awarded by Crown Prince George (later King George V). This enabled him to study landscape painting under Edmund Koken at the Polytechnischen Schule in Hannover. He was there from 1845 to 1850. After that, he went to Munich where he was a student of Albert Zimmermann\u00a0, Christian Morgenstern and August Seidel\u00a0\nIn 1856 he returned to Hanover, joined the Hannoverscher K\u00fcnstlerverein\u00a0 and soon became one of that city's most prominent painters.\nFrom 1862 to 1865, he was employed as an art teacher for the Hanoverian princesses, Frederica und Marie. Even after the family had fled to Austria, in 1866, when Hanover was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia, he continued to receive commissions from the princesses' mother, Queen Marie. \nDuring those years he lived in seclusion, but continued to paint landscapes of the Bavarian Alps and Harz Mountains. By 1874, he was able to buy his own home. Following his death, the Hannoverscher K\u00fcnstlerverein held a memorial exhibition, consisting of over 150 oil sketches.\nHis youngest daughter, Lisa, married Hermann L\u00f6ns, a journalist and author known as the \"Poet of the Heath\".\nIce Skating",
    "\nThis is a history of military education in Canada.\nEarly efforts\nLong before the Royal Military College was established in 1876, there were proposals for military colleges in Canada. Although the Assembly of Lower Canada decided to establish a military college in 1815, agreement upon its organization was blocked by religious and linguistic conflicts.\nCaptain A.G. Douglas, a former adjutant at the British military college at Great Marlow, recommended in 1816 the establishment of a military college open to Catholic and Protestant boys at Three Rivers in a disused government house with himself as superintendent. Douglas' college was intended as a boarding school to educate the young sons of officers, among others, in Latin, English language, French Language, History, Geography, Drawing and Mathematics.\nIn 1826, retired British navy and army officers who had settled in March township, near Ottawa, Ontario proposed a military college boarding school for boys on the Great Lakes on naval and military lines.\nIn late November 1863, a circular announced the intention to establish Schools of Military Instruction for militia officers. The schools' training program lasted up to three months; graduates received a \"First Class\" certificate for the ability to command a battalion, and a \"Second Class\" for company command. By 1866, schools were operational in Quebec City, Montreal, Kingston, and Toronto; those in Hamilton and London had been closed for lack of enrollment. The schools were judged to be inadequate by 1874; they opened only during the winter months, and higher quality education was required. In 1868, schools of Cavalry and Artillery were formed in Toronto and a school of artillery was formed in Montreal. Since these were not Boarding schools, students lived in the communities.\nAt a pre-Confederation of Canada military school in Halifax, Nova Scotia, adult male students drilled and attended lectures on drill commands, military records, court-martial, the Articles of War, discipline and punishments, promotion of non commissioned officers, military accounts and pay and messing. After Confederation, military schools were opened in Halifax and Saint John.\nIn 1870\u201371, Canadian militia staff replaced the British regulars who were recalled from overseas station. From December to May, six schools conducted officer training for cavalry, infantry and artillery. The British garrisons operated the schools at Halifax, Saint John, New Brunswick and Quebec. Canadian militia staff and former British army drill sergeants operated the schools at Montreal, Kingston and Toronto.\nThe first full-time units of the Canadian militia, A and B Batteries at Kingston and Quebec, organized gunnery schools on a year-round basis in which artillery courses lasted from 3\u201312 months with the possibility of extension. Colonel P Robertson-Ross, adjutant general of the militia (1870\u20133) recommended the schools be organized as tactical brigades of three arms and that infantry and cavalry schools should also be put on a permanent basis. The Canadian government did not accept his advice.\nService colleges\nIn 1876, legislation was enacted to create the Military College of Canada, which became known as the Royal Military College of Canada in 1878.\nIn 1911, the Royal Naval College of Canada was established. It was shut down in 1922.\nIn 1940, HMCS Royal Roads was established, becoming the Royal Canadian Naval College in 1942, the RCN-RCAF Joint Services College in 1947, the Canadian Services College, Royal Roads in 1948, and the Royal Roads Military College in 1965. It was shut down after the end of the Cold War, and the last class graduated in 1995.\nIn 1952, the Coll\u00e8ge militaire royal de Saint-Jean was established as a bilingual, tri-service military college.\nNotes\n",

It covers the town centre and southern portion of Gainsborough near the River Trent and its border with the ceremonial county of Nottinghamshire. The population of Gainsborough Trent ward was recorded at 5,462 in the 2021 UK Census.\nGeography\nThe ward covers a large part of Gainsborough and includes notable landmarks and amenities of the town including:\nGainsborough Old Hall - One of the oldest buildings in the town\nGainsborough Town Hall - Former municipal building, now converted to retail use\nAll Saints Church - Oldest church in Gainsborough, Grade I listed\nTrinity Arts Centre - Former church, now an arts and events venue\nMarshall's Yard - Shopping Centre\nTrent Bridge - Connects town to Beckingham in Nottinghamshire\nLea Road/Lindsey County School - Now closed\nGainsborough Lea Road railway station - Offers train services to Lincoln and Doncaster\nGainsborough Central railway station - Offers train services to Sheffield and Grimsby\nThe boundary of Gainsborough Trent begins roughly near Old Trent Road and roughly borders the wards and suburbs of Gainsborough North West, North East and Hill.

    "Archaeological site in Jerusalem, Israel\nKhirbet 'Adash is an archaeological site located in northern Jerusalem.\nGeography\nThe site is located 5 kilometers north of Jerusalem's city center, near Pisgat Ze'ev. It is situated one kilometer north of Tell el-Ful, an archaeological site commonly identified with the biblical Gibeah, or Giv'at Sha'ul.\nSettlement history\nAntiquity\nThe site was inhabited in the Hellenistic and Roman periods.\nSeveral scholars have attempted to link Khirbat 'Adasa with the biblical site of Hadashah, described in Book of Joshua (15:37) as being near Jerusalem.\nSome scholars suggest that Khirbat 'Adasa might also be identical with Adasa, the site of the battle of Adasa (c. 160 BCE) during the Maccabean Revolt, where Judas Maccabeus led the Jewish forces against the Seleucid general Nicanor.\nMedieval period\nA preliminary survey initially suggested the site was abandoned after the Byzantine period. However, excavations show it was resettled at the end of the Byzantine era, and expanded in the 8th and 9th centuries during Early Islamic times.\nSeveral structures, including a residential unit and likely a stable, were built in the village's eastern part in the late seventh or early eighth century and remained in use until the 10th century.\nThe village was abandoned in the 11th century but was resettled during the Mamluk period.\n",

    "1953 United States Supreme Court case\nBrown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443 (1953), is a landmark United States Supreme Court case about habeas corpus.\nBackground\nUnited States courts are authorized by statute (28 USC \u00a72241 pursuant to \u00a72254) to grant habeas relief to prisoners who have been convicted by a state court.\nJustice Felix Frankfurter concurring in Brown notes the \"uniqueness\" of habeas corpus is its availability to \"bring into question the legality of a person's restraint and to require justification for such detention\". Justice Chase said habeas corpus has long been considered \"the best and only sufficient defence of personal freedom\".\nCase history\nThe named petitioner Brown was convicted of rape and sentenced to death by the state of North Carolina in 1950. He challenged the indictment alleging discrimination in the selection of grand jurors. He also challenged the admission into evidence of a confession he claimed was coerced. The state supreme court affirmed the conviction.\nIn two of the cases Speller v. Crawford (99 F. Supp 92) and Daniels v. Crawford (99 F. Supp. 208) the district court heard new evidence in addition to the trial and appellate records. In Brown v. Crawford (98 F. Supp. 866) the district court accepted the findings of the sentencing judge without considering new evidence.\nSupreme Court\nBrown v. Allen held that federal courts had statutory authority under the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 to hear collateral attacks on state convictions for constitutional error, even if the state courts had already adjudicated the federal question fully and fairly, unless there was a state ground for procedural default. There were two major opinions: the formal opinion of Justice Reed and a separate opinion by Justice Frankfurter.\nVote breakdown\nJustice Frankfurter wrote two opinions. There were some differences between the Reed and Frankfurter opinions on the effect of the denial of certiorari. Justice Reed said Frankfurter's opinion concurring in the judgment represented the position of the majority about the effect of the denial of certiorari. Frankfurter also noted the interest in uniformity of \"enforcement of the Constitution\" in all states and outlined some guidelines or standards for limiting federal habeas review.\nJustice Jackson concurred in the judgment only.\nJustice Frankfurter, joined by Justice Black and Justice Douglas, wrote separately dissenting from the judgment. Justice Black also wrote separately dissenting from the judgment.\nOpinion of the Court\nWhile state adjudication is not res judicata for so-called \"mixed questions of law\", federal courts may dismiss petitions if they are \"satisfied, by the record, that the state process has given fair consideration...and has resulted in a satisfactory conclusion.\" Writing separately Justice Felix Frankfurter said that \"state adjudication of questions of law cannot, under the habeas corpus statute, be accepted as binding.\" He said the enforcement of federal constitutional rights was determined by the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867: \"It is for this Court to give fair effect to the habeas corpus jurisdiction as enacted by Congress\". The decision of a state court about the legality of a prisoner's detention made \"on the facts presented\" does not require a new hearing \"on the merits, facts or law\" if the reviewing federal court is \"satisfied that federal constitutional rights have been protected\".\nState procedural rules may require that certain errors be raised by appeal. Failing to exhaust available state remedies is a clear ground to deny habeas applications. In the consolidated case Daniels v. Allen habeas was denied because the defendant was one day late filing paperwork according to the state's procedure. The \"failure to appeal\" was a procedural default that \"bars subsequent objection to conviction\".\nBrown says procedural default would not bar consideration of claims on federal habeas review if the prisoner was not able to comply with the state procedure requirements \"because of lack of counsel, incapacity, or some interference by officials\". The Court said the petitioners had counsel and were not obstructed by the state. This was relaxed in Fay v. Noia.\nJustice Jackson concurring in the judgment said the \"vague and unsettled\" requirements of substantive due process allowed \"floods of stale, frivolous and repetitious petitions\". He says habeas relief should be limited to jurisdictional questions where a state denied a prisoner in custody access to state courts or improperly obstructed him from making a record.\nReaction\nThe Wall Street Journal called the decision a \"woe for the lawyers\" in 1953. Justice Douglas later said the opinions in Brown \"were so long, and so discursive that one could find in them what he was looking for\".\nPaul Bator wrote an influential article Finality in Criminal Law and Federal Habeas Corpus for State Prisoners (1963) arguing that Brown represented a \"radical\" departure from established precedents.

    "2024 video game\n2024 video game\nReynatis is a 2024 action role-playing game developed by Natsume Atari and FuRyu, and published by FuRyu and NIS America. It was released in Japan for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch in July 2024 and will be released worldwide, including for Windows, in September 2024.\nGameplay\nReynatis revolves around playing in two modes, Suppressed Mode and Liberated Mode. In Suppressed Mode, the player character cannot attack, but is able to dodge enemy attacks with the press of a single button. In Liberated Mode, the player character has access to offensive magic, but is unable to block. The player can access both modes in real-time.\nPlot\nThe game takes place in Shibuya, Tokyo, where the use of magic is legally forbidden and wizards face oppression. It follows two main characters, the wizard Marin Kirizumi and the governance officer Sari Nishijima.\nDevelopment\nReynatis was first announced by FuRyu on February 21, 2024, via Nintendo Direct. A physical limited release called the Liberators Edition was unveiled. The demo for the Nintendo Switch was made available via Nintendo eShop in Japan on June 18, 2024. The demo version granted the player bonuses for use in the full release depending on the player's status when they cleared it. The demo for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 came out in the country on June 21. In the rest of the world, NIS America launched the demo for all initial release platforms simultaneously on September 13, 2024.\nThe soundtrack was composed by Yoko Shimomura, and the scenario was written by Kazushige Nojima. Other members of the development team include artist Yasutaka Kaburagi and director Takumi Isobe. The game has a subquest featuring the characters from Square Enix's Neo: The World Ends with You. It was first teased in an April Fools' Day joke that year. Takumi said he pursued the collaboration because he was a fan of The World Ends with You and thought it was the most famous work that involves Shibuya.\nReception\nReception\nReynatis received \"mixed or average\" reviews on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch according to review aggregator Metacritic. 27% of 15 critics recommended the game according to OpenCritic.\nNotes\n",

    "British archaeologist and historian (1947\u20132004)\nStuart Christopher Munro-Hay (21 April 1947 \u2013 14 October 2004) was a British archaeologist, numismatist and Ethiopianist. He studied the culture and history of ancient Ethiopia, the Horn of Africa region and South Arabia, particularly their history of coins.\nBorn in Northern Ireland, he was initially called Stuart Christopher H. McIlwrath, but took his mother's maiden name after his parents separated. Munro-Hay studied Egyptology at the University of Liverpool from 1970 to 1974. As a student and collaborator of Neville Chittick, he worked on the 1973-74 excavation project of the British Institute in Eastern Africa (BIEA) in Aksum, the capital of the late-antique Aksumite Empire. The excavations had to be cancelled due to the Derg's coup d'\u00e9tat in 1974, but Munro-Hay continued to dedicate his work to researching the history of Aksum, and in particular compiled a large collection of Aksumite coins. He completed his doctorate in 1978 at the London School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), supervised by the then BIEA chairman Laurence Kirwan, his thesis was titled A Reappraisal of the History and Development of the Aksumite State from Numismatic and Archaeological Evidence.\nMunro-Hay taught at the universities of Khartoum (1977\u20131980), Nairobi (1980\u20131982), Edinburgh (1983\u201384) and Cambridge (1985\u20131987). He was then employed by the British Institute in Eastern Africa, on whose behalf he published the results of the excavations in Aksum. In the 1980s, he sold a large part of his collection of Ethiopian and South Arabian coins to the Ethiopian government. From 1991 he lived as a freelance archaeologist in Paris and Thailand. He died in the Northern Thai city of Chiang Mai.\nSelect publications\nExcavations at Aksum; an account of research at the ancient Ethiopian capital directed in 1972\u20134 by the late Dr Neville Chittick.

    "The Offshore Constitutional Settlement (OCS) is an agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the States which provides the basis for an agreed division of powers between the Commonwealth and the States in relation to coastal waters and in relation to certain other matters including the regulation of shipping and navigation, offshore petroleum exploration, crimes at sea, and fisheries.\nHistory\nConvention on Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone 1958\nThe United Nations treaty, the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone defines \"the contiguous zone\" as not extending beyond \"twelve miles from which the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.\"\nSeas and Submerged Lands Act 1973\nThe Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 incorporates the Convention on Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone 1958 in domestic law.\nNew South Wales and Others v. Commonwealth of Australia\nThe six states took the federal Government to court over the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973. The High Court of Australia upheld the act and asserted that control over the coastal waters was in the hands of the Commonwealth.\nSettlement\nPremiers Conference, 1979\nOn 29 June 1979, the Commonwealth and the states completed an agreement called the \"Offshore constitutional settlement\".\nThe agreement outlines several different points of the agreement:\nthe Commonwealth Parliament will pass legislation based on Section 51 of the Constitution of Australia to give each state the powers with respect to the adjacent of 3 miles territorial sea, including the seabed beneath the sea\nthe area outside the 3 mile territorial sea will be governed by commonwealth legislation alone Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967\njoint authorities will be established to manage the regulation of petroleum arrangements in the interim period while there are already agreed projects - these were\nCoastal Waters (State Powers) Act 1980\nThe Coastal Waters (State Powers) Act 1980 vests the states the power to legislate within 3 nautical miles.\nCoastal Waters (State Title) Act 1980\nThe Coastal Waters (State Title) Act 1980 vests the states the right and title to the property within 3 nautical miles.\nCoastal Waters (Northern Territory Powers) Act 1980\nThe Coastal Waters (Northern Territory Powers) Act 1980 vests the Northern Territory the title of within 3 nautical miles.\nCoastal Waters (Northern Territory Title) Act 1980\nThe Coastal Waters (Northern Territory Title) Act 1980 vests the Northern Territory the right and title to the property within 3 nautical miles.\nFurther developmennts\nUnder the Crimes at Sea Act 2000 (Cth), the criminal law of each state applies to all 12 miles of the territorial sea.\nDiscussion\nUntil the settlement there had never been any national oceans policy. The OCS has been described as reflecting Australia's \"inherently federal public policy-making\".\nInternational comparison\nThe settlement has drawn comparisons to the United States' and Canada's federalist arrangements. Unlike Australia, the Canadian federal government has attempted to assert a 12-mile territorial sea, and only Newfoundland and Labrador has been able to assert a 3-mile sea. The equivalent arrangements for the United States are governed by the Submerged Lands Act.\nCriticism\nThe settlement has been described as an \"intergovernmental arrangement to sidestep an unpopular High Court decision\" rather than a constitutional settlement.\nThe situation created by the settlement has been criticised as a \"muddle\" of state and Northern Territory laws.\nSee also\nSubmerged Lands Act",
    "\nThe main line of Ann Arbor Railroad is a partially-abandoned railway line in the states of Michigan and Ohio. It was constructed between 1874 and 1897 by the Ann Arbor Railroad and its predecessors, and constituted that company's main line. At its fullest extent it ran 292 miles (470\u00a0km) from Toledo, Ohio, on Lake Erie, to Frankfort, Michigan, on Lake Michigan. A train ferry service operated across Lake Michigan to Wisconsin. The original Ann Arbor Railroad went bankrupt in 1976, and ownership of the line is now split between the state of Michigan and two short-line railroads: the Ann Arbor Railroad (founded in 1988) and the Huron and Eastern Railway. The northern end of the line is now near Yuma, Michigan.\nHistory\nConstruction\nSee also: Ann Arbor Railroad (1895\u20131976) \u00a7\u00a0History\nThe Toledo, Ann Arbor and Northern Railroad, founded in 1869, graded a line between Ann Arbor, Michigan, and the Ohio border, but was a casualty of the Panic of 1873. The Toledo and Ann Arbor Railroad, founded by James Mitchell Ashley, completed the line in 1878. Regular service began on June 21. A short section of the line within Toledo was built by the Toledo and State Line Railroad in 1874. That company was leased by the Pennsylvania Railroad between 1874 and 1878.\nThe further development of the Ann Arbor main line was pursued by Ashley through a series of companies which extended the line into northern Michigan. Initially, Ashley intended to extend northeast towards Pontiac, Michigan. The Toledo, Ann Arbor and Grand Trunk Railroad built 15 miles (24\u00a0km) north to South Lyon via Leland. The line opened in August 1881. In South Lyon the line connected with the Detroit, Lansing and Northern Railroad. The company abandoned further expansion toward Pontiac, shifting its attention toward Durand.\nThe basis of the Ann Arbor's northern extension was the Owosso and North Western Railroad, which had graded a line between Owosso and St. Louis. The Toledo, Ann Arbor and North Michigan Railway, successor to the Toledo, Ann Arbor and Grand Trunk, acquired the graded roadbed and right-of-way and completed the line in August 1884. The Toledo, Ann Arbor and North Michigan built a third disconnected segment in 1885 between Durand and Lakeland, Michigan; trackage rights over the Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway to the north and the Michigan Air Line Railroad to the south permitted through operation. In 1886 the company completed its own lines to connect the disparate sections.\nThe planned route north of St. Louis would have bypassed Alma. In response, local businessmen founded the Lansing, Alma, Mt. Pleasant and Northern Railroad, which in 1885 began building a line between Alma and Mount Pleasant, to the north. Ashley acquired that company in 1886, and completed the line to Mount Pleasant that July. In the south, the former grade of the Chicago, Saginaw and Canada Railroad was used to connect St. Louis and Alma. The Toledo, Ann Arbor and Cadillac Railway undertook the next phase of the expansion, beginning in 1886. As before, the grade of a previous company was incorporated, in this case the Lake George and Muskegon River Railroad. The extension between Cadillac and Mount Pleasant opened in August 1888.\nAshley selected Frankfort as the Lake Michigan outlet of the line. The Frankfort and South Eastern Railroad, backed by local businessmen, was already building eastward to Copemish. Using another new company, the Toledo, Ann Arbor and Lake Michigan Railway, the line was extended west from Cadillac to Copemish. The two lines met in Copemish in November 1889. Train ferry operations from Elberta, across Betsie Lake from Frankfort, began in 1892.\nAnn Arbor Railroad\nCherry Street station in Toledo\nThe Toledo, Ann Arbor and North Michigan Railroad entered bankruptcy during the Panic of 1893, and James Ashley resigned as president in 1894. The company was reorganized in 1895 as the Ann Arbor Railroad. In 1896, the Ann Arbor completed a 7-mile (11\u00a0km) cutoff north of Ann Arbor, bypassing the original route via Leland. A more significant change came in 1897, when the line was re-routed in Gratiot County to serve Alma directly, bypassing St. Louis. The basis of this re-route was the line of the Ithaca and Alma Railroad, purchased from the Detroit, Grand Rapids and Western Railroad. This change led to a lawsuit from residents in St. Louis who had backed the initial line. Also in 1897 the Ann Arbor built a new station in Toledo at Cherry and Seneca, 2.5 miles (4.0\u00a0km) from the main line.\nPassenger service ended in 1950 and the station at Cherry Street in Toledo were demolished in 1964.\nPost\u2013Ann Arbor\nSee also: Conrail \u00a7\u00a0History\nThe Ann Arbor Railroad entered bankruptcy in 1973. The United States Railway Association (USRA) evaluated the line for inclusion into the Conrail network. The USRA recommended only the Toledo\u2013Ann Arbor section (and Saline Branch) for inclusion. The online traffic north of Toledo was insufficient to justify inclusion. The USRA wa",

Malinformation is content grounded in truth but presented in a misleading or exaggerated way, which can lead to misconceptions and harm. It manipulates factual elements to mislead audiences through distortion or selective emphasis.\nIn August 2021, the Canadian Election Misinformation Project was launched by McGill University in response to concerns about the rise of misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic and the increase in foreign interference in elections globally. According to McGill's 2022 Media Ecosystem Observatory's report, Canada's information landscape is fragmenting, with citizens increasingly relying on diverse and potentially unreliable sources for political information, raising concerns about echo chambers. The rise of minimally moderated platforms has created a chaotic environment, making it harder to combat disinformation. A disconnect exists between the actual prevalence of misinformation and public perception, potentially eroding trust in democratic processes. Additionally, a growing segment of Canadians has become deeply skeptical of democratic institutions, operating in an alternate information reality disconnected from mainstream narratives.:\u200a4\u20135\u200a\nAccording to the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS) the annual cost globally of \"misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation\" (MDM) represents billons of dollars.\n2000s\n2003 \u2014 A petition with 1,180 signatures was submitted to the House of Commons alleging that \"massive amounts of chemicals\"\u2014adversely affecting Canadians across the country\u2014were sprayed by the federal government. Health Canada and Environment Canada refuted the claims. The Environment Canada statement said that the term 'chemtrails' was a \"popularised expression\" and that petitioners were seeing contrails\u2014airplane condensation trails. The decades-old chemtrail conspiracy theory has been \"widely debunked by scientists and experts, who emphasize there is no credible evidence to support the claims associated with this theory\".\n2010s\n2014\nCanadian pro-Putin groups began promoting Russian misinformation about the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. The illegal annexation marked the beginning of the Russo-Ukrainian War.\n2017\nMarch 14 Canadian pro-Putin groups have promoted Russian narratives about the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation which marked the beginning of the Russo-Ukrainian War. Russian disinformation in Canada included the \"Nazi-grandfather\" conspiracy theory that claims that descendants of Nazis who are currently living in Canada have amassed \"outsized political power.\" Chrystia Freeland became a target of the hoax.\n2018\nJune 9 \u2014 The G7 Rapid Response Mechanism (G7 RRM) was established in Charlevoix, Quebec at the \"Charlevoix Commitment on Defending Democracy from Foreign Threats\" by the leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) countries\u2014United States, Canada, Japan, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy.:\u200a2\u200a The G7 RRM focusses on \"addressing foreign-sponsored disinformation\".\nOctober \u2014 The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security(CSSS) was established with Scott Jones as the head.\n2019\nJanuary 25 \u2014 Trudeau sharply criticized social media giants at  a public event in Quebec City, with particularly sharp rhetoric against Facebook for spreading disinformation around the world.\nJanuary 29 \u2014 The Canadian government announced a $7 million plan to fight online misinformation and disinformation ahead of the 2019 Canadian federal election. The government also called on social media platforms to be more proactive in combatting disinformation by implementing policies.\nIn response to the increase in \"false, misleading and inflammatory\" online disinformation, the federal government created the Digital Citizen Initiative, to \"support democracy and social inclusion in Canada\". The Digital Citizen Initiative is also supporting the Canadian Digital Media Research Network (CDMRN).\nThe CPC chair, Bob Zimmer, of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics said that the 2015 Canadian federal election was largely \"unencumbered by interference\", although there were some attempts to \"disrupt, misinform and divide\", but these \"efforts\" were \"uncoordinated\", limited in number, and had little if any imp",

    "Spanish bullfighter (1932\u20132011)\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  Chenel and the second or maternal family name is  Albadalejo.\nAntonio Chenel Albadalejo (Spanish: ; 24 June 1932 \u2013 22 October 2011), professionally and popularly known as Anto\u00f1ete (Spanish: ), was a Spanish bullfighter. His family had no background in bullfighting beyond Anto\u00f1ete's father having been a monosabio (a picador's assistant).\nAnto\u00f1ete himself explained that his maternal surname should really be Albaladejo, rather than Albadalejo. The transposition of two of the letters in this name arose from bureaucratic carelessness when his National Identity Document was issued.\nEarly life\nBorn in Madrid, right near Spain's foremost bullring, Las Ventas, Anto\u00f1ete spent the Spanish Civil War in the country's east once the Spanish mint had transferred its operations to Valencia; his father was a mint employee. The family later moved to Castell\u00f3n de la Plana, also on the Costa del Azahar and, once the fighting was over, to Alicante. They moved back to Madrid in 1940 when Anto\u00f1ete was eight years old. He suffered as a result of having a \"red\" father, who was both left-wing and Republican. Hungry and out on the street\u00a0\u2013 the consequent malnutrition resulted in chronic bone decalcification for the boy\u00a0\u2013 they had no choice but to turn to Anto\u00f1ete's brother-in-law, who was the overseer at Las Ventas, Paco Parejo (whose wife was Anto\u00f1ete's elder sister Carmen). He thus got to watch from an early age the bullfights with the great bullfighters of the 1940s, whom he considered his heroes, above all the ill-fated Manolete. During his childhood and adolescence, he would spend his time at the horse yard, the stables, and the bullpens at Las Ventas helping train bullfighters (by standing in for the bull) such as Agust\u00edn Parra \"Parrita\", Paquito Mu\u00f1oz, and Manolo Navarro.\nFirst steps into bullfighting\nIn 1946, Anto\u00f1ete gained experience at capeas in smaller towns. It was in this year that he fought and slew his first calf. A novillero between 1949 and 1952, he donned the suit of lights for the first time in 1949 in a spectacle called \"Los charros mejicanos\" (or \"mexicanos\" in some sources; \"The Mexican Rustics\"), organized by the company that ran Las Ventas.\nAnto\u00f1ete made his d\u00e9but with picadores on 18 February 1951 in Barcelona, alternating with Pablo Lozano and Manolo Sevilla, with bull calves furnished by the Brothers Zambrano ranch.\nOn 5 June 1952, Anto\u00f1ete then presented himself at Las Ventas, sharing the billing with Manuel Perea \"Boni\" and Mariano Mart\u00edn Aguilar \"Carriles\", and together fighting calves laid on by the ranch Don Nicasio L\u00f3pez Naval\u00f3n.\nBecoming a matador\nAnto\u00f1ete took his alternativa on 8 March 1953 in a very familiar place: Castell\u00f3n de la Plana, his family's wartime refuge. Standing as \"godfather\" on this occasion was the bullfighter Julio Aparicio Mart\u00ednez while Pedro Mart\u00ednez Gonz\u00e1lez \"Pedr\u00e9s\" stood as the witness. The bulls for the occasion were supplied by the ranch Don Francisco Chica, the one for Anto\u00f1ete's alternativa being named Carvajal. Confirmation of his alternativa came in Madrid on 13 May of the same year. Standing as \"godfather\" this time was Rafael Ortega Dom\u00ednguez, while Julio Aparicio Mart\u00ednez bore witness. Anto\u00f1ete that day at Las Ventas demonstrated an orthodox and classical style although with temper, courage and much valour, which was why he sustained quite a few serious injuries early on in his bullfighting career. The bulls for the confirmation were laid on by the ranch Don Alipio P\u00e9rez-Tabernero Sanch\u00f3n; the actual confirmation bull was Rab\u00f3n. Two days later, he had a great triumph at the same bullring, fighting two bulls from the Ferm\u00edn Boh\u00f3rquez ranch, both of which he left earless, although at least one source says that he was only awarded three ears at this corrida, but that he was also borne out through the Great Gate on shoulders. He shared billing that day with Rafael Ortega and Jorge Aguilar \"El Ranchero\".\nOn 1 July 1953, Anto\u00f1ete presented himself in Portugal, at Lisbon's Campo Pequeno Bullring, where he alternated with Diamantino Vizeu, Antonio Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, and Luis Espatanal. Together they fought bulls from Don Antonio Silva's and Don David Telles's ranch.\nAnto\u00f1ete's alternativa was confirmed once again in Mexico on 22 November 1953. Standing as \"godfather\" then was Manuel Capetillo, while Juan Silveti bore witness. Bulls were supplied by the San Mateo ranch, and the one that Anto\u00f1ete fought for the confirmation was named C\u00f3mico.\nAnto\u00f1ete's very long bullfighting career stretched over more than forty years, with many upturns and downturns, retirements, and comebacks. He is one of bullfighting history's greatest. His faena (series of passes before the bullfighter slays the bull) with Cantinero from the Garz\u00f3n ranch in 1985 will always be remembered by bullfighting fans.\nFirst period (1953\u20131975)\nAnto\u00f1ete's first period, which was full of ups and downs owing to his bone injuries, lasted fro",

    "Municipal building in Forres, Scotland\nThe Forres Tolbooth is a municipal building on the High Street in Forres in Scotland. The building, which is used as a visitor attraction, is a Category A listed building.\nHistory\nThe first tolbooth in Forres was completed in the mid-16th century. It was primarily used as a prison, but was in a ruinous condition by 1655. Extensive repairs were carried out in the 1670s and the late 1690s. A bell was installed in 1708 and a clock was installed in 1711.\nThe foundation stone for the current structure was laid in 1838. It was designed by William Robertson in the Scottish baronial style, built in ashlar stone, and was completed in 1839. The design involved a five-stage tower facing southwest down the High Street. There was a round headed doorway with an archivolt in the first stage, a round headed window with an archivolt in the second stage, a corbelled parapet with corner bartizans at the top of the third stage, clock faces with more corner bartizans in the fourth stage, and a tall octagonal belfry in the fifth stage, all surmounted by an ogee-shaped roof, a small cupola and a weather vane in the shape of a cockerel. There was a three-storey courthouse block behind. Internally, the principal rooms were some vaulted rooms in the tower, six prison cells, and a courtroom, which featured a coffered ceiling and stained glass windows depicting Saint Lawrence, on the first floor of the block behind.\nA mercat cross, designed by Thomas Mackenzie closely resembling the Scott Monument, was erected just to the west of the tolbooth in 1844. The building was closed to the public in 1991 and was subsequently left largely vacant except for two offices used by Moray Council.\nBy 2011, the condition of the fabric of the building was deteriorating and it was placed on the Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland. The building was transferred from Moray Council to the newly-formed Forres Heritage Trust in 2014. After extensive restoration works, which included refurbishment of the courtroom, a new staircase in the tower and masonry repairs, the building re-opened as a visitor attraction in 2022. Tours of the building reached the prison cells, the courtroom and then the tower. The complex also began hosting concerts and other events: a marriage ceremony took place in the courtroom in April 2022, and concert performers there have included the folk singer, Ivan Drever, in April 2024. The building was lit up with energy efficient floodlights to help promote tourism from January 2024.\nSee also\nList of Category A listed buildings in Moray\nList of listed buildings in Forres, Moray",

    "19th-century Bornu aristocrat\nLaminu Njitiya (died 1871) was a 19th-century Shuwa Arab aristocrat who served as an influential adviser to Umar bin Muhammad al-Kanemi, the Shehu of Bornu. He was often described as the most powerful figure in Bornu during the second reign of Umar (1854 to 1881).\nInitially a highway bandit, Laminu became a follower of influential courtiers of the Shehu, including Mallam Tirab, and later his son, al-Hajj Bashir. As the chief assistant of Bashir, he was infamous for carrying out the dirty work of his master, which he did with ruthless efficiency. After Bashir's death in 1853, Laminu became Umar's closest adviser. This position granted him considerable influence and wealth in Bornu. He was known for his competence as an administrator and is remembered as the greatest 19th-century fief-holder in Magumeri.:\u200a80\u201381\u200a\nEarly life\nLaminu Njitiya was of mixed Shuwa Arab and Kanembu descent. He began his career as a highwayman in Magumeri, a fief of Mallam Tirab, an influential adviser to Muhammad al-Kanemi, the Shehu of Bornu. Njitiya eventually abandoned banditry to follow Mallam Tirab and quickly rose through the ranks of Tirab's large following. After Mallam Tirab's death in 1846, his son al-Hajj Bashir succeeded him on the Shehu's council, inheriting Tirab's influence and followers, including Njitiya.:\u200a80\u201381\u200a\nWakil of al-Hajj Bashir\nLaminu became the most trusted companion of al-Hajj Bashir, who appointed him as Wakil (chief assistant). Bashir frequently relied on Laminu for executing his dirty work, which he performed with \"complete loyalty and ruthless efficiency.\" Dr Heinrich Barth, a German explorer who visited Bornu in the 1850s, described Laminu as the \"shameless left hand of the Vizier,\" condemning him for his \"hard-heartedness and total want of gentle feelings.\":\u200a80\u201382\u200a\nThe palace of the Shehu in Kukawa (1857)\nBashir became a very influential member of Shehu Umar's council, eventually assuming the role of Waziri (Vizier). Shehu Umar's dependence on Bashir granted him immense power, which drew animosity from the other courtiers, particularly Abdurrahman, Umar's brother, who wanted to become Shehu. This tension led to open conflict in November 1853, forcing the Shehu to impose a curfew in Kukawa, Bornu's capital. Laminu was tasked with enforcing it, leading a contingent of the Waziri's slaves and followers. While carrying out this assignment, he got involved in a skirmish with the supporters of Abdurrahman, suffering a broken hand.:\u200a77\u201378\u200a\nThis skirmish further escalated the discontent in Kukawa. The two factions eventually clashed in battle, resulting in a defeat for the Shehu's faction. Consequently, Abdurrahman was quickly installed as Shehu, while Bashir fled the capital, and Laminu went into hiding.:\u200a78\u200a\nThe reign of Abdurrahman was very short. After he killed al-Hajj Bashir, his courtiers eventually came to despise his rule, viewing him as a tyrant. Since the main objection to Umar's rule was his reliance on Bashir, who was now dead, the courtiers launched another coup, leading to Umar's restoration as Shehu in early September 1854.:\u200a79\u200a\nShehu Umar's second reign\nAfter Abdurrahman was deposed, Laminu returned to Kukawa to serve directly under Shehu Umar. Laminu grew close to Umar and eventually became a member of his council. Following the death of al-Hajj Bashir, Abdurrahman had confiscated his properties and slaves, but after Umar's return to power, Laminu was granted a large portion of Bashir's fief, leaving only a few villages to Abba Salih, Bashir's younger brother. This reward was given in recognition of Laminu's loyalty and exceptional leadership abilities.:\u200a81\u201382\u200a\nDue to his growing wealth, Laminu amassed a large following, consisting mostly of former supporters of al-Hajj Bashir. Contrary to his reputation during his time doing Bashir's dirty work, Laminu became very popular in Kukawa. He was known for his competence as an administrator and is remembered in Magumeri as its greatest 19th-century fief-holders, with the district's population more than doubling under his leadership. He led several expeditions, which resulted in the Bornu army conquering large portions of the Marghi country, located to the south of the kingdom.:\u200a80\u201382\u200a\nLaminu's popularity, combined with Shehu Umar's confidence in him, made Laminu one of the most powerful and effective leaders in Bornu. Although he became as influential as his former master before his death, he seemed to have managed to handle it better. Despite having powerful enemies, he always maintained a larger number of friends.:\u200a80\u201382\u200a\nDeath\nLaminu died on 4 February 1871. Gustav Nachtigal, a German explorer who was in Kukawa at the time, considered his death a great calamity for Bornu and for Umar who had lost his only 'honest adviser'.:\u200a82\u200a Nachtigal recorded the reaction in Kukawa after his death:\"The grief extended no less to the Shaikh and many of the citizens of the capital.

It uses retro-style pixel art graphics.\nDevelopment\nDeveloper Metamorphosis Games is based in Los Angeles. Fireshine Games released Gestalt: Steam and Cinder for Windows on July 16, 2024.  Ports to the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Switch are planned for 2025.\nReception\nGestalt: Steam and Cinder received \"mixed or average\" reviews from critics, according to the review aggregator website Metacritic. GameSpot enjoyed the combat, steampunk setting, pixel art, and customization options, but they said there was too much exposition, to the point that it became overwhelming.  They concluded that it is \"a great start for a potential franchise\". RPGSite called it \"an extremely enjoyable experience\" and recommended it to people who enjoy action-platformers.  They initially thought it would be good for speedrunning but said the amount of exposition and unskippable cutscenes would make this difficult.  They suggested making changing cutscenes to be skippable. Shacknews said they enjoyed the game and praised the art.  However, they disliked the ending despite enjoying the rest of the story and the worldbuilding.  They also felt the combat needed more balancing because it became trivial to defeat bosses after becoming overpowered. Slant Magazine criticized the exposition for being \"undercooked but intrusive\".  They also disliked the exploration, feeling that it became tedious.\n",

    "Exhibition of M\u0101ori Art\nTe Hokinga Mai (M\u0101ori: the return home) was a touring exhibition of M\u0101ori art gathered from major museum collections throughout New Zealand. The exhibition was initially organised by the American Federation of Arts and toured four North American cities as Te Maori (sometimes Te M\u0101ori in modern sources) in 1984 to 1986. Upon completion of the North American tour the exhibition returned to New Zealand in 1986 and was rebranded Te Maori: Te Hokinga Mai \u2013 The Return Home. It toured to the four major metropolitan centres in New Zealand; Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.\nBackground\nTe Maori opened at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in September 1984. The exhibition featured 174 customary carved M\u0101ori art items from the collections of 12 museums in New Zealand. The exhibition met with such success in North America that a New Zealand tour was planned. Upon its return to New Zealand in 1986 the exhibition was rebranded and travelled the country starting at the National Museum, Wellington (August \u2013 October 1986), Otago Museum, Dunedin (November 1986 \u2013 February 1987), the Robert McDougall Art Gallery, Christchurch (March \u2013 May 1987) and finally to the Auckland Art Gallery (June \u2013 September 1987).\nDevelopment\nThe exhibition was initially organised by the American Federation of Arts under the curatorship of Douglas Newton of the New York Metropolitan Museum, David Simmonds, of the Auckland Museum and Hirini Moko Mead. As part of its New Zealand tour as Te Hokinga Mai new art works were added including textiles.\nArt works\nTe Maori featured 174 unique and ancient M\u0101ori art treasures. While lauded for putting M\u0101ori art on the global stage, the exhibition also received criticism for its exclusion of arts associated with M\u0101ori women and contemporary art. The return to New Zealand as Te Hokinga Mai enabled some of these criticisms to be addressed.\nNew Zealand tour\nIn 1986 and 1987 the exhibition toured to the four metropolitan centres of New Zealand, Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. It was the most expensive exhibition ever to tour New Zealand but due to a further financial commitment from the primary sponsor Mobil New Zealand it remained free entry. Instead visitors were asked for koha, a voluntary gift.\nReception\nAs Te M\u0101ori made international headlines, New Zealanders awoke to the nation's unique M\u0101ori point of difference and the public appetite for a national tour grew. M\u0101ori leaders saw the tour as a chance for more M\u0101ori to interact with their heritage. On its return to New Zealand, the exhibition was rebranded and the organising committee worked with each venue to facilitate wider M\u0101ori participation.\nLegacy\nRay Waru made a film Te M\u0101ori \u2013 Te Hokinga Mai.\nTe Hokinga Mai precipitated and inspired more M\u0101ori to work in museums and galleries. With these new professionals came increased use of M\u0101ori customs and language within these institutions. Increased exposure to M\u0101ori relationships to their art or taonga as living treasures resulted in repatriation programmes between overseas museums and New Zealand.\n",

    "Dirty Fred (or as Jimmy Ears refers to him: Dirty Alfred) is a comic character created by Hungarian author Jen\u0151 Rejt\u0151 (writing under the pseudonym P. Howard), and is the titular protagonist in several of Rejt\u0151's most famous pulp novels.\nDirty Fred features (in order of writing) in the novels \"The Lost Cruiser\", \"Dirty Fred, the Captain\", \"Dirty Fred intervenes (to Jimmy Ears' Sincere Regret)\" and \"The Found Cruiser\". These novels have reached enormous popularity in Hungary after the author's death - including adaptations into radio dramas, plays, graphic novels and a board game - and Dirty Fred himself has become a well-known cultural touch stone, having had restaurants, songs and rock bands named after him.\nDescription\nDirty Fred is around fifty years old, with a long, dirty, coffee-colored, unkempt beard, and black-rimmed eagle talons. His skin is tanned and wrinkled, with small, cunning, glittering eyes. On his face are several round, large warts, a characteristic hawk-like nose, and a downturned, wide mouth. His messy, grayish-white hair hangs over his forehead. He could only be forced to bathe under life-threatening circumstances, and his sun-tanned face guarded the date of his last wash like a great mystery. The humor of his character stems from the fact that, in line with his name, he is dirty, neglected, taciturn and grumpy like a sailor, yet thanks to his sharp mind and extensive network of acquaintances, he is surprisingly able to arrange many situations to his liking. A characteristic move to assert his will is to announce plans to do the opposite of his actual intention, and let others who want to spite him play into his hand. One of his constant partners, yet also his adversary, is Jimmy Ears, who once described him thus: \"He has the most brains in the world. He's stingy, cruel, grumpy, and stops at nothing when it comes to money. He cheats everyone, profits from everything, befriends no one, roams the world alone, and as his name suggests, he's completely dirty.\" And \"...only three things interest him: money and nothing else, plus screwing me over.\" His personality, however, is not devoid of mysterious lyricism: \"from the time of his bygone youth, they say, archaic, gentlemanly sorrows rested as mysterious, frozen fossils.\"\nLife\nFred was born as Wilbour Theodor. He was once a frigate captain of an unspecified ship in the Royal Navy but on one occasion he committed several murders and had to leave his service. At some point he married Helena, queen of the Bliss Islands and later Queen Mother and fathered the Grand Duke St. Antonio, later King of the Bliss Islands of Happiness. He and the queen keep this as a secret. Afterward, he smuggled ammunition to China on a 'shabby little steamer' and brought drugs back to Greece. He founded a bank in Port Said with Mr. Wagner, and on another occasion, he created a joint-stock company with the participation of the Surgeon, Rusty, the Kid, Bunk\u00f3, and Morbitzer, and he became the managing director. In a moment of distress, he stole the cruiser Balmoral - which he later renamed Radzeer based on Rusty's idea - but due to his useful services, he was forgiven and even allowed to keep the cruiser. For a while, he peacefully sailed the seas with his comrades, but since Dirty Fred was a tyrant and constantly embezzled from the ship's expenses, a mutiny broke out, and the captain was slapped on a stormy night at the height of the Cape of Good Hope, after dramatic preliminaries.\nLater, he was allegedly seen in Alaska, where he opened a gambling den, and the gold diggers seriously considered lynching him. Once there was a rumor that he had died, but it later turned out that he was the captain of that shabby little steamer that rushed to the aid of the luxury steamer Tokio-Maru, which had run aground in a raging storm, and saved fifty passengers. They later noticed that all their valuables had disappeared. He occasionally appears in Canton, Trieste, or Rio de Janeiro.\nDirty Fred Novels\nThe Lost Cruiser (Az elveszett cirk\u00e1l\u00f3)\nFirst edition: Nova Irodalmi Int\u00e9zet, 1938 (byline: 'P.

    "\nThomas Carnelley (22 October 1854 \u2013 27 August 1890) was a British chemist who contributed to physical chemistry and was involved in introducing German-inspired chemistry research into Britain as professor of chemistry at the University of Dundee and later at Aberdeen. He studied the relationships between the melting and boiling points of the salts of elements and their positions in the periodic table. He also examined relationships between molecular structures and physical properties and came up with a rule that is sometimes called \"Carnelley's Rule\".\nLife and work\nCarnelley (standing second from left), Dmitri Mendeleev (bottom, centre) and Sir Henry Roscoe (bottom, right)\nCarnelley was born in Manchester, the son of William. He studied at King's College School, London and joined Owens College, Manchester in 1868. He showed scholastic brilliance and received a Bachelor of Science in 1871 with a third position in Third Class Honors in Chemistry. In 1872 he obtained second place in First Class Honors in Chemistry qualifying for a university scholarship. He studied the vanadates of thallium that led to a Dalton Chemical Scholarship and he worked as a private assistant to Henry Enfield Roscoe in 1872-74 giving lectures in the evening at Owens College. He then went to the University of Bonn and studied under August Kekul\u00e9 (1829\u20131896), Theodor Zincke (1843\u20131928), and Otto Wallach (1847\u20131931). He studied the reactions of carbon disulfide and alcohol with hot copper catalysts and the synthesis of tolylphenyl. He received a doctorate in 1876 and in 1879 he received a DSc from the University of London. He was appointed to Firth College, Sheffield in 1879 where he established a chemistry laboratory and in 1881 he moved to the University College of Dundee where he had more resources. He taught with great zeal and was popular among students. He also conducted research on the heating and ventilation of schools, the quality of air in buildings and so on leading to his being elected to the school board. He also established a museum and a dye-house with material contributed by Carnelley's father to the college. In 1888 he accepted the chair of chemistry at the University of Aberdeen following the death of James Smith Brazier. Two years after moving to Aberdeen, he suffered from a sudden illness and an internal abscess. He died at home in Cults, Aberdeen at the age of 36.\nCarnelley (left) and J. S. Haldane examining the air of Dundee sewer\nCarnelley helped introduce the German style of chemical research and industrial applications into Britain. He was elected to the Chemical Society of London in 1874. He published more than 50 papers and several textbooks. He studied the synthesis of several hydrocarbons including tolylphenyl and ditolyl and examined the physics of ice. In his 1879 work, he examined the melting points of metallic salts and related them to their positions in the periodic table. Mendeleeff took notice of the work and wrote to Henry Roscoe that Carnelley's work deserved wide knowledge. He stated that: \u201cThe labors of Carnelley connected with the periodic law of the elements have been so remarkable that the history of the subject would be incomplete if his name were omitted.\u201d Carnelley and Thomas Burton developed a new pyrometer to measure high temperatures. It was made of a coil of copper tubing which carries water through it. Measurement was made of the water temperature at the inlet and at the outlet and he calibrated these with known temperatures. In 1881 he claimed that it was possible to maintain ice at solid phase at temperatures above the normal melting point under pressure. In 1880 the sublimation of ice was demonstrated at low temperatures.\nCarnelley's Rule states that of two or more isomers, those whose atoms are the more symmetrically and the more compactly arranged melt higher than those in which the atomic arrangement is asymmetrical or in the form of long chains.\nHis interest in public hygiene led to his being appointed to a committee to examine the air and smells in the House of Commons in 1886. Carnelley and J.S. Haldane were asked to examine the quality of the air. The studied the carbon dioxide levels in the sewers and in the rooms. He also adapted a bacteriological analysis using Hesse's method.\n",
    "Judicial building in Oban, Scotland\nOban Municipal Buildings is a municipal building on Albany Street in Oban in Scotland. The building, which is used by Argyll and Bute Council for the delivery of local services, is a Category B listed building.\nHistory\nFollowing significant population growth, largely associated with the fishing and distillery industries, Oban became a police burgh in 1862. However, Oban did not have a town house, until the police commissioners decided to procure one to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The site they selected was on the northwest side of Albany Street.\nThe foundation stone for the new building was laid by the provost, Francis Cooper, on 22 June 1897. It was designed by Alexander Shairp in the neoclassical style, built in ashlar stone at a cost of \u00a36,000 and was completed in around 1900. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of seven bays facing onto Albany Street. The central bay featured a round headed opening with an archivolt and a keystone flanked a pair of Corinthian order columns supporting an open segmental pediment with floral carvings in the tympanum: there was a venetian window on the first floor. The other bays were fenestrated by sash windows with keystones and triangular pediments on the ground floor, and by round headed windows with colonettes and keystones on the first floor. The bays were separated by full height pilasters supporting a frieze and a balustraded parapet. The parapet was broken by a panel, inscribed with the words \"Municipal Buildings\", which was surmounted by a triangular pediment containing an oculus and flanked by pedestals supporting finials. Internally, the principal room was the council chamber in the northeast corner of the first floor.\nIn August 1956, Queen Elizabeth II visited the town and, following her visit, a plaque was placed on the main frontage, to the right of the entrance, to celebrate the royal visit. In October 1962, another plaque was placed on the main frontage, to the left of the entrance, to celebrate the founding of An Comunn G\u00e0idhealach (English: The Gaelic Association) in Oban in 1891. The building continued to serve as the meeting place of the burgh council for much of the 20th century but ceased to be the local seat of government when the enlarged Argyll and Bute District Council was formed in 1975. However, the council, known as Argyll and Bute Council after it became a unitary authority in 1996, subsequently established a customer service point in the building as well as a series of \"touchdown areas\" for local residents.\nWorks of art in the building included a pair of portraits by Duncan MacGregor Whyte depicting the provosts, Dugald McIsaac and Hugh MacGowan.\nSee also\nList of listed buildings in Oban",

    "Jean de La Br\u00e8te\nJean de La Br\u00e8te (pen name of Alice Cherbonnel; 1858\u20131945) was a pseudonymous French writer of novels for young women. Her best-known work, Mon oncle et mon cur\u00e9\u00a0 (1889), went through several editions and was adapted to stage and screen.\nEarly life\nAlice Cherbonnel was born in Saumur, 13 December 1858 to a Norman father and a Angevin mother. She descended from a lineage of French storytellers.\nCareer\nLa Br\u00e8te's novels were commentaries on contemporary society. Le Roman d'une croyante, L'Impossible, and Un Mirage dealt with the religious problems that agitated France in La Br\u00e8te's era. Her most popular work was Mon oncle et mon cur\u00e9, the autobiography of a young girl who reveals to the reader her thoughts, dreams, and  aspirations. It was awarded the Prix Montyon in 1890 by the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, and was constantly republished until 1977. This novel was adapted for the cinema in 1938. Mon oncle et mon cur\u00e9 was considered to be a work of great educational value, cleverly and agreeably disguised as a work of fiction. It was a favorite text for schools and colleges. Elizabeth M. White adapted the book to young students, annotating freely with footnotes, and adding a series of exercises based on the text, for translation from English back into French.\nLa Br\u00e8te's style was characterized as clear and vivid; her stories are vigorous and highly colored; her conclusions are generally shown by the plot itself rather than by a series of speeches.\nPersonal life\nIn the winter, she lived in a Parisian apartment on the Boulevard des Invalides. In the summer, she lived on her estate in Anjou, an estate that belonged to her mother's family for more than a century. Her library was installed in the tower above the chapel of the manor, a description of which was contained in her Badinage. Alice Cherbonnel died in Cizay-la-Madeleine, 23 August 1945.

    "RNLI Lifeboat station in Argyll and Bute, Scotland\nTobermory Lifeboat Station is located at the end of Main Street in Tobermory, a harbour town sitting at the northern end of the Sound of Mull, on the Isle of Mull, part of the Inner Hebrides, off the west coast of Scotland.\nA lifeboat was first placed at Tobermory by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1938.\nThe station currently operates a Severn-class All-weather lifeboat, 17-39 Elizabeth Fairlie Ramsey (ON 1270), on station since 2003.\nHistory\nIn 1937, it was decided to place a lifeboat at the town of Tobermory, on the Isle of Mull, a location ideally situated to cover the sea areas of western Scotland. The nine-year-old 40ft 6in Watson-class lifeboat J. & W. (ON 722) was temporarily placed on station in October 1938.\nMeanwhile, the new station boat, a 46ft Watson-class lifeboat, which had been constructed in early 1938 at Sandbank on Holy Loch, by Alexander Robertson & Sons, had been placed on display at the Empire Exhibition in Glasgow in May 1938, remaining there until October 1938. When the exhibition closed, the boat was dispatched to its new home at Tobermory, stopping at Ardrishaig on Loch Gilp on the voyage, where 300 people took a further opportunity to view the boat. Finally, she transited the Crinan Canal to Tobermory. At a ceremony on 28 November 1938, the boat was named Sir Arthur Rose (ON 801).\nThe boat had been funded by the late Miss Margaret Lithgow, of Dhunara Castle, on the estate of Glen Gorm, Mull, and who was the sister of the shipbuilder, Sir James Lithgow.\nOn Sunday 31 March 1940, the steamship Nydalen, on passage from Runcorn to Methil via Kirkwall, ran aground at full speed on a reef at Arinagour, on the island of Coll. She was so far aground, that they couldn't initially launch the ships lifeboats until high water. Tobermory lifeboat Sir Arthur Rose arrived to find Captain Jensen and 13 crew in the lifeboats, sheltering under the stern of the vessel. All 14 men were landed at Arinagour.\nHMS Western Isles was a command ship of the Royal Navy during World War II, and was the flagship of the Anti-Submarine Training School based at Tobermory. It is not known who made up the crew of the lifeboat during the period of the war, but it may be no coincidence that after the withdrawal of HMS Western Isles from Tobermory, and the departure of Naval personnel, by 1947, Tobermory lifeboat station was experiencing great difficulty maintaining a crew. In December 1947, Tobermory station was closed, and the lifeboat was transferred to a new station at Mallaig, which opened in January 1948.\nIt was decided to reopen the station in 1990, after a local campaign highlighted the growing number of leisure boats and incidents in the area. The Waveney lifeboat 44-016 Ralph and Joy Swan (ON 1042) was initially placed on service, but was replaced the following year with the larger 54-foot Arun lifeboat 54-07 City of Bradford IV (ON 1052).\nIn 1940, Tobermory lifeboat had been presented with a small version of the 'St John's Cross of Iona', by the Reverend George MacLeod, later Lord MacLeod of Fuinary, and it was carried on the lifeboat on all service launches. When the station closed, the cross remained aboard the lifeboat, which was transferred to operate from the new station at Mallaig, and was carried on board all subsequent Mallaig lifeboats. On 26 May 1991, with the Tobermory station re-established, the Mallaig Arun-class lifeboat, 52-21 The Davina and Charles Matthews Hunter (ON 1078), stopped in at Tobermory, and following a presentation ceremony, a small version of the 'St John's Cross of Iona' is now once again being carried aboard the Tobermory lifeboat.\nTobermory Severn-class lifeboat 17-39 Elizabeth Fairlie Ramsey (ON 1270)\nIn 1992, a row of five lock-up garages was purchased alongside Mishnish Pier, and work was carried out to convert the buildings, to provide facilities for the RNLI crew and volunteers, and an office for H.M. Coastguard. The building was officially opened at a ceremony on 26 March 1994, funded from a local appeal which raised over \u00a361,000. The appeal was started in the memory of Robert 'Bobby' MacLeod, a veteran of the 1947 lifeboat crew, and one of those people instrumental in the campaign to reopen the lifeboat station.\nAn alongside berth was completed in 2000. In 2003, Tobermory would receive their latest lifeboat, a 17\u00a0m (56\u00a0ft) Severn-class lifeboat, 17-39 Elizabeth Fairlie Ramsey (ON 1270).\nOn 27 January 2013, the Tobermory lifeboat was called to the aid of a fishing boat with gearbox failure, located 7 miles (11\u00a0km) west of the Isle of Coll. The boat was towed back to the Isle of Tiree, where another boat awaited to take up the tow, but the rope parted, and the fishing boat ended on the rocks. Lines and tows were set up several times by the lifeboat, and the fishing boat was finally retrieved to Tobermory. In all, the service had taken 11 hours.\nStation honours\nThe following are awards made at Tobermory.\n",

    "1915 battle during World War I\nThe Battle of Ni\u0161 was a military engagement between the joint armies of Bulgarian Kingdom and German Empire against Serbia in November 1915, during the Central Powers Morava Offensive of World War I. City of Ni\u0161, serving as a capital of Serbian kingdom after the fall of Belgrade, was captured between 4 and 5 November 1915 by the forces of 9th Pleven Division of Bulgarian First Army. The fall of Ni\u0161 had a huge psychological impact on both of fighting sides: Serbians were forced to continue in their Great Retreat, for Central Powers the victory ment removing the last obstacle for operating the Berlin\u2013Baghdad railway, the shortest railway connection between Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire.\nPrelude\nSerbian campaign\nIn the beginning of October 1915 armies of Austria-Hungary, supported by German troops, launched a mayor offensive against Serbia with a combined force of over 600,000 soldiers. Massive numerical and technological superiority caused a quick collapse of Serbian defence: between 5 and 16 October 1915 Belgrade, capital of Serbia, was captured after intensive clashes forcing Serbian soldiers, civilians and also the government to flee further south. Serbian cabinet led by Prime Minister Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107 already moved their offices to the Palace of Ni\u0161 on 26 July 1914, one of the biggest cities in the country, placed about 230 kilometers south-east from Belgrade, far enough from the front. City was protected by the Ni\u0161 Fortress, mayor citadel of the defending site, and also a few defensive posts on the city suburbs.\nMorava Offensive\nAs a critical fact for fiercely fighting Serbian Army, on 14 October 1915 Bulgaria, one of the Central Powers allys and a rival of Serbia in the Second Balkan War in 1913, joined the war against Serbia lanunching the Morava Offensive. Operation proceeded by the forces of the First Bulgarian Army commanded by General Kliment Boyadzhiev was delayed due to bad weather conditions and impassable terrain. Despite the desperate resistance of the Serbian units, their defense was broken after the retreat of their posts near the town of Knja\u017eevac under the pressure of the Bulgarian Eighth Tunjan Infantry Division. This forced the Serbian units to withdraw from the Pirot Fortress on 14 October, where Bulgarians captured and c. 1,500 Serbian prisoners and 14 cannons. After this breakthrough the First Army then continued to a further advance towards Ni\u0161, enemy's provisional capital.\nBattle\nBulgarian artillery shells the outer forts of Ni\u0161 (illustration by Georg H\u00e4nel, 1915)\nDefence of the city was crucially threaded after the fall of Aleksinac Fortress at the end of October 1915. On 4 November, after fierce fighting and Bulgarian artillery bombardment, the First Bulgarian Army reached the outskirts of Ni\u0161. The storming of the city was launched simultaneously by parts of the northern and eastern groups of Bulgarian forces. The defensive line of the Ni\u0161 fortress was finally breached at 3 p.m. by the Fourth Pleven Infantry Regiment of the Ninth Pleven Division with a frontal bayonet attack. The Serbs then started a chaotic retreat leaving the entire fortified line.\nBulgarian soldiers entered the fort on the morning of 5 November without any further resistance thophying 42 old fortress cannons, several thousand rifles and a big amount of ammunitions, stores of food, in addition of around 5,000 prisoners of war.\nOn 6 November Bulgarians made contact with the German 11th Army of General Gallwitz.\nAftermath\nFerdinand I as the driver of the locomotive of the first train after the restoration of the connection from Sofia to Ni\u0161, before the departure in Sofia (Felix Schwormst\u00e4dt, 1916)\nBulgarian propaganda postcard celebrating the fall of Ni\u0161 (1915)\nFerdinand I and Wilhelm II on the military parade in Ni\u0161, January 1916\nLoss of Ni\u0161 caused a mayor strategic tragedy for the defending Serbs. Bulgarian offensive cut off the retreat of the Serbian army towards Thessaloniki, where Entente army forces landed to support them. The remaining Serbian units ignominiously retreated behind the Morava river, where they were able to build defensive posts causing the Morava Offensive to end. Austro-Hungarian, German and Bulgarian armies were then pushing the Serbians further to Kosovo, in winter 1915/1916 to the mountains in Albania finally being evacuated to British-held Corfu island.\nFor the Central Powers capturing of Ni\u0161 had a huge strategic importance too. The Belgrade\u2013Sofia railway, which connection was cut by the Serbians because of outbreak of World War I in summer 1914, was now re-opened and regular train connections were established. This ment the re-opening the Berlin-Baghdad railway connection, allowing to send the troops and supplys from Germany of Austria-Hungary directly to Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire, cousing a significant advantage for Central Powers forces fighting on the Mesopotamian Front.\nVictory was massively praised and celebrated in Bulgaria as one",
    "Television channel\nTelevision Guyana, also known as TVG is a Guyanese over-the-air television network owned by the Ramroop Group of Companies, led by Dr. Ranjisinghi 'Bobby' Ramroop, the owner of Guyana Times and Radio Guyana. It is the oldest television channel in the country, descending from the former Vieira Communications Television.\nHistory\nVieira Communications Television\nVieira Communications Television started broadcasting in May 1980 under the initiative of Anthony Vieira, becoming the first television station in the country. Shortly before, the first television sets and video recorders were made available in Guyana in upper and middle class households. VCT had its transmitter located in Versailles on the west bank of the Demerara River. Initially, VCT delivered its signals by relaying American satellite television programs and later scramble the signal, selling it for a monthly fee, for which a descrambler was required. Only the elites bought descramblers, as the cost of such was high. The station broadcast on UHF channel 28 and at start it had a limited schedule, relaying popular American television series of the time such as Dallas, Charlie\u2019s Angels, Diff\u2019rent Strokes, The Jeffersons and The Love Boat among others. The legality of VCT led to debates on the subject, over times, writers to Stabroek News' letter column described it as a \"pirate\" station. Until the appearance of WRHM, it was the only television station in Guyana; WRHM when it opened was entirely free-to-air and did not rely on subscriptions.\nIn 1993, The Evening News premiered, airing weeknights at 7pm.\nVCT announced the end of its evening news bulletin on April 1, 1999, set to end by late June, due to lack of advertiser support. The newscast later continued due to circumstances beyond Vieira's control and viewer feedback. The bulletin was suspended in April 2000 for a one-month period, due to a rift between Vieira and VCT staff members over story payments. The aim of the suspension was to improve the quality of the newscast when it returned.\nThe lottery broadcasts moved to NCN Television who accepted a more attractive offer from the lottery board. This led to the beginning of VCT's downfall. After these events, Vieira lost control of the channel in 2007 after TBN shut down its operations in Guyana being sold to Hits and Jams TV, a private channel. The end of his relays of TBN negatively impacted its income.\nIn early 2009, VCT temporarily suspended 24-hour broadcasts due to electricity costs.\nTelevision Guyana\nOn June 5, 2009, Vieira, age 64, sold off VCT Network to the Ramroop Group, who launched The Guyana Times in 2008. The founder of the channel wanted to concentrate on \"less stressful\" assets he still had. VCT was being affected by the global financial crisis of the time and the state of the local advertising market, which for such a small population was being served by a large number of television channels. Unnamed Ramroop officials were expecting the channel to have a large makeover, with \u201cnew and exciting programs to Guyanese as they seek to enhance the quality of local television viewing\u201d. The name VCT was in the process of being scrapped.\nControversies\n2002 suspension of staff member\nIn May 2002, a member of the VCT Network staff was suspended from working at the channel for a period of one month, due to the airing of the Andrew Douglas tape. At the time, there were no guidelines set for the tape being considered \"illegal\".\nCriticism of ethnic domination of South Asians and Afro-Guyanans\nAnthony Vieira made critical remarks of other ethnic minorities in Guyana, specifically the African and Indian communities that dominated the country, in the third week of May 2004. The Advisory Committee on Broadcasting (ACB) in June demanded the suspension of VCT Network's license due to three related episodes. Vieira denied rumors of a possible closure of the station.\n",

She belonged to Frederick William Vanderbilt from 1891, and then to William Montagu, 9th Duke of Manchester from 1911. In the First World War the Admiralty requisitioned her as an armed yacht. In 1915 she was commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMY Conqueror II. The \"II\" was added to avoid confusion with the dreadnought battleship HMS\u00a0Conqueror. A German U-boat sank the yacht in 1916, killing 17 of her crew.\nBuilding and registration\nRussell & Co of Port Glasgow built the yacht as yard number 194, and launched her on 20 February 1889. Her lengths were 188.05\u00a0ft (57.32\u00a0m) overall and 177.0\u00a0ft (53.9\u00a0m) between perpendiculars. Her beam was 24.6\u00a0ft (7.5\u00a0m) and her depth was 13.5\u00a0ft (4.1\u00a0m). Her tonnages were 386\u00a0GRT and 175\u00a0NRT. She had a single screw, driven by a three-cylinder triple-expansion engine that was built by William King & Co of Glasgow, and rated at 92 NHP. She carried a lifeboat big enough to accommodate the entire crew, and also carried a steam launch and a \"naphtha launch\" (i.e. motorboat).\nRussell's built the yacht for William B Walker of Chislehurst in Kent, as a replacement for his previous yacht, Lady Aline, which the Admiralty had acquired from him in 1888. Walker intended to give his new yacht the same name, but he died in January 1889, shortly before she was launched.\nA Walter S Bailey of Kingston upon Hull bought the yacht, named her Conqueror, and registered her in Hull. Her UK official number was 95786, and her code letters were LCWM.\nImport duty court case\nFrederick W Vanderbilt in the 1890s\nIn May 1891 FW Vanderbilt bought the yacht for \u00a315,500, or about $75,000. That June he had her brought to New York via Halifax, Nova Scotia. He registered her in New York.\nBy 22 August 1891, a solicitor for the United States Department of the Treasury ruled that because she was an imported \"manufacture of iron\", the United States Customs Service should subject her to duty at 45 percent. On 27 August the revenue cutter W. E. Chandler took a USCS officer to Stapleton, Staten Island, where he boarded and seized Conqueror in lieu of $30,500 duty. That same day, Vanderbilt filed a libel in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Technically the lawsuit was against Conqueror, but in effect it was against the Collector of the Port of New York, Jacob Sloat Fassett.\nOn 19 October 1891, the Supreme Court of the United States granted William Howard Taft, Solicitor General of the United States, leave to file a petition for a writ to prohibit the Judge of the District Court from hearing Vanderbilt's libel. On 15 December the Supreme Court heard the application, with Taft representing the Federal Government, and Elihu Root representing Vanderbilt. On 11 January 1892 the Supreme Court found against Taft, which left the District Court free to hear Vanderbilt's libel. By 28 January the District Court had heard the case, and Judge Addison Brown had found in Vanderbilt's favour. Almost five years later, on 3 January 1897, the Supreme Court upheld the District Court's decision, and awarded Vanderbilt $21,742 in compensation.\nConqueror\nMrs FW Vanderbilt \nThe yacht included two cabins for Mr and Mrs Vanderbilt; three guest cabins; a \"grand saloon\"; a \"deck saloon\"; and a \"grand staircase\". A writing and smoking room was in a separate superstructure aft. The accommodation had electric lighting, and in the forward part of the yacht was an ice chest big enough to supply ice for two months. At the foot of the grand staircase was a closet for silver, and an arsenal of rifles and revolvers. The yacht carried a crew of 34.\nOn 28 January 1893, Conqueror left the Erie Dry Dock, Brooklyn, to begin a cruise from New York to the West Indies. Only the crew was aboard, as FW and Mrs Vanderbilt and their guests planned to travel in his private railroad car Mariquita to Brunswick, Georgia, where they were to board the yacht. Guests included Mr and Mrs Thomas H. Howard. The plan was to cruise to the Florida Keys, Nassau, Havana, and Port of Spain. The Vanderbilts planned to return to New York in mid-March.\nMr and Mrs Vanderbilt used Conqueror to entertain guests at Newport, Rhode Island, and to watch New York Yacht Club races. In March 1896, FW Vanderbilt ordered a new \"naphtha launch\" to carry aboard Conqueror as a replacement for her steam tender.\nPortrait of Cornelius Vanderbilt II in 1896 by Daniel Huntington\nIn July 1896 Cornelius Vanderbilt II, the eldest brother of FW Vanderbilt, suffered a stroke. Conqueror took him to Newport, where a rubber-tyred berline was used as an improvised ambulance to take him from the yacht to The Breakers.\nOn 10 June 1899, Conqueror left New York for a Mediterranean cruise. She took FW Vanderbilt and guests to 21 ports, including Marseille on 25 August. She returned to New",
    "Diasoma is a proposed clade of mollusks uniting the classes Scaphopoda and Bivalvia. Whether scaphopods and bivalves are each other's closest living relatives among mollusks is disputed, leaving the monophyly of Diasoma in doubt.\nDiasoma was originally proposed on morphological grounds by Bruce Runnegar and John Pojeta Jr., in 1974. The name means \"through-body\", referring to the relatively straight gut with a mouth at the anterior end and anus at the posterior end, contrasting with gastropods and cephalopods, in which the gut is more curved and the mouth and anus are usually much closer together. The grouping was accepted by many studies in the 1980s and 1990s, but a phylogenetic analysis of 18s rDNA conducted by Gerhard Steiner and Hermann Dreyer in 2003 found scaphopods to be more closely related to cephalopods than bivalves. A 2020 phylogenetic analysis by Kevin Kocot and colleagues found scaphopods to be more closely related to gastropods than bivalves. However, a molecular phylogenetic analysis published by Hao Song and colleagues in 2023 supports the monophyly of Diasoma.\nThe extinct rostroconchs, a group possibly ancestral to the Scaphopoda, are also considered to belong to Diasoma. Song and colleagues inferred that Diasoma originated approximately 520 million years ago, during the Cambrian period, and considered the earlier fossil genera Anabarella, Watsonella, and Mellopegma to be members of the diasome stem group.\n",

It is owned-and-operated by Grupo Rede Amaz\u00f4nica and was launched April 6, 2005 as the first television station in the interior of Roraima.\nIn 2013, the station's local programming was shuttered as part of a cost-cutting move done by Rede Amaz\u00f4nica but returned in 2023.\nHistory\nNearly three years after receiving authorization for VHF channel 11 in the municipality of Rorain\u00f3polis, on August 11, 2002, Rede Amaz\u00f4nica founded the first television station in the interior of Roraima. On April 6, 2005, TV Rorain\u00f3polis was opened. The station produced a local segment of Jornal de Roraima and news bulletins during programming.  The station replaced retransmitters of sister station TV Roraima in Rorain\u00f3polis.\nIn May 2009, TV Rorain\u00f3polis requested permission from the Regional Electoral Court of Roraima not to broadcast party political propaganda during the year, claiming that it did not have the technical capacity to generate and display the programs, despite broadcasting local commercials during programming. The request was accepted by the TRE judges.\nOn April 9, 2013, three days after the station's eighth anniversary celebrations, Rede Amaz\u00f4nica, through TV Roraima, announced the end of TV Rorain\u00f3polis' activities as a microgenerator, extinguishing local production. The reason would be the generation of local commercials, which is not allowed by Rede Globo for microgenerators not recognized in the Coverage Atlas, which was the case of the Rorain\u00f3polis station.\nThe station's transmission structure continued to operate as a repeater. The city now has only one correspondent reporter to send reports to TV Roraima and the interstate news programs of Rede Amaz\u00f4nica, produced by TV Amazonas.\nOn March 10, 2023, Rede Amaz\u00f4nica announced the reactivation of the TV Rorain\u00f3polis structure in the municipality, directing the station to cover five municipalities in the southern region of Roraima. The relaunch of the station was announced at an event that took place on the same day, with the presence of governor Antonio Denarium and mayors of the cities covered by Rede Amaz\u00f4nica Rorain\u00f3polis, in addition to executives from Grupo Rede Amaz\u00f4nica.\nThe station officially reopened on July 1, returning to insert local commercials after ten years. On July 3rd, the local edition of Jornal de Roraima 2nd Edition relaunched, presented by Carolina Fran\u00e7a. As with the group's other stations in the interior of the states, the news is generated in the Rede Amaz\u00f4nica studios in Manaus.\nTechnical information\nRede Amaz\u00f4nica received the concession to operate the digital signal on the Rorain\u00f3polis repeater through UHF channel 18.

Originally, the artist had planned to release an album titled Color of Happiness in 2023, but due to \"in-house reasons,\" he decided to create a new project, which became Maverick. The album explores personal themes related to family, life, and loss, reflecting on Kizz Daniel's experiences over the three years since his last release. As the title suggests, Maverick embodies Kizz Daniel's decision to create music on his own terms, combining introspective moments with his signature Afrobeats sound.\nSingles\nThe lead single \"Flex,\" was released on 26 February 2021 and was produced by DJ Coublon. The second single, \"Buga,\" features Tekno and was produced by Blaisebeatz, Yung Willis and Reward Beatz. Kizz Daniel announced the release of \"Buga\" on Instagram on the day of 4 May 2022, offering a \u20a61,000,000 prize for the best Buga video content, with fans serving as the judges. He encouraged followers to participate and provided the link to the song in his bio. The third single \"Cough (Odo)\" was released on 14 October 2022, and was the lead single off the Empire Distribution compilation album, Where We Come From, Vol. 01 (2022). The song was produced by Blaisebeatz with uncredited production from Philkeyz. The fourth single off Maverick, \"RTID (Rich Till I Die)\" was released on 6 January 2023, with production from Reward Beatz and Blaisebeatz, and a video directed by TG Omori that reached over 1.7 million views in the span of three days. The Reward Beatz-produced fifth single off Maverick, \"Shu-Peru,\" was released on 12 May 2023, and was mixed and mastered by Jaycen Joshua. The sixth single is the remix of the third single, \"Cough (Odo),\" and was remixed with Becky G on 21 July 2023. The seventh single off the album \"My G\" was released on 9 October 2023 with a TG Omori-directed music video.\nCritical reception\nThe album received mixed reviews from critics. Adeayo Adebiyi of Pulse Nigeria critiqued Maverick for lacking artistic depth, variety, and excitement, calling it a monotonous experience. While praising the album's opener \"Red & Green\" and some moments like \"Feran You Two,\" Adebiyi found the project to be disappointingly unvaried across its 20 tracks. He gave the album a rating of 5.5/10, labeling it \"average.\" Patrick Ezema of Afrocritik described Maverick as an uncertain and directionless album, noting that Kizz Daniel struggles to evolve musically. While the album has its good moments, the writing often falls flat, and the music feels repetitive. Ezema summarized, \u201cUltimately, Maverick fails to find its footing.\u201d He also gave the album a rating of 5.5/10.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nOluwatobiloba \"Kizz Daniel\" Anidugbe \u2013 vocals, writer, executive producer\nAugustine \"Tekno\" Kelechi \u2013 vocals, writer\nEmeka \"Blaqbonez\" Akumefule \u2013 vocals, writer\nRebbeca \"Becky G\" Gomez \u2013 vocals, writer\nChike Osebuka \u2013 vocals, writer\nPromise \"Pryme\" Nwabueke - vocals, writer\nLukman \"Not3s\" Odunaike - vocals, writer\nYemi Alade - vocals, writer\nJohn \"Young Jonn\" Udomboso - vocals, writer\nNomcebo Zikode - vocals, writer\nNonso \"DJ Big N\" Ajufo - vocals, writer\nJohn \"Johnny Drille\" Ighodaro \u2013 vocals, writer, producer\nAkwuba Charles Ugochukwu \u2013 producer, writer\nMarcel \"Blaisebeatz\" Akunwata \u2013 producer\nPhilip \"Philkeyz\" Chukwuka \u2013 producer\nDennis \"DeeYasso\" Yasso - producer\nDaniel \"Yung Willis\" Williams - producer\nGodwin \"Shugavibez\" Ifeanyi - producer\nOlawale \"Reward Beatz\" Isaac - producer\nMbah \"Xtofa\" Christoper - producer\nJoseph \"Roc Legion\" Watchorn - producer\nJohn \"M.O.G.

A longtime aide to Patrick Leahy during Leahy's career as a prosecutor and U.S. senator, Rouille served as United States Marshal for the District of Vermont from 1994 to 1999.\nEarly life\nJohn Edward Rouille was born in Burlington, Vermont on February 7, 1932, the son of John Oliver Rouille and Beatrice Evelyn (Barber) Rouille. He was raised and educated in Burlington, and attended Burlington High School. He left high school early to join the military during the Korean War. Rouille enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve in 1950 and spent 18 months on active duty before returning to Vermont. He served in reserve units in Vermont, Massachusetts, and New York until 1958, and attained the rank of corporal.\nCareer\nAfter returning from his active military service, Rouille completed his high school education at Burlington High School in 1952. He subsequently completed courses at Champlain College in Burlington. At the start of his career, he worked for several Burlington-area companies, including General Electric (1952 to 1955, 1960 to 1963), the Tulatex Corporation (1955 to 1960), and the Bader Company (1970 to 1972). He was employed by the Burlington Police Department (BPD) from 1964 to 1965, and again from 1972 to 1975. During his second stint with the BPD, he was assigned as an investigator in the office of Patrick Leahy, the state's attorney of Chittenden County.\nWhen Leahy was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1974, he hired Rouille as a member of his staff, responsible for liaison activity on veterans and military issues. In 1994, Leahy announced his intent to recommend Leo P. Blais of Essex as Vermont's U.S. Marshal, succeeding Christian Hansen Jr. When Blais withdrew from consideration, Leahy recommended Rouille, who briefly served as acting marshal while awaiting confirmation. President Bill Clinton made the appointment, which was subsequently confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Rouille served until retiring in November 1999, and was succeeded by John H. Sinclair.\nLater life\nAfter retiring, Rouille continued to reside in Burlington. He volunteered for several organizations and causes, including St. Anthony Christ the King church, South Burlington's Vet Center, and Toys for Tots.\nHe died in Burlington on May 28, 2024. Rouille was buried at New Mount Calvary Cemetery in Burlington.\nFamily\nOn August 1, 1953, Rouille married Joyce Marcy LaVallee (April 22, 1934\u2013March 8, 2012). They were the parents of five children: Mary Patricia, Kathleen, Gregory, Melinda, and Jay.\n",
    "Italian soldier (1789\u20131865)\nGiovanni Timoteo Calosso or Calasso (24 January 1789 \u2013 27 March 1865), also known as R\u00fcstem Bey, was an Italian soldier. Calosso saw action in multiple countries under the army of Napoleon Bonaparte. Shortly before Napoleon's fall, Calosso returned to his native Turin and served in the Royal Sardinian Army until the Carbonari uprising. After traveling to multiple countries, Calosso ended up in the Ottoman Empire and served Sultan Mahmud II for 13 years. He was, for some time, at the forefront of Ottoman-Sardinian relations. Giuseppe Garibaldi, one of the founding fathers of Italy, had close relations with Calosso when he lived in Istanbul.\nEarly life and career\nChildhood and education\nCalosso was born to a family of humble origins in Chivasso, a comune within Turin, Kingdom of Sardinia on 24 January 1789. He was baptised at the Collegiate Church of Santa Maria Assunta. His godfather was architect of Verolengo, Giovanni Comoglio, and his godmother was Comoglio's sister, Caterina. Calosso had seven siblings; four male, three female. His father died in 1795 when he was six years old. Calosso's widowed mother struggled to keep his father's business afloat while simultaneously raising eight children.\nDespite the family's financial setbacks, Calosso enrolled at the age of 10 in a boarding school (now Liceo Newton). After becoming familiar with Latin and French in the school, at the age of 15 his mother tried to convince him to start a career in commerce. Heavily inspired by the Napoleonic era, Calosso instead wanted to pursue a military career characterised by glory. In 1805, he read a bulletin released by the Grande Arm\u00e9e. This cemented his desire to enter into the military, prompting him to leave his family behind on 5 August 1806, at the age of 17, to serve in the Napoleonic army at Pinerolo and Bassano del Grappa. A fit and tall man, he was immediately accepted and trained by officers who saw potential in him.\nNapoleonic wars\nCalosso was sent to participate in the War of the Fourth Coalition against Prussia in early 1807. Crossing the Vistula, he made his way to Elbing in Prussian-occupied Poland. He acted as a Latin translator between army officials and Polish priests in this journey. From there, the army marched on to Finckenstein Palace, where Napoleon (a fellow ethnic Italian and Lombard) would supervise them. At a ceremony held in the premises of the palace, near the Emperor was a Turkish dignitary wearing a large turban. Calosso would later write in his memoirs, \"Who would have thought then that twenty years later I would wear the turban in the service of Sultan Mahmoud?\". In 1809, during the War of the Fifth Coalition, Calosso was promoted to brigadier. By the next year, he was made mar\u00e9chal des logis.\nFinckenstein Palace\nOften under the command of Napoleon and Horace Sebastiani during his time in the French army (in cavalry units), Calosso participated in four wars for the country; the War of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Coalitions, as well as the French Invasion of Russia. He was also present at the Battle of Leipzig as aide-de-camp to Sebastiani. Thus, Calosso's service in the French army saw him travel thousands of miles from the Po to the Dnieper.\nBattle of Leipzig\nReturn to Sardinia\nShortly before the fall of Napoleon, Calosso resigned from the French military on 20 August 1814. Returning to his homeland, he reunited with his family and saw his sergeant brother, Probo, who he had coincidentally come across previously during the disastrous Battle of Berezina. He had also met his sister, Camilla, who married a sapper, Santa. Soon after his arrival, Calosso attempted to join the Sardinian army, but was unable to as only nobles could be recruited as officers. As a result, he remained as King Victor Emmanuel I's farrier until March 1815 when he was made trumpeter.\nCarbonari uprising and exile\nIn 1821, Calosso participated in the Carbonari uprising, a nationalistic movement that demanded a new constitution and the establishment of a parliament. During the revolt, King Victor Emmanuel I abdicated in favour of his brother, Charles Felix of Sardinia, who with Austrian military intervention managed to squash the rebellion on 8 April. Excommunicated and forced to abandon his wife, Secondina Tarino Imperiali (d. 23 September 1858), and his son Emilio, Calosso entered into exile to avoid imprisonment for his role in the uprising.\nHangings of the main Carbonari leaders, Michele Morelli and Giuseppe Silvati in Naples\nGreek War of Independence\nLike other exiles, Calosso remained a wanderer, traveling and offering his services to multiple countries such as France, Switzerland, Spain, Belgium and England between 1821 and 1826. In 1826, he embarked on a ship from England to Nauplia with other exiled Italians from the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies led by Lieutenant Colonel Pisa. There in Ottoman Greece, he fought for the cause of the Greek independence. However, during his short service, he",

The museum was officially established in 1946 under the name of the City Museum of Sremska Mitrovica shortly after the end of World War II in Yugoslavia and the liberation from the Axis occupation of Vojvodina.\nThe founding of the museum was closely linked to archaeological findings from the Roman city of Sirmium. The museum initially opened as the Museum of Church Art on May 1, 1946, focusing on rich religious heritage of the city. By November 23, 1946, it became a comprehensive museum with archaeological, ethnographic, historical, art, and natural history collections.  The museum's first exhibition opened to the public on May 31, 1948, while the current name of the institution was introduced in 1952.\nHistory\nThe need to establish a museum in Sremska Mitrovica arose in the second half of the 19th century, as many artifacts from the ancient city of Sirmium were being transferred to other museums in cities like Zagreb, Budapest and Vienna. In 1869, the researcher Feliks Kanitz initiated the formation of the \"Sirmium\" society, aiming to collect old monuments and lay the groundwork for a museum. The museum was first established in June 1885 by the city's mayor \u0106ira pl. Mileki\u0107, although it did not initially have a permanent location. Roman stone monuments were at the time displayed in the city park. The Museum of Church Art was the first to open in the Old Serbian Church. The Church Art museum was at the time one of the first of its kind in Democratic Federative Yugoslavia and opened formally on June 30, 1946. The establishment of the church art museum was followed by the founding of the City Museum on November 23, 1946. In November 1946, the Museum of Church Art was integrated into the City Museum, with Branko Vasili\u0107, an architect and voluntary associate, playing a key role in its development.\nSee also\nList of museums in Serbia\nHistorical Archive of Srem",

    "\nThe Cotton Management Company (French: Compagnie de G\u00e9rance du Coton, COGERCO), is a state-owned cotton company in Bujumbura, Burundi. \nBackground\nThe Belgian colonial regime introduced cotton cultivation to Burundi in the 1920s in the Imbo natural region at altitudes of 800\u20131,100 metres (2,600\u20133,600\u00a0ft). \nCotton was considered the most import export crop after coffee.\nIn 1924, Law No. 52 compelled each family to grow 10\u201315 acres (4.0\u20136.1\u00a0ha) of cotton.\nThis was increased in 1935 to 40 acres (16\u00a0ha) for a married person and 20 acres (8.1\u00a0ha) for a single person.\nIn the 1950s research in the Moso natural region began in the Ruyigi and Rutana prefectures.\nYields were low and transport to Bujumbura for processing would be expensive, so the trials were soon abandoned.\nEarly years\nCOGERCO was established in 1947 as the Cotton Reserves Management Committee (Comit\u00e9 de G\u00e9rance des R\u00e9serves Cotonni\u00e8res) to serve the Belgian Congo, Rwanda and Burundi. \nThe Congo withdrew in 1961 and Rwanda in 1967.\nCOGERCO concentrated on collection and popularization of Burundian cotton seed.\nThe industrial and commercial functions were handled by RUZIZI, a private company.\nRUZIZI was nationalized in 1977, and COGERCO took over the processing and marketing functions.\nCOGERCO arranged for cotton to be planted, grown and harvested.\nCOGERCO's cotton gin separated fiber, sent to the textile company COTEBU, from seed, which accounted for about 54% by weight.\nAround 10% of the seed was retained for propagation of cotton, and the remainder was blown through a seed transport pipe to Rafina, which made cottonseed oil and other products.\nCOTEBU used the fiber to produce excellent quality cotton textiles, and won first place in an industry competition in Madrid, Spain, in 1982.\nCOGERCO also delivered fiber to smaller companies included the UPC factory which manufactured medical wadding, gauze bandages and sanitary napkins, Quami Freres, which manufactured sewing thread for clothing workshops and LOVINCO, which produced and marketed blankets.\nDecree-Law No. 100/81 of 19 June 1984 changed the name of COGERCO to Compagnie de G\u00e9rance du Coton (Cotton Management Company) and made it a state-owned industriel and commercial establishment to promote cultivation of cotton, support cotton producers, process cotton seed into cotton fiber and market the fiber and its derivatives.\nAn American \"Continental Eagle\" plant was purchased in 1987, capable of processing 120 tonnes of cotton seed per day.\nTrials in the Moso region were revived in the 1980s when the government, looking for new sources of foreign exchange, asked COGERCO and the Institute of Agronomic Sciences of Burundi (ISABU) to again study the cotton potential of Moso.\nTrials were conducted in the Makamba, Rutana and Ruyigi provinces at altitudes of 1,100\u20131,400 metres (3,600\u20134,600\u00a0ft).\nBased on results, COGERCO cautiously launched commercial cotton growing in Rutana in 1985.\nSome cotton was grown by farmers on their land, and some was grown on land owned by COGERCO.\nCotton production peaked in 1993 when 27,000 producers supplied 8,813 tonnes of cotton bolls, yielding 3,500 tonnes of fiber.\nDecline\nWith the political crisis of 1993 the cotton crop was gradually abandoned by farmers, and replaced by more profitable food crops.\nQuantities of textile produced by COTEBU dropped from 10,579,591 metres (34,709,944\u00a0ft) in 1989 to 4,901,301 metres (16,080,384\u00a0ft) in 1993. \n4,838,907 metres (15,875,679\u00a0ft) were produced in 2000, rising to 7,264,798 metres (23,834,639\u00a0ft) in 2005.\nCOTEBU closed down in 2006 and 2007, and dismissed almost 1,600 workers.\nIts successor, Afritextile, was launched that year.\nIn November 2014 the general manager of Cogerco said annual cotton production was now rarely more than 2,300 tonnes.\nAfter the 1993 crisis, large parts of Cogerco's cotton reserves were taken for other purposes, and the area of Cogerco reserves and peasant farms used for cotton had dropped from 8,000 to 2,000 hectares (19,800 to 4,900 acres).\nFarmers preferred to grow food stocks, which were worth much more than cotton.\nIn September 2015 the international price of cotton had dropped significantly.\nCogerco continued to lose land, with most of the remaining cotton grown in Cibitoke Province.\nAfritextile sometimes delayed their purchase of cotton, causing cash flow problems.\nLack of electricity was a serious problem for their factory.\nCogerco was also negotiating with Rafina.\nRafina refined the seeds to make cottonseed oil, oilcakes, and mushroom fertilizer.\n2,500 tonnes of seed were produced in 2018, but in 2019 and 2020 there was heavy flooding, and yields were 873 and 777 tonnes of seed.\nCogerco produced 1,010 tonnes of cotton during the 2020-2021 growing season.\nAs of 2021 the \"Continental Eagle\" was COGERCO's only plant, now supported by Bajaj Steels Industries of Nagpur, India.\nCOGERCO was selling cotton fiber to Afritextile and  cotton seeds to the Rafina refinery.\nHowever, it could not meet the demands ",

    "Marble sculpture by Donatello\nFor Donatello's bronze statue, see David (Donatello, bronze).\nDavid is a marble statue of the biblical hero by the Italian Renaissance sculptor Donatello. One of his early works (1408\u20131409), it was originally commissioned by the Operai del Duomo, the  Overseers of the Office of Works, for the Florence Cathedral and was his most important commission up to that point. In 1416, the Signoria of Florence ordered the statue to be sent to the Palazzo della Signoria (now known as the Palazzo Vecchio), where it held both a religious and political significance. As part of its relocation, Donatello was asked to make adjustments to the David.\nTypical of the International Gothic style, the marble piece is noted as not being representative of the approach Donatello had toward his work as he matured. The statue is also clothed, unlike the nearly nude bronze figure of David which Donatello sculpted circa the 1440s. The latter became more widely known than his marble piece; both are now in the Museo Nazionale del Bargello in Florence.\nHistory\nBiblical background\nDonatello's statue depicts David in the story of David and Goliath from the Books of Samuel, specifically 1 Samuel 17. In the biblical narrative, the Israelites are fighting the Philistines, whose champion \u2013 Goliath \u2013 repeatedly offers to meet the Israelites' best warrior in single combat to decide the whole battle. None of the trained Israelite soldiers are brave enough to fight the giant Goliath, yet David, a shepherd boy who is too young to be a soldier, accepts the challenge. Saul, the king of Israel, offers David armour and weapons, but the boy is untrained and refuses them. Instead, he goes out with his sling and confronts Goliath before hitting the giant in the head with a stone and knocking him down. He then grabs Goliath's sword and cuts off his head, causing the Philistines to withdraw as agreed, and saving the Israelites. David's special strength comes from God, and the story illustrates the triumph of good over evil. According to Olszewski, David's triumph over Goliath has been interpreted as a \"parallel of Christ's triumph\" over the devil.\nCommission\nIn 1408, the Operai del Duomo commissioned the statue. At the time, Donatello was twenty-two and had been active in the workshop of Lorenzo Ghiberti. Donatello's earliest known important commission, the marble David statue was to be placed on the tribune of the dome at one of the buttresses on the north side of Florence Cathedral. Nanni di Banco was commissioned to carve a companion piece, a statue of equal size depicting the prophet Isaiah. One or the other of the statues was lifted into place in 1409, but at just under two meters high, was found to be too small to be easily visible from the ground and was taken down; both statues then languished in the Opera del Duomo, the workshop of the Duomo for several years. \nAccording to Caglioti et al., it is possible that it was Donatello's David raised on the north tribune of the Cathedral and removed soon afterward. As the removal occurred on 3 July 1409, it might have been erected on the feast day of John the Baptist (24 June), the patron saint of the city. It is also possible that instead it was di Banco's sculpture of Isaiah that was placed on the tribune.\nH. W. Janson, in his monograph on Donatello (1963), made his case that the marble David was indeed the statue commissioned by the Operai in 1408 to accompany the Isaiah carved by di Banco, a point disputed by some historians. On 3 July 1409, the Operai decided to remove the statue of a prophet that had been installed \"near the dome\", an action later recorded by Italian historian Giovanni Poggi. Therefore, it appears that one of the two statues had actually been placed on the buttress. Because Donatello's David had been completed only three weeks prior, this must have been the Isaiah. Janson never doubted that the Bargello David was the result of the 1408 commission, concluding that the youthful Donatello had miscalculated the visibility of his sculpture when viewed from street level ninety feet below. Olszewski opines that whether or not it was ever installed in that location is unclear, but in any case it was promptly returned to the Operai del Duomo and replaced by Donatello's Joshua, a colossus in terracotta.\nExecution and design\nDetails of the marble David (top) and the head of Goliath (bottom)\nAmy Bloch observes that a number of arguments have been made concerning the manner of the execution of Donatello's marble David. Some authors declare that it was carved circa 1409 and altered by Donatello in 1416, before it was moved to the Palazzo della Signoria. Others, such as Manfred Wundram, argue that it was always intended for placement in the palace. He speculates that Donatello carved the Bargello David particularly for the governmental palace and sculpted the Isaiah around 1409.\nThe marble piece is a work closely tied to tradition, revealing few signs of the innovative appr",
    "\nHolder Mathias Architects Limited, often simply known as Holder Mathias or Holder Mathias Architects, is an architectural firm and private limited company based in London, England. The firm was founded in 1969, in Cardiff, Wales, by architects Peter Mathias and Tim Holder as the Holder and Mathias Partnership. It has been responsible for the Atlantic Wharf development, the eastern portion of the Cardiff Bay redevelopment project, including Crickhowell House and the Red Dragon Centre, and other projects in the United Kingdom and Europe.\nHolder Mathias has an American subsidiary, Taylor Clark Architects, which it uses as its international arm.\nHistory\nTim Holder and Peter Mathias founded the Holder and Mathias Partnership in Cardiff, Wales, in 1969. The firm was originally based from Holder's home in Rumney, in an office above his garage. In an interview with the South Wales Echo from 1987, Holder stated that the duo initially planned for the firm to become a \"medium-sized firm for Cardiff\" with 20 employees. In 1970, the firm was relocated to offices in Four Elms Road, Cardiff, where the duo were then joined by a third partner, Bryan Alcock. In the late 1970s, the firm acquired Associated Dairies, then a minor but growing dairy company in Leeds, England. Associated Dairies later became the supermarket chain Asda, with the firm's work expanding to cover several towns and retail projects across the United Kingdom as a result. The firm continued to expand significantly over the rest of the decade, which led to the opening of an office in London in 1978. By 1987, the firm had grown to 160 employees, with 95 of these based in London and 65 based in Cardiff. By this time, it had been the architect of 15 Asda stores, Prince Philip Hospital in Llanelli, Cromwell Hospital in London, a military hospital in Saudi Arabia, two projects in the London Docklands at a cost of \u00a380 million, and Cardiff's Leckwith development.\nIn 1984, the firm put forward a successful bid to redevelop the derelict Bute East Dock area of Cardiff, which would become the first part of the wider Cardiff Bay redevelopment project. Later known as the Atlantic Wharf development, Mathias, Holder and Alcock designed the project at a cost of \u00a350 million. In 1987, the firm purchased the area's abandoned bonded warehouse, which it restored and redeveloped into its new headquarters and the centre of the new development, becoming the first firm to relocate to the Cardiff Bay redevelopment area. During the same period, the firm expanded its operations in London. As a result, it was commissioned to deliver multiple residential developments, such as the Free Trade Wharf. The firm later designed the eastern portion of the wider Cardiff Bay redevelopment project, designing and constructing more than 30 projects in the area over the next two decades. Such projects included the Red Dragon Centre, Crickhowell House and the Atradius building. In the 1980s, it also formed an American subsidiary and international arm, Taylor Clark Architects, to compete internationally.\nThe firm continued to design several major projects in the early 1990s, most notably the Oasis Holiday Village development in Cumbria for Centre Parcs, which became another regular client of the firm. Other clients included 3M, Sony and Hewlett Packard, with the firm active in the London Docklands, the Roath basin and Cardiff. In the late 1990s, the firm expanded its operations into Europe, establishing an architectural partnership in Munich, Germany, in 1999 and participating in multiple retail developments throughout the continent. Developments from the firm in the UK included the St Stephen's shopping centre in Hull, which costed \u00a390 million, and several projects for Centre Parcs in Woburn and Cumbria. Co-founder Peter Mathias announced his retirement in 2013.\nOrganisation\nHolder Mathis is registered in England and Wales as a private limited company, with architectural activities as its stated nature of business. It was originally named the Holder and Mathias Partnership from 1969, but changed its name to Filbuk 98 Limited in March 1987. In July 1987, its name was again changed to Holder Mathias Limited, before the firm reverted to Holder and Mathias Partnership Limited later that month. It changed its name again in October 1987, becoming Holder Mathias Alcock PLC, which remained its name until October 2002. In October 2002, its name was changed to Holder Mathias Architects PLC. Since 2009, it has been named Holder Mathias Architects Limited. The firm aims to follow three main principles in its architectural work, profit, service and good design, in that order.\n",

    "Genus of lichens\nPyrenothrix is a small genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Pyrenotrichaceae. It comprises two species of filamentous lichens, which are organisms formed by a symbiotic relationship between fungi and photosynthetic partners. The genus is characterized by its unique structure, featuring densely arranged filaments composed of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) wrapped in fungal threads. Pyrenothrix species form dark greyish-brown growths on various surfaces, with one species found on tree bark and the other on leaves in tropical forests. The genus was circumscribed in 1917 by American scientist Lincoln Ware Riddle, based on specimens collected in Florida. Pyrenothrix is distinguished from other lichens by its intricate cellular structure and reproductive features, including specialized spore-producing structures.\nTaxonomy\nThe genus was circumscribed in 1917 by the American lichenologist Lincoln Ware Riddle, with P.\u00a0nigra assigned as the type, and at the time, only species in the genus. A second species was added in 2005. The oldest lichenized fungal type specimen in the fungal, lichen, and myxomycete collections of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill herbarium is Pyrenothrix nigra, collected by Roland Thaxter in Florida in 1897. This material was originally found growing on the bark of scrub oaks at West Palm Beach, Florida.\nLichenothrix is a genus that was proposed by Aino Henssen in 1964, but it has since been folded into synonymy with Pyrenothrix.\nDescription\nSpecies of Pyrenothrix are characterized by their unique morphology and structure, which sets them apart from other lichen genera. The thallus of Pyrenothrix species is composed of densely arranged, appressed filaments that are not conglutinated. These filaments form a continuous layer that can extend up to 100\u00a0mm across in some species. The overall appearance of the thallus is dark greyish brown, though individual filaments appear yellowish to light olive brown under microscopic examination. A distinctive feature of Pyrenothrix is the structure of its photobiont association. The filaments are formed by photobiont threads of Scytonema (a genus of cyanobacteria) wrapped in a sheath of fungal hyphae. This close association creates the characteristic appearance of the lichen thallus. The photobiont cells, when extruded from their gelatinous sheath, appear bluish-green and are typically applanate to rectangular in shape.\nThe fungal hyphae forming the sheath around the photobiont filaments have a unique structure. They are greatly branched and anastomosing, creating a network that at first glance may appear to form a closed, almost paraplectenchymatous layer. However, closer examination reveals that they consist of distinct, septate hyphae. The individual cells of these hyphae are often curved and terminally inflated, which may represent haustoria. The ascomata of Pyrenothrix are perithecioid, appearing as sessile structures on the thallus. They are spherical to pear-shaped with a short neck, and their color matches the dark greyish brown of the thallus. The size of the perithecia varies between species, ranging from 0.13 to 0.17\u00a0mm in diameter in P.\u00a0mexicana to 0.2\u20130.3\u00a0mm in P.\u00a0nigra.\nThe excipulum (peridium) of the perithecia is relatively thin, measuring 10\u201315\u00a0\u03bcm in P.\u00a0mexicana and 15\u201325\u00a0\u03bcm in P.\u00a0nigra. It has a distinctive structure consisting of several layers. The innermost 2\u20133 layers are composed of very narrow, thin-walled, and periclinally elongate, almost hyaline cells. The median 1\u20132 layers consist of broader, rather large, thick-walled, and strongly pigmented cells. The outermost 2\u20133 layers are made up of isodiametric to irregular, thin-walled, and paler cells. This layered structure contributes to the unique characteristics of the Pyrenothrix perithecia.\nThe asci (spore-bearing cells) in Pyrenothrix are fissitunicate, broadly clavate to saccate in shape. They produce eight ascospores per ascus. The ascospores are fusiform and septate, with the septation pattern differing between species. In P.\u00a0mexicana, the ascospores are transversally 3-septate, while in P.\u00a0nigra, they are (sub)muriform with (3\u2013)5 transversal and 0\u20131 longitudinal septa per segment. This unique combination of morphological and anatomical features distinguishes Pyrenothrix from other lichen genera and contributes to its classification within the Pyrenotrichaceae.\nPhotobiont associations\nThe photobiont of Pyrenothrix nigra has a filamentous cyanobacterial structure with double-false branching, a characteristic traditionally associated with the genus Scytonema. However, research by Robert L\u00fccking and colleagues has suggested that the photobiont might actually belong to the genus Rhizonema. This proposition is considered plausible due to ongoing debates about the reliability of branching patterns as a distinguishing feature between Scytonema and Rhizonema.\nRhizonema, a recently resurrected cyanobacterial genus, was established to classify filament",

    "2004 double murder of an elderly couple in Alabama\nOn June 24, 2004, 87-year-old Floyd Hill and his 72-year-old wife Vera Hill were both attacked and murdered in Guin, Alabama, United States, by an intruder who bludgeoned them severely before stealing $140 and prescription drugs from the couple. Floyd was mortally wounded and died on the scene; Vera survived until September 12, 2004, when she died of complications resulting from her injuries.\nThe Hills' 30-year-old neighbour, Jamie Ray Mills, was arrested and charged with murdering the couple. Mills was found guilty of the double murder and sentenced to death in 2007, while Mills's wife was similarly convicted of murder but jailed for life. Jamie Mills remained on death row for about 17 years before he was executed on May 30, 2024.\nDouble murder\nAt the time of the murder, the Hills were both present at home when they were approached by Jamie Ray Mills, who was accompanied by his wife JoAnn Mills. Jamie and JoAnn Mills had just completed an overnight drug use session, in which they smoked methamphetamine together. Mills reportedly asked the Hills if he and his wife could borrow their phone. The couple allowed the couple into their house.  \nSome time after gaining entry into the home of the Hills, Jamie Mills attacked the couple by bludgeoning them with a machete, tire tool and ballpeen hammer. Mills assaulted Floyd Hill first, while the latter was talking to him in the shed, just as the women were walking back to the porch. Mills then carried out a vicious assault on Vera, who had turned back to the shed after hearing the assault on her husband. Mills and his wife ransacked the house and stole some prescription drugs and $140 before they leaving the house.\nAfter the attack, the Hills' children and grandchildren, who were unable to reach the couple by phone, lodged a police report, and Guin police officer Larry Webb arrived at the Hills' home shortly after dark. He inspected the house after there was no response to his calls and knocks, and discovered the bodies of the couple inside the padlocked shed. \nFloyd Hill was mortally wounded and died at the scene. Vera was still alive but sustained severe head and neck injuries. Despite timely medical intervention, she later died. The autopsies separately conducted on both Floyd and Vera confirmed that both the Hills died from blunt and sharp force trauma; a trauma surgeon from the University of Alabama Hospital testified that Vera would have died within hours if she had not received the treatment she was given on the day of the murder.\nTrial process and appeals\nJamie and JoAnn Mills were arrested a day after the double murder, and were later tried before separate courts.\nIn August 2007, Jamie Mills was tried before a jury at an Alabama state court on two counts of capital murder. Mills's wife, who was called as a witness, testified that she saw her husband wielding a hammer and battering the elderly couple to death. At the end of the trial, Mills was found guilty of both counts of murder by the jury. The sentencing hearing ended with the 12-member jury deciding that, based on a majority opinion of 11 to one, Mills should be sentenced to death for the double murder.\nIt was revealed after the trial of Jamie Mills that his wife JoAnn, who originally faced the same charges of capital murder as her husband, agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges of murder, provided that she turned state evidence against her husband. After admitting to her role in the murders, JoAnn was sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole. The earliest date for a parole hearing is December 2027.\nAfter his trial, Jamie Mills appealed several times to higher courts (both state and federal) against his death sentence, maintaining he was innocent and arguing that the plea bargain with his wife might have caused his wife to lie about his involvement in the murders. All of the appeals were rejected, including those in 2006, 2008 and 2016.\nDeath warrant\nOn January 31, 2024, less than a week after the state conducted its first execution via nitrogen gas inhalation, the Alabama Attorney General\u2019s Office filed a motion to the Alabama Supreme Court, seeking approval to schedule a date of execution for Jamie Mills. Unlike the previous execution of Kenneth Eugene Smith, the state asked to carry out the death sentence of Mills via the primary method of lethal injection. In the same state, another lethal injection execution was scheduled for July 18, 2024.\nOn March 21, 2024, the Alabama Supreme Court approved the death warrant on Mills, and directed the state's governor Kay Ivey to schedule his execution date. Six days later, on March 27, 2024, the tentative execution date of Mills was slated as May 30, 2024.\nBy May 16, 2024, two weeks before he was executed, Mills had filed last-minute appeals, hoping to delay his execution. His appeals centered on his claims of innocence and opposition to \"torturous\" execution procedures.\nU.S. District Jud",

    "Telluride mineral\nVolynskite (Russian: \u0412\u043e\u043b\u044b\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0301\u0442), is a rare hydrothermal mineral of the sulfide class (the matildite\u00a0 group), that forms microscopic grains in related minerals, which in composition is a complex bismuth-silver telluride with the calculated formula AgBiTe2.\nVolynskite was first discovered and identified between 1960 and 1965 by Marianna Bezsmertnaya and Lada Soboleva who observed thin sections among closely related tellurides in the territory of the Zod gold deposit.  It was named in honor of the late professor of mineralogy and head of the mineralogy department at the Institute of Mineralogy, Geochemistry and Crystal Chemistry of Rare Elements\u00a0, Igor Volynsky, who had died suddenly in September 1962.:\u200a3\u200a\nDiscovery history and name\nFor the first time, a new previously unknown mineral (the future volynskite) was encountered by M. S. Bezsmertnaya and Sh. O. Amirayan during a microscopic study of samples from the Sotk gold mine and was initially mistaken for wehrlite.:\u200a143\u200a In the course of further research conducted in 1960\u20131963, it was established that, based on a combination of chemical, X-ray, and optical characteristics, this mineral differs from all natural tellurium compounds described in the literature and represents a new, independent mineral species.:\u200a129\u200a\nIn 1960, when the composition of the mineral had not yet been precisely determined, studies were conducted using the local microspectral analysis method using N. V. Korolev's setup. The future volynskite was removed on one plate with tellurobismuthite, which was closely intergrown with it, and the analysis conditions for both minerals were identical. The closeness of the elemental composition of volynskite to tellurobismuthite made it possible to at least approximately estimate the content of individual elements in it. Based on the results of microsample analysis, it was established that the main elements included in the composition of volynskite are silver, bismuth, and tellurium.:\u200a134\u200a\nIn the same 1960, similar studies were conducted by Z. M. Sverdlov on a microspectral setup at A.P. Karpinsky Russian Geological Research Institute\u00a0 (VSEGEI). The same elements were identified in the composition of the new mineral. A year later, at the personal request of Marianna Bezsmertnaya, a more detailed quantitative microspectral analysis of the future volynskite was conducted by N. V. Korolev at the State Optical Institute in Leningrad. Two closely related tellurides were used as standards for calculating the mineral formula: tellurobismuthite (Bi2Te3) and hessite (Ag2Te). Before filing an application for registration of the new mineral, a total of 11 microspectral and 7 X-ray analyses were conducted. Based on the results of the study, the formula of volynskite was finally established as AgBiTe2, close within the error limits to the synthetic compound AgBiTe2.:\u200a134,\u200a140\u200a\nIn 1962, also at the request of researchers, an artificial compound of the composition AgBiTe2 was synthesized by A. Yu. Malevsky in the experimental laboratory of IMGRE from stoichiometric quantities of its three constituent elements. The synthesis was carried out for five hours at temperatures of 1000-1400\u00a0\u00b0C, followed by quenching for one and a half hours from 400\u00b0 in an open furnace with free access to air. According to the chemical composition, optical and X-ray data, a fundamental similarity was noted between the low-temperature modification of AgBiTe2 obtained at the Institute of Semiconductors, the main phase of the compound synthesized by A. Yu. Malevsky and the mineral under study.:\u200a131\u2013132\u200a\nSpecific difficulties in studying the new mineral were primarily related to the lack of any massive samples that would allow determination using qualitative analysis. As a result, the authors of the future discovery repeatedly checked and rechecked the results obtained using different methods.\nIn the studied samples it was possible to observe it only under a microscope in the form of inclusions up to 0.3 mm in size in tellurobismuthite in association with other tellurides, mainly altaite, and hessite. It is possible to isolate the mineral of such inclusions in samples only in quantities sufficient for microspectral and X-ray structural (by the powder diffraction method) tests. Therefore, the definition of the new mineral was based mainly on optical diagnostic features, microspectral (11 analyses) and X-ray (7 analyses) tests, the reliability of which is confirmed by the completely satisfactory convergence of the results for each type of research for the mineral described by us and the artificial compound of the composition AgBiTe2.:\u200a140\u200a\n\u2014 Marianna Bezsmertnaya, Lada Soboleva, \u201cAbout Volynskite \u2014 a new telluride of bismuth and silver\u201d, 1965\nAll of the above studies were conducted during the lifetime of the head of the IMGRE\u00a0 mineralogy department, Igor S.

    "South Arabian tribal group in the Hijaz region\nThe Azd Shan\u016b\u2019ah (Arabic: \u0623\u0632\u062f \u0634\u0646\u0648\u0621\u0629) also spelled as Shanuwah, are a group of South Arabian tribes in the Hijaz that were descended from the larger Azd group. The Banu Lahab, Banu Zahran and Banu Ghamd, including their branches, are among the few parts of the Azd Shanu'ah. Formerly residing in Yemen, they emigrated from it in masses during the 2nd century CE.\nTribal lineage\nThe traditional genealogy of the Azd Shanu'ah is that they are descended from a man named 'Abd Allah al-Harith, whose full lineage is given as; 'Abd Allah al-Harith, son of Ka'b, son of 'Abd Allah, son of Malik, son of Nasr, son of al-Azd. This traces the ancestry of 'Abd Allah al-Harith back to al-Azd, the progenitor of the Azd tribe, and also makes him a Qahtanite Arab due to the Azd being descended from Qahtan.\nBranches\nThe most prominent branches of the Azd Shanu'ah include the Banu Lahab, Banu Ghamid, and the Banu Zahran.\nCharacteristics\nEtymology\nAccording to Ibn Duraid, the word Shanu'ah in their name originated from the term \"shan'ah\" which was expressed as a form of resentment; the Azd Shanu'ah reportedly received their name because their progenitor had enmity with his contemporary tribal chiefs. Shihab al-Din al-Khafaji gave a more positive view, saying that the Shanu'ah was a term referring to the righteous, pious and noble people of high lineage.\nAccording to Ibn Qutaybah, the Azd Shanu'ah can also be known by the alternative spelling, Shanuwah.\nAppearance\nThe early Arabians characterized the Azd Shanu'ah as having light, thin bodies that were agile, with dark skin. In some Hadith, it was reported that Muhammad compared the Azd Shanu'ah to the biblical Moses, noting their similarities in appearance and height.\nPersonality\nThe Azd Shanu'ah were known amongst the early Arabians to be very eloquent poets and writers. They also preferred living in mountainous and rural areas in the Arabian Peninsula.\nHistory\nThe Azd Shanu'ah originated in ancient Yemen and were contemporary to the Sabaeans. After the collapse of the Ma'rib Dam, the Azd Shanu'ah emigrated from Yemen under the leadership of Muzayqiya, as their homeland had not become suitable for them to live in anymore. They migrated to the Sarawat Mountains where they stayed. Yaqut al-Hamawi narrates that the Azd Shanu'ah had conflict with some Amalekites who inhabited the mountainous region temporarily. The migration to the Hijaz has been dated to the 2nd or 3rd centuries CE, based on contemporary inscriptions.\nIn the 7th century, the Azd Shanu'ah converted to Islam from polytheism; a good portion of them were part of the Sahaba, companions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. After 630 CE, all of the tribes in the Hijaz began to profess Islam, most likely including the remainder of the Azd Shanu'ah. In later years, members of the Azd Shanu'ah became governors of provinces under the Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates respectively.\nIn modern times, descendants of this ancient tribe exist and live in the towns and rural villages of the Al Bahah Region.\nSee also\nTribes of Arabia\nKhindif",

After the conquest of Cairo by the Mamluks, the new sultan al-Zahir Baybars built his eponymous mosque over the polo grounds in 1268.\nUntil the mid 19th Century, the area north of the mosque was the rural fringe of Cairo, consisting of the villages of El-Waylia, El-Demerdash, El-Mohamady and the Kobba palace izba (hamlet).\nIn 1849, Egypt's ruler, Abbass Pasha I, redeveloped the area into the Abbasia neighbourhood. However, by the late 19th Century the area was sparsely developed, where the contractor and real estate developer Sakakini Pasha bought a parcel of \"swampy mosquito infested\" land immediately north of al-Zahir mosque, and built a radial grid development in 1897, with his circular palace placed in the middle of the grid. This area is known today as the Sakakini quarter (shiakha) in qism al-Zahir.\nAdministrative subdivisions and population\nAl-Waily district is divided into the qisms of al-Zahir and al-Waily according to the Cairo Governorate district map and the census.\nAl-Waily district map bu shiakha\nIn 2017 qism al-Waily had 79,292 residents in its 12 shiakhas.\nWhile qism Al-Zahir had 71,870 residents in its six shiakhas in 2017.\n",

    "\n1914 food riot in Providence, Rhode Island\nThe Macaroni Riots were a series of civil disturbances that took place in the Federal Hill neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island, in 1914. The first riot occurred on the night of August 29 and was followed by additional nights of rioting on August 30 and September 7. \nThe food riot stemmed from an increase in the price of food, particularly pasta products such as macaroni, that affected the predominately Italian American population of Federal Hill in 1914. On August 22, socialist activists held a peaceful rally to protest the price increases, and on August 29, another rally turned violent as a mob of about 1,000 people marched down Atwells Avenue and looted the store of Frank P. Ventrone, a local food wholesaler who had been accused of profiteering. The angry mob caused thousands of dollars in damages and threw pasta products into the streets before police officers restored order. Additional rioting broke out the following night. Following this, socialist activists negotiated with Ventrone's associates and were able to broker a deal where he would sell his product at a reduced cost. Following a peaceful week, another riot occurred on the night of September 7 following a Labor Day rally that caused more property damage than the previous two riots combined. While additional rallies and protests occurred after this, the price protests slowly died down.  \nThe rioting, which resulted in several thousand dollars in property damage, was the most severe civil disturbance in Providence since the Dorr Rebellion of 1841. In the end, 50 people were arrested and several dozen were injured, including at least 14 by gunshot wounds. Most of the arrested were charged with reveling and given light fines, while two people were found guilty of more severe charges and sentenced to several months in jail. In addition to the price increases, historians point to anti-Italian discrimination, especially among the police, and organization by radical groups such as the Industrial Workers of the World as contributing to the violence.  \nBackground\nItalian Americans in Federal Hill\n1912 street photograph of Atwells Avenue in the Federal Hill neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island, by Lewis Hine\nFederal Hill is a neighborhood in Providence, Rhode Island, situated directly west of the city's Downtown district. Beginning around the 1840s, Federal Hill became a working class neighborhood with a significant population of Irish Americans, many of whom had immigrated to the United States due to the Great Famine in Ireland. Starting in the 1870s, Italian Americans began to settle in Federal Hill, and by 1895, the neighborhood was roughly evenly divided in population between Italian and Irish immigrants and their descendants. By the beginning of the 20th century, the neighborhood had gained the designation as Providence's Little Italy, and between 1905 and 1916, with many Irish Americans finding housing elsewhere, the neighborhood's Italian American population grew from 18,000 to over 40,000. In addition to Federal Hill, other neighborhoods with sizeable Italian populations included Charles and Silver Lake.\nThese immigrants and their descendants faced anti-Italian discrimination from the non-Italian White Americans in Providence. For example, many Italian Americans who were employed by the city's streetcar operator were referred to by numbers instead of their surnames, and some in the immigrant community were critical of reformers associated with the city's settlement movement, which sought to Americanize the community. Additionally, a 1911 shootout between police officers and an Italian American murder suspect in Federal Hill damaged the relationship between the police and the community. In some cases, Italian immigrants sought to resist discrimination by forming mutual benefit associations and joining activist groups, such as anarchist and socialist organizations and the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a militant labor union. In Federal Hill, the socialist movement included a weekly newspaper, the Labor Advocate, and the Italian Socialist Club. On September 16, 1912, local socialist activists held a 2,000-person parade in support of labor organizers who had been arrested during the recent Lawrence textile strike, including Italian IWW organizers Joseph James Ettor and Arturo Giovannitti. During the parade, activists unfurled a red flag, leading to a violent confrontation between marchers and police that further soured relations.\nPrice increases during World War I\nIn 1913, the United States was experiencing a period of economic depression that was accompanied by a nationwide increase in the price of foodstuffs that was so severe that it was leading to some instances of starvation. Early in the year, an increase in the price of ice led to a 10 percent price increase in milk in the neighboring states of Connecticut and Rhode Island, prompting the city government of Providence to launch an inv",
    "Former railway station in Liverpool, England\nFor the current station opened in 1836, see Edge Hill railway station.\nThomas Talbot Bury's watercolour of the tunnel portals\nEdge Hill railway station was a railway station that served the district of Edge Hill, Liverpool, England and is one of the oldest railway stations in the world.\nThere have been two stations of that name. The first stood a short distance south-west of the present station and its remains are still visible, although the site is not open to the public.\nDescription\nThe largest bore, in the centre, was the 2,250\u00a0yd (2,060\u00a0m) Wapping Tunnel, a long downwards incline leading to Wapping Dock and the world's first tunnel to be bored under a metropolis. The tunnel was worked by an endless rope running down the centre of one track and back along the other, the goods wagons descended by gravity, but were hauled up by the stationary steam engine. During the summer of 1829, prior to the tunnel opening for traffic, it became a popular subterranean promenade. It was whitewashed and lit by gas at intervals. On the 1 August alone, some three thousand people walked its length.\nThe tunnel to the north of the central bore was much shorter and inclined upwards, leading to the passenger terminal at Crown Street and a coal depot. Here the trains descended by gravity to Edge Hill station and were wound up into Crown Street.\nThe southern tunnel was originally a short length leading nowhere and used as a storage shed: its chief purpose was to create a symmetrical appearance. In 1832 it was cleared out and used as engine shed during the winters; later it became the wagon repairing shop until 1845 or 1846 when it was extended and expanded to provide two additional tracks into the Crown Street coal depot.\nThe Moorish Arch\nAt the opposite end of the station area were two engine houses in the form of towers on either side of the line, which was spanned at this point by the famous Moorish Arch. The arch was decorative with two battlemented towers and decorated masonry forming a grand and impressive entrance to Liverpool. But the arch was also functional and served as a bridge connecting the two engine houses across the deep cutting.\nThere were engine sheds and workshops cut into the rock either side of the station area, others were fitted up as passengers' waiting rooms and offices, there being no room in the cutting for ordinary buildings.\nThe engines were supplied with steam from return-flue boilers, two on each side of the tracks in the cutting walls. The smoke was channelled down rock cut flues to tall chimneys \u2013 known as the 'Pillars of Hercules' \u2013 situated either side of the tunnel entrances. A steam connecting pipe was installed in 1832 enabling either set of boilers to be used for either engine, at the same time a pedestrian subway was installed so that staff could move between the engine houses without having to move through the operating railway.\nThe station area was mainly used for the marshalling of trains and the coupling and uncoupling of locomotives, but first class passengers could also join the trains here, conveyed by horse-drawn carriages from Dale Street in the city centre.\nIn 2022, the site was listed as a scheduled monument by Historic England.\nNotes\n",

Bogan was reduced from ten to nine, Tumut was reduced from ten to eight, Warren increased from ten to twelve and Wellington increased from ten to eleven.\nGloucester, Kyogle, Murray, Murrumbidgee and Tallaganda were all increased from eight to nine councillors.\nDeferred elections\nIn August 1983, local government minister Lin Gordon announced that elections for 13 councils would be postponed until 10 December 1983 while possible amalgamations were considered. The City of Sydney and the municipalities of Ashfield, Botany, Burwood, Canterbury, Concord, Drummoyne, Leichhardt, Marrickville, Randwick, Strathfield, Waverley and Woollahra were all affected.\nA number of these councils appear to have eventually gone ahead with elections as planned on 24 September.

    "Singaporean banker (1926\u20132016)\nIn this Chinese name, the family name is  Chua.\nChua Kim Yeow (28 January 1926 \u2013 21 August 2016) was a Singaporean banker and presidential candidate at the 1993 presidential election, the first election in Singapore to have a president elected by citizens instead of Parliament. Chua was unsuccessful, only garnering 41.31% of the vote as compared to Ong Teng Cheong's 58.69%, who became the fifth president.\nA civil servant, Chua also served multiple roles at many companies along with becoming the first local accountant-general, serving in that role for 18 years.\nEarly life and education\nChua was born on 28 January 1926 in the Straits Settlements (present-day Chinatown, Singapore). His father was a stevedore subcontractor who worked for the Singapore Harbour Board. In 1943, following his father's death, Chua became an odd job worker to support his mother and three siblings.\nHe was a top student in Gan Eng Seng School and attended Raffles Institution for 2 years before ending his studies due to the Japanese occupation. In 1947, Chua passed the London Matriculation External Examination and later the UK Association of Certified Accountants in 1953. In 1954, Chua worked at the Income Tax Service. In 1956, he was transferred to the accountant-general's department, reaching the top position in 5 years.\nCareer\nCivil service career\nIn 1961, Chua succeeded a British accountant as accountant-general, becoming the first local accountant-general. He served as accountant-general for 18 years. In 1979, he retired from civil service and became executive chairman of the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS Bank), leaving in 1986 and becoming executive chairman of POSB Bank, leaving in February 1993. In 1981, he became the head of the Securities Industry Council. Chua was also director of several companies such as Singapore Press Holdings and City Developments Limited.\nChua was also involved in launching the Singapore dollar, having served as deputy chairman on the Board of Commissioners of Currency from 1967 to 1979. In 1985, serving as chairman, Chua announced the dissolution of The Singapore Monitor. In 1990, Chua was appointed director of Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd. In December 1993, Chua was appointed chairman of Stock Exchange of Singapore.\n1993 presidential election\nSee also: 1993 Singaporean presidential election\nChua used a flower as his campaign's symbol.\nIn the 1993 presidential election, presidents were to be elected by citizens instead of by Parliament. To prevent an uncontested walkover, former Minister Goh Keng Swee and then-Finance Minister Richard Hu persuaded Chua to stand in the election against Ong Teng Cheong. Chua initially refused, stating that he considered Ong to be a \"far superior candidate.\" However, he later decided to stand as a candidate, stating that it was \"an act of public duty\".\nChua submitted his Certification of Eligibility on 18 August. His nomination was proposed by Wee Kok Wah and seconded by Lam Fong Loi. Chua's assenters included Tan Boon Teik, Mah Kah Eng, Frances Wong Lai Yong, and V. T. Arasu. Chua was supported by opposition parties such as Workers' Party and Singapore Democratic Party.\nChua decided not to campaign at all, only having two public appearances on television. In his first television appearance, Chua stated that the reason he did not campaign was due to a lack of funds and that he wasn't politically affiliated. Due to his lack of campaigning, his supporters campaigned for him. One supporter made flyers out of The Straits Times pages and distributed them using fax. Supporters also made \"Vote Chua\" car stickers but had to stop due to rules that the stickers did not bear the Returning Officer stamp.\nOn 28 August, results for the presidential election were announced with Chua losing the election with 41.31% of the vote as compared to Ong's 58.69%. Chua stated that he was surprised by the amount of votes he had received, with Ong stating about Chua that he was a \"very credible candidate\".\nPost-election career\nIn 1994, Chua quit as director to Singapore Press Holdings, Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd, and Times Publishing Ltd. He was briefly re-elected director of Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd but only temporarily till a replacement was found. This was reportedly done to avoid conflict of interests between the companies and his role as chairman of Stock Exchange of Singapore. Chua also served as chairman of Stamford Tyres from 2000 to 2013.\nPersonal life\nIn 1964, Chua was awarded the Public Administration Silver Medal and, in 1975, was awarded the Public Administration Gold Medal. He married his wife Seah Sok Meng, a school teacher, in 1954 and had 4 daughters. Seah died in 2012.\nDeath\nOn 21 August 2016, Chua died at the Singapore General Hospital of pneumonia. He had been hospitalized there since early August. He was survived by 4 children, 3 grandchildren, and 1 great-grandchild.\n",

Between 1993 and 1995, the parabolic arch and the walls towards Cala de Tr\u00e1pana were built, and later brick vaults were built on the third level and the streets above these were paved, Miguel Acosta and Concepci\u00f3n, due to the risk of collapse, making them accessible to visitors coinciding with the 500th anniversary of the Spanish occupation of Melilla with the installation of wooden pavements. Between 1998 and 2000, the first level was shored up and reinforced, all the levels were connected, and toilets and a sewage treatment plant were built under the staircase that goes down to Tr\u00e1pana.\nDescription\nIt has a gigantic open cavity, reinforced by a parabolic arch of stone and brick and three interconnected levels, from lowest to highest. The first consists of two intersecting naves and was used as a church, the second, a set of rooms connected to each other and with windows to the outside, the third being similar to the previous one, but with smaller and lower rooms.\n",
    "American painter\nJudith Belzer, From the Anthropocene #5, oil on canvas, 60\" x 60\", 2015.\nJudith Belzer (born 1956) is an American painter based in Berkeley, California. She is known for semi-abstract oils and watercolors depicting invented landscapes in which the natural and built worlds collide and adjoin. These hybrid scenes have been described as dynamic, distanced but expressive, and non-prescriptive\u2014more provocative than overtly critical observations of environmental change. In an Artillery review Barbara Morris wrote, \"Belzer explores the edge where the natural world interfaces with the industrialized landscape, emphasizing how rhythms and patterns found in nature are echoed in the structures that man has created \u2026   conveying our anxious energy as we struggle for equilibrium in a world permanently altered by our actions.\"\nBelzer has exhibited at venues including the Museum of Arts and Design (New York), Berkeley Art Museum (BAMPFA), Nevada Museum of Art, Contemporary Jewish Museum (San Francisco), and Mills College Art Museum.  Her work belongs to the permanent collections of BAMPFA and the Nevada Museum of Art. In 2014, she received a Guggenheim Fellowship. Belzer is married to journalist and author Michael Pollan.\nEducation and exhibitions\nBelzer was born in 1956 in Chicago. She enrolled at Bennington College in 1974, where she majored in English and met Pollan; in 1979, she completed her degree at Barnard College. After graduating, she lived in Manhattan and studied art at the New York Studio School, before moving to rural Cornwall, Connecticut in the mid-1990s. During that time, she began receiving critical attention for nature-based paintings through surveys and exhibitions at Berry-Hill Galleries (1996\u20132005) in New York and Richardson-Clarke Gallery in Boston (1994\u20132000).\nIn 2003, Belzer moved from the East Coast to Berkeley, where the scope and sprawl of the skies, landscape and urbanized environment gradually transformed her work. Her later solo exhibitions have taken place at the Sonoma County Museum (2007), the Nevada Museum of Art (2018), and galleries including Morgan Lehman (New York, 2008\u201313), Valerie Carberry (Chicago, 2007\u201310), and George Lawson (2010\u201316), Anglim Trimble (2021) and Hosfelt Gallery (2022\u2013present) in San Francisco.\nWork and reception\nBelzer's art is unified by a sustained engagement with and gradually expanding conception of what \"nature\" comprises. Critics have characterized her approach as an inquiry into underlying patterns of natural and social life, which has moved freely from crystalline and cellular to aerial perspectives. Working at the landscape level inspired formal shifts that coalesced to create the playful, frenetic energy of her later paintings. These include: an intensified color palette; gestural, linear mark-making that observers connect to text and her early studies in language; sweeping graphic patterning like a cartographical shorthand; and off-balance, vertiginous views with multiple vantage points.\nJudith Belzer, Trunk #3, diptych, oil on canvas, 40\" x 108\", 2006.\nBelzer's later work has been likened to the quasi-abstract landscapes of Wayne Thiebaud and Richard Diebenkorn; however, unlike those works, her landscapes are non-specific geographic inventions that are chaotic and sometimes dystopian rather than serene. In this vein, critic DeWitt Cheng wrote, Belzer's \"oils resemble colored pencil drawings made by lapsed Impressionists suffering from a certain Expressionist anxiety\u2014like van Gogh or Munch \u2026  all-over fields of energy in the spirit of Abstract Expressionism.\"\nPainting, 1992\u201309\nBelzer's painting in the 1990s and early 2000s approached everyday nature\u2014marshes, bramble, winter berries, leaves\u2014with an intimate, quiet focus that produced realistically observed, yet expressionistically rendered studies of form and suffused light. While still descriptive, these works became increasingly abstract and atmospheric, and less bound to dimensional references such as the horizon line. Critic Karen Wilkin called them \"lyrical, Asian-inspired paintings  distill landscape into suggestive fragments seen close up\": flights of leaves, branches and organic shapes set against muted oil washes that evoked the transience of seasons and life and ranged in mood from meditative to exuberant. Other writers related this work to post-war all-over painting, calligraphy, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and Monet.\nAfter moving to the West, Belzer shifted to larger forms\u2014oak and eucalyptus trees\u2014in detailed, monumental works that examined rotting trunks, exfoliating limbs and densely interwoven branches, whose patterns echoed those of organic forms such as skin tissue, body parts, mountainsides. Her \"Inner Life of Trees\" series (2007\u201308) often employed multiple panels. Fusing realism and abstraction, they evoked a sense of penetrating trees' interiors or physically tracing concentric rings and bark ridges that echoed the movement and rhythms of ocean waves or sand.

    "\nAn Numaniyah Airfield (ICAO, ORAN) is a former airfield and former military training center in An Numaniyah, Wasit Governorate, Iraq.\nHistory\nDuring the Iran\u2013Iraq War in the 1980s, An Numaniyah Air Base was used to attack Iran and pro-Iranian villages in Southern Iraq. \nIn the 1990s, garrisoned troops and stationed helicopters located in the air base were claimed to participate in an environmental warfare with the Marsh Arabs by draining wetlands. \nIn early 2003, An Numaniyah Air Base served as the headquarters for the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force during the Iraq War.\nAn Numaniyah Air Base likely ceased its operations after the 2003 Iraq War.\n\nThe An Numaniyah Project\nIn 2004, the Coalition Provisional Authority budgeted $289 million to renovate the military base as a part of phase 1. In January 2004, work was announced to begin soon with the lowered budget of $65.4 million. The considered important project consisted of several renovations on existing buildings and infrastructure as it was needed for the defense of the country. On September 1, 2004, the Iraqi Flag was raised over the training base to mark its opening. An Numiniyah would serve as a training base for three battalions of Iraqi Intervention Force and also as the Iraqi army's 2nd Brigade headquarters.\nOn June 9, 2005, the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing sent a Military Transition Team to help support the training of the 1st Battalion, and also help stand up to the 2nd Brigade of the 7th Iraqi Army Division.\nDownfall and Closure\nIn June 2006, the withdrawal of the US troops left behind approximately $1 million worth in equipment. Only 2 months after the withdrawal, Iraq troops experienced food shortages and lack of supplies. This led to officers having to sell power generators in all but the officer's quarters. It was claimed that the quarters were left in disrepair so badly, many preferred to sleep outside, which was one of many factors that led to the closure of the short-lived An Numaniyah Training Base.\nLayout\nAn Numaniyah Airfield occupies a 17 square kilometer site, and is served by a single 9,700 foot paved (12/30) runway.\nAn Numaniyah Training Base consists of several water treatment facilities, large dining halls with a capacity of 3,000 soldiers each, and living quarters.\n",

    "In this Basque name, the surname is  Medrano.\nCrist\u00f3bal de Medrano (b. 1561 \u2013 d. 1597) was a noble from the House of Medrano, a Basque-Spanish composer, organist of the Church of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Granada in Llerena, and Maestro de capillo of the Badajoz Cathedral and Church of San Juan Bautista in Marchena. He is the author of the Missa voce mea cum sex vocibus manuscript, published by Antonio Baciero in 1594.\nLife\nCrist\u00f3bal de Medrano most likely was born in Seville during the reign of Philip II of Spain. Crist\u00f3bal belonged to the noble House of Medrano, an ancient family under the protection of the Monarchs of Spain. Crist\u00f3bal identified himself as a \"Cantabren\" in his Missa Voca Mea manuscript. He belonged to a family of musicians active in the last third of the 16th century in the cathedrals of Seville, C\u00f3rdoba, and Ja\u00e9n. However, instead of joining the Seville Cathedral choir as a chorister, as his potential birth in Seville might suggest, it seems he joined as a seise in the Ja\u00e9n Cathedral, where on July 4, 1561, a choirboy by that name is documented. He was a relative of Francisco de Medrano y Villa, a famous poet from Seville.\nEarly career\nHe was a musician in the private music chapel of Rodrigo de Castro Osorio, who at that time was the metropolitan archbishop of Seville. Castro was an important patron of the Spanish Renaissance, from the family of the Count of Lemos. In 1583, Crist\u00f3bal de Medrano appears as the organist of the Church of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Granada in Llerena.\nIn mid-1585, he succeeded Antonio de Villaroel in the position of maestro at the Church of San Juan Bautista in Marchena, in the province of Seville. Crist\u00f3bal de Medrano was hired with a salary of 12,000 maraved\u00eds per year, slightly lower than Villaroel, who earned 15,000. However, he was granted an increase of 8,000 maraved\u00eds as an annual cost-of-living allowance, according to the mandate of the vicar \u00cd\u00f1igo de Leci\u00f1ana. He remained in the position until the end of August 1587.\nMaestro de capillo at the Cathedral of Badajoz (1587-1596)\nThe position of maestro de capillo at the Cathedral of Badajoz had become vacant following the death of maestro Luis de Qui\u00f1ones in 1587. The chapter contacted Crist\u00f3bal de Medrano in June of that same year, culminating in the negotiations between both parties with Medrano taking possession of the position on December 6, 1587. It seems that relations between Medrano and the chapter of Badajoz were not very cordial. He remained in the position until November 22, 1596. He was temporarily replaced by Gil Fern\u00e1ndez until the arrival of Esteban de Brito.\nBooks\nIn the Historical Library of the Complutense University of Madrid, there is a preserved 1594 manuscript of the Missa Voce Mea, which includes a mass and motet. The mass was published in 1996 by Antonio Baciero and Alfonso Peci\u00f1a. In Badajoz, he left the Missa Voce Mea cum sex vocibus, published by Antonio Baciero.\nMissa Voce Mea\nCrist\u00f3bal de Medrano's Missa Voce Mea manuscript, dating from 1594, is a six-voice mass and motet dedicated to Cardinal Rodrigo de Castro, Archbishop of Seville, a significant patron of the Spanish Renaissance. Hidden within the manuscript's cover illustration is a six-voice canon. The manuscript serves as a comprehensive tribute, with the phrase \"Rodericus Cardinalis\" appearing throughout the mass and motet, creating a sonic reminder of the figure to whom the work is dedicated. Heraldic symbols related to the house of Lemos, to which the cardinal belonged, are incorporated into the decorative capital letters of the various sections of the mass.\nDedicaton to Rodrigo de Castro\nCrist\u00f3bal de Medrano dedicated his Missa Voce Mea manuscript to Rodrigo de Castro:\nCrist\u00f3bal de Medrano presents his Missa Voce Mea to Cardinal-Archbisbop Rodrigo de Castro.\n\"To the Most Illustrious and Reverend Lord Don Rodrigo de Castro, Archbishop of Seville, Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church, Counselor of His Majesty, and His Major Chaplain. Illustrious and Reverend Lord, It is the humility of my soul and the devotion of my heart, which, drawn from the deep admiration for Your Lordship's greatness, pushes me to lay at your feet this work of my humble abilities. In this document, I humbly dedicate myself to Your Most Illustrious and Reverend Person, hoping to offer it as a small token of the reverence and gratitude I feel toward Your Eminence for your most noble virtues and patronage, which extend as an infinite sea of compassion and protection. May this humble offering be received by Your Grace as a sign of my profound respect and loyalty. I ask that Your Illustrious Lordship, in your immense kindness, accept it with the same favor with which I offer it.\"\nThe final motet, based on Psalm 141, where King David pleads for divine assistance while alone in a cave, may symbolically reflect Medrano's own appeal for protection or gratitude to the cardinal.

    "River in Zl\u00edn, Czech Republic\nThe Kyjovka (also known as Stupava) is a river in the Czech Republic, a left tributary of the Thaya River. It flows through the South Moravian and Zl\u00edn regions. It is 88.1\u00a0km (54.7\u00a0mi) long.\nEtymology\nThe river is named after the town of Kyjov.\nCharacteristic\nSpring of the Kyjovka\nThe Kyjovka originates in the territory of Star\u00e9 Hut\u011b in the Ch\u0159iby range at an elevation of 518\u00a0m (1,699\u00a0ft) and flows to Lan\u017ehot, where it enters the Thaya River at an elevation of 152\u00a0m (499\u00a0ft).

    "\nOn June 7, 2021, suspected Fulani herdsmen attacked the village of Odugbeho, Agatu LGA, Benue State, Nigeria, killing at least forty people.\nBackground\nFulani herdsmen in Nigeria have been in conflict with various farming communities across Nigeria for decades due to disputes over land use. The local government area in Agatu, Benue State is home to various different ethnic groups, and ethnic conflict between Fulani herdsmen and ethnic Agatu locals that broke out in early 2016 led to hundreds of civilians killed. In the conflict, Fulani herdsmen laid siege to several villages in the LGA, including Odugbeho. A second massacre in Nimbo in April 2016 killed hundreds more civilians.\nA week before the 2021 massacre in Odugbeho, suspected Fulani herdsmen killed 36 Tiv civilians in the village of Shikaan Mbagena Kpav, also in Benue State. Fulani herdsmen had also stormed several villages in Agatu LGA in the weeks prior to the attack, displacing thousands of people.\nMassacre\nAt the time of the attack, civilians in Odugbeho were at a burial ceremony and others were out at the market due to the village's market day being on Sunday. Later in the afternoon, many people were at home. The herdsmen likely entered the area from Nasarawa State, with one survivor stating that the herdsmen caught the village by surprise by entering from the forest in the direction of Gwer West LGA. The attack began at 5:45 pm, with the herdsmen shooting indiscriminately into the village and the ceremony as soon as they entered. The massacre lasted for an hour until around 6:40 pm, when the herdsmen dispersed back into the forest.\nMany civilians fled into the bush towards Ogbaulu to evade the attack. A survivor of the massacre speaking to Channels TV said that while he was fleeing, he saw nine bodies lining the road out of Odugbeho. When he returned to the village after the herdsmen fled, he saw eleven bodies in the village center. Many of the bodies were unable to be recovered the night of the attack in anticipation of a second massacre.\nAftermath\nNigerian senator Abah Moro, who represents Odugbeho's area of Benue in the Nigerian Senate, condemned the attack and stated 40 people were killed. The spokesman for the Benue State police stated that the police had knowledge of the attack and would send reinforcements from Operation Whirl Stroke to the area. The spokesman added that bodies were still being discovered and that the death toll was unknown.\nMoro was one of the first officials to report the attack and stated the death toll was 40. John Ngbede, the chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Benue stated that 25 bodies had been buried by June 8, and that 30 had been discovered in total including ten bodies in the bush. Ngbede added that local officials had told him they suspected over 40 people were killed, as many bodies were still in the bush undiscovered. The chairman of Agatu stated that 27 people had been confirmed to be killed by June 8, although the number was not final.\nFulani herdsmen attacked Odugbeho again on June 20, killing eleven people in a spree of attacks on Odugbeho, Aila, and Adagbo. Two people were killed in Odugbeho and 21 houses were burned.\n",
    "Castle in Bavoriv, Ternopil Oblast, Ukraine\nBavoriv Castle (Ukrainian: \u0411\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043a) is a located in Bavoriv, Ternopil Oblast, Ukraine. The wooden castle was located on a hill, above the Hnizna River.\nHistory\nThe stronghold was built in the 16th century by Wac\u0142aw Bawor, a courtier to King Sigismund I the Old and a field scribe of the crown. In 1589, Tartars besieging the defensive castle suffered a memorable defeat. In the 17th century the fortress was rebuilt. The next owners of the castle and lands were the Ma\u0142ecki family. Around 1800 the castle was abandoned and began to fall into disrepair.\nPalace\nIn 1851, the estate was bought from the Ma\u0142ecki family by Count Wiktor Baworowski. Since the castle was no longer habitable, he built a new palace, where he gathered a collection of artworks and a rich book collection. Victor Count Baworowski was also the founder of the Baworowscy Library in Lviv. When Count Baworowski committed suicide in 1894 the estate passed into foreign hands. In the interwar years they belonged to the Astana family, among others. By the end of the 19th century, only ruins remained of the castle.\nArchitecture\nIn the 17th century, the brick castle was a defensive structure, founded on a rectangular plan with an inner courtyard. The residential buildings were three-story. The entrance to the fortress led through a gate in the gateway building, the two corners of which had round, three-story towers topped with a helmet. Similar towers were on the other buildings. The castle also had a castle chapel, which in 1747 was rebuilt as the Roman Catholic Church of St. Wenceslas, and at the turn of the 20th century was in turn turned into the Orthodox Church of St. John the Baptist. The Baworowskis were buried in the crypt of the Roman Catholic church. Today almost nothing remains of the castle. The rebuilt Roman Catholic church shows the area of the former fortifications. Of the old Roman Catholic castle church, only the lower part with a semicircular apse survived, existing in the later church.\n",

    "Nira (Jawi derived from Sanskrit: \u0928\u0940\u0930, romanized:\u00a0n\u012bra \"water\") or lahang (Jawi: \u0644\u0627\u0647\u06a0\u200e) is a sweet liquid obtained from the stems of plants such as sugarcane, sugar beet, sorghum, maple, or the sap of the flower stalks (spathe) of the palm family such as arenga palm, coconut, date palm, nipa palm, sago palm, tal and others.\nNira contains about 10-15% sugar. This liquid can be consumed directly, fermented into palm wine or further processed into syrup, sugar and other products.\nExtraction\nNira is obtained through a method called \"tapping\". The plant from which the sap is to be harvested is bent slightly, with its spathe wrapped in young coconut leaves. This process continues for about a week to prevent the stalk from breaking. The bent spathe is stripped of its sheath and sliced little by little using a tapping knife, allowing the sap to drip into a bamboo container, usually about a foot long or holding around 2 liters.\nThe volume of nira collected can depend on weather conditions. For example, in the Philippines, nipa farmers can predict the arrival of typhoons (common in the region) a few days in advance when the daily yield of sap decreases or even stops suddenly.\nSap harvesters typically add substances to the collected nira to prevent natural fermentation, either by using sodium benzoate (0.05\u20130.2%) or lime (0.7\u20131.2%), until the pH of the sap becomes relatively high, above 7. Fermented sap with a pH below 5.5 or sugar content lower than 8% cannot be used to make palm sugar.\nComposition\nThe main sugar found in nira is sucrose. Nira also contains small amounts of glucose and fructose when freshly tapped. Sap from flowers is actually sterile, but once tapped, it is often contaminated by microorganisms that can hydrolyze sucrose into glucose and fructose. The hydrolysis process reduces the yield of palm sugar, and in some cases, palm sugar may not form at all, remaining a thick liquid.\n",
    "Michael Cargill is an American gun rights activist. He is the host of the gun rights radio show, Come And Talk It. He is also the owner of Central Texas Gun Works.\nBiography\nCargill was born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He spent his early life in Florida. Later, he joined the U.S. Army and served for twelve years, earning Army Achievement Medals, Commendation Medals, and Good Conduct Medals. He also qualified as a marksman and as a parachutist. After an honorable discharge as Sergeant, he moved to Texas, where he initially worked in telecommunications and later started a freight company.\nCargill became interested in firearms education following an assault on his grandmother, which led him to focus on teaching self-defense. In 2011, he founded Central Texas Gun Works in Austin.\nIn 2014, Cargill ran for the Texas House of Representatives to represent the 50th district in a special election held in January, but he was unsuccessful. In the same year, his store was named America's first Bitcoin gun store.\nIn 2015, Cargill initiated a lawsuit against the City of Austin for its decision to declare City Hall a gun-free zone following the statewide legalization of open carry in most public places. The legal dispute concluded in 2019, with Judge Lora Livingston of the 261st Civil District Court ruling in Cargill's favor and fining the city $9,000 for denying entry to licensed gun holders on multiple occasions.\nIn 2017, a member of the Austin City Council nominated Cargill to a board addressing traffic issues in Austin, but he was rejected by other council members due to his views on the Second Amendment.\nIn June 2022, Cargill served as the chairman of the Log Cabin Republicans (LCR) of Texas, a group of gay Texas GOP members. He continues to serve as the president of LCR's Austin chapter.\nIn June 2024, Cargill successfully challenged a federal ban on bump stocks, culminating in a 6-3 U.S. Supreme Court decision. The court determined that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) could not classify bump stocks as machine guns under existing legislation. This ruling came after Cargill, who had surrendered two bump stocks to the ATF, filed a lawsuit arguing that the agency had exceeded its authority. The challenge was supported by the New Civil Liberties Alliance. The ATF's inclusion of bump stocks under the \"machinegun\" category followed the 2017 Las Vegas shooting.\nCargill also provides firearm training for disabled individuals across Texas.\n",

    "Turkmen tribe in Turkey and Iran\nBayburdlu (Persian: \u0628\u0627\u06cc\u0628\u0648\u0631\u062f\u0644\u0648), or Bayburtlu (\u0628\u0627\u06cc\u0628\u0648\u0631\u062a\u0644\u0648), is a Turkoman tribe inhabiting the region of Arasbaran in northwestern Iran. The tribe presumably had its roots in the area around the city of Bayburt. According to Karamanname, the Bayburdlu tribe attained land between Konya and Ankara in central Anatolia upon its conquest by the Karamanids, and the tribe's name was reflected in that of a local Ottoman-era district. The loyalty of the Bayburdlu tribe changed to Iran with the rise of the Safavids, under whom many tribesmen served as governors and military commanders.  \nEtymology\nThe tribe's name implies that the tribe's origins lay in and around the town of Bayburt in northeastern Anatolia. According to historian Hoseyn Baybordi, bay means big, while burd denotes \"head\", and the tribe may be unrelated to the city of Bayburt. Later in history, the tribe's name was often written as \"Bayburdi\" to ease the Persian pronunciation.\nHistory\nAccording to the narrative in the Menakibname of Dedi\u011fi Sultan, Bayburd Beg and Turghud Beg, the eponymous leaders of the Bayburdlu and Turghudlu tribes, were brothers who were dispatched to Anatolia (Rum) from Khorasan by Didighi Sultan, an influential descendant of the Sufi poet Ahmad Yasawi. The anonymous author of Karamanname Shikari narrates that when the pastures between Konya and Ankara entered Karamanid rule, one half of the region was granted to Bayburd Beg, while the other half was granted to Turghud Beg. During the reigns of the Ottoman Sultans Bayezid II (r.\u20091481\u20131512) and Selim I r.\u20091512\u201320), the nahiyah of Bayburd, the tribe's namesake, was part of the kaza of Turghud and comprised the lands south of Ere\u011fli and east of Karaman. This district was turned into a kaza during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent (r.\u20091520\u201366).\nThe Bayburdlu tribe was loyal to Safavid Iran, and several tribe members were prominent figures within the state. Qaraja Ilyas was one of Ismail I's (r.\u20091501\u201324) commanders at the Battle of Sharur in 1501. Qara Khan, the son of Qaraja Ilyas, was the Safavid governor of Erivan and Shuragil at the time of Tahmasp I's death (r.\u20091524\u201376) and was notable for his victory over the Ottoman forces of Erzurum in 1577/8. During the reigns of Mohammad Khodabanda (r.\u20091578\u20131587) and Abbas the Great (r.\u20091587\u20131629), Shahverdi Beg Bayburdlu was the yas\u0101vol-e \u1e63o\u1e25bat, and is known to have left much wealth for his descendants when he died in 1614. At the time of Abbas's death, Morad Khan Sultan Bayburdlu was serving as the governor of Arasbaran in northwestern Iran. Members of the Bayburdlu tribe were often appointed as the governors of the region of Arasbaran, where they had settled. A firman (decree) of the Safavid Shah Hoseyn (r.\u20091694\u20131722) attests to the recruitment of Emam Qoli Beg, the son of Mohammed Beg Bayburdlu, in the district around Shaki and Shirvan. Sixteenth-century poet Sadiqi Beg mentions one Mohammad Beg from the Bayburdlu tribe who wrote poems in Turkic.\n",

    "Courtly scene depicting the grand vizier Shahqoli Khan Zanganeh presenting a ring, dated 1694/95\nThe Royal Council (Persian: \u062f\u06cc\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650 \u0627\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0644\u0670\u06cc, romanized:\u00a0Divan-e a'la) was the highest governing authority in Safavid Iran, led by the grand vizier. Royal Council meetings frequently took place, under the supervision of the shah. Except in times of civil war (1525\u20131532 and 1577\u20131582), when the vakil and Qizilbash leaders were the de facto rulers of the state, the members had no decision-making power. The dominance of the Qizilbash was eradicated under Shah Abbas I (r.\u20091587\u20131629), and the Royal Council was taken over by bureaucrats the shah personally selected. Another council also existed at the same time, known as the janqi, which functioned as a privy council and was limited to the most powerful statesmen.\nThe English traveller Robert Shirley wrote about the Royal Council, noting that each morning, the grand vizier, accompanied by the shah's advisors and secretaries, reviewed the condition of the provinces. Matters were discussed, and opinions were documented by the secretaries. Afterward, the Royal Council presented the recorded documents to the shah, who selected which issues to pursue and which to reject. On Wednesdays, the shah would hold a public council session where people from all social backgrounds could present their petitions. The shah reviewed these, choosing some for further consideration and recording them in a book. If a petition was chosen, it was not allowed to be resubmitted.\nDue to the indecisiveness of Shah Soltan Hoseyn (r.\u20091694\u20131722), the Royal Council gathered frequently to discuss important and state problems, but typically no meaningful choices were made. Rather than taking responsibility and addressing the internal and foreign dangers to the safety of the state and its population, the various groups within the Royal Council instead attempted to compete with each other. Threats were once made during a Royal Council meeting as a result of the hostility between the Royal Council members. Previously, similar situations would have resulted in the execution of councilors, but during this period it only caused damage to their self-image.\n",

Built in 2004, the terminal serves as the main intercity bus hub for the city, with services to the rest of Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, along with Rapid Penang public transit services. Spanning an area of 42,112\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (3,912.3\u00a0m2), the terminal, owned by the Penang Island City Council, has a capacity of 1,000. It is also slated to form part of the proposed Mutiara LRT system.\nHistory\nSungai Nibong Bus Terminal prior to upgrades between 2021 and 2024.\nThe Sungai Nibong Bus Terminal was constructed in 2004 and officially opened to the public in April 2005, serving as a hub for intercity and transit bus services. In the years after its launch, the terminal faced challenges such as complaints about touts and insufficient amenities.\nIn 2021, Easybook, an online transport service provider, was granted a contract to revamp the terminal. The refurbishment included the integration of universal design amenities, implementation of automated ticketing systems and other infrastructure improvements. The upgrade project was completed in 2024 with a total cost of RM7 million, an increase from the initial estimate of RM6.2 million. UDA Holdings was appointed to manage the terminal, with plans to introduce retail spaces within the facility.\nThe terminal is also set to be part of the proposed Mutiara LRT line, which envisions a transit-oriented development around the terminal including a new train station and a maintenance depot at a nearby public space.\nPublic transport\nRapid Penang operates five bus routes through the terminal, connecting it with various parts of George Town.\n102: Sungai Nibong bus terminal\u2013Penang National Park\u2013Penang International Airport\n303: Sungai Nibong bus terminal\u2013Weld Quay\u2013Bukit Gedung\n304: Sungai Nibong bus terminal\u2013Gurney Drive\u2013Bukit Gedung\n308: Sungai Nibong bus terminal\u2013Gertak Sanggul\n401: Sungai Nibong bus terminal\u2013Weld Quay\u2013Teluk Kumbar\nSee also\nPenang Sentral",
    "The Constitutional Court of Saarland (also Saarland Constitutional Court) is the constitutional court of the German state of Saarland. The court also has the special status of a constitutional body (see: Constitution of Saarland). According to the Constitution of December 15, 1947, the Constitutional Court of Saarland is the third organ of the will of the people alongside the state parliament and the state government (Article 97 SVerf). The detailed regulations on the Constitutional Court are set out in the Law on the Constitutional Court.\nThe seat of the Constitutional Court is Saarbr\u00fccken.\nComposition and election\nThe Constitutional Court is made up of eight judges. Each of these eight judges is assigned a deputy. The judges and their respective deputies are elected for a term of six years by a two-thirds majority of the statutory number of members of the state parliament. Re-election is possible. There are certain requirements that a member of the Constitutional Court must fulfill: they must be a German citizen and eligible for election to the state parliament, be at least 35 years old and have the qualifications to hold judicial office or to hold a higher administrative service. At least two members and their deputies must be professional judges and belong to a higher regional court.\nAdministration\nThe administration is carried out by the President.\nDuties\nThe Constitutional Court decides:\non the compatibility of a state law with the constitution (abstract and concrete normative controls)\non disputes between organs\non constitutional complaints\non challenges to certain decisions of the state parliament or the state government regarding popular initiatives and referendums\non election and mandate checks on charges against members of the government and on other matters mentioned in the Constitutional Court Act.\nHistory\nThe Constitutional Court had been planned since the Constitution of Saarland came into force in 1947, but at that time it had very limited powers. The actual tasks of a constitutional court lay with the Constitutional Commission, which was created on the model of France. So the Constitutional Court initially only existed on paper. Only after the referendum on the Saar Statute on October 23, 1955, which rejected it and paved the way for the political and economic integration of the Saarland into the Federal Republic, was a comprehensive constitutional amendment passed in December 1956, transferring the previous powers of the Constitutional Commission to the Constitutional Court. It began its work in January 1959 with the election of its members and its president in February 1959.\nJudgements\nContact tracing had t be revived in (August 2020).\nRaw measurement data must be produced to be used as evidence\nThe 3-member AfD parliamentary group is not entitled to additional financing from the state parliament\nMembers\nSource\nPresidents since 1959\nCurrent members\nLiterature\nWerner Thieme: Die Entwicklung des Verfassungsrechts im Saarland von 1945 bis 1958.

    "Boxing match\nJulio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez vs. H\u00e9ctor Camacho, billed as Ultimate Glory: The Fight for it All, was a professional boxing match contested on September 12, 1992, for the WBC super lightweight title.\nBackground\nA fight between Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez and H\u00e9ctor Camacho, two of the top fighters in the super lightweight division, had been discussed as early as 1989, though problems within Camacho's management team prevented HBO, who then held Ch\u00e1vez's television rights, from making the fight with then-HBO sports head Seth Abraham stating \"While I'd love to do the fight, I'm not sure who to make the deal with.\" After years of rumors and  failed negotiations, the Ch\u00e1vez\u2013Camacho fight finally came to fruition in April 1992. After Ch\u00e1vez made a successful mandatory defense against Angel Hernandez, he would challenge Camacho, who was sitting ringside, by yelling \"you're next!\" at him. The two fighters would then each take tune-up fights on August 1, 1992, in preparation for their showdown scheduled in September that year. Camacho would defeat Eddie Van Kirk followed by Ch\u00e1vez making another successful title defense against Frankie Mitchell, officially putting their fight on. There were concerns that Camacho, who had fought Van Kirk in the light middleweight division at 148 pounds, would have difficulty getting down to the 140-pound super lightweight division and thus make the long-anticipated bout a non-title fight. Promoter Don King would downplay Camacho's rumored troubles, stating they were \"not true\" and that there was \"no question\" that Camacho would make weight come the day of the fight. Ch\u00e1vez, then undefeated in 81 professional fights, entered the fight as a heavy 5\u20131 favorite.\nRichard Steele was named the referee of the fight three days prior to it taking place. This was the first time Steele had refereed a Ch\u00e1vez fight since controversially awarding Ch\u00e1vez the victory by technical knockout against Meldrick Taylor after stopping the fight with only two seconds remaining over two years prior.\nThe fight\nCh\u00e1vez would earn the victory with an extremely lopsided unanimous decision. Ch\u00e1vez served as the aggressor for nearly the entire 12 rounds as the constantly retreating Camacho offered little offense throughout. There were no knockdowns, though Ch\u00e1vez came close to scoring a knockout in the third after hitting Camacho with a left-right-left combination while Camacho was stuck in his corner though Camacho survived the round. By the eighth round, Camacho's left eye was badly swollen after absorbing considerable punishment and Ch\u00e1vez would open a cut alongside Camacho's right eye though Camacho would nevertheless hold on and take Ch\u00e1vez the distance. All three judges had Ch\u00e1vez the clear winner with scores of 120\u2013107 (12 rounds to none), 119\u2013110 (10 rounds to one, one round even) and 117\u2013111 (nine rounds to three)\nFight card\nConfirmed bouts:\n^Note 1 For WBC Super Lightweight title ^Note 2 For WBA Super Middleweight title\nBroadcasting\n",
    "Mosque in Azerbaijan\nHaji Badal Mosque- A historical and architectural monument from the 19th century, a mosque. It is located in the \"Basqal\" State Historical-Cultural Reserve in Azerbaijan.\nThe mosque was included in the list of local importance immovable historical and cultural monuments by the 132nd decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan on August 2, 2001.\nAbout\nHaji Badal Mosque was built in 1854 in the Demirchibazar neighborhood of the Basqal settlement. The mosque was commissioned by Haji Badal  Mashadi agha oghlu. Haji Badal, from the Goshabulaq neighborhood of Basqal, constructed the mosque in honor of his daughter, Sitar\u0259. The construction work was supervised by builders Allahi and Mashadi Sattar.\nThe mosque's courtyard also contains a mausoleum. Seyid \u00dcmb\u00fclbanu is buried here. It is said that he was descended from Imam Jafar al-Sadiq (a.s). The inscription on the mausoleum's entrance indicates that Seyid \u00dcmb\u00fclbanu lived from 1855 to 1898 and was buried in the mausoleum.\nIn Azerbaijan, after the Soviet occupation, the fight against religion officially began in 1928. In December of that year, the Central Committee of the Azerbaijan Communist Party transferred many mosques, churches, and synagogues to the balance of clubs for educational purposes. While there were 3,000 mosques in Azerbaijan in 1917, this number decreased to 1,700 in 1927, 1,369 in 1928, and only 17 in 1933. The Haji Badal Mosque was also closed for worship during this period. Initially, weaving looms were installed in the building, and it functioned as a silk workshop. After World War II, the building was used as a warehouse for the Rural Consumer Society. In 1985, major restoration work was carried out on the mosque. The decaying ceiling, mosque floor, and the courtyard's stone covering were renewed. In 1989, the \"Basqal\" State Historical-Cultural Reserve was established in the area including the mosque.\nAfter Azerbaijan restored its independence in 1991, the mosque was reopened for worship. It was included in the list of local importance immovable historical and cultural monuments by the 132nd decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan on August 2, 2001.\nArchitecture\nThe mosque's ceiling is made of wood, and the floor is made of stone. The roof is covered with iron sheets. Inside the mosque, there are two arched and six rectangular windows. The prayer hall is divided into two sections, one for women and one for men. The women's section is located on a wooden balcony in the main hall. The prayer hall can accommodate 200 people. The pulpit is made of wood. The mihrab is decorated with various patterns by Basqal calligraphers. The mihrab also features the name \"Ali\" written in Arabic multiple times on a dove figure. This inscription, combined with a mirror effect, forms the name \"Muhammad.\" The mosque has one dome and one minaret. The height of the dome is 4 meters.\nSee also\nSheikh Muhammad Mosque",
    "\nThe Building housing the East African school of Library and Information Science at Makerere University Main Campus\nThe East African School of Library and Information Science, also known as EASLIS, is one of the schools that make up the College of Computing and Information Science (COCIS) at Uganda's largest university, Makerere University in Uganda.\nEASLIS is located at Makerere University's main campus in Kampala, just next to Uganda's oldest academic library which is Makerere University's Main Library (old entrance) and it is situated next to the junction that leads to the school of Chemistry and not far from the university's Main Administration Block and the Freedom Square.\nHistory\nThe school was founded in the year 1963  shortly after Uganda had gained independence and its establishment was meant to foster the development of library professionals in the East African countries which were three by then (Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania). The school was established with funds from United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and by the time of its establishment called the East African School of Librarianship.\nAchievements\nFrom the time of its establishment in 1963, EASLIS has developed in very many ways such the development of new and fully accredited academic awards. This one of the greatest achievements  because by the time the school was established it was only offering a certificate in library studies, after ten years in 1974 an additional certificate leading to the award of diploma in library science got introduced, a post graduate diploma in library science got introduced in 1975, and then in 1988 the Bachelor of library and information science was introduced. As you are reading this, EASLIS offers 2 Masters Programs that is  in information science and the other in records and archives management established in 1997 and 2016 respectively, 1 PhD in information studies since 2004 with a Doctor of Philosophy in Archival studies coming up. Another achievement for EASLIS is the increase in number of students at the school the development and establishment of other library and information science training schools in Uganda and East Africa can also be considered as one of the achievements of EASLIS since most of them were established under the leadership of the alumni of EASLIS. EASLIS currently has a partnership with the University of Boras in Sweden and the partnership has seen several cohorts of students from EASLIS go to Sweden in a specified student exchange program.\nLeadership\nEASLIS has had several leaders at its helm bearing the title of director or Dean.

It was released as the lead single from her seventeenth studio album, Tension II (2024), on 27 September 2024 by BMG and Minogue's company, Darenote, and was distributed in both digital, streaming and phyiscal formats. The song was written by Minogue, Norwegian singer-songwriter Ina Wroldsen and its producer Lewis Thompson. Musically, it is an upbeat electronic track with elements of club music and a heavy beat drop, and the lyrics focus on topics such as having a glamorous lifestyle. \n\"Lights Camera Action\" received positive reviews from music critics for its high energy, the overall sound, and Minogue's carefree vibe, with publications comparing it to Minogue's work on Tension (2023), especially \"Padam Padam\". Commercially, the song charted in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Sophie Muller directed the music video, which features Minogue in various guises\u00a0and performing the track on a staged set in Budapest, Hungary, and was met with positive remarks from critics.\nBackground and release\nFollowing the critical and commercial success of Minogue's sixteenth studio album Tension, Variety announced that the album\u00a0would be repackaged and released in 2024. The following month, Minogue hinted at working on new music during interviews at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, where she won the inaugural\u00a0Grammy Award for Best Pop Dance Recording for her single \"Padam Padam\". During the same year, she collaborated on several tracks, including \"Dance Alone\" with Australian singer Sia, \"Midnight Ride\" with South African singer Orville Peck and American DJ Diplo, \"My Oh My\" with American singer Bebe Rexha and Swedish artist Tove Lo, and \"Edge of Saturday Night\" with American DJ The Blessed Madonna.\nOn 19 September, Minogue teased an announcement on social media, and one day later, she revealed her seventeenth studio album Tension II, its release formats, her Tension Tour, and the album's lead single \"Lights Camera Action\". On 21 September, she teased the track at a listening party alongside the rest of the material from Tension II. Additionally, Minogue shared a short snippet of the track and its cover art; the artwork is a still from the single's music video, which was filmed in Budapest, Hungary. On September 27, BMG and Minogue's company Darenote released the single in digital and streaming formats. The same day, a digital EP featuring remixes by Confidence Man, Zach Witness, and Jaconda was released, including the original and extended mix. On 3 October, Minogue announced the single's release on three physical formats, which would be shipped from 17 October.\nComposition\n\"It\u2019s quite hypnotic. It\u2019s lots of fun, and you will probably just be throwing in \u2018Lights Camera Action\u2019 to general parlance from now.\"\n\u2014Minogue describing \"Lights Camera Action\".\n\"Lights Camera Action\" was written by Minogue, Ina Wroldsen and its producer Lewis Thompson. Minogue served as the song's vocal engineer, while Wroldsen provided additional background vocals and Thompson handled the programming and instrumentation. Minogue teased the song with Vogue Singapore saying, \"One of the writers that wrote 'Padam Padam' worked on this track so there\u2019s definitely a link. When I heard the demo, I just thought it was a fun song and what\u2019s important was this tension and hold that draws you in. It draws and then it drops and it\u2019s a pretty solid drop.\" Regarding the song's vibe, Minogue stated \"It\u2019s quite hypnotic. It\u2019s lots of fun, and you will probably just be throwing in \u2018Lights Camera Action\u2019 to general parlance from now.\" Furthermore, she stated to NME that the song follows \u201cthat similar kind of hypnotic quality\u201d that was similar to her single \u201cPadam Padam\u201d, and felt the lyric \u201cLights camera action, that\u2019s it\u201d was a bit \u201ccatchphrase-y\u201d.\nMusically, it is a club-inspired electronic track with \"raving synths\" and \"hard strutting beats\" that lasts two minutes and 42 seconds. Billboard writer Jessica Lynch compared \"Lights Camera Action\" to the sounds of Tension, writing that Minogue dives \"deeper into the electronic world, continuing the nightclub-inspired sound that made her last album Tension a global hit.\" Lynch also described the track as \"packed with high-energy beats fit for the dance floor.\" Rolling Stone editor Conor Lochrie expressed a similar sentiment, comparing it to the sounds of Tension and believing it \"captures the carefree spirit of the nightclub\". Similarly, Ky Stewart of Junkee felt the song was \"another homage to Kylie's favourite place: the dance floor\", while also noting that the track \"carries the dance-electronic atmosphere from Tension but it stands strong on its own. Pushing Kylie deeper into the genre, ushering her into yet another era.\" Classic Pop writer\u00a0Dan Biggane described it as a \"high energy club-inspired track\" that follows Minogue's dance-oriented contribution to \"Edge of Saturday Night\".

    "American non-rigid airship\nThe UConn Lumpy was a blimp designed, built, and flown by students at the University of Connecticut in 1975.\nDesign and development\nThe airship was built by five University of Connecticut engineering students as part of their Engineering Design Project class at the university, with Associate Professor Kurt Marshke acting as their faculty advisor. As part of the process, the students built a 9.2\u00a0ft (2.8\u00a0m) proof-of-concept model, to vet the design and the control mechanisms.\nThe gondola was made from aluminum tubing, with the pilot located near the front and the engine sited towards the rear.    \nThe envelope was sewn together using green surplus government issue parachutes, and contained three 25\u00a0ft (7.6\u00a0m) diameter weather balloons. The ill-fitting appearance of the envelope led to the craft being named Lumpy. The airship was powered by a 15\u00a0hp (11\u00a0kW) snowmobile engine, that had been salvaged from an earlier student project. The craft was fitted with an elevator, but not a rudder.\nOperational history\nThe Lumpy flew on Saturday, 24 May 1975 at the university's Storrs campus' soccer field. To abide by FAA regulations, a 500\u00a0ft (150\u00a0m) tether was attached to the airship.  Student Robert S. Meshako acted as pilot for the initial trials, with the other students later having turns at the controls. The airship reached a maximum altitude of 100\u00a0ft (30\u00a0m).\nSpecifications\nData from The Hartford Courant & Connecticut Daily CampusGeneral characteristics\nCrew: 1\nLength: 16\u00a0m (51\u00a0ft)\nDiameter: 7.6\u00a0m (25\u00a0ft)\nVolume: 200\u00a0m3 (7,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) gross\nEmpty weight: 204\u00a0kg (450\u00a0lb)\nPerformance\nMaximum speed: 16\u00a0km/h (10\u00a0mph, 8.7\u00a0kn)",

    "Species of fungus\nMeruliporia incrassata is a fungus that creates dry rot, predominantly in North America, where it can also be known by the diminutive \"poria\", which is also a recognized historical synonym for the genus.\nEnvironment, distribution and behaviour\nM. incrassata has a wide range of favourable temperatures, growing aerobically from the freezing point to approximately 38 degrees Celsius, by consuming cellulose but not lignin. While it is known as \"dry rot\", this is a misnomer linked to the resulting decay of the wood being powdery and cracked; the fungus, like many fungi, does require moisture. It is highly sensitive to temperatures above its range when compared to other rots.\nIt has the ability to conduct water up to 25 feet from a water source, meaning it can affect dry wood provided there is abundant water nearby, and can readily draw water from soil. It tends to reside in the Southern United States, but with some prevalence in the northern United States and southern Canada.\nIt's behaviour mirrors that of the other dry rot fungus Serpula lacrymans, which is more prevalent in Europe and extant in the northern United States. It seems to have spread substantially in the middle of the 20th century, coinciding with importation of softwood, but its origin is unknown, as it was found in the American South, Northeast, and Pacific Northwest.\nManagement\nM. incrassata can be managed through construction techniques that minimize water, and preventing penetration of the foundation by rhizomorphs. Crawlspace foundations that are poorly ventilated pose a high risk compared to slab foundations or well-ventilated and drained crawlspaces.\n",

On the lands leased by the Russian monarchs, the Cossacks harvested and processed grapes, which were then transported to St. Petersburg. The local church has been preserved to this day.\nAnother Russian church, dedicated to Martyr Alexandra, appeared in 1803 in the Budapest suburb of \u00dcr\u00f6m, on the site of the death of Grand Duchess Alexandra Pavlovna, daughter of the Emperor Paul I of Russia.\nLater, the Ofen Ecclesiastical Mission was established, which operated under the diplomatic mission and registered Orthodox people living in these places. For a long time, the Ofen Ecclesiastical Mission was a place of spiritual care and consolation for Russian people who found themselves in Hungary. Russian diplomats, members of the royal family, representatives of Russian culture, and politicians have repeatedly visited the church at the mission. The Ofen Mission had an good library, highly artistic expensive church utensils, the church was distinguished by the splendor of its decoration, and its staff, consisting of a priest, a deacon and four singers, allowed to lead a liturgical life and pastoral care of Eastern Orthodox believers at a decent level. Grave Russian Orthodox cemetery in Hungary with graves of clerics and choristers of the court church existed at the chapel. The mission ceased to exist after the outbreak of the First World War and the revolution in Russia.\nDuring interwar period, refugees from former Russian Empire settled in Budapest and created two Russian parishes: one had a house church and was under the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Russian Orthodox Churches in Western Europe, the other did not have a permanent church and was subordinate to the Synod of Bishops of the ROCOR. These parishes ceased to exist during the Second World War.\nAfter the war in 1945, Russian parishes came under the jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate. At same time, Patriarch Alexius I of Moscow and All Russia began receiving appeals from Hungarian Orthodox parishes, which were under the jurisdiction of the Serbian Orthodox Church before the First World War, and who sought to use the Hungarian language.\nHungarian Deanery\nOn November 11, 1949, by the decision of the Holy Synod of the ROC, \"Hungarian Orthodox parishes that have not been under anyone's jurisdiction to date or have lost Russian jurisdiction during the war are united into the \"Provisional Administration of Hungarian Orthodox Parishes\"\", the superior of which was appointed with the name \"Dean\" (administrator) Archpriest John Kopolovich; at the same time, the Hungarian Provisional Administration included: the parish of St. John Chrysostom in Budapest, the parish of the Assumption of the Mother of God in Budapest, the church in the name of the Great Martyr Queen Alexandra in \u00dcr\u00f6m, the parish in Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za, the parish in Sarkadkereszt\u00far, the parish in Szentes, the parish in Szeged with the church in the name of the Great Martyr St. George the Victorious, the Russian Orthodox Church in the name of St. Sergius of Radonezh in Budapest. The spiritual care of the parishes of the Hungarian Deanery was entrusted to the DECR Chairman.\nOn November 15, 1949, Patriarch Alexius I approved the Regulation (Charter) on the management of parishes that are part of the Hungarian Deanery, as well as a power of attorney to resolve and implement issues of his current life. The regulation noted that the Moscow Patriarchate accepts into its jurisdiction only those parishes that ask for it, are not subordinate to the archpastoral authority of another jurisdiction and are outside canonical care; Orthodox Hungarians were granted \"the right to perform all services and demands in the Hungarian language.\" Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Budapest became a cathedral.\nFrom August 10 to 31, 1951, courses were organized for Hungarian clergy and clergy in order to expand their theological knowledge and strengthen their liturgical skills.

He's recognized as the main perpetrator of the al-Rehab Palace Massacre and the killer of the Iraqi Hashemite royal family during the 14 July 1958 revolution.\nEarly life\nAbd al-Sattar Saba'a al-Aboussi was born in 1930 in the Bab al-Sheikh neighborhood near the Shrine of Abd al-Qadir al-Gillani in Baghdad, Iraq. Al-Abousii had two brothers, the first, Jawad, worked as a military officer and was killed on national duty, while the second, Rashid, was a student studying biology in the United States. A rumor has it that he was killed in an incident that some attributed to the Regent Abd al-Ilah because of his national activity against the royal regime, while others believe that his killing was by the CIA, as he was excelling in his studies and the Americans offered him to leave Iraq and stay in the United States. Because he refused these offers, he was physically liquidated. Nevertheless, this incident gave al-Aboussi a grudge against the Iraqi royal family.\nAl-Rehab Palace Massacre\nMain article: 14 July Revolution\nOn 14 July 1958, a military coup to overthrow the Iraqi monarchy took place. Eventually, the revolutionaries ordered military soldiers to guard the royal al-Rehab Palace that morning. King Faisal II exited the palace with a Qu'ran and a white flag, wanting to be surrendered in peace. However, al-Aboussi, an infantry trainer in the al-Washash camp who wasn't part of the movement, ran with enthusiasm to the palace. He urged the soldiers to fire at the palace and urged aggression. At the garden of the palace, al-Aboussi, alongside an Iraqi soldier named Mustafa Abdullah, opened fire on the royal family without warning. Killing Faisal II at age 23, alongside Abd al-Ilah and many of the princesses. Abd al-Ilah's corpse would then be dragged across al-Rashid Street where crowds stoned it.\nAftermath and death\nTwo years after the massacre, al-Aboussi regretted the killing of the royal family. In a recorded meeting with an Iraqi officer named Adnan Muhammad Nuri, al-Aboussi stated that the event made him lack sleep and have dreams where Faisal II, in white clothes, confronted him and asking repeatedly him \"Why did you kill me? Did I hurt you? Did I do something wrong? Why did you take away my life when I was very young?\" Soon after, other members of the royal family, including Princess Nafissa, started to appear in his dreams. In a later meeting with Nuri, al-Aboussi's dreams became worse after women he did not recognize blaming him for Iraq's conditions. At one point, al-Aboussi traveled to the Soviet Union for treatment but it did not help him.\nAl-Aboussi would eventually commit suicide in 1970 by shooting himself with a 5mm pistol bullet, dying twelve years after the massacre.\n",

    "Belgian national exhibition, 1830 to 1847\nFor the \"Exhibition of Products of Industry\" in Paris, France, see Exposition des produits de l'industrie fran\u00e7aise.\nThe Exhibition of Products of Belgian Industry (French: Exposition des produits de l'industrie belge), also known as the Exhibition of Belgian Industrial Products or simply the Belgian Industrial Exhibition was a national exhibition that took place in Belgium, devoted solely to the products of the national industry. The Belgian industrial exhibitions were held between 1830 and 1856.\nHistory\nAround 1815, global trade links disrupted by the American Revolution, French Revolution, and the Continental Blockade were gradually being reestablished. Belgium, asserting itself as an industrial power, concentrated on industry during the 1830s, particularly in the wake of the Belgian Revolution. Minister Charles Rogier introduced the idea of fostering the various branches of industry like the arts, encouraging the exhibition of foreign and Belgian products. A concept proposed and first carried out in France by Nicolas Fran\u00e7ois de Neufch\u00e2teau as the Exposition des produits de l'industrie fran\u00e7aise (English: Exhibition of Products of French Industry). The goal of an exhibition in Belgium was to promote Belgian craftsmanship and strengthen its economic and industrial ties with other countries.\n1st exposition (1830)\nThe National Exhibition of Products of Belgian Industry was first held in the City of Brussels, in the Kingdom of Belgium in 1830, amid its separation from the Netherlands. Drawing a large crowd from both the kingdom and abroad, the exhibition at the Palais de l'Industrie featured 1,020 exhibitors, with 813 Belgians submitting their products. Showcased were Tournai's tapestries, machines from Li\u00e8ge and Brussels, and fabrics from cities like Antwerp, Ghent, Bruges, Ypres, Courtrai, and Verviers.\n2nd exposition (1835)\nThe idea of another industrial exhibition emerged, giving different localities of the Kingdom of Belgium a chance to present their natural resources and specialized manufactured goods to the public. Following Leopold I's decrees on 30 July 1834 and 7 January 1835 relating to the exhibition of products of national industry, the Exhibition of National Industry Products was officially announced and scheduled to open in September 1835. Belgium's Minister of Interior Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my de Theux de Meylandt was tasked with the execution of the decrees. Nicolas-Jean Rouppe, Mayor of Brussels, was the chairman of the organizing committee. A jury of 25 members, appointed on 30 July 1834, included Goswin de Stassart, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Basse, F\u00e9lix Bethune, Raymond de Biolley, John Cockerill, Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Cauchy, Pierre Joseph David-Fischbach, Louis Prosper Gachard, L\u00e9opold Lefebvre, and Adolphe Quetelet. Among them, a president, vice-president, and general secretary were elected.\nThe exhibition of Belgian industrial products was held on 16 September 1835 at the Palais de l'Industrie in Brussels, with products exhibited in the six large rooms of the palace.  At the opening ceremony, Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my de Theux de Meylandt, Minister of the Interior, delivered a speech. It was attended by Brabant governor Goswin de Stassart, Jean-Joseph Raikem, and Auguste Duvivier, along with members of the Senate of Belgium and the Chamber of Representatives.\n3rd exposition (1841)\nA royal decree of 28 July 1840 constituted the exhibition of Belgian industrial products in 1841. Belgian Interior Minister Charles Liedts was assigned to oversee the decrees. An organizing committee included Brussels Mayor Guillaume Van Volxem, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Basse, Charles de Brouck\u00e8re, Auguste-Donat De Hemptinne, and more. The committee, established on 5 March 1841, had the duty of appointing a president, treasurer, and secretary from its members. On 10 March 1841, the committee elected Mayor Van Volxem as its president, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Basse as its vice president, Auguste t'Kint as honorary treasurer, and Louis Prosper Gachard as the general secretary with Fran\u00e7ois-Jean Wyns de Raucour taking over for Van Volxem on 25 July 1841 after succeeding him as mayor. By August, a jury of nearly 40 members was appointed to evaluate the exhibited products and award merit prizes, distinctions, or honorable mentions to the kingdom's manufacturers, artists, and craftsmen. On 15 July 1841, the Exhibition of Belgian Industrial Products was held in Brussels. Exhibitors represented the Belgian provinces of Brabant, West Flanders, East Flanders, Hainaut, Li\u00e8ge, Limburg, Luxembourg, and Namur.\n4th exposition (1847)\nOn 4 January 1847, a royal decree by Leopold I of Belgium established a fourth public exhibition of the products of the national industry to be opened in Brussels on 1 July 1847. At that time, Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my de Theux de Meylandt was the Minister of Interior and was tasked with executing the order. The commission, established in February 1847 to oversee the exhibition, included Brussels Mayor Fran\u00e7ois-Jean Wyns de Raucour, Charles de Br",

It is also responsible for managing official and confidential records related to government operations, administration, and policymaking. Unlike National Archives of Pakistan, NDW deals with more contemporary and often confidential records that are crucial for internal government functioning. The NDW operates under the jurisdiction of the Cabinet Division and plays a crucial role in ensuring that essential government records are systematically maintained, archived, and accessible.\nIn addition to serving in administration and policymaking, it also provides scholars and students with access to historical records that aid in research on these topics. The NDW also publishes document compilations on significant national issues, contributing to policy formulation. These publications are well-regarded in academic circles and have clarified misconceptions surrounding the Muslim freedom struggle, offering a more accurate context for Pakistan's national history.\nHistory\nThe National Documentation Wing, originally known as the National Documentation Center, was instituted in 1974 under the Cabinet Division of the government of Pakistan. Its establishment was necessitated by the historical circumstances surrounding its independence. At the time of partition in 1947, Pakistan inherited no central archive of official documents or research materials. Historically significant books and documents had been housed in the Imperial Library in Calcutta and the Imperial Record Office in New Delhi\u2014both of which remained in India and became inaccessible to Pakistan. Additionally, another significant collection was maintained in the United Kingdom at the India Office Library and Records, London. Beyond these, several other British institutions held records pertinent to Pakistan's history.\nDomestically, pre-partition records were dispersed across various provincial repositories, primarily in Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar, and Quetta. Faced with the fragmentation of these crucial documents, Pakistan found it necessary to retrieve relevant records from the United Kingdom and consolidate them into a central national archive. This led to the signing of several agreements with U.K. repositories for the acquisition of the essential records, enabling the establishment of Pakistan's own central documentation repository.\nOrganizational structure\nThe National Documentation Wing operates under the jurisdiction of the Cabinet Secretary and functions as a key archival and information management body. The NDW is organized into a hierarchical structure that ensures the systematic management of research, documentation, and archival processes.\nAt the apex of the NDW structure is the cabinet secretary, followed by the AS-II (assistant secretary II) and the JS (Doc/Devo), the joint secretary responsible for documentation and development. The director of the NDW directly reports to the joint secretary and oversees the day-to-day operations of the organization.\nThe NDW is divided into five specialized sections, each tasked with specific responsibilities:\nResearch Section: This section is managed by several deputy directors (I-IV) and assistant directors (I-II). It is responsible for conducting research activities pertinent to national documentation and archival needs.\nMicrofilming Unit: Led by a deputy director (Technical), this unit handles the microfilming of documents for preservation. It includes specialized personnel such as the microfilm officer, assistant microfilm officer, and conservation assistant.\nReference Library: This section is headed by a bibliographer and provides reference services to researchers, ensuring access to critical documentation and information.\nMain Library: The Main Library, also overseen by a bibliographer with additional charge, maintains the organization's core collection of texts and research materials.\nRecord Room: The Record Room, managed by a section officer (Records) and supported by assistants, is responsible for maintaining and organizing the archived records for easy retrieval.",

Coming from a family of medical professionals, for a time he studied medicine as well. After the French Revolution, in 1793, he became an aide in the French Arm\u00e9e d'Italie, enlisting in the 15th Light Infantry Demi-brigade in the next year and becoming a Sous-Lieutenant in 1795. In 1796 the Lieutenant began alternating between serving in the 7th and 6th Hussar regiments and staff duty for several years. He frequently was assigned as aide-de-camp to generals Barth\u00e9lemy Catherine Joubert and Louis-Alexandre Berthier, serving in the Italian campaigns. He tied close connections to the latter officer, eventually marrying his niece Josephine-Therese Virginie (1794\u20131833), a daughter of his brother C\u00e9sar Berthier, in 1810. Meanwhile, he was promoted to captain in 1797, Chef d'escadron after the Battle of Marengo in 1800, and Major in the 5th Hussar Regiment in 1803. In March 1804 he was awarded the Legion of Honour and a year later was named Colonel of the 23rd Mounted Chasseur Regiment.\nIn 1806 Bruy\u00e8re distinguished himself at the Battle of Jena and was promoted to General de brigade on December 31.

Mustafa Hafez moved to Gaza with his family in 1952 as chief of Egyptian military intelligence in Gaza.\nIn July 1952, the Egyptian monarchy was overthrown by the Free Officers Movement. For its support of the revolution, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (EMB) was rewarded with one of its members appointed as the head of Gaza, then a municipality of Egypt. In exchange, the EMB agreed to end cross-border attacks on Israel. However, following an Israeli raid into Gaza in 1955, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser appointed Hafez to organize raids of commandos, called fedayeen to infiltrate Israel. Fedayeen attack campaigns against military and civilian targets in southern Israel in August 1955 and April 1956 provoked Israeli responses.\nIsraeli intelligence chief Yehoshafat Harkabi proposed Operation Saris to assassinate Hafez and Lt.

    "Locality in New South Wales near Lismore\nTuncester, formerly known as Tunstall, is a locality within the City of Lismore local government area in New South Wales, Australia. It lies around 5\u20137\u00a0km (3.1\u20134.3\u00a0mi) outside the main town of Lismore. It is known for its historical self-managed Aboriginal reserve known as Cubawee, which was led by Pastor  Frank Roberts for most of its existence (1932\u20131965).\nTuncester lies on the traditional lands of the Bundjalung people, who inhabited the Richmond River area before European settlers arrived in the 1840s. It was named Tunstall after Tunstall Station, a pastoral lease taken up by amateur naturalist Augustus Adolphus Leycester and his business partner Robert Shaw in 1843, where they grazed cattle. In 1907 Tunstall was officially renamed Tuncester, a combination of Tunstall and Leycester. Leycester Creek runs through Tuncester.\nHistory\nTuncester\nEuropean settlement reached the Richmond River area in the 1840s, and from the 1860s, they cleared and fenced lands surrounding the town that the settlers created, and Aboriginal people in the area were forced to live in camps on the edge of town.\nIn 1843 Augustus Adolphus Leycester and Robert Shaw took up the pastoral lease over land which they called Tunstall, and created a cattle station. They had previously held a run called Maidenhead on the Severn River in New England, and herded their cattle overland to Tunstall via Woodenbong and Urbenville. The property was described in the New South Wales Government Gazette as covering an area of around 19,200 acres (7,800\u00a0ha), capable of grazing 1200 cattle. Its northern boundary was Duck Creek (now Leycester Creek), and it was surrounded by other stations. There was a boundary dispute in 1847 with neighbour Alfred Ward Stephens, who lived on a property called Runnymede, with both men claiming \"a large, fertile plain\" between the two. Shaw left, and Leycester eventually sold the property to Henry Garrard in 1849. Leycester remained as manager of Tunstall until 1850, before heading to California. He returned to New South Wales at some point, and in April 1859, with the help of Aboriginal man Davy, claimed to have retrieved the first egg of a rare type of lyrebird, Menura alberti. He had previously (in 1844) shot one of the birds, but did not realise that it was a new species at that point. He also wrote a detailed description of Menura alberti and its habits, which was later reproduced by an English scientist in a book of birds. However, ornithologist John Gould somehow managed to get a specimen to London before Leycester, so he was given no credit for the discovery. Leycester married widow Jemima Sophia Pritchard in Sydney in 1871, and died in England in 1892.\nIn 1886 the Campbell brothers were running around 2000 head on Tunstall Station, with the homestead on Leycester Creek. One of the brothers was John Campbell. His son Malcolm Lamont Campbell was born in 1875, and had to walk through scrub to get to school. Malcolm later bought another property in the location known as Tunstall, and died in 1936.\nAnother of the founding settler families in the location were the Bibo family. In 1873, Anton and Rosina Bibo and their three children arrived in Australia on the SS Great Britain, and settled in Tunstall (Tuncester), where they planted vineyards and made wine.\nThe name change to Tuncester was announced by the deputy postmaster-general on 4 February 1907, with the railway station and the post office taking on the new names soon afterwards. The Winsome Hotel is mentioned as being in existence at this time, with talk of a blacksmith and a store.  It was reported that the Hon. Thomas Thomson Ewing had said that the name was derived by combining Tunstall and Leycester, both of which were already in use in the Commonwealth. The Northern Star regretted that it could not be called Leycester was not available, as it would have perpetuated the name of\nA. A. Leycester, a \"fine type of colonist\". The newspaper said that it would otherwise have preferred to adopt the Aboriginal name of a nearby location.\nThe Tuncester Progress Association (formerly Tunstall Progress Association) was in existence by 1907, and celebrated the third anniversary of the Tuncester Methodist Church. In 1909 the mail service referred to the location as \"Tuncester (Tunstall)\".\nTunstall Public School was renamed Tuncester School. In 1907 it catered for 36 students, but there were many complaints that it was too hot for the children owing to poor ventilation.\nThe Government of New South Wales created Aboriginal reserves and in 1908, and some of the people in camps were moved to Dunoon Aboriginal Reserve at Modanville, where they were able to live independently. After the reserve was converted into an agricultural station run by white people in the 1920s, many residents began returning to the town camps, and Dunoon closed in 1929.\nIn 1973, the \"Tuncester School for Specific Purposes\" was established in 1973 for children with sp",

    "\nOdara Kofun (\u5c0f\u7530\u826f\u53e4\u58b3)  is a Kofun period burial mound, located in the Misumi neighborhood of the city of Uki, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. The tumulus was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1979.\nOverview\nThe Odara Kofun is located at the tip of a low hill close to the coast on the northern coast of the Uto Peninsula, which juts out west from the center of the prefecture. This tumulu is thought to have been an enpun (\u5186\u58b3)-style round tumulus with a diameter of about 20 meters, but most of the mound has been lost, and materials for the stone burial chamber have been piled up. Archaeological excavations conducted in 1978 confirmed that the area above the tomb is now farmland 7.2 meters above sea level,  and the earth had been removed to the point where the upper edge of the stone barrier around the stone chamber was visible on the field.  Four sides of the barrier remain, measuring 1.9 meters east\u2013west and 1.85 meters north\u2013south, with the height to the gravel bed inside being 0.65 meters. The barrier is made of shaped sandstone and is 8 centimeters thick.   The inside of the stone barrier is divided by two rows of partition stones running east to west, and two sections of corpse beds are set on the north\u2013south and west sides, with round stones the size of a fist laid on the bottom. The central passage between the corpse beds is slightly lower than the corpse beds. Around this stone barrier, some of the piled stones from the walls of the stone chamber remain. The burial chamber was constructed by digging a pit measuring 3.5 meters east to west and 3.2 meters north to south. The entrance to the burial chamber is thought to face west, and there is a V-shaped recess on the west side of the stone barrier. There is also a shallow V-shaped recess in the center of the two rows of partition stones.\nThe four sides on the stone barrier are decorated with carvings and colors, with four circles on the north side, three circles, two ridges, and two shields on the east side of the back wall, three circles on the south side, and two circles on the west side, all of which are contained within two horizontal lines. The circles are 17-18 centimeters  in diameter, with a central hole carved out, two string-like expressions on the top and bottom, and the shield is decorated with patterns, making it important as a stone barrier-type decorated kofun. There is also a red paint that appears to have been applied to the entire tomb, but its condition is poor. Excavated grave goods include knives, small beads, and bells, as well as fragments of human bones. The construction and decorative patterns suggest that the tumulus was built around the late 5th century. In order to prioritize preservation, not everything was excavated, and damaged stone was treated for preservation before being backfilled.Currently, only the outside of the stone chamber can be viewed under the roof. A life-size replica of the interior of the stone chamber, which cannot be seen on-site, is on display at the Kumamoto Prefectural Decorated Burial Mounds Museum.\nSee also\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Kumamoto)\nDecorated kofun",

    "\nQueen consort of Denmark\nMechtilde of Holstein  (c.\u20091218 \u2013 1288) was a Danish queen consort, married to King Abel of Denmark and later to Birger Jarl, Regent of Sweden.\nLife\nMechtilde was born around 1218, likely in Schauenburg Castle. She was the daughter of Adolf IV, Count of Schauenburg and Heilwig of Lippe. Her grandfather Adolf III had lost the County of Holstein to Danish King Valdemar Sejr in 1203, but her father regained it during her childhood after the German nobles defeated Valdemar in the Battle of Bornh\u00f6ved in 1227. On 25 April 1237 she was married to Duke Abel of Schleswig, King Valdemar's second eldest son, as part of a settlement between the two houses.\nWhen Abel became King of Denmark in 1250, she was crowned with him in Roskilde on 1 November. Abel died two years later in 1252, and was succeeded by his brother Christopher rather than her son Valdemar, who was imprisoned by the Archbishop of Cologne at the time.\nShe successfully secured Valdemar's release from Cologne and fought for her children's inheritance in the Duchy of Schleswig. In 1253, she secured Schleswig for Valdemar. After his death in 1257, she arranged for her next son, Eric, to take over the Duchy in 1260.\nShe made a pact with Jacob Erlandsen, archbishop of Lund, and then broke her vows from the convent by marrying the Swedish regent Birger Jarl in 1261. Birger had been one of her late husband Abel's major antagonists who had started up a military vendetta against him which was only stopped by Abel's death. After Birger's death in 1266, Mechtilde moved to Kiel, yet her own grave is with Birger's in Varnhem, Sweden.\nIn 1260, she had pawned the land between Eider and Schlei in southern Denmark to her brothers. After the deaths of her sons in 1272 and 1279, she inherited the land. Shortly before her death in 1288, she transferrred the land to her brother, Count Gerhard of Holstein. This caused much resentment in Denmark, where she was labeled the \"daughter of the Devil\" and accused of destroying letters from the Pope and emperor to King Valdemar.\nIssue\nQueen Mechtilde bore her first husband three sons and one daughter who reached adulthood:\nValdemar III (1238\u20131257); Duke of Schleswig from 1254 to 1257\nSophie (c.\u20091240 \u2013 c.\u20091284), married Bernhard I, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg\nEric I (c. 1241 \u2013 27 May 1272); Duke of Schleswig from 1260 to 1272\nAbel (1252\u20131279); born after his father's death, held several fiefs in Southern Denmark\nUnnamed daughter, died young\nNotes\n",

    "New York Hedge Fund\nBaker Brothers Advisors (BBA) is an American hedge fund management firm headquartered in New York. Despite its secretive nature, the firm is a leading biotechnology investor and manages over $20\u00a0billion in assets under management (AUM). \nBackground\nBBA was founded in 2000 by brothers Felix and Julian Baker. Their father is Keith Michael Baker, a history professor at Stanford University. Felix graduated from Stanford University with a B.S. in Biology, got a PhD in immunology and completed two years of medical school while Julian graduated from Harvard University with a B.A. in Social studies and then worked in the private equity arm of Credit Suisse First Boston. In 1994, the brothers started managing health care investments for the Laurence Tisch's family who owned the Loews Corporation before creating their own standalone business.\nThe brothers maintained close ties to the Tisch family and until 2017, the BBA office was in the 667 Madison Avenue skyscraper which was the same one as the Loews Corporation.\nBBA has been noted for its secrecy. It has no website and the brothers avoid the press as well as refuse to respond to phone calls for comments on their strategy.\nInvestment strategy\nBBA focuses on the biotechnology sector and been noted for its strong returns. Yale University\u2019s charitable foundation had $274\u00a0million invested with BBA in 2009 and by 2016 it rose to $1.08\u00a0billion, a combination of new money and profits of $393\u00a0million. In October 2019, BBA's investment value in two weeks increased by $1.4\u00a0billion due to Seagen and BeiGene. In August 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported that BBA's 25% stake investment in Seagen in 2003 resulted in a windfall gain of $8\u00a0billion when in 2023, Pfizer acquired Seagen for $43\u00a0billion which was considered one of the largest return on capital investments in the industry. Most of those gains were returned back to investors because it didn't see enough opportunities to deploy all that money at once.\nBBA's success has been built on advances in the science of genetics,  rise in biotechnology stocks and a period of dealmaking as large biopharmaceutical companies acquire up smaller innovators.  BBA relies on talented executives and scientists which are often discovered at companies it invests in and frequently end up on the board of directors in other companies in BBA's portfolio. As of 2019, BBA's top 20 disclosed public company investments eight have at least one board member who are BBA employees. Chief executives for 7 of those 20 companies also serve as board members for other companies that are BBA investments. Some welcome BBA's influence such as Eve Slater who has stated the representatives are very scientifically driven\" and \"active\". Others are more critical of BBA's influence such as RA Capital Management who felt BBA's influence in a now-rejected deal to merge BioCryst Pharmaceuticals with Idera Pharmaceuticals significantly favoured BBA at the expense of other shareholders.\n",

    "Azerbaijani entrepreneur and philanthropist\nNasib Piriyev (born June 2, 1981) is an Azerbaijani entrepreneur and philanthropist. He is the CEO of AzMeCo and PNN Group, which he co-founded along his father in 1994.\nBiography\nNasib was born on 2 June 1981, grew up in Baku, Azerbaijan until 1992 when the family moved to Moscow in Russia. In 1998, Nasib attended his undergraduate studies at American International University in London, England where he obtained a bachelor's degree in business administration in 2001. Later in 2006, Nasib enrolled at Moscow State Institute for International Relations in Russia to pursue a post-graduate degree, he graduated with Master of Economics in Oil and Gas Industry and Energy Security in 2008. Since 2011, Nasib holds a Candidate of Sciences in Economics from Higher School of Economics in Russia.\nBusiness career\nPNN Energy\nIn 2001, Nasib joined his family's business, which specialized in manufacturing parts for crude oil refineries and gas condensate processing units. As the head of business development, he led the company through a period of significant growth, overseeing the completion of several key projects across Central Asia. One of his early achievements was the construction and commissioning of a 500-ton-per-day gas condensate processing unit in Kungrad, Uzbekistan, in 2003. Two years later, in 2005, the company completed a 1000-ton-per-day oil refinery in Hairatan, Afghanistan. Continuing this expansion, Nasib led the establishment of a 500-ton-per-day oil refinery unit in Jalal-Abad, Kyrgyzstan, in 2006.\nAzMeCo\nIn 2007, the Piriyev family embarked on a project to develop a petrochemical complex in Garadag, Azerbaijan, as a methanol plant. Azerbaijan Methanol Company (AzMeCo) was established under the leadership of his father Nizami Piriyev. Nasib Piriyev took the role of CEO. As CEO, Nasib was involved in developing AzMeCo's corporate structure and governance, collaborating closely with the International Finance Corporation (IFC). The Piriyevs led in sustainable practice by incorporating green technologies at the company, including a CO2 capturing unit that boosted production and reduced emissions, establishing the company as a regional eco-leader.\nNasib led AzMeCo in securing a $120 million non-recourse loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The loan agreement signing ceremony at the AzMeCo site in Garadag was attended by Britain's former prime minister Tony Blair. In addition to EBRD, Nasib conducted negotiations with other major European banks. He also closed financing deals with Russian banks, VTB and Sberbank. In 2012, Nasib secured a take-or-pay methanol off-take contract with BP. The methanol plant was completed in 2014, with its first product exported to international markets via BP.\nPNN Lifestyle\nIn 2010, Nasib and the team diversified the family business into the food, consumer, and lifestyle sectors, where they acquired franchise and distribution rights for brands. Nasib founded AFK Ltd, which opened KFC in Azerbaijan in 2011. He later sold the company and established UFC Ltd, launching KFC restaurants in Kiev, Ukraine, in 2012.\nIn 2013, PNN Group secured the rights to open WH Smith bookstore in Baku, and began expanding the brand in the region. In 2013, Nasib opened a De Beers Jewelry boutique in Baku, marking the start of his fashion group's expansion. The group later acquired several luxury stores on Baku's Neftchilyar Avenue, including Alfred Dunhill, Brunello Cucinelli, Santoni, Nina Ricci, and Sergio Rossi.\nAfter UNESCO recognized chovgan as part of Azerbaijan's Intangible Cultural Heritage, Nasib founded the Baku Guardians, the first Azeri professional polo club in London. In May 2014, he organized an exhibition match and charity event with HRH Prince William captaining the team. In September 2014, he organized the Chovgan Twilight Polo event in Richmond, Surrey, with Princess Tamara Czartoryski and Natalia Vodianova. The event featured an exhibition match with Baku Guardians and included a Gala night with a charity auction raising funds for the War Child and the Naked Heart Foundation.\nIn 2015, Nasib, his wife Olena, and perfumer Maria Candida Gentile launched Lankaran Forest perfume, inspired by Azerbaijan's Lankaran forest. The fragrance, housed in a Lalique crystal flacon, debuted at an after-party for the 2nd Buta Festival at the Royal Academy of Arts in London.\nInvestments\nPNN Capital\nAfter relocating to London in 2015, Nasib focused on restructuring PNN Group and started investing in publicly traded businesses, including on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in China, since 2019.\nIn 2020, Nasib joined a consortium that made a \u00a3400 million bid to acquire a controlling stake in West Ham United FC and redevelop the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. The bid, which required owner David Sullivan to relinquish control, was rejected as Sullivan chose to sell a 27% stake to Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky for \u00a3200 million whil",
    "Cuban statesman\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  Garc\u00eda Menocal and the second or maternal family name is  Deop.\nPablo Garc\u00eda Menocal was a Cuban military officer, statesman, and a former quartermaster of the Cuban Rural Guard.\nBiography\nEarly History\nPablo Antonio Garc\u00eda Menocal y Deop was born in the 19th century. His father, Gabriel Garc\u00eda-Menocal, had many children, including Pablo Garc\u00eda Menocal and his brothers Tom\u00e1s, Gustavo, Fausto, Gabriel, Serafin, and Mario. His brother Mario Garc\u00eda Menocal became the 3rd President of Cuba.\nCuban Liberation Army\nPablo joined the Cuban Liberation Army in the mid-1890s, fighting in the Cuban War of Independence. He and 19 accomplices were arrested in Penns Grove, New Jersey and taken to Wilmington, Delaware on August 30, 1895, for their involvement in a filibustering expedition to Cuba that violated U.S. neutrality laws. In March 1898, a month before the Spanish\u2013American War, he accompanied his brother on a 200-man march from Holgu\u00edn to Havana Province, relieving Gen. Alejandro Rodriguez as Chief of the 5th Army Corps operating in the provinces of Matanzas and Havana. After the Treaty of Paris on December 10, 1898, and the intervention of the U.S. Military Government in Cuba, the Liberation Army was disbanded, while the Spanish Civil Guard's exit fueled banditry.\nCuban Rural Guard\nGarc\u00eda Menocal and Leonard Wood convened in Havana in December 1899 to form a 350-man rural guard from Cuban War of Independence veterans for law enforcement. Pablo Garc\u00eda Menocal was named Major and Quartermaster of the Cuban Rural Guard on May 20, 1901, by Military Governor Wood. Under the U.S. Military Government, he oversaw the distribution of equipment, supplies, and logistical operations for the newly consolidated National Rural Guard. The Rural Guard was responsible for protecting rural districts and maintaining public order in post-independence Cuba.\nPolitical career\nEstra Palma Administration\nDuring the first term of Cuban President Tom\u00e1s Estrada Palma, Col. Pablo Garc\u00eda Menocal was appointed Cuban consul to Veracruz in Mexico on August 11, 1902. His resignation was sent on November 14, 1904.\nMenocal Administration\nOn May 20, 1913, Mario, his brother, took office as the third President of Cuba, holding the position until May 20, 1921. Rumors in November 1913 suggested Menocal offered two Cuban warships and led a commission of several Cubans to Nogales, Sonora to confer with Constitutional Army General Venustiano Carranza. By 1914, Pablo Garc\u00eda Menocal resided in Bayamo. As a member of the National Conservative Party, he ran as a candidate for Oriente Province and, after the 1914 Cuban parliamentary election, was elected to the Cuban House of Representatives. He worked in the Department of Public Works.\nFollowing the controversial 1916 Cuban general election, former President Gen. Jos\u00e9 Miguel G\u00f3mez rose in arms against the Menocal administration. In March 1917, Pablo Menocal was the commander of the militia forces in Oriente Province. The Menocal forces were encamped in Contramaestre. That year in Santiago de Cuba, Pablo and his brother Fausto Garc\u00eda Menocal had been captured and held hostage by the Liberal forces of Gen. Jose Gomez.\nHe spent the summer with his family in New York in July 1919, and by September, the Cuban congressman boarded the steamer Mexico to head back to Cuba.\nDeath\nPablo Garc\u00eda Menocal died in Havana, Cuba in March 1924. According to police, he took his own life by shooting and had been suffering from ill health.\nFamily\nHe married Mar\u00eda de la Piedad Mart\u00ednez y Lufr\u00edu, and together they had four children: Teresa, Margarita, Esther, and Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda Menocal y Mart\u00ednez.\n",

    "Television station in Roraima, Brazil\nRede Amaz\u00f4nica Boa Vista (channel 4) is a Brazilian television station based in Boa Vista serving as an affiliate of TV Globo for the state of Roraima, owned-and-operated by Grupo Rede Amaz\u00f4nica, a company of businessman Phelippe Daou.\nHistory\nThe arrival of television in Roraima goes back to the eves of the 1970 FIFA World Cup, when the federal territory of Roraima was identical to the one that rocked the rest of the country, when the Brazilian Football Team was still heading towards its third football championship. At that time, telecommunications and electronics technician, Esdras Avelino Leit\u00e3o, was struggling to provide family and friends with images of the World Cup final in Mexico City, which was won by Brazil.\nHowever, since the late 1960s, some people watched television images through receivers spread across the city. At the time, electronics technician Esdras Leit\u00e3o was already capturing images of the World Cup final in Mexico, in which Brazil became three-time champions. The feat was only possible due to their persistence, which, by improvising small satellite dishes, managed to capture images generated by the Costa Rican TV channel (Teletica), Venezuelan networks (RCTV Canal 2, Venevisi\u00f3n Canal 4, TVN Canal 5, CVTV Canal 8, all coming from Caracas) and even American network affiliates (NBC, ABC and CBS). And this was possible with a certain regularity and reasonable quality.\nThis technician's fight allowed, for almost four years, friends and relatives to watch television every day, with a very varied program. Most of the time, with the tracking system developed, images were only captured from other countries, almost always from Venezuela.\nWhen he took over the Government of the Territory of Roraima, on March 12, 1970, aviator colonel H\u00e9lio Costa Campos became aware of the adventures undertaken by technician Esdras. Connected to the telecommunications area, the aviator colonel could not understand why a territory with more than 30 thousand inhabitants could not have the privilege of watching television. H\u00e9lio Campos was excited by the story. In a preliminary survey it was discovered that there were 70 television sets throughout the territory, all capturing images from foreign broadcasters.\nEnthusiastic about the will of the people of Roraima, the governor made a public commitment in April that all inhabitants \u201cwould watch the opening of the 1974 FIFA World Cup, scheduled for the month of June, with images generated by a station installed in Roraima\u201d.\nThe governor's determination was fundamental to the idealization of the objective. In record time (15 days) the building for the TV installations was constructed. Journalist Laucides Oliveira was assigned to monitor the station's implementation project. But the person who actually ended up supervising the project was the governor himself.\nThe battle to acquire equipment for the broadcaster to start operating began. At the same time, the Ministry of Communications released the signal for the Government of Roraima to begin relaying programming, with much of the equipment borrowed from TV Educativa do Maranh\u00e3o and with material and programming recorded by TV Amazonas.\nOn June 14, 1974, at 6pm, all Roraima residents watched the official inauguration of TV Roraima Canal 2, the first in operation in Brazilian territory in the Northern Hemisphere. Once inaugurated, the first images generated by TV in Roraima were from the World Cup in West Germany. To make this possible, a war operation was mounted. As there was no equipment in the territory to capture the images, the inauguration program was recorded in Manaus (800 kilometers from Boa Vista) and a plane kindly provided by the government of Amazonas was responsible for bringing the governor and the tapes with all the information to Roraima. the recorded program. Only in this way was it possible, four hours after the end of the opening and the first game (draw between Brazil and Yugoslavia, held in the late afternoon of June 13), for the people of Roraima to watch the same images that had already been shown in almost the entire country. From the first day of operation, unlike TV stations at the time that started in black and white, TV Roraima already generated color images. And the program lasted until 10pm.\nThe next day, another war mission for the station to start operating took place. The problem was the lack of programming. Films, shows, among other productions, were purchased outside Roraima. Difficulties still prevented local programming. Even so, the station's director, Laucides Oliveira, decided to air local news, taking advantage of the news broadcast by R\u00e1dio Nacional. A radio studio was set up inside the TV. Presenters C\u00e9lio Antunes and Benjamin Monteiro repeated on TV what they did on the radio, from the booth they read the entire half-hour newscast. Viewers listened to the news and watched images (slides) of Boa Vista. As it was not possible to capture image",

He has served as the head of space weather at the British Antarctic Survey. Horne has been a Fellow of the Royal Society since 2021, and was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 2022.\nEarly life and education\nHorne received his first degree in Physics from the University of Sheffield from 1974 to 1977 before completing a PhD at the University of Sussex from 1977, completing in 1980 or 1982.\nResearch\nHorne joined the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in 1981 as a Higher Scientific Officer before moving to the British Antarctic Survey in 1984.\nHorne received recognition for his work on wave-particle interactions in space. In particular, Horne showed how plasma waves had the capability to accelerate charged particles to relativistic speeds, and that these particles had an effect on the formation of the radiation belts. In 2005, he received awards from NASA and ESA for his work showing that very low frequency plasma waves are a major cause of the Van Allen belts, which was validated with the 2012 launch of the Van Allen Probes.\nFrom 2011 to 2017, Horne led two collaborations- SPACECAST and SPACESTORM- to successfully produce operational forecasts of space weather impacts on satellites, which are now used by the European Space Agency and other clients. Horne's contribution to the SPACESTORM collaboration led directly to significantly higher risk estimates of the risk of space weather to satellites, and led to revised assessments of space weather on the National Risk Register in 2017 and 2020.\nLeadership roles\nHorne was vice-president of the Royal Astronomical Society from 1997 to 1999 and the chair of Commission H at the International Union of Radio Science from 2005 to 2008. He led the SPACECAST and SPACESTORM European collaboration projects from 2011 to 2014 and from 2014 to 2017 respectively.

    "Sides A, B, C, and D of the Waldenbuch pillar.\nThe Waldenbuch pillar is a four-sided sandstone monument of the early to middle La T\u00e8ne culture. The pillar, which probably originally extended to an anthropomorphic bust akin to the Holzgerlingen figure, only survives in a fragmentary form. It is presently at the Landesmuseum W\u00fcrttemberg.\nDiscovery\nThe Waldenbuch pillar was found in the forest of Greuthau in 1864. The find spot is not far from the Schl\u00f6sslesm\u00fchle\u00a0 and from the town of Waldenbuch. It was found 2km from the La T\u00e8ne archeological site of Federlesmad near Echterdingen, and only 10km from the supposed findspot of the Holzgerlingen figure. The pillar was thereafter placed in the Kunstkammer of the local duke. The stone is now in the collection of the Landesmuseum W\u00fcrttemberg.:\u200a11\u200a:\u200a281\u200a\nDescription\nThe pillar is made from made from Stubensandstein, a kind of local sandstone. The pillar is four-sided and measures 125cm by 47cm by 27cm.:\u200a281\u200a The stonemasonry has been described as of \"astonishing quality\" for the period.:\u200a284\u200a\nThe pillar has a 25cm tall rectangular base, which juts slightly further out than the rest of the pillar. Above the base is a 65cm section on which tendril-like, curvilinear designs have been carved in relief. Each side of the pillar has its own relief, separated by framed edges. On sides A, B, and D these designs curve (lyre-like) into lobes. On side C the designs are much more slender. Above this section is a 15cm tall band of upright rectangles (separated by vertical gashes) encompassing the pillar. Above the band on sides A, C, and D, a mixture of cross and T-shaped designs are carved. On side B, a human forearm is visible, with the fingers curling around to grip side A. The forearm on side A is backgrounded by more lobed curvilinear designs. Lobed curvilinear designs also appear above the T-shape designs on side A. Nothing above this is visible due to uneven damage to the top half of the pillar.:\u200a282\u2013283\u200a:\u200a208\u200a\nDating and interpretation\nThe Waldenbuch pillar has often been compared with the Holzgerlingen figure.\nThe pillar has been securely classified within the La T\u00e8ne period, but much like the Holzgerlingen figure its dating within that culture is not secure.:\u200a281\u200a Paul Reinecke dated it to the middle La T\u00e8ne on the basis of a perceived similarity between the lyre-like curvilinear designs on the pillar and those on some middle La T\u00e8ne Yugoslavian scabbards. Paul Jacobsthal classifies it within the early La T\u00e8ne period:\u200a281\u200a and J. V. S. Megaw conjectures a similar date, between the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, on the basis of the slender tendrils which recall the early La T\u00e8ne Waldalgesheim style and other such analogies of design elements. However, Megaw calls his dating \"by no means obligatory\", noting that such an early date as his means that the pillar \"constitute a unique piece for the period.\" Design elements do not allow a secure dating, as prehistorian Wolfgang Kimmig\u00a0 has noted; elements of the pillar, like the decorative T's and crosses, appear as far back as the pre-La T\u00e8ne Hallstatt culture. Archaeologist Josef R\u00f6der has noted marks of both pointed and flat chisels on the stone, which he claims was not possible before the Hellenistic period (that is, before the 4th century BC).:\u200a279\u200a\nGiven the proximity of the find spots and the resemblance between the arms of the Waldenbuch pillar and the Holzgerlingen figure, the two stones have often been compared to one another.:\u200a283\u200a Though there is no direct information about the upper half of the pillar,:\u200a269\u200a if it carried on into an anthropomorphic bust as the Holzgerlingen figure does we can make some deductions about the lower half. T. G. E. Powell has suggested that the curvilinear designs are to be interpreted as folds in the figure's lower garment and the band of rectangles is to be interpreted as a belt or square-cut cape.:\u200a270\u200a Unlike the Holzgerlingen figure, arms are visible on only one side, so it is not safe to assume the original figure was two-faced like the Holzgerlingen figure.:\u200a208\u200a\nSee also\nPfalzfeld obelisk\nNotes\n",
    "A A-4K Skyhawk of No. 75 Squadron at the Royal Australian Air Force's base at Darwin, 1984\nThe Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) operated Douglas A-4 Skyhawk attack jet-aircraft from 1970 to 2001. The aircraft equipped the RNZAF's Strike Wing, serving with No. 75 Squadron and, from 1984, No. 2 Squadron. In late 2001, the aircraft were controversially withdrawn from service without being replaced. Some were donated to aviation museums in New Zealand and Australia and the remainder were sold to Draken International, a private military contractor to the United States, in 2012.\nBackground\nMain article: Douglas A-4 Skyhawk\nThe Douglas A-4 Skyhawk was developed by the Douglas Aircraft Company in the early 1950s as a subsonic jet fighter for the United States Navy (USN). Entering service with the USN in 1956, the Skyhawk was an immediate success and flew in a number of conflicts around the world, ranging from the Vietnam War to the Falklands War, as well as the First Gulf War. With 2,960 examples of the various versions of the aircraft being built, it was operated by the air forces of several nations, including New Zealand. Its relatively low weight meant that it was able to incorporate new technologies as these were introduced and also carry a heavy payload, which led to a prolonged service life for the type, extending well into the 1990s.\nAcquisition\nIn 1962, when Air Vice-Marshal Ian Morrison became New Zealand's Chief of Air Staff (CAS), the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) was in a period of decline, with an aging fleet of aircraft. On taking office, he sought to reinvigorate and reequip the RNZAF. His initial focus was to remedy the deficiencies in the RNZAF's transport and maritime capabilities, before addressing its air combat capacity. At the time, the RNZAF's Strike Wing was composed of one squadron equipped with English Electric Canberra jet-powered medium bombers, plus another that had a complement of de Havilland Vampire jet fighters albeit non-operational.\nBy May 1966, a number of aircraft had been considered as replacements for the RNZAF's Strike Wing, among them the General Dynamics F-111 bomber, Northrop F-5 Tiger, and the F-4 Phantom, the latter being the preference of both Morrison and the Defence Council. In contrast, for cost reasons the New Zealand Government preferred the F-5 Tiger. However, no decision had been made by the time Morrison's term as CAS ended later in the year. His replacement, Air Vice-Marshal Cameron Turner, together with Chief of Defence Staff Lieutenant General Leonard Thornton, continued with the efforts to modernise the Strike Wing. A key argument for this was the importance of being seen by New Zealand's allies, particularly Australia and the United States, as being able to contribute in an air combat role.\nOne of the RNZAF Skyhawks, top, flying in the United States in 1969 prior to being shipped to New Zealand. The other Skyhawk is intended for delivery to Israel\nCost continued to be an issue, and in late 1967 Turner was asked to reevaluate the Douglas A-4C Skyhawk. This had been among the aircraft considered for the air combat role in 1966 but it had not been favoured at the time due to its inferior performance relative to the likes of the F-4 Phantom. By 1967, the A-4F Skyhawk was in service and this was much improved from the earlier A-4C, having performed well in the Vietnam War. Approval was given for a team of RNZAF personnel to go to the United States to assess the Skyhawk for its suitability for its intended operational role in New Zealand. The leader of the team, Air Commodore T. Gill, reported that it would be an ideal replacement for the Canberras.\nThere were two purchase options; the first was for eighteen Skyhawks, twelve being single-seat A-4Fs and six two-seat TA-4Fs for training requirements, while the second was for ten single-seat and four two-seat examples. The RNZAF preferred the first option, with Gill recommending that four of the single-seat A-4Fs be set aside to allow for accidental losses. However, when the proposal was put to the New Zealand Government, it opted for the second option. Including spares and the necessary supporting equipment, the total cost was NZ$23 million, about NZ$936,000 per aircraft, with a further NZ$1.6 million to be spent upgrading airfield facilities. Approval for the purchase was made on 10 June 1968.\nSkyhawk A-4K/TA-4K\nIn service with the RNZAF, the Skyhawks, based on the A-4F model, were designated as A-4K and TA-4TK respectively. The RNZAF requested some minor changes be made to its aircraft: a drag chute, a VHF radio and armament pylons suitable for carrying the AIM-9 Sidewinder missile. A notable inclusion was a dorsal hump aft of the cockpit, intended to house additional avionics controllers that was required to operate electronic countermeasures (ECM). The wiring and controller hardware for the ECM were present in the RNZAF aircraft but without the controllers, which were never installed, were inoperable. ",

    "Chernobyl disaster liquidators\nMonument to Those Who Saved the World in the city of Chernobyl, dedicated to Chernobyl liquidators\nOn the night of April 26, 1986 at 1:23 an explosion occurred at the fourth power unit of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. A large fire broke out on the roof of the reactor. To extinguish this fire, the guards of the 2nd paramilitary fire department for the protection of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant under the command of Volodymyr Pravyk and the 6th independent paramilitary fire department for the protection of the city of Pripyat under the command of Lieutenant Viktor Kibenok were alerted. Leonid Telyatnikov a major of the internal service took full control over the situation and extinguishing the fire. About forty firefighters took part in extinguishing. After the explosion, a large amount of cesium-137 isotopes rose into the air together with the smoke, with an increase in the radiation background. All firefighters who participated in extinguishing received large doses of radiation. Many firefighters died of Acute radiation syndrome and radiation burns in a fairly short period of time, but there were survivors. For their heroic actions and courage, firefighters were presented with state awards of the Soviet Union, and some received the highest title of Heroes of the Soviet Union, among them Viktor Kibenok (posthumously), Volodymyr Pravyk (posthumously) and Leonid Telyatnikov, who survived and after treatment continued his service in the Soviet, and then in the Ukrainian fire brigade. In 1995, he retired with the rank of major general, and in 2004 he died of cancer in the city of Kyiv. In addition to firefighters, station employees took part in the extinguishing, they were engaged in turning off equipment, clearing debris, extinguishing fires on equipment and other work, as well as police officers who helped with the organization of the initial and subsequent liquidation, and doctors who were the first to treat the injured from the explosion and radiation.\nThe exploits of the liquidators were noted in Ukraine at the state level. Many of them were posthumously awarded state honors of Ukraine, in particular the highest - Hero of Ukraine with the award of the \"Golden Star\" order. In 2006, firefighters Mykola Vashchuk, Vasily Ignatenko, Tytenko Mykola, Volodymyr Tyshur, Volodymyr Pravyk and station worker Oleksandr Lelechenko were posthumously awarded this title.\nOn June 24, 2019, the title of Hero of Ukraine with the awarding of the \"Golden Star\" order was awarded to: Ananenka Oleksiy, Bespalova Valery and Boris Baranov (posthumously). They were three volunteers who, a few days after the explosion, descended into the bubble pool and emptied it. This was done so that the spewed nuclear material of the destroyed reactor did not reach the water. In this way, the three engineers prevented a steam explosion, thereby saving the world from an even greater disaster.\nCommemoration\nIn many cities of Ukraine, monuments have been erected, memorials and plaques have been opened to heroes, and various objects have been named after them. In the memorial complex of victims of the Chernobyl disaster in Kyiv, busts of Chernobyl firefighters Heroes of Ukraine have been installed.

    "German ironclad gunboat\nFor other ships with the same name, see SMS Crocodill.\nSMS Crocodill was an ironclad gunboat of the Wespe class built for the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) in the 1870s. The ships, which were armed with a single 30.5\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) MRK L/22 gun, were intended to serve as part of a coastal defense fleet.\nDesign\nMain article: Wespe-class gunboat\nPlan and profile of the Wespe class in their original configuration\nDevelopment of the Wespe class of ironclad gunboats began in the 1850s, after the first ironclads were introduced during the Crimean War. Through the 1860s, the Federal Convention examined various proposals, which included plans to build at least eight vessels, to as many as eighteen armored warships. The decision was finalized based on the fleet plan conceived by General Albrecht von Stosch, the new Chief of the Kaiserliche Admiralit\u00e4t (Imperial Admiralty), in the early 1870s. He envisioned a fleet oriented on defense of Germany's Baltic and North Sea coasts, which would be led by the ironclad corvettes of the Sachsen class. These were to be supported by larger numbers of small, armored gunboats, which became the Wespe class.\nCrocodill was 46.4 meters (152\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) long overall, with a beam of 10.6\u00a0m (34\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in) and a draft of 3.2 to 3.4\u00a0m (10 to 11\u00a0ft). She displaced 1,098 metric tons (1,081 long tons) as designed and 1,163\u00a0t (1,145 long tons) at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 3\u00a0officers and 73 to 85\u00a0enlisted men. She was powered by a pair of double-expansion steam engines that drove a pair of 4-bladed screw propellers, with steam provided by four coal-fired cylindrical fire-tube boilers, which gave her a top speed of 11.2 knots (20.7\u00a0km/h; 12.9\u00a0mph) at 800 metric horsepower (790\u00a0ihp). At a cruising speed of 7 knots (13\u00a0km/h; 8.1\u00a0mph), she could steam for 700 nautical miles (1,300\u00a0km; 810\u00a0mi).\nThe ship was armed with one 30.5\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) MRK L/22 gun in a barbette mount that had a limited arc of traverse. In practice, the gun was aimed by turning the ship in the direction of fire. The Wespes were intended to beach themselves on the sandbars along the German coastline to serve as semi-mobile coastal artillery batteries. The armored barbette was protected by 203\u00a0mm (8\u00a0in) of wrought iron, backed with 210\u00a0mm (8.3\u00a0in) of teak. The ship was fitted with a waterline armor belt that was 102 to 203\u00a0mm (4 to 8\u00a0in) thick, with the thickest section protecting the propulsion machinery spaces and ammunition magazine. The belt was backed with 210\u00a0mm of teak. An armor deck that consisted of two layers of 22\u00a0mm (0.87\u00a0in) of iron on 28\u00a0mm (1.1\u00a0in) of teak provided additional protection against enemy fire.\nService history\nProfile drawing of the Wespe class as they appeared c. 1900\nThe keel for Crocodill was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in 1878, and she was launched on 13 September 1879. Named for the earlier wooden gunboat Crocodill, she was delivered to the navy on 26 May 1880. She remained out of service initially, before being commissioned on 20 September for sea trials under the command of Kapit\u00e4nleutnant (KL\u2014Captain Lieutenant) Emil Freiherr von Lyncker. Her initial testing was completed by 20 October, when she was decommissioned in Kiel and allocated to the Marinestation der Ostsee (Baltic Sea Naval Station).\nCrocodill was commissioned for her first active period of fleet duty on 22 April 1884, under the command of KL Ernst von Frantzius. She joined her sisters Hummel, Camaeleon, Natter, and Biene in the newly created Armored Gunboat Division. They carried out unit training over the summer, and they joined the rest of the main fleet for the annual maneuvers in August and September. Crocodill was decommissioned again on 30 September. The ship remained out of service for the next decade, and in the early 1890s, she underwent a modernization. The work included installing a pair of 8.7\u00a0cm (3.4\u00a0in) L/24 built-up guns, a pair of 37\u00a0mm (1.5\u00a0in) Hotchkiss revolver cannon, and two 35\u00a0cm (14\u00a0in) torpedo tubes in her bow, both of which were below the waterline. Crocodill next returned to service on 13 October 1894, assigned to the Armored Gunboat Reserve Division, which was based in Danzig. She served as the flagship of the division until 5 May 1895, when she was replaced by her sister M\u00fccke. Crocodill was decommissioned at that time for periodic maintenance at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Danzig.\nOn 3 August 1897, Crocodill was recommissioned under the command of KL Richard Koch. She remained in service through 1 October, during which time she resumed flagship duties for the gunboat division. She remained in reserve for the next two years, before recomissioning for her last period of active service, which lasted from 27 July to 24 September 1900. KL Siegfried von Jachmann captained the ship that year, and she once again served as the divisional flagship. Crocodill was struck from the naval register on 18 March 1911 and then used as a target ship. In ",

    "\nJan Hladik' (21 May 1927 \u2013 3 June 2018) was a Czech textile artist, printmaker, painter and illustrator.\nLife\nIn 1942\u20131944, during World War II, Jan Hlad\u00edk studied at the State Graphic School in Prague under Prof. Jaroslav Vodr\u00e1\u017eka and Prof. Karel  M\u00fcller. His classmates were V\u00e1clav Sivko, Vladim\u00edr Fuka or Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Medek. In 1945, he was admitted to the High School of Arts and Crafts, and chosen by prof. Alois Fi\u0161\u00e1rek, head of the studio of applied painting and textile art. In 1947, he took a month-long study tour to Paris and Brittany with his classmates and prof. Fi\u0161\u00e1rek to see contemporary French and world art. Jan Hlad\u00edk completed his studies in 1950 with a collection of decorative fabrics made using the serigraphy printing technique.\nSoon after the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'\u00e9tat, the Hlad\u00edk family was persecuted. Jan Hlad\u00edk was conscripted into the PTP labour camp, the family property was confiscated, his father was arrested and imprisoned. After serious electric shock injury at the military service and his return to civilian life, Jan Hlad\u00edk found it difficult to find commissions in the field of textile design, despite the support of Prof. Fi\u0161\u00e1rek. He made his living as a printmaker, selling drawings and ceramics, and occasionally illustrating books.\nIn 1955 he married Jenny Hr\u0161elov\u00e1 and returned to handmade textile art. For the exhibition of the newly established Group 7 of textile artists (1958) he wove the first tapestries with abstract motifs based on his own graphic designs. Alongside his original tapestries, which became his main artistic output from 1959 onwards, he created graphic sheets (woodcuts, linocuts, etchings and especially mixed media using assemblage), tempera drawings and oil paintings.\nIn 1960, he was accepted into the Union of Czechoslovak Visual Artists (S\u010cVU) and exhibited textile works at the Milan Triennial. In 1963 he had his first solo exhibition in Prague and in 1965 he was invited for the first time to the Biennale Internationale de la Tapisserie in Lausanne where he was then selected again in 1967, 1969, 1977 and 1979. He became one of the founders of the Pierre Pauli Association (1979).\nHlad\u00edk's friendship with Josef Topol and the actors of Divadlo za branou (Theatre behind the gate) in the early 1970s inspired him to create tapestries of theatre scenes (Tom\u00e1\u0161ov\u00e1, T\u0159\u00edska, and others).\nHe had been a member of Czech Graphic Artists Association Hollar since 1967 and had his first exhibition of graphic work in 1970 just before the regime's liquidation of the association's activities and the closure of the exhibition hall. His second solo exhibition of graphic art took place more than 12 years after the fall of the communist regime in 2002.\nHe died in June 2018 in Prague.\nHonours and prizes\n1966 Award for Applied Arts, Union of Czechoslovak Visual Artists\n1967 Honorable mention for participation in EXPO 67, Montreal\n2007 Hollar Foundation Award\nWork\nPrintmaking, drawing, painting\nThe first drawings and graphic sheets produced at the end of the war in high school were studies of Cubist principles of painting and image construction, influenced especially by Bohumil Kubi\u0161ta. Bohumil Kubi\u0161ta's monograph was brought to Jan Hlad\u00edk in 1944 by his classmate Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Medek.\nA trip to Paris in 1947 and direct experience with the artworks of the Surrealists, Picasso, Braque and other painters led to a gradual relaxation of artistic expression.

He subsequently pursued graduate studies at Princeton Theological Seminary and engaged in playwriting at the Iowa Writers' Workshop and New York University.\nGrowing up in a mill town in the years following the Great Depression provided the rich images, characters, and experiences that fueled and populated his writing. Early in his career, Must taught secondary school in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and New York City where his deep love of books, and the process of writing them inspired a generation of students, many of whom ultimately made the arts their vocation or avocation. During the 1960s and 1970s, a time of great experimentation in the theater, he wrote, directed, and co-produced several off-off-Broadway plays in collaboration with artist John Hawkins.\nIn the 1990s, Must refocused on his writing, producing a body of work that included five novels, three short story collections, and numerous pieces published in literary journals and anthologies.

    "\nLighthouse in Azores, Portugal\nLighthouse\nThe Serreta Lighthouse (Farol da Ponta da Serreta or Farol da Serreta), is located on top of a cliff, on the Ponta do Queimado, in the parish of Serreta, on the northwest coast of Terceira Island, in the Azores, Portugal. There have been four different lighthouses on this site, the most recent being a 14-metre-tall white with red horizontal bars fibreglass tower, equipped with a fifth-order optical device, powered by solar energy. It is situated within the Nature Park of Terceira. \nHistory\nThe \"General Plan for Lighting and Marking the Coasts and Maritime Ports of the Mainland of the Kingdom and Adjacent Islands\", was presented in 1883 by the Lighthouse and Marking Commission, which had been established in 1881. This envisaged the construction of a lighthouse at Ponta da Serreta (Serreta Point). This document provided for the construction of a lighthouse with a fourth-order lense and a range of 17.5 nautical miles (nm) in moderate weather conditions and 8.5 nm in foggy conditions.\nThe proposal to install a lighthouse at the westernmost point of Terceira Island was defended by Commander Jos\u00e9 de Almeida de \u00c1vila, from Faial, in an article published in 1891 entitled \"An opinion on the lighting of the Azores archipelago\". The idea was adopted in the \"Lighthouse Design and Marking Plan for the Adjacent Islands\", drawn up in 1902, which identified the exact location and the characteristics of the light required, opting for a fifth-order device showing a white flash followed by a red one every five seconds.\nConstruction of the lighthouse began in 1907, according to a project drawn up by the engineer Jules Dourot. The work to construct the white, quadrangular masonry tower was carried out by Augusto Alves, a mason, and Jacinto Ferreira, a carpenter. The Serreta Lighthouse began operating on 4 November 1908. It had a focal plane 96 m above mean sea level. The original tower was 11 metres high and was initially equipped with a fifth-order rotating catadioptric device, with a focal length of 187.5 mm, which had a constant-level lamp as its light source. The rotation was produced by a clockwork machine. The optical device was replaced in 1935 by a fourth-order one and in 1947 the light source was changed to an incandescent lamp powered by petroleum vapour, giving the lighthouse a range of 25 nautical miles. It was electrified in 1958 through the installation of two diesel generator sets, and the light source was changed to a 3000 W electric incandescent lamp, giving a light range of 30 nautical miles. In 1960, due to its poor condition, the optics were replaced by a fourth-order one, which had been removed from the Lighthouse of Ponta de Sagres in the Algarve on the Portuguese mainland.\nThe access road to the lighthouse was opened when the lighthouse was built. It often became impassable after heavy rains. In 1968, a single-lane, tarred access road to the lighthouse was built, connecting it to the road that runs around the island. The road now goes beyond the lighthouse, taking tourists down to a sea level viewpoint.\nDuring an earthquake on 1 January 1980, the lighthouse and the keepers' houses were damaged. Cracks in the lighthouse led to the loss of 2.5 kg of mercury, although it remained in operation. The following year, four prefabricated houses were temporarily installed to house the lighthouse keepers. Plans to restore the tower were abandoned in 1982 as they were considered too expensive. As an alternative, at the end of 1983, the old 12-metre cylindrical iron tower of the extinct Cacilhas Lighthouse, just south of the capital Lisbon on the opposite bank of the Tagus estuary, was moved to Terceira. The Cacilhas light had been deactivated on 18 May 1978 due to the construction of the new  passenger ferry terminal and because it served little use as an aid to navigation.\nThe original lighthouse was demolished, a small temporary lighthouse was installed and began to operate in 1983, with a sixth-order light, while the tower brought from Cacilhas was assembled. The assembly work was completed in 1986 and a new fifth-order optical device was installed. The tower was 15 metres high. In 1987 the lighthouse was remodelled and automated using the SIRIUS system, and began to operate with solar energy, with a generator set being kept as a reserve. In 2000, the SIRIUS system was replaced by the ELCO-12 system.\nThe Cacilhas lighthouse after its return to its original site\nIn 2001, the Almada City Council, of which Cacilhas is a part, requested the Directorate of Lighthouses to return the tower.  It was disassembled in the first quarter of 2004, and re-erected close to its original site in Cacilhas in 2009. Not used as a lighthouse, it is now considered part of the Almada Naval Museum. It was replaced at Serreta by a 14-metre fibreglass tower, which is white with red stripes and equipped with a fifth-order optical device, also powered by solar energy, emitting a white flash every six",
    "Parliamentary electoral district in Austria\nEast Tyrol (German: Osttirol), also known as Electoral District 7E (German: Wahlkreis 7E), is one of the 39 multi-member regional electoral districts of the National Council, the lower house of the Austrian Parliament, the national legislature of Austria. The electoral district was created in 1992 when electoral regulations were amended to add regional electoral districts to the existing state-wide electoral districts and came into being at the following legislative election in 1994. It is conterminous with the district of Lienz in the state of Tyrol. The electoral district currently elects one of the 183 members of the National Council using the open party-list proportional representation electoral system. At the 2019 legislative election the constituency had 39,536 registered electors.\nHistory\nEast Tyrol was one 43 regional electoral districts (regionalwahlkreise) established by the \"National Council Electoral Regulations 1992\" (Nationalrats-Wahlordnung\n1992) passed by the National Council in 1992. It was conterminous with the district of Lienz in the state of Tyrol. The district was initially allocated one seat in May 1993.\nElectoral system\nEast Tyrol currently elects one of the 183 members of the National Council using the open party-list proportional representation electoral system. The allocation of seats is carried out in three stages. In the first stage, seats are allocated to parties (lists) at the regional level using a state-wide Hare quota (wahlzahl) (valid votes in the state divided by the number of seats in the state). In the second stage, seats are allocated to parties at the state/provincial level using the state-wide Hare quota (any seats won by the party at the regional stage are subtracted from the party's state seats). In the third and final stage, seats are allocated to parties at the federal/national level using the D'Hondt method (any seats won by the party at the regional and state stages are subtracted from the party's federal seats). Only parties that reach the 4% national threshold, or have won a seat at the regional stage, compete for seats at the state and federal stages.\nElectors may cast one preferential vote for individual candidates at the regional, state and federal levels. Split-ticket voting (panachage), or voting for more than one candidate at each level, is not permitted and will result in the ballot paper being invalidated. At the regional level, candidates must receive preferential votes amounting to at least 14% of the valid votes cast for their party to over-ride the order of the party list (10% and 7% respectively for the state and federal levels). Prior to April 2013 electors could not cast preferential votes at the federal level and the thresholds candidates needed to over-ride the party list order were higher at the regional level (half the Hare quota or 1\u20446 of the party votes) and state level (Hare quota).\nElection results\nSummary\nDetailed\n2010s\n2019\nResults of the 2019 legislative election held on 29 September 2019:\n2017\nResults of the 2017 legislative election held on 15 October 2017:\n2013\nResults of the 2013 legislative election held on 29 September 2013:\n2000s\n2008\nResults of the 2008 legislative election held on 28 September 2008:\n2006\nResults of the 2006 legislative election held on 1 October 2006:\n2002\nResults of the 2002 legislative election held on 24 November 2002:\n1990s\n1999\nResults of the 1999 legislative election held on 3 October 1999:\n1995\nResults of the 1995 legislative election held on 17 December 1995:\n1994\nResults of the 1994 legislative election held on 9 October 1994:\n",
    "William Kelsey Fry during World War I\nSir William Kelsey Fry (18 March 1889\u201326 October 1963) was a British dental surgeon who, with Harold Gillies, was an important figure in the development of oral and maxillofacial surgery during World War I.\nHe was born in 1889 in Greenwich, the son of Kate n\u00e9e Kelsey and Edmund Fry, a stone merchant. He was educated at Hurstpierpoint College and in 1908 entered Guy's Hospital, obtaining the M.R.C.S. and L.R.C.P. in 1912 and L.D.S. in 1913. On qualifying as a doctor and a dental surgeon in 1914 he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) and served in World War I as a regimental medical officer attached to the Royal Welch Fusiliers. Fry landed in France with the 7th Division in October 1914. He was wounded during the Battle of Festubert in May 1915 while carrying out his work under heavy fire and was awarded the Military Cross. In 1916 as a Captain he married Hannah Ruby Preston. He was wounded again on 26 August 1916. Fry spent two years at the Front and tended the wounded at Neuve Chapelle, \nAubers Ridge, Festubert and the Somme.\nThe former Cambridge Military Hospital in Aldershot in Hampshire Later he worked with Harold Gillies, initially at the Cambridge Military Hospital in Aldershot in 1916 where they pioneered the development of oral and maxillofacial surgery. At Aldershot Gillies and Fry put together a multidisciplinary team that treated both bony and soft tissue elements in the development of this new medical specialty. In 1917 they continued this work at the newly established Queen Mary's Hospital in Sidcup, Fry's experience at this time led to his essay on \"Treatment of injuries of the jaws\" which was awarded the Cartwright Prize of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.\nGroup photograph at Queen Mary's Hospital in Sidcup (1917). Harold Gillies (seated third from left), Henry Tonks (standing third from left), and William Kelsey Fry (standing extreme right)\nAs plastic surgery was a newly emerging medical discipline, Harold Gillies realised that teamwork was important in facial reconstruction and he therefore worked closely with the dental surgeons. At Sidcup Fry led the team of dentists and dental technicians. He and his team had \"an active role in designing the inventive dental prostheses that returned masticatory function to patients with jaw injuries.\" Under the direction of Fry and Gillies Queen Mary's Hospital became an international centre for training surgeons in plastic and oral surgery.\nFry returned to Guy's Hospital as a lecturer after WWI where he became established as one of the leading oral surgeons in the country. Here he developed innovative treatment techniques for patients with cleft palates and other facial deformities. He became President of the British Dental Association and his medical textbook The Dental Treatment of Maxillofacial Injuries (1942) became a leading text in the field.\nDuring World War II Fry worked with Archibald McIndoe at the maxillofacial and plastic unit of the Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead. During this time Fry was a civilian consultant in dental surgery in the E.M.S., and had a leading role in establishing treatment centres for maxillo-facial injuries throughout the United Kingdom. He was appointed a civilian consultant to the Royal Air Force and the Ministry of Health. In 1948 he was awarded the diploma FDS by the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and from that year until his death Fry was a member of the Board of Faculty of Dental Surgery there, and was Dean of the Faculty (1950-53). On his retirement from Guy's Hospital in 1949 he became a Lecturer in Oral Surgery at the Eastman Dental Institute. He was appointed CBE in 1948 and was knighted in 1951. Fry became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1953, and in 1955 he was made a D.Sc by McGill University. Until just before his death Fry served as a member of the Board of Governors of Guy's Hospital and the S.E. Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. In his later years he was an enthusiastic golfer.\nSir William Kelsey Fry died at his home in Bexhill-on-Sea in 1963 leaving a widow, Lady Hannah Ruby Fry (1891-1979), and a son, Ian Kelsey Fry (1923-2018), who had followed him into the medical profession.\nKelsey Fry Road in Gun Hill Park in Aldershot is named to commemorate him.\n",
    "Law on government acquisition of land\nThe Land Acquisition Act 1966 is a Singaporean law on government acquisition of land for public housing projects.\nBackground\nPrior to the Land Acquisition Act 1966, the law for the government acquiring private land was the Land Acquisition Ordinance 1955, which empowered the government to compulsorily acquire private land for public projects. However, it did not prevent landowners from increasing the price of their land, which increased the land acquisition cost and therefore made low-cost public projects to be difficult.\nIn the 1950-60's, the population of Singapore was increasing, which caused informal settlements and shophouses to be overcrowded. This made the government to establish the country's public housing agency, the HDB, and to build HDB residential estates to relocate its population. However, in order to do so, land must be acquired cheaply. Land was also important as the government planned to use it for industrial development as well as to build roads, schools, and community and recreational facilities. To effectuate it, the Land Acquisition Act 1966 was introduced in parliament and was passed on October 26, 1966. It went into effect a year later on June 17.\nImpacts\nAfter the commencement of the Land Acquisition Act, it expedited the government's land acquisition programme. In fact, between 1959 and 1984, the government acquired roughly a third of Singapore's land mass (43,713 acres).\n",

It is dedicated to Lord Shiva, particularly associated with the deity's form known as Ekapada Murthy.\nHistory\nThere is also a legend that in the past, when a dispute arose over the boundary between Mallabhum and Samantabhum, Lord Mahadev himself resolved the issue. However, according to another popular legend, Lord Shiva himself meditated to resolve this boundary dispute between the two kingdoms. At the junction of the two borders, as a symbol of unity, King Raghunath Malla of Mallabhum built the Ekteswar Shiva Temple and initiated the celebration of Ekteswar's Gajan festival. According to Acharya Jogeshchandra Roy bidyanidhi, \"The Vedas mention 'Eka Padeshwar,' which over time has transformed into the name 'Ekteswar.' In the Ekteswar Temple, Lord Shiva is worshiped as 'Ekapada Murti' (one-legged deity). Such a form of Shiva is not found anywhere else, making it extremely rare.\"\n",

Also, the brother of Napoleon, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte lived here shortly as the King of Westphalia. In 1811, the city palace was destroyed by a fire and not restored afterwards.\nLocation\nA city map of Kassel dating 1736 shows the city palace laying at the south side of the city, with to its left the Karlsaue park\nThe city palace was located at an elevation of 156 meters above sea level, at the site of the current regional government office (German: Regierungspr\u00e4sidium) overlooking the Fulda river. Presumably, a Frankish royal court named Chassalla stood here already around the year 913.\nHistory\nThe Kassel City Palace seen from the South West\nThe First Castle of Henry I\nAt the site of the Frankish Royal Court (German: K\u00f6nigshof), the first castle was built by Henry I, Landgrave of Hesse in 1277 and later expanded by his successors. In 1935, foundations and cellar vaults from the 14th and 15th centuries were uncovered. Strategically located on the high banks of the Fulda River, the castle secured the vital river crossing for long-distance trade routes. The original structure was likely made mostly of wood, with a stone fortification added in 1386.\nThe Second Castle: The Ludwig Building\nBetween 1462 and 1466, Landgrave Louis II replaced the first castle by a new building: A rectangular, southwest-to-northeast-oriented structure arose, consisting of a two-story stone base and a one-story timber-framed upper floor. The castle included a manor house and several separate buildings surrounding an inner courtyard.\nThis so-called Ludwig Building was situated on the northwest side of the grounds, parallel to the old stone road. After a gunpowder explosion, it soon had to be renovated, and over the following years, it was continually expanded and improved.\nTowards the end of the 15th century, the castle's fortifications were renewed. Starting in 1502, Landgrave William II had a larger extension built on the side facing the Fulda River, a wing made of red sandstone, which was called the \"Rothenstein Wing\" due to its red colour.\nThe Renaissance Castle\nThe Kassel City Palace, the lower city and the bridge over the Fulda river around 1770\nThe fa\u00e7ade facing the Fulda River\nThe Kassel City Palace seen from the Fulda River\nIn 1523, Landgrave Philip I started transforming the city of Kassel into a modern fortress. He eventually ordered the partial demolition of the old castle, which had been expanded multiple times. Between 1556 and 1562, using parts of the existing structure, fortress architect Antonius Riemenschneider constructed a Renaissance-style palace in its place.\nConstruction started in November 1556 with the kitchen building, which had a central entrance on the southwest side, followed by the adjacent city-facing bakery building in 1560. The women's quarters, located near the Brothers Church, were expanded between 1560 and 1562.\nPhilip's son, William IV, the first Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, had the Gothic \"Rothenstein Wing\" renovated between 1570 and 1574. Court painters Caspar van der Borcht and Jost vom Hoff played key roles in decorating the interiors. William IV also established the first observatory in Central Europe at the palace, consisting of two balconies on the southern front with a balustrade walkway.\nWilliam IV's son, Landgrave Maurice, continued the transformation by renovating the chapel between the Rothenstein Wing and the women's quarters. The palace now became a three-story, four-wing structure with an almost square layout around a spacious courtyard, featuring a high roof with numerous dormer windows. Polygonal spiral stair towers stood at the corners of the courtyard.\nThe palace remained largely unchanged until the French invasion in December 1806, serving as the residence of the House of Hesse-Kassel. Although there were various plans in the 18th century to modernize the palace, such as a proposal by Charles de Wailly .\nThe last ruler of Hesse-Kassel to reside in the city palace was William I, who was elevated to Elector in 1803. He had to leave his land on 1 November 1806, shortly before it was occupied by France.\nDestruction: the 1811 Fire\nThe Kassel City Palace around 1805\nAfter the creation of the Kingdom of Westphalia by decree of Napoleon on 18 August 1807, the new king of Westphalia, Napoleon's brother J\u00e9r\u00f4me, moved into the Kassel City Palace on 10 December 1807.\nOn the night of Saturday to Sunday, 24 November 1811, flames suddenly broke out in the palace. J\u00e9r\u00f4me's court architect, Grandjean de Montigny, had removed many of the palace's stoves and replaced them with a heating system using copper pipes beneath the floors, similar to underfloor heating.

    "WD 1425+540 is a white dwarf in the constellation Bo\u00f6tes.\nWD 1425+540 (G200-39) is a white dwarf that accreted an exocomet (exo-Kuiper Belt Object, exo-KBO). This is evident from the pollution of the white dwarf atmosphere with metals, especially the pollution with nitrogen. WD 1425+540 is the first white dwarf with detected nitrogen. The white dwarf has a K-dwarf companion called G200-40, about 40 arcseconds away. The white dwarf nature of the object was discovered by Greenstein in 1974.\nThe white dwarf is the prototype of the DBA spectral type that indicates both hydrogen and helium in its atmosphere, which was discovered in 1977. Metal pollution was first discovered in 1988 in the form of small amounts of calcium. Observations with Keck and Hubble, published in 2017, showed that the white dwarf is polluted with the elements carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, magnesium, silicon, sulfur, calcium, iron and nickel. The total mass of the heavy elements is around at least 10% of the mass of Pluto. The presence of nitrogen and its high abundance in WD 1425+540 hints at the presence of nitrogen ice or ammonia ice on the surface of the accreted body. The C/O ratio indicates that the body was dominated by magnesium silicates. High abundance of oxygen also shows that the body was rich in water ice, but also had carbon ices (e.g. dry ice, CO ice). The presence of water ice in the accreted body could also explain the high amount of hydrogen in the atmosphere of WD 1425+540. The excess in oxygen indicates that the exo-KBO would have been made of 30% water ice. The total abundance resembles the composition of the comet Halley. A study in 2021 showed that the abundance of the accreted material is in agreement with the metal abundance of the companion star G200-40.\nWhen WD 1425+540 was a main-sequence star, it had a mass of about 2 M\u2609 and therefore the exo-KBO would have been 120 astronomical units from its star, or 3 times the distance of the Kuiper Belt from the sun. When the star lost mass during the asymptotic giant branch stage, the Kuiper-Belt analogue would have expanded to beyond 300 au. Simulations have shown that the pollution might have followed the eccentric Kozai\u2013Lidov mechanism.\nSee also\nList of exoplanets and planetary debris around white dwarfs\nG238-44 another white dwarf with nitrogen pollution",

    "Political party in India\nIndian political party\nAwami Ittehad Party (abbr. JKAIP) is an Indian political party in Jammu and Kashmir union territory. Founded in 2013 by Engineer Rashid, the party has been active in local politics, including the 2024 Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election. During the 2024 assembly elections, they reportedly advocated for the unconditional release of political prisoners and a ban on liquor sales as part of their manifesto.\nHistory\nFoundation\nThe Awami Ittehad Party (AIP) was founded in 2013 by Sheikh Abdul Rashid, commonly referred to as Engineer Rashid, who had previously been an independent member of the Legislative Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir representing the Langate constituency. Rashid had gained prominence for his views on the Kashmir conflict and his advocacy for peaceful resolutions to the region's political disputes. AIP was established as an alternative to both the mainstream political parties in Jammu and Kashmir, such as the National Conference (NC) and the People's Democratic Party (PDP), as well as separatist factions.\nIdeology\nAIP's core ideology revolves around the right to self-determination for the people of Jammu and Kashmir, as outlined in United Nations resolutions. The party calls for a plebiscite to allow the people of the region to decide their future, either with India or Pakistan or as an independent state. In addition, AIP advocates for demilitarization, the removal of laws like the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), and an end to human rights abuses by security forces in the region. AIP also focuses on improving socio-economic conditions for Kashmiris, addressing unemployment, and ensuring political rights for the people of the region.\nPolitical activities\n2014 Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly Election\nThe party contested the 2014 Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly elections on multiple seats, with its founder, Engineer Rashid, retaining his seat in Langate.  Despite not winning additional seats, AIP emerged as a vocal force within the state legislature. Engineer Rashid frequently brought attention to the plight of civilians in Kashmir, speaking on issues like the heavy militarization of the region, human rights violations, and economic hardships.\n2024 Baramulla Lok Sabha election\nIn the 2024 Indian general elections, AIP's leader, Engineer Rashid, contested the Baramulla parliamentary seat from prison. Rashid had been in detention under the Public Safety Act (PSA) and was later arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in 2019 on charges related to terror funding. Despite his ongoing legal troubles and his inability to actively campaign, Rashid achieved victory, securing the seat with high margin.\nRole in the Gupkar Declaration\nIn October 2020, AIP became part of the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), a coalition aimed at restoring the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, which had been revoked following the abrogation of Article 370. This alliance opposes the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories and seeks to restore its autonomy.\nCoalition in 2024 assembly polls\nIn a political development, the Awami Ittehad Party (AIP) led by Engineer Rashid has formed an alliance with former members of the Jamaat-e-Islami for the 2024 Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election.\n\nSee also\nEngineer Rashid\nKashmir conflict\nArticle 370 of the Constitution of India\nPeople's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration\nJammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly elections\nJammu and Kashmir (union territory)",

    "Television channel\nNCN Television is the television service of the National Communications Network, Guyana. Created in 1988 as an independent government outlet, it was merged with GBC in 2004 and became a part of the current NCN.\nHistory\nNCN TV's predecessor, Guyana Television Company, was licensed in October 1987, going on air on January 1, 1988, broadcasting an experimental service for an hour a week on Sundays using a 400-watt transmitter donated by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on VHF channel 10. A merger of the three government media units was set for late March 1992.\nAn assessment taken by the National Frequency Management Unit in 1992 said that GTV was the only television station in Guyana to comply with technical and programming requirements. In 1996, with the release of an official VHF frequency plan for Georgetown by the NFMU, GTV planned to move to channel 11, a decision pending approval of the Broadcast Authority Bill. The station's executive chairman Earl Bousquet said that the move in frequencies was to prevent co-channel interference, as Neil Blackman's NBTV occupied channel 9.\nOn March 1, 2004, GTV and GBC merged to become NCN. In 2006, it took over the lottery broadcasts that formerly aired on VCT Network, strengthening its position in the market.\n",
    "Extinct genus of fishes\nObaichthys is an extinct genus of lepisosteiform fish that inhabited South America, Africa, and southern Europe during the mid-Cretaceous period. It closely resembled modern gars, which it was related to, but differed in its spiny scales and restricted mouth gape. The genus name references the Yoruba spirit \u1eccba, who is worshiped in the Candombl\u00e9 religion in Brazil.\nThe following species are known:\n\u2020O. africanus Grande, 2010 - Cenomanian of Morocco (Kem Kem Group), Algeria (Gara Samani Formation), Egypt (Bahariya Formation), Spain (Arenas de Utrillas Formation & La Caba\u00f1a Formation), Portugal (Tent\u00fagal Formation), and France (Aquitaine Basin)\n\u2020O. decoratus Wenz & Brito, 1992 (type species) - Early Albian of Cear\u00e1, Brazil (Romualdo Formation)\nIndeterminate scales of Obaichthys, formerly referred to chimera genus \"Stromerichthys\", are known from the Albian of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Notably, these scales are morphologically more similar to those of the concurrent O. decoratus from Brazil than with the younger O. africanus, despite the latter being on found on the same continent. The species O. laevis was also initially described in this genus, but was later moved into its own genus, Dentilepisosteus, which is the only other confirmed genus in the family Obaichthyidae. Much like Obaichthys, Dentilepisosteus is known from both South America and Africa.\nObaichthys remains have been discovered in formations representing both freshwater and marine environments, suggesting it was a euryhaline fish that primarily inhabited freshwater & brackish environments but was tolerant of saltwater, much like modern gars. Evidence for such a euryhaline behavior has been found in the distribution and localities of both Obaichthys species.\n",
    "Board game released in 2022\nBox Cover of Captivade\nCaptivade is a British pursuit-evasion and deductive themed board game for 2-4 players. It was released in 2022 by Mewstone Games.\nThe name is a portmanteau of \"capture\" and \"evade\", the two objectives of the players.\nBackground theme\nIn Captivade, each player controls a prisoner who has just escaped from Pentonville Prison, London. These prisoners are:\nRuby Red - a socialite who has a taste for the finer things in life. She is awaiting extradition to China after being jailed for her role in a series of casino heists\nGary Green - a fixer from East London. He was jailed for arson and GBH after burning down a rival snooker club\nBeatrice Bleu - an eco-warrior who was raised in France and graduated from St Andrews University. She was jailed after being accused of masterminding the destruction of gas extraction sites in the North Sea\nYousef Yellow - a delivery driver from Birmingham. He was jailed for trading exotic animal furs\nPlayers also each control an MI6 agent, tasked with capturing the escapees and returning them to Pentonville. However, each agent sympathises with one of the escapees and will not turn them in. These agents are:\nAgent Brown - who sympathises with Ruby Red\nAgent White - who sympathises with Gary Green\nAgent Black - who sympathises with Beatrice Bleu\nAgent Silver - who sympathises with Yousef Yellow\nGameplay\nCaptivade is played on a board displaying a map of the world, with 92 city locations highlighted. All escapee and agent pawns start in London, however the escapee pawns are not physically placed on the game board. Instead, players track the location of their pawns on (included) set pieces of paper as they move throughout the game. Other players must then use their agents to track down the other escapees, with the player being caught last winning the game.\nThe game is played over 6-10 rounds, stylised as 'weeks' within the game. Each week consists of three phases:\nRun - At the start of each week, each player can move their escapee up to two city connections away (four in Week 1). Players can also use their limited funds to take flights between cities with an airport symbol\nRoll - Once all escapees have moved, each player must roll a dedicated dice to determine what events occur during the current week. This often includes an escapee being spotted at a previous location, forcing the player to give certain information about their whereabouts. The dice roll may also cause the player to draw an event card. These cards can have effects for all players, such as an airport closing or cities becoming impassable\nChase - Players can now move their allocated agents and attempt to capture the escapees using information gathered throughout the game. Agents may move up to three connections, searching the last two locations they move to. If an escapee is discovered, they are captured and returned to Pentonville Prison. Captured players may still control their agent to find other players. If a player moves their agent to a location containing their escapee, the agent provides them with money, rather than capturing them\nOnce the set number of weeks has passed, the players who have successfully evaded capture win the game.\n",

    "Military unit\nThe Shkval Battalion is a Ukrainian penal battalion that was formed in 2024 after the Verkhovna Rada passed Registered draft law No. 11079 which allowed for the mobilization of convicts into the Ukrainian Army.\nHistory\nFormation\nThe battalion was formed in 2024 after a bill was passed and then signed into law by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky which allowed for the mobilization of convicts into the Ukrainian Army.\nLike other Russian and Ukrainian penal military units, members of the battalion are recruited from prisons on the premise that successful service would result in a deduction of their sentence. Members of the battalion are offered wages ranging from $500 to $4,000 per month, depending on time spent on the front line. However, they are required serve in the military until the end of the war. Members of the battalion were then trained by other Ukrainian units. Like with other Ukrainian penal battalions, if a member of the battalion would attempt to desert or retreat without authorisation, an additional 5 to 10 years would be added to their sentence.\nPokrovsk offensive\nThe battalion first saw action during the Pokrovsk offensive. A Ukrainian officer who wanted to remain anonymous for safety reasons, told CNN that the battalion had refused to fight alongside conscripts due to their low morale and lack of motivation to fight. Another Ukrainian officer claimed in a post on Telegram that the battalion had been thrown into assaults with no professional military training and no coordination with the other units  which resulted in heavy losses. However, Ukrainian media outlets reported that the battalion fights bravely and destroys Russian forces in large numbers.\n",

Previously he served as head of several Ukrainian banks, including Rodovid Bank, Kyiv International Bank, Kreditprombank, and others.\nEarly life and education\nDenis Gorbunenko was born on 9 December 1973 in Donetsk, Ukraine. His father, Volodymyr Gorbunenko, was a banker, and his mother, Valentyna Gorbunenko, was a physician.\nIn 1996, he graduated from the Donetsk State Academy of Management with a degree in management in the Non-Production Field.\nIn 1997\u20131998, he studied at Oxford Brookes University, where he defended his master's thesis on \"Foreign Direct Investment as a way to enter the Ukrainian Market\" and received a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree.\nCareer\nGorbunenko started his career during his first year of study at the Donetsk Academy. From 1992 to 1998, he worked at INKO Joint Stock Bank, holding the positions of leading specialist, and later head of the department for organization and control of branches and deputy manager of the bank's Donetsk branch. In 1998, he led the liabilities department at Kyiv-Privat Joint Stock Bank.\nAt the same year, he led the international payments and operations department at Kyiv International Bank, established by Rabobank (Netherlands) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\nFrom 1999 to 2004, he worked at OJSC Kreditprombank. For five years, he has held the positions of Deputy Chairman of the management board, Deputy Chairman of the supervisory board and a member of the supervisory board of OJSC Kreditprombank.\nFrom 2004 to 2009, Gorbunenko worked at Rodovid BANK. He started as a deputy chairman, later became the head of the financial institution and a minority shareholder. The bank's assets grew 18-fold in five years, reaching $2.75 billion at the end of 2008 and at the time of Gorbunenko's resignation in January 2009.

Although no formal charges have been made against him, he has not publicly commented on these claims.\nUnder his leadership, Gorbunenko brought two Ukrainian banks to bankruptcy in the 2000s, which caused sufficient financial problems for the customers and the government of Ukraine.\nUkrainian media states that Gorbunenko may also have been connected to Ukrainian businessman Dmytro Firtash as his quasi-representative. Reports indicate that Gorbunenko signed various financial documents under Firtash's power of attorney. Firtash was arrested in 2014 in Austria at the request of the FBI on charges related to alleged bribery for mining licenses in India, and U.S. authorities have been seeking his extradition since then.

    "19th-century ch\u00e2teau in France\nCh\u00e2teau de Valli\u00e8re, 2011\nThe Ch\u00e2teau de Valli\u00e8re is a 19th-century ch\u00e2teau located in Mortefontaine, in the Oise d\u00e9partement, in the Hauts-de-France region. The park is partly located in the commune of Fontaine-Chaalis. Built in 1894 in neo-Gothic style for the Duke of Gramont, its facades and roofs are listed in the supplementary inventory of historical monuments by decree of 29 October 1975. The park, located on the edge of the Ermenonville Forest, has been a listed site since 10 April 1961.\nHistory\nAriel view from the southwestPlan of the Parc de Mortefontaine, 1780\nIn October 1798, Joseph Bonaparte (the older brother of Napoleon I) acquired the vast Mortefontaine and Montm\u00e9lian estates, including the Ch\u00e2teau de Mortefontaine. Bonaparte had the Grand Parc completed between 1808 and 1814, organized around four ponds which were painted by Antoine Watteau and Camille Corot. Before his additions, only the Petit Parc existed, which was not part of the Valli\u00e8re estate. The Ch\u00e2teau de Mortefontaine was the site of the signing of the Convention of 1800 (also known as the Treaty of Mortefontaine), a treaty of friendship between France and the United States of America. The preliminaries of the 1802 Peace of Amiens were also negotiated at the ch\u00e2teau.\nBonaparte, who served as the King of Naples from 1806 to 1808 and King of Spain and the Indies from 1808 to 1813, owned the estate until 1814, when he went into exile, bequeathing the Mortefontaine estate to his administrator, Madame de Villeneuve, by a fictitious sale. She rented most of the estate to the Prussian Baron Georg-Arthur von Schickler, who had wanted to purchase it.\nPrince of Cond\u00e9\nIn 1829, Louis Henri de Bourbon, the last Prince of Cond\u00e9, and already owner of the Ch\u00e2teau de Chantilly, bought the estate. After his death, his mistress Sophie Dawes, Baronne de Feuch\u00e8res, received the estate as a gift in 1837. Only three years later, her ten-year old goddaughter Sophie Thanaron (the daughter of her sister Charlotte and a retired French officer), inherited the estate following the 1840 death of the Baroness. She married the Prefect of Aisne Henri Corbin (d. 1879). In 1892, the Corbin family sold 3,800 acres (1,500\u00a0ha) of land, the largest part of the Mortefontaine and Montm\u00e9lian estate, to Ag\u00e9nor de Gramont, 11th Duke of Gramont, which became the Valli\u00e8re estate. The Corbin family kept the Ch\u00e2teau de Mortefontaine and the woods on the Montm\u00e9lian hill. Sophie Thanaron Corbin died in 1901. The ch\u00e2teau and the Petit Parc remained the property of her children until 1928.\nPortrait of Marguerite, Duchess of Gramont, by Philip de L\u00e1szl\u00f3, 1902Princess Marie Ruspoli, Duchess de Gramont, also by Philip de L\u00e1szl\u00f3, 1922\nDukes of Gramont\nAfter acquiring the estate in 1892, the 11th Duke of Gramont had architect Alfred-Philibert Aldrophe build the Ch\u00e2teau de Valli\u00e8re in 1894, for his wife, Marguerite, Duchess of Gramont (n\u00e9e Baroness Marguerite de Rothschild; a younger daughter of Baron Mayer Carl von Rothschild, the first Jewish member of the House of Lords of Prussia), in the Grand Parc of the Mortefontaine and Montm\u00e9lian estate. The ch\u00e2teau is near Thorn Lake (French: Lac de l'\u00c9pine), the largest of the four ponds, and Molton Island.\nAt Valli\u00e8re, the Duke organized pheasant, duck and deer hunts while the Duchess had plays by Eug\u00e8ne Labiche and tableaux vivants performed. The Duke set up an omnibus service between the station and the ch\u00e2teau, comprising sixteen grey horses harnessed in groups of five and led by postilions wearing top hats. The Duke and Duchess's eldest son, Armand de Gramont, then Duke of Guiche, married the Countess \u00c9laine Greffulhe at the estate in 1904. The Duke of Guiche's friend, Marcel Proust, dined with the family at Valli\u00e8re's terrace on 14 July 1904, who noted that he could see the towers of Senlis Cathedral above the ponds and the foliage. After Duchess Marguerite died in 1905, the Duke married Princess Maria Ruspoli.\nOn 2 September 1914, an advance guard of 4 battalions of the 3rd Infantry Division crossed the Ermenonville Forest and slipped, at nightfall, into the park of the Ch\u00e2teau de Valli\u00e8re, where they encountered the rearguard of the 56th Reserve Division, composed of the 354th Infantry Regiment and the 69th Battalion of Foot Chasseurs. During the capture of the village of Mortefontaine, the Pomeranians of the 2nd and 9th Grenadiers, two were killed and thirty wounded. The \"Battle of Mortefontaine\" is considered the closest battle to Paris and the \"extreme point of the enemy advance\". There is a small monument at the ch\u00e2teau which honors the memory of soldiers of the 354th Regiment who died for France during the battle.\nAfter his father's death in 1925, Armand de Gramont became the 12th Duke of Gramont. He was succeeded by his son, Henri as the 13th Duke in 1962. In 1982, twenty years later, he sold the Ch\u00e2teau de Valli\u00e8re and the Grand Parc outside of the de Gramont family.\nPresent day\nToday, the Ch\u00e2teau",

However, Anuja later died in a clash with the Sri Lankan Army , while Sivavarman and Vasugi relocated to Canada.\nInvolvement with the LTTE\nRajaratnam's involvement in militant activities can be traced back to her father's influence and his participation in Puli Padai (Tiger Force), a secretive Tamil group. On 12 August 1960, her father and around 40 others, mostly Tamil government employees, took an oath at the ancient Koneswaram temple in Trincomalee, forming the group. The members of Puli Padai, who believed in the necessity of Tamil self-determination, are largely unknown today, as most have since died. A. Rajaratnam was also one of the first members of the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi.\nKoneswaram temple, trincomalee\nKalaivani studied up to middle school in Batticaloa, until dropping out to join the LTTE when she was around 12-15.

    "The Gower Monument is a grade II* listed monument in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. Erected in 1888, the monument's centrepiece is a seated bronze sculpture of the playwright and poet William Shakespeare. The monument is flanked by four detached bronze statues on plinths representing popular characters from Shakespeare's plays; Prince Hal, Lady Macbeth, Hamlet, and Falstaff.\nDesign\nThe monument was designed and constructed in Paris over a 12-year period between 1876 and 1888 by Lord Ronald Gower, Luca Madrassi, Raux & Marley, and the House of De Cauville & Perzinku. Its estimated price per year of construction was \u00a3500. The stone portions of the structure compise of a mixture of Yorkstone and Bath stone. The sculptures and fittings on the monument are made of bronze.\nThe monument features a central stone plinth adorned with a bronze seated sculpture of William Shakespeare, holding both pen and parchement. Each side of this central plinth features an inscription from four of Shakespeare's plays; Henry V, Henry IV, Part 2, Macbeth, and Hamlet. Attached to each of the four corners of the central plinth is a bronze Greek mask.\nDetached from the main plinth are four bronze statues on separate pedestals representing popular characters from Shakespeare's plays. These characters were intended to be emblematic of Shakespeare's creative versatility. The statue of Prince Hal represents history, Hamlet is to represent philosophy, Lady Macbeth symbolises tragedy, whilst finally Falstaff signifies comedy.\nHistory\nFollowing its completion in 1888, the monument was originally erected in the gardens behind what was then the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre (now the Swan Theatre).\nThe monument was unveiled in Stratford-Upon-Avon accompanied by a speech from Sir Francis Philip Cunliffe-Owen, director of the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A Museum), and Oscar Wilde reading a poem dedicated to the monument written by Mrs. R. S. de Courcey Laffan, wife of the headmaster of the local grammar school.\nThe unveiling of the memorial did receive some criticism. The satirical magazine Punch mocked both the cost allegedly incurred by Lord Gower to construct the monment and the 'originality' of its design in an article titled \"Immortality Indeed!\". The anonymous authour of the article remarked \"Now who but a born genius would ever dreamt of representing Shakespeare in such an attitude, and with all these properties,\"a pen in his right hand,\" and a \"roll of manuscript in his left.\" What perfect symoblism!\"\nThe monument, along with the four detached bronze statues was moved to its current position in Bancroft gardens in 1933 following the 1926 fire in the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre and subsequent redevelopment of the area.\nThe Gower Monument became a listed monument on 25 October 1951.The Gower Monumnet in the gardens behind the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre",

    "\n2024 song by The Innocence Mission\n\"This Thread Is a Green Street\" is a single by American alternative band The Innocence Mission, released as the first single from their thirteenth studio album Midwinter Swimmers on September 3, 2024. The song was written by Karen and Don Peris, with Karen also creating an animated music video for the song.\nComposition and recording\nThe song was written by Karen Peris alongside her husband Don Peris. It is the only song on Midwinter Swimmers to be co-written by Don, as Karen was the sole composer of the rest of the album. Karen said the lyrics of \"This Thread Is a Green Street\" were inspired by the \"transportive quality of scenes we might come upon in the natural world, or even in everyday objects\", saying that \"a sewing thread when I'm mending something could remind me of a street map.\" She elaborated that she was \"envisioning the landscape as a world of doorways that might allow us to locate memory or to be nearer in some way to people we miss.\" Karen related this lyrical concept to the recording of the song, saying that during the recording the band were seeking to \"find the half-remembered beauty of sing-alongs of our 1970s childhoods. There's a search in recording that goes on being elusive, in a good way.\"\nRelease and promotion\n\"This Thread Is a Green Street\" was issued as the first single from Midwinter Swimmers, as a one-track digital download and streaming single on September 3, 2024. That same day, a \"hand-stitched\" animated music video was released, directed by Karen. BrooklynVegan described the video as Karen using \"ideas of sewing, stitching together backgrounds from maps, cloth swatches as the world of doorways and a photo of the 1964 World\u2019s Fair taken by her father. There are people moving through them, along with lyrics that appear as diagrammed sentences. It's a video that is as evocative of that early-'70s feel Peris describes \u2013 not unlike what she imagined on 2021 solo album A Song Is Way Above the Lawn \u2013 and you could imagine this as part of a PBS children's series back then.\"\nCritical reception\nStereogum said the song \"casts a dreamy, pastoral spell.\" BrooklynVegan called the song \"gorgeous\". Paste listed it as one of the best songs released that week.\nCredits and personnel\nCredits adapted from the description section of the song's official YouTube music video.\nKaren Peris \u2013 vocals, nylon string guitar, pump organ, Hammond organ\nDon Peris \u2013 harmony vocals, acoustic and electric guitars, drums\nMike Bitts \u2013 upright bass",

    "1978 single by Rino Gaetano\nNuntereggae pi\u00f9 is a 1978 song by Rino Gaetano and the title track of his fourth album, released that same year. \nIn January 1978, after doubts and hesitations, he participated in the Sanremo Music Festival with the song \"Gianna\" achieving great success and finishing in third place. However, the singer-songwriter would have preferred to compete with \"Nuntereggae pi\u00f9,\" but he was strongly discouraged from doing so.\nHistory and significance\n\"Someone wants to silence me! I\u2019m not afraid of them. They won\u2019t succeed. I feel that my songs will be sung by future generations, who, thanks to mass communication, will understand what I mean tonight.\"\u2014\u200aRino Gaetano, shortly before a concert on the beach of Capocotta in 1979.\n1978 was a tragic and complex year marked by significant events in Italy, which included three popes, two presidents, and the kidnapping and murder of Aldo Moro, preceded by the massacre of his security detail. The 1976 Italian elections saw a strong showing by the Italian Communist Party, which gained a majority in the Chamber, but the Christian Democracy Party remained the largest party overall. Effectively, DC and PCI emerged as the winners. This duality brings to mind Rino Gaetano's lyrics: \u201cdcpsi / nuntereggae pi\u00f9 / dcpci / pcipsi plipri / dcpci pcidc.\u201d His song encapsulates the essence of 1978 and remains relevant in reflecting the crises of that time.\nThe lyrics include the names of notable public figures at the time. The list is as follows: Vincenzo Cazzaniga, Gianni Agnelli, Umberto Agnelli, Susanna Agnelli, Attilio Monti, Leopoldo Pirelli, Franco Causio, Marco Tardelli, Giuliano Musiello, Giancarlo Antognoni, Renato Zaccarelli, Gianni Brera, Enzo Bearzot, Carlos Monz\u00f3n, Adriano Panatta, Gianni Rivera, Pompeo D'Ambrosio, Niki Lauda, Gustav Th\u00f6ni, Maurizio Costanzo, Mike Bongiorno, Paolo Villaggio, Raffaella Carr\u00e0, Francesco Guccini, Sigmund Freud, Cartier, Pierre Cardin, and Gucci.\nGaetano reviews the clich\u00e9s of the politics of that time.\nMi sia consentito dire / nuntereggae pi\u00f9 / il nostro \u00e8 un partito serio / certo! / disponibile al confronto / nella misura in cui / alternativo\"Allow me to say / nuntereggae pi\u00f9 / ours is a serious party / certainly! / open to dialogue / as long as / it's alternative.\"\nThis draws on a quote from Amintore Fanfani (with his favorite phrase \"allow me to say\") and from Enrico Berlinguer (with his statement \"ours is a serious party\"), progressively moving to the colloquial leftist expressions of \"as long as\" and \"dialogue,\" always with an alternative stance.\nIn a 1978 RAI radio interview for the program Quadernetto Romano, Enzo Siciliano described the song's lyrics as a kind of catalog and asked Gaetano if there was a logical thread. Gaetano confirmed this, explaining his creative process involved taking various newspapers, categorizing articles, and randomly selecting topics to write the song, making the lyrics essentially headlines. His method reflects a free, chance-based creative approach reminiscent of Dadaism, where concepts like morality, family, and politics become empty conventions. When Siciliano mentioned the risk of superficiality, Gaetano responded that his music is escapist; he prefers to create love songs and engage with societal issues in a way that brings enjoyment rather than burdening listeners. Siciliano noted that Gaetano's songs do address social problems, to which Gaetano agreed but emphasized that he aims to make the experience pleasurable.\nTrack listing\nCharts\nWeekly charts\nExternal links\nNuntereggae pi\u00f9 at Discogs (list of releases)\n",

    "\nParliamentary elections were held in Serbia in 1869 to elect a Grand National Assembly\u00a0 to approve a new constitution.\nBackground\nFollowing the assassination of Prince Mihailo in 1868 there was no obvious successor as Mihailo had been childless. Politicians established the 'Temporary Viceroyalty of Princely Dignity', consisting of Rajko Le\u0161jani\u00a0 (Minister of Justice) Jovan Marinovi\u0107 (President of the State Council) and \u0110or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107 (President of the Court of Cassation). The Viceroyalty announced that a Grand National Assembly\u00a0 would be elected and meet in Top\u010dider within a month to elect a new prince. Elections to the 504-seat Assembly were held in early June and the Assembly met on 20 June. However, prior to it meeting, 14-year-old Milan was chosen as Mihailo's successor by Minister of War Milivoje Blaznavac. As a result, when the Assembly met its revised task was to confirm Milan's selection and to appoint a regent. Milan's selection was confirmed unanimously, while Blaznavac, Jovan Risti\u0107 and Jovan Gavrilovi\u0107 were chosen as the regents. The Assembly was then disbanded on 24 June, with its members having expressed a desire to replace the 1838 'Turkish' constitution.\nThe Viceroyalty subsequently established the Svetonikoli committee, which was tasked with determining whether a new constitution was required, and if it was, to draft one. The committee was formed of 70 members from the political and clerical elite. After it had drafted a new constitution, a Grand National Assembly was required to be convened to approve it. As a result, elections were called to elect the 516 members of the Assembly, which would meet in Kragujevac.\nResults\nNearly all seats were won by the Liberal Party.\nAftermath\nThe Assembly met for the first time on 10 June, with \u017divko Karabiberovi\u0107\u00a0 chosen as president and Todor Tucakovi\u0107 as vice president, before it was formally opened on 12 June.\nFollowing the approval of the new constitution the Assembly was dissolved with the intent of convening an extraordinary Legislative Assembly to amend and pass laws that were in line with the new constitution. This was elected the following year. After passing most of the legislation required, the Assembly was dissolved the following year and parliamentary elections were held in August 1871.\n",

    "Species of flowering plants\nOriginal illustration of O. microphylla, from Nova Genera\nOurisia microphylla is a species of flowering plant in the family Plantaginaceae that is endemic to the Andes mountains of southern Chile and Argentina. Eduard Poeppig and Stephan Endlicher described O. microphylla in 1835. Plants of this species of South American foxglove are small, showy, perennial, many-branched and suffruticose with entire, decussate leaves. The flowers are solitary, with a regular calyx, and a pink to white regular corolla. The calyx has tiny glandular hairs, and the corolla tube is glabrous inside.\nTaxonomy\nOurisia microphylla Poepp. & Endl. is in the plant family Plantaginaceae. German botanist Eduard Poeppig and Austrian botanist Stephan Endlicher described O. microphylla in 1835 in their publication, Nova Genera.\nThe type material was collected by Poeppig in the Andes mountains of the Biob\u00edo Region of Chile at \"Tvun Leuvu\"  and Sierra Velluda in January 1830. The lectotype was designated by Heidi Meudt and is housed at the Herbarium W at the Natural History Museum, Vienna, with isolectotypes at several other herbaria.\nOurisia microphylla is the type species of Ourisia subgenus Suffruticosae Meudt. The other two species in this subgenus are O. polyantha and O. serpyllifolia, and these three southern Andean species share a suffruticose, many-branched habit with sessile, opposite to decussate leaves, and solitary flowers. They also have tiny glandular hairs on the regular calyx, and rectangular, linear oblong to narrowly oblong seeds.\nOurisia microphylla can be distinguished from O. polyantha by its pink or white corollas that are less than 15\u00a0mm long (vs. red corollas that are yellow inside the tube and longer than 15\u00a0mm) and its short stamens less than 5\u00a0mm long, with filaments attached half-way down the corolla tube (vs. long stamens over 16\u00a0mm long, with filaments attached near the tube opening).\nIt can be distinguished from O. serpyllifolia by its decussate, entire leaves (vs. not decussate, and toothed), pink or white corollas that are glabrous inside (vs. lilac corollas that are yellow and hairy inside), s-shaped style (vs. style distinctively bent just below stigma), and reniform or kidney-shaped anthers (vs. linear).\nDescription\nOurisia microphylla plants are perennial suffruticose, many-branched herbs. The stems are woody at the base, with opposite, decussate leaves along the branches. Branches are 1\u201313\u00a0cm long, 0.2\u20130.9\u00a0mm wide, and glabrous except for few, tiny glandular hairs near the branch tips. Leaves are sessile, 1.0\u20133.9\u00a0mm long by 0.6\u20132.6\u00a0mm wide (length: width ratio 1.8\u20132.9:1).

    "American artist and illustrator (1886\u20131965)\nBurr E. Giffen (March 3, 1886 - April 2, 1965) was an American artist and illustrator working in New York City. His most famous creation was while he was working for an Advertising Company in 1906. He created the Fisk Tire Company Boy holding a tire and night candle as a proposal sketch in charcoal. This sketch became the company's well-known registered trademarked image in 1910.\nBiography\nBurr Giffen was born in Rockford, Illinois. When he reached the age of 4, he moved to Des Moines, Iowa where his father Marvin Q Giffen, was successful in the wholesale furniture business. Burr was noted without an occupation in the 1905 Iowa Census and soon left for New York City.\nIn 1910, he was a fledgling working for an ad agency known as Wagner and Field. Giffen says he got the inspiration for the drawing at 3 A.M., sat down on his bed and rapidly sketched the little boy with a tire over his right shoulder and a candle held in his left hand. Simultaneously. he coined the slogan: \"Time to Re-tire.\"\nThe sketch was an instant hit with the Fisk Rubber Co., which a few years earlier had introduced its first pneumatic automobile tire. Its first appearance nationally was in Life magazine in 1911.\nNorman Rockwell was one of the artists who illustrated the Fisk tire boy, which allowed him to be creative.\nOver the decades, the tousle-haired, sleepy-time boy appeared on every Fisk car and truck tire, in ads, on all stationery, booklets, posters, TV slides, calendars, tire store displays and even on clock faces.\nSee also\nPaul Martin (illustrator)\n",

Pe\u00f1a was involved in the Little War under Gen. Emilio N\u00fa\u00f1ez, aligning with the Cuban leaders who refused to sign the Pact of Zanjon.\nFollowing the war's end, he escaped to St. Thomas, later settling in Florida and becoming a cigar maker.\nCuban War of Independence\nAt the onset of the Cuban War of Independence, Pe\u00f1a joined the first expedition back and served with Gen. Maximo Gomez. Gomez made him a colonel in the Cuban ranks and in a week he held a command of 300 mambises.\nExpeditions\nHe organized many armed expeditions for the insurrection from the United States. In March 1895, he boarded the tug Commodore from Charleston, South Carolina in command of an expedition that successfully landed on the island of Cuba. The steamer was libeled for undertaking a foreign voyage, but the case never reached trial. Braulo Pe\u00f1a headed another filibustering expedition to Cuba to aid the military operations in the summer of 1895. He and 20 accomplices were arrested in Penns Grove, New Jersey and taken to Wilmington, Delaware on August 30, 1895, for their involvement in the violation of the U.S. neutrality laws. He faced the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on September 23, 1895, and was later released on bail. In March 1896, under Brigadier Emilio N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Maj. Braulio Pe\u00f1a landed an expedition in Nuevitas of Puerto Principe with eight men including Winchester Osgood, 400 rifles, large amounts of ammunition, and a two-pounder Hotchkiss gun. That year, M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez made him a brigadier general and appointed him the chief of cavalry in the Cuban Liberation Army. The cavalry's horses were mostly those stolen from the Spanish troops.\nCuban Rural Guard\nIn post-independence Cuba, the U.S. Military Government's appointment and the departure of the Spanish Civil Guard increased banditry, leading to the establishment of the Cuban Rural Guard locally. Lt. Col. Braulio Pe\u00f1a was named Chief of the Rural Guard of Puerto Pr\u00edncipe (Spanish: Guardia Rural de Puerto Pr\u00edncipe) on January 1, 1899, when it was assembled in the province. Some 160 Cuban war veterans were selected, forming 9 squadrons for patrols and public order in the rural areas outside of the city limits. Pe\u00f1a, in Maj. Louis V. Caziarc's annual report, was noted as Chief of the Puerto Pr\u00edncipe Rural Guard from July 1900 to December 1901, under Commander Hatfield. He oversaw 252 officers and men with various staff members including an assistant captain and inspector.\nBraulio Pe\u00f1a, Second in Command of the Second Regiment of the Cuban Rural Guard, retired in 1906 due to declining health.\nDeath\nBraulio Pe\u00f1a died in Puerto Pr\u00edncipe (now Camag\u00fcey), Cuba on April 25, 1924.\n",
    "Polymetallic plumbotelluride mineral\nMontbrayite (from a Canadian toponym) is a very rare mineral from among the gold tellurides, close to krennerite and calaverite, in composition it is a mixed polymetallic plumbotelluride of gold with a variable formula, initially written as Au2Te3,:\u200a20\u201321\u200a or (Au,Sb)2Te3, but today having a much more complex form in the calculated form: (Au,Ag,Sb,Bi,Pb)23(Te,Sb,Bi,Pb)38. The color of montbrayite is cream, tin-white to pale yellow, the luster is metallic.\nDiscovery history and name\nThe mineral was first identified in 1946 by M. A. Peacock and R. M. Thompson at the Canadian Robb Montbray deposit (Quebec). Almost immediately, it was analyzed and a description of montbrayite was published as a new gold telluride with the formula Au2Te3. The mineral was named after the location of its discovery, the typical Canadian Montbray deposit, which remained the only one for montbrayite for the next quarter of a century.:\u200a28\u200a\nProperties\nMontbreyite forms small segregations, rarely exceeding 3\u20135\u00a0mm, the mineral is dense, usually homogeneous, very brittle, the fracture is flat-conchoidal, sometimes discontinuous separation is observed. The hardness of montbreyite is low, which is quite common for tellurides, it is about 2.5 on the Mohs scale. The specific gravity is about 9.94. The luster is metallic, on chips it gradually oxidizes and becomes cloudy, the color is tin-white to pale yellow. The polished surface is creamy-white, similar to that of krennerite; but not as white as altaite.:\u200a20\u201321\u200a\nThe mineral formula was initially defined as Au2Te3:\u200a20\u200a or (Au,Sb)2Te3, but more accurate analyses revealed that in different cases constant impurities are part of the montbrayite. Several formula variants are fixed in the calculated form, in particular, one of the variants concerns samples from the Robb Montbray type deposit and looks like (Au1.73Bi0.10Sb0.06Pb0.06Ag0.04)\u03a3=1.99Te3.00.\nWhere montbrayite does not contain tellurobismuthite or altaite inclusions, its structure is generally homogeneous. Bireflection is barely noticeable. Anisotropy is weak to moderate, shades: light gray, light yellow-brown, bluish-gray.:\u200a21\u200a\nVery similar minerals: calaverite, krennerite and montbrayite are difficult to distinguish under a microscope. A good way to determine this is by testing for microhardness. Another feature: montbrayite is characterized by a mosaic structure. In addition, montbrayite sometimes forms twins. When exposed to HNO3 (in a 1:1 dilution), a kind of etching occurs, it boils strongly, bubbles form and yellow-brown spots of released gold remain on the surface of the mineral.:\u200a239\u200a With more saturated nitric acid (dilution 3:2) the reaction is less violent, the stain is light brown and small round halos are formed, also colored light brown; with concentrated nitric acid it boils weakly, and the surface is colored uniformly grayish-brown; round halos are not observed. Other reagents (HCl, KCN, FeCl3, KOH and HgCl) do not affect the mineral.:\u200a21\u201322\u200a\nCalaverite and montbrayite are among the earliest tellurides to form; they have relatively high microindentation hardness values, increased relief, and a pronounced tendency toward idiomorphism and the formation of coarse-crystalline varieties. The reflectivity of montbrayite is noticeably higher than that of calaverite; Rg of montbrayite almost completely repeats the R\u0441\u0440 curve of krennerite. In terms of reflectivity values in yellow light, relief, microindentation hardness, and the forms of separation in the form of short-prismatic plates, montbrayite and calaverite are similar to melonite, differing in the presence of a pronounced pinkish tint and more perfect cleavage in melonite.:\u200a39\u200a\nConditions of formation\nMontbreyite is a typical mineral of tellurium-gold deposits, closely associated with native gold, petzite, altaite, coloradoite, melonite and tellurobismuthite, forming rounded inclusions and veinlets in tetrahedrite and chalcopyrite. The size of fine-grained aggregates of montbreyite, as a rule, does not exceed 2.5\u00a0mm.:\u200a111\u200a\nUnlike hessite, sylvanite and other first-row minerals, empressite (AgTe), montbreyite (Au2Te3) and muthmannite (AuAgTe2) are among the rare gold-silver tellurides.:\u200a106\u200a\nIn the Robb-Montbray mine, montbrayite was found in association with native gold, tellurobismuthite, altaite, petzite, melonite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, sphalerite, chalcocite and marcasite. The sizes of the segregations of the corresponding gold tellurides were sometimes very large and reached 1\u00a0cm in diameter, and montbrayite was either at contacts with other gold tellurides or had the form of an inclusion in them. In places, altaite with small admixtures of gold and petzite in the form of thin fibers crossed montbrayite. Sometimes tellurobismuthite with a small amount of altaite and petzite formed rounded inclusions in montbrayite. In the latter case, a eutectoid structure was present, apparently resulting from the decomposition of tellurides. Melonit",

    "\nKaze Green Economy, or KAGE, is a social enterprise that manufactures wood and charcoal substitutes from biodegradable waste.\nIt has facilities in Gitega and Bujumbura, Burundi.\nBackground\nWood, as firewood or charcoal, is the main source of energy for cooking in Burundi, and accounts for 95% of the country's energy consumption.\nA 2021 report noted that at current rates of forest clearance Burundi would have no forest cover left in 25 to 33 years.\nProducts\nKaze Green Economy converts biodegradable waste into two products: KABIOF (Kaze Bio Fuel) Makara and KABIOF Rukwi.\nKABIOF Rukwi is a substitute for firewood and KABIOF Makara is a substitute for charcoal. \nThe company also makes safe and energy efficient cooking stoves from recycled plastic and metal waste.\n\nMaize salks are collected from households and dumps, dried to remove all moisture, partially burned in ovens, crushed into a carbon-rich powder, then combined with other products.\nMaterials used now include corn cobs, rice husks, coffee parchment, charcoal residues, palm trees and other agricultural residues.\nThe \"Kabiof Charcoal\" is much cheaper than other fuels, does not emit smoke or odors, and one piece can burn for over two hours.\nThe product reduces the incentive to cut down trees for fuel, and as a side effect helps keep the streets clean.\nThe fuel reduces indoor air pollution.\nKAGE creates waste collection jobs.\nHistory\nThe founder of the company, Delphin Kaze, was born in Gitega around 1997.\nHe studied at the Faculty of Environmental Sciences in the Polytechnic University of Gitega.\nWhile researching the problems caused by deforestation, he came up with the idea of making charcoal from biodegradable waste.\nInitial trials were unsatisfactory, but when corn cobs were added the results were good, and the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research validated the product.\nKaze launched the Kaze Freen Economy company in Gitega in 2018.\nUNDP Burundi provided material and technical support to help the company expand its capacity.\nAs of 2020 the company was providing fuel to about 8,000 households.\nIn 2020 the company employed 42 people and produced 300 to 500 kilograms (660 to 1,100\u00a0lb) a day.\nThe Burundian state granted Delphin Kaze land to build his factory in the north of Bujumbura.\nIn October 2020 production began in Bujumbura.\nThe Bujumbura factory is one a large plot.\nPiles of rice husks are stored on the east side, which has interconnected machines making coal and briquettes.\nImproved stoves, piles of coal and some of the offices are on the north of the plot.\nThe south has a factory for manufacturing efficient stoves.\nThe reception and other offices are on the west side.\nIn May 2021 First Lady Angeline Ndayishimiye visited Kaze Green Economy accompanied by the UNDP representative Nicole Kouassi, where they met Delphin Kaze. \nShe praised his achievements, and his hiring of disabled people and women in general.\nKaze told her production had increased from 350 kilograms (770\u00a0lb) per day to 28 tons per day, made up of 20 tons of firewood equivalent and 8 tons of charcoal equivalent.\nThere were still challenges, including lack of electricity, limited storage space, waste disposal and the need to separated biodegradable household waste from other waste.\nIn October 2021 the wives of the premiers of Burundi and Niger visited the Afritextile, Kaze Green Economy and FOMI factories in Bujumbura.\nBy 2022 Kage had more than 40 permanent employees and over 20 day laborers.\nSee also\nList of companies of Burundi\nEconomy of Burundi",
    "\nCharles Warren Foster (March 31, 1830 \u2013 May 10, 1904) was an American soldier and military officer. He first served as an enlisted engineer and NCO in the United States Army during the Mexican\u2013American War and then as a commissioned officer in the American Civil War. In the latter he notably headed the Bureau of Colored Troops, managing the recruitment and organization of African-American units for the Union Army.\nBiography\nFoster was born in Salem, Massachusetts, on March 31, 1830. In June 1846, shortly after the outbreak of the Mexican\u2013American War, he enlisted in the United States Army as a private in the Corps of Engineers. With a company of engineers he deployed to Mexico as part of Winfield Scott's army, serving at Veracruz, Cerro Gordo and Puebla. Ending the war as a sergeant, originally having enlisted in the Regular Army for five years, he spent the rest of his term as part of the garrison of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Reenlisting for another term, he was put on surveying duty in Texas, returned to West Point, and then served at Key West, Florida. His second tour ended in August 1856.\nAfter the Civil War had begun, he sought service in the Union Army, and in September 1861 he was commissioned captain in the United States Volunteers (USV). He was assigned to the staff of Brigadier General Horatio Wright as an assistant adjutant general. First he served as such at the Battle of Port Royal and in the campaigns in the Department of the South and then when Wright headed the Department of the Ohio. In early 1863, after the issue of the Emancipation Proclamation, the Union had begun recruiting colored men as soldiers on a national level. Units were organized in the field, e.g. along the Mississippi River by Adjutant General Lorenzo Thomas and in Louisiana by Daniel Ullmann. To centralize the various recruiting and organization efforts in the country, the Department of War established the Bureau of Colored Troops on May 22, 1863, with General Order No. 143. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., Foster was chosen as Chief of the Bureau. Recruitment was authorized for various commanders, governors and bureau commissioners, while several boards of examination were established to get qualified officers for the new units, and by October some 58 regiments had already been organized. Eventually the number of units of the United States Colored Troops would almost triple. Foster headed the bureau for the duration of the war and was promoted to major in August 1863, receiving brevets to lieutenant colonel and colonel in the USV in 1864. In 1865 he also received a Regular Army commission, being made captain in the Quartermaster Corps and receiving regular brevets to major, lieutenant colonel and colonel for his war service. He continued to lead the bureau during the early Reconstruction era, until it was disestablished in October 1867, at the same time mustering out of the USV.\nFoster remained in the army, now with his regular commission as captain and quartermaster, and in 1868 went with an expedition to Alaska. In the following years he served on various posts in the departments of California, Arizona, Dakota, Utah and eventually back in the East, being promoted to major in 1883. He stayed on duty until 1891, when he retired after 40 years of service. Charles W. Foster died in a hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on May 10, 1904, after a protracted illness. He was married to Anna Allen Currier Foster, and their son Pierce Currier Foster (born 1878) served in the army as well. A graduate of West Point, class of 1899, the 2nd lieutenant immediately went to serve in the Philippine\u2013American War. However, he contracted typhoid fever and died in June of the same year. The whole family is interred in a small family mausoleum on West Point Cemetery.\n",

Despite that obstacle, the festival was held again the following year and it held its fourth edition in 2024, slowly gaining a foothold in the tight schedule of Spanish film festivals.\nStructure\nOfficial section\nThe official section includes the films that compete for the different awards. The films are divided into two types: fiction feature films and documentaries. The first ones must be at least 60 minutes long. Documentaries must be at least 45 minutes long. In both cases, they must have been made over a year and a half before the beginning of the festival and either take place during a past era or deal with a historical subject.\nTwo main awards called the \u2018Golden Dragon\u2019 (Spanish: Drag\u00f3n de Oro) are given \u2014 one to the best fiction feature film and another one to the best documentary. In the fourth edition, they included an economic endowment of \u20ac6,000. Moreover, other minor awards known as the \u2018Silver Dragon\u2019 (Drag\u00f3n de Plata) are given to the best actor, actress, director and script. The jury that grants the trophies is multidisciplinary and consists of film industry professionals, critics and historians. Finally, a \u2018Youth Award\u2019 is granted by a jury formed by young people. The minor awards were endowed with \u20ac1,000 in the fourth edition.\nOther sections\nDuring the first editions, a non-competitive section dedicated to showing television series was organised. However, experience showed that the SFF could not compete against festivals explicitly focused on series, so the section was rearranged in the third edition as \u2018Saraqusta Outlook\u2019 (Spanish: Panorama Saraqusta), a non-competitive exhibition parallel to the official section.\nAn Aragonese Documentary section was added in the fourth edition, whose screening took place in the morning in the Caesaragusta Theatre Museum (Spanish: Museo del Teatro de Caesaraugusta). Its aim is to promote the work of regional professionals and it is not competitive either. Admission to the screenings is free until full capacity.\nLastly, special screenings outside the competition are done as part of the inauguration, the closing ceremony or as a homage to certain people receiving honorary awards. These screenings do not have to be of recently released films.\nOther activities\nBesides the screenings of the different sections, they organise panel discussions of different topics related to audiovisual production, and there are daily press conferences to inform about the development of the festival. They also give what is known as the \u2018Saraqusta Award\u2019 (Spanish: Premio Saraqusta), an honorary award for audiovisual professionals whose trajectory has been related to historical themed films. Some of the honorees have been actors Rodolfo Sancho, Joaquim de Almeida and Fabio Testi, producer Andr\u00e9s Vicente G\u00f3mez, and directors Agust\u00ed Villaronga and Antonio del Real.\nGolden Dragons\n",

    "Painting by Thomas Lawrence\nPortrait of Mirza Abul Hasan is an 1810 portrait painting by the English artist Thomas Lawrence depicting Mirza Abolhassan Khan Ilchi, the Persian envoy to Britain.\nHe was the first diplomatic envoy sent to the country since the seventeenth century. He was well received by high society and attracted interest in the press. The painting was commissioned by Sir Gore Ouseley who had been appointed as the ambassador's guide during his stay on Britain. He has a distinguished career in the diplomatic service and returned again to England on another mission. In 1824 he was appointed Persia's first Minister of Foreign Affairs.\nPortrait of Mirza Abul Hasan by William Beechey, 1810\nLawrence, a future President of the Royal Academy, was a leading portraitist when he received the commission. He had a relatively short time-span to work due to the ambassador's imminent departure. Lawrence was unused to painting beards, as the Regency era fashion was for clean-shaven faces. He also had to portray the sitter's turban and ornamental dagger. A full-length painting of the ambassador by William Beechey was also produced.\nToday the Lawrence portrait is part of the collection at Harvard Art Museums.\n",
    "\nSittich Karl Rudolf Hans von Berlepsch (18 October 1857 - 2 September 1933) was a German nobleman who took an interest in bird conservation in Germany. He introduced a wooden nest box, established an ornithological station in Seebach, and wrote a book on bird conservation in 1899. He was involved in the passing of the German bird protection act of 1908. He was a cousin of the ornithologist Hans von Berlepsch.\nLife and work\nBerlepsch's nest box design\nVon Berlepsch was born in Seebach near M\u00fchlhausen in Thuringia to Rudolf Sittig Gottlob (1825\u201384) and Pauline n\u00e9e Barthels (1837\u20131910). August von Berlepsch was an uncle. The family coat of arms included five parakeets. Even as a young boy he was interested in birds and was an army officer from 1879 to 1905 travelling around Europe and also to Brazil. In 1908 he was a guest of Dr Alexander Koenig's expedition to Norway, Spitzbergen and Bear Island. He observed the destruction of migrating birds in Italy. In 1890 he spoke about the killing of birds in Italy at the 2nd International Ornithological Congress at Budapest. He retired in 1918 with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Returning to the Seebach Castle he introduced a wooden nests imitating a woodpecker nest hole for birds to nest. In an autobiographical note in 1922 he wrote that the nest boxes he designed were a failure as many of the birds that nested in them were unsuccessful in raising broods. He also suggested the planting of bird protection shrubs supporting these ideas in his 1899 book Der Gesamte Vogelschutz. In 1908 he established an ornithological station in Seebach which was declared as a model station for bird protection by the Prussian government. At the 1905 International Ornithological Congress at London he presented a paper on his determination of Erithacus cairii as being merely the juvenile of Erithacus tithys (this is now Phoenicurus ochruros). He was involved in protection of gulls at their breeding grounds in Memmert. He however supported the eradication of house sparrows. In 1925 the management of the Seebach station moved to Karl Mansfeld. He received an honorary doctorate from the University of Halle-Wittenberg in 1923. He is buried at Seebach.\n",

Cromarty had previously been represented in the Parliament of Scotland but lost its representation in 1672, regaining it in the 1832 Reform Act.\nFollowing the Act of Union in 1707, the British parliamentary constituency of Cromartyshire was created, replacing the former Parliament of Scotland shire constituency. also called Cromartyshire. Paired as an alternating constituency with neighbouring Nairnshire, the freeholders of Cromartyshire elected one Member of Parliament to one Parliament, while those of Nairnshire elected a Member to the next.\nIn 1832 the town of Cromarty was separated from the county, and became a parliamentary burgh, combined with Dingwall, Dornoch, Kirkwall, Tain and Wick in the Northern Burghs constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

    "\nRafina (French: Raffinage des produits agricoles) is a company based in Bujumbura, Burundi, that manufactures cottonseed oil.\nProducts\nRafina uses cotton oil seeds from COGERCO to produce:\ncottonseed oil for human consumption\noilcake for animal feed. This has become increasingly important with the policy of permanent stabling of all livestock\ncotton substrates, a very fertile environment for cultivation of edible mushrooms\ncotton bark for use as fuel\nByproducts are also sold to manufacturers of cotton cushions and mattresses, soap manufacturers such as Savonor, and manufacturers of combustible bricks.\nHistory\nEarly years\nRafina had its origins in HUILUSA (Huilerie d\u2019Usimbura), created in 1951, owned by a Belgian group.\nAfter several changes of name and ownership, it became RAFINA through 1963 legislation.\nUntil 1985, the original Belgian managers remained with the company.\nLater the company was bought by individuals with 3,000 shares for a share capital of US$300,000.\n51% were nationals of Burundi and 49% were foreigners.\nAs a private company, Rafina keeps its costs to the mimimum.\nRafina had the capacity to crush 15,000 tons of seeds per growing season, but has never used more than a small part of this potential.\nRafina was intended to process and refine oilseeds such as soybeans, peanuts, sunflowers and cotton seeds, and to market the oils and by-products.\nIn practice, state-provided cotton seed from COGERCO became its only commercial input.\nCOGERCO's cotton gin separated fiber, sent to the textile company COTEBU, from seed. which accounted for about 54% by weight.\nAround 10% of the seed was retained for sowing cotton, and the remainder was blown through a seed transport pipe to RAFINA.\nLater difficulties\nProduction at the state-owned cotton producer COGERCO fell by about 70% between 1971 and 2018.\nBetween 1991 and 2006 Rafina cut its staff from 57 to 28.\nAfter 1998, Rafina had to import cotton seed from Tanzania at considerably higher prices than those charged by COGERCO.\nThis affected the price of its oil, which became less competitive compared to imported oil or locally produced palm oil.\nAfter 2007, the seeds were stored by COGERCO, some sold to cattle breeders and the rest sold to Rafina after negotiation.\nIn the 2017\u20132018 season, COGERCO expected to extract 1,300 tonnes of cotton seeds to be sold to Rafina.\nAs of 2021 COGERCO was selling cotton fiber to Afritextile and cotton seeds to the Rafina refinery.\nHowever, it could not meet the demands of either customer, who had to also import cotton fiber or seeds.\nRafina's coottonseed oil was never produced in sufficient quantities to meet domestic demand.\nAs of 2008 Rafina's production of oilcake was 700 to 900 tonnes per year, of which 80% was used in poultry feed and 20% for cattle feed.\nAt first Rafina sold the oilcake to the state-owned breeding company, linked to a national dairy.\nAs these were closed, the cakes were sold to private farms around Bujumbura.\nRafina's factory is increasingly vulnerable to flooding from the Ntahangwa River.\nSee also\nList of companies of Burundi\nEconomy of Burundi",

    "Educationist and social reformer\nGerda Philipsborn (30 April 1895 \u2013 14 April 1943) was a German-born Jewish educator who made significant contributions to the early development of Jamia Millia Islamia, a central university in Delhi, India. Known for her commitment to youth education and social reform, she is called as the \"Aapa Jaan\" (elder sister) of Jamia.\nEarly life and education\nBorn in Kiel, Germany, in 1895, Philipsborn came from a well-off family. She was educated and trained as an opera singer. In Berlin, she initiated her own kindergarten and worked in the Jewish People's home. Philipsborn was involved in fundraising for the Ben Shemen Youth Village project, an agricultural boarding school in Mandatory Palestine, where she taught in 1932. She was also associated with a Berlin asylum organization for refugee children.\nMove to India\nIn 1921, Gerda met three Indian students, Zakir Husain, Abid Husain, and Mohammad Mujeeb, who later would become the founders of Jamia Millia Islamia and also play important roles in India's political history, with Zakir Husain becoming the country's third president in 1967. She met them while they were studying in Berlin. The trio shared their vision of creating an educational institution in India free from colonial influence with Gerda. Their discussions introduced Gerda to the ideas of Gandhian self-sustenance and the role of education in the Indian independence movement. Influenced by these ideas, she moved to India in December 1932 and joined Jamia Millia Islamia in January 1933.\nContributions to Jamia Millia Islamia\nAt a time when few women were involved in education on such a scale, Gerda played a crucial role in shaping the institution's Nursery and Primary School section. She introduced innovative teaching methods that she had learned in Germany & dedicated her life to the development of the institution.\nHer commitment went beyond education. She was actively involved in the creative and personal development of the students. She initiated \"Piyami Baradari\", an educational society that facilitated children's writings and correspondence across the country. She also launched an international children's journal called \"Payam-i-Talim\" (Messages of Education), which encouraged creative expression through arts and crafts. She organized regular health check-ups and extracurricular activities for students, while serving as the warden for the children's hostel.\nShe introduced arts and crafts, such as embroidery and knitting, to women at Gandhi's ashram in Sevagram. In addition, she was actively involved in helping women who were traditionally excluded from public roles to participate in educational and community events at Jamia.\nWorld War II\nGerda, as a German national in British India, was arrested and interned at the Purandhar camp in 1940 under suspicion of being an enemy of the British Empire. There, she maintained her spirit, nursing fellow inmates and organizing events to lift morale. However, her health deteriorated during this period. After her release, she returned to Jamia but struggled with declining health due to a gastric ulcer that later became cancerous.\nDeath and legacy\nGerda Philipsborn died in April 1943 and was buried in the Jamia graveyard. Her contributions to the institution, particularly in the early years, have been under-appreciated and unnoticed in mainstream historical accounts. Though much of her personal life remains undocumented, her impact on Jamia Millia Islamia and the broader Indian educational landscape continues to be acknowledged by scholars and students. Her legacy is remembered at Jamia, where a daycare center and a girls' hostel have been named in her honor.\nScholars such as Syeda Hameed have referred to Philipsborn as an \"invisible architect\" of Jamia and one of Jamia's \"Khatoon-e-Awwal\" (Jamia's number one woman).\n",

    "RNLI Lifeboat station in North Ayrshire, Scotland\nLargs Lifeboat Station is located at the junction of Greenock Road and Barfields, in the seaside town of Largs, which sits on the Firth of Clyde, in North Ayrshire, on the west coast of Scotland.\nA lifeboat station was first established at Largs in May 1964 by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI).\nB-class (Atlantic 75) Peggy Keith Learmond (B-739), ready in the new boathouse\nThe station currently operates a B-class (Atlantic 85) Inshore lifeboat (ILB), R. A. Wilson (B-854), on station since 2011.\nHistory\nIn response to the increasing amount of water-based leisure activity around the coast, the RNLI decided to introduce a number of small fast Inshore lifeboats, which could respond quickly to local emergencies, and be launched with just a handful of people. Trials took place over the winter of 1963, and it was decided that 25 Inshore boats would be placed around the UK. In Scotland, just two sites were chosen, at Broughty Ferry and Largs.\nIn May 1964, Largs Lifeboat Station was established, with the arrival of an unnamed 16-foot D-class (RFD PB16) Inshore lifeboat, (D-22). Initially, the Inshore boats were seasonal, being introduced in the spring, and withdrawn in autumn. The stations didn't always get the same boat back each year.\nThe Largs Inshore lifeboat was launched to the aid of 6 men aboard a drilling rig (pontoon) off Hunterston. On arrival, the pontoon was found to be moving violently in the rough conditions, and it was decided to take the six men off. All 6 men, and their service launch, were recovered to Hunterston Jetty. A 'Framed Letter of Thanks signed by the Chairman of the Institution' was awarded to each of the three crew of the ILB, John H Harrison, Helmsman, and crew members Robert Watson, and John Mackie.\nIt was decided in 1973, that a larger faster twin-engined B-class lifeboat would be placed at Largs. The relief B-class (Atlantic 21) lifeboat Co-operative No.1 (B-511) arrived on station temporarily in 1973 for training. Soon afterwards, the D-class (RFD PB16) (D-151) was withdrawn, and  the Atlantic 21 lifeboat William McCunn and Broom Church Youth Fellowship (B-513) was placed on service, to become the permanent lifeboat at Largs until 1980.\nAt a ceremony on July 18 1981, a new boathouse, funded from the legacy of the late Miss Janet Brunton, was formally handed over to the RNLI, and the new Atlantic 21 which had arrived in 1980 was named Independent Forester Liberty (B-547).\nOn 24 July 1983, Largs lifeboat Independent Forester Liberty (B-547) was launched to the aid of a capsized motor-boat, off Fairhaven, on the east side of Great Cumbrae Island, with four people aboard. Two men had been picked up by a yacht, and the third was pulled unconscious from the water into a motor-boat, but didn't survive. The fourth person, a girl, was still trapped in an air-pocket in the boat. After several attempts ducking into the water, and under the upturned boat, crewman Arthur Hill managed to get the girl free, and into the waiting lifeboat. Hill was awarded both the RNLI Silver Medal, and the Maud Smith Award 1983. Helm John Strachan was accorded 'The Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum'.\nLargs B-class (Atlantic 85) lifeboat R. A. Wilson (B-854)\nIn 1997, the station received a replacement lifeboat, the larger B-class (Atlantic 75). The 1981 boathouse was no longer big enough to accommodate both the boat and the Talus MB-764 County amphibious tractor used to launch the boat.

    "American architect, 1867-1923\nFor other people named Albert Sutton, see Albert Sutton (disambiguation).\nAlbert Sutton (June 6, 1867 \u2013 November 18, 1923) was a noted architect in the Pacific Northwest, especially in the cities of Tacoma, Washington; San Francisco, California; Portland, Oregon; and their vicinities. Apart from his first 8 years in San Francisco, he thrived working with his architectural partners: James Pickles for 7 years in Tacoma, Charles P. Weeks for 7 years in San Francisco, and Harrison A. Whitney for 11 years in Portland, prior to his sudden untimely death.\nLife and career\nEarly life\nAlbert Sutton was born 1867 in Victoria, British Columbia, the eighth of nine children to John and Anna Sutton. His father led a seafaring life as chief engineer in the Pacific Squadron of the U.S. Navy during the 1860s and was on the George S. Wright Steamer when it tragically disappeared in January 1873 off Sitka, Alaska on its way back to Portland, Oregon.\nSutton grew up in Portland, Oregon, where his family moved to when he was a young boy, and attended public schools there.  He relocated to Berkeley, California for two years of study at the University of California.  He then became a draftsman for the Southern Pacific Railroad, working on railroad bridges and buildings for three years.\nPickles & Sutton, Tacoma\nSutton moved in 1888 to Tacoma, Washington, during its railroad boomtown period, when it served as the western terminus of the newly completed northern transcontinental railroad. Sutton, in his early twenties, fortunately was able to became a junior partner with architect James Pickles, who was thirty. Together, Pickles & Sutton designed many of the historic commercial buildings in Tacoma in the early boom years, using design elements from the Romanesque Revival style which was in vogue at the time. Their portfolio included the Sprague Block (1888); the Sprague Building (1889); the U.S. Post Office (1889); the Abbot Building (1889); the Uhlman Block (1889); the Baker Building (1889); the Wolf Building (1889); the Dougan Block (1890); the Holmes & Ball Furniture Co. (1890); the Joy Block (1892); and the Berlin Building (1892).\nSutton got married in 1894 to Ethel F. Meek of San Lorenzo, California and moved the following year to the big city, San Francisco, where they had two daughters, Alberta and Anna.\nSutton & Weeks, San Francisco\nAlbert Sutton's design of new buildings to house affiliated colleges of the University of California: San Francisco Call, 8 February 1896\nSt. Peter's Chapel, Mare Island: designed by Albert Sutton, 1900, NRHP-listed\nIn San Francisco, Sutton entered a 1895 design competition for new buildings to house the affiliated colleges of the University of California, including the College of Medicine, the College of Dentistry & Pharmacy, and the College of Law. Although he did not win the award, he garnered among five finalists the largest support of the Board of Regents on their first two ballots and established his presence as an architect. In 1896 he designed a new building for the Good Samaritan Mission near 2nd and Folsom streets in San Francisco. The following year he was selected by the board of trustees to design a new $125,000 homeopathic hospital on Lake street between 14th and 15th avenues of San Francisco, with support from philanthropist Phoebe Hearst for a children's ward. In 1900 he designed the St. Peter's Chapel, Mare Island, which was dedicated in 1901. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places and is the oldest extant U.S. Navy chapel.\nBaker and Hamilton Building: formerly, Pacific Hardware and Steel Company Building, designed by Sutton & Weeks, 1904, NRHP listed\nAround 1903 Sutton formed the firm of Sutton & Weeks with junior partner Charles Peter Weeks (1870\u20131928), which increased his reach in California. Their portfolio ranged from the Pacific Hardware and Steel Company Building (San Francisco, 1904), which is listed in the National Register of Historic Places, to the Citizens' National Bank of San Francisco (1905), and the Zeta Psi House in Berkeley (1910). Other works designed were, according to historian Carey, \"the Farmers & Merchants Bank at Oakland, the John A. Roebling's Sons Company building at San Francisco, said to be one of the best examples of fireproof construction in the country... \". Moreover, Sutton & Weeks bested the State competition in 1906 to obtain the premium controlling contract to remodel the California State Capitol in Sacramento. As the senior partner, Sutton spent much time working with the State Capitol commission, which consisted of Governor Pardee, Secretary of State Curry, and State Treasurer Reeves; this resulted in State appropriations of almost $700,000 for the remodeling project completed in 1908.\nAfter a public contested divorce and child custody battle in the courts, Sutton received custody of the two daughters, remarried in 1909 to Marie L. Hewitt of Tacoma, and retired to a ranch in Hood River, Oregon the",
    "Australian rules football player\nAustralian rules footballer\nCooper Hamilton (born 24 September 2003) is an Australian rules footballer who last played for the Greater Western Sydney Giants in the Australian Football League (AFL).\nCareer\nHamilton played with the Bendigo Pioneers in the NAB League and the Colbinabbin Football Club in the Heathcote District Football League (HDFL) before being drafted to the Giants with pick 13 in the 2022 rookie draft. During the 2022 pre-season, Hamilton broke the club's two-kilometre time trial record.\nHe played his first game for the Giants' reserves team in round 1 of the 2022 Victorian Football League (VFL) season. Hamilton made his AFL debut in round 7 against Adelaide, recording 12 disposals in a 59-point victory. He played in another three games in 2022 and four games in 2023, and was given a one-year contract extension at the end of the season.\nBeginning in 2023, Hamilton appeared in a number of viral videos released by the club on social media. This included a video released prior to the 2023 preliminary final against Collingwood, which the Giants lost.\nHamilton did not play any AFL games for the Giants in 2024. He was delisted at the end of the season.\n",
    "American speculator and slave owner (1774\u20131834) \nJohn Brahan (June 8, 1774\u00a0\u2013 July 5, 1834) was a resident of the frontier-era U.S. South. He was a land speculator, public official, and militia officer in Tennessee and Alabama. In 1819 he resigned from his job as receiver of public monies at the public land office in Huntsville, Alabama because the federal bank account was short $80,000.\nBiography\nBrahan was originally from Fauquier County, Virginia. He was married to Mary Weakley, daughter of Tennessee politician and landowner Robert Weakley. Brahan was paymaster of the Tennessee militia in 1804 at Fort Southwest Point. He and William Dickson were appointed to work at the Nashville Land Office on April 10, 1809. Brahan was in the Natchez District of Mississippi Territory when his appointment came through. A military staff list published at Natchez in May 1809 listed Brahan as a captain.\nBoth Brahan and Dickson were land speculators. Brahan's job was \"receiver of public monies\" and Dickson's job was registrar. Both men had a connection to William P. Anderson who was the district surveyor \"who had been one of those instrumental in effecting\" the Chickasaw treaty of 1805, and to an extended network of speculators and surveyors that included James Jackson, John Coffee, John Drake, John Strother, Edward Ward, and Thomas Freeman. Many of this group were long-time allies of Tennessee planter and speculator Andrew Jackson, and connected to one another by a dense web of business and family ties.\nThese men were all early buyers of lands in the vicinity of the Big Spring, shortly thereafter organized as the town Twickenham, Madison County, Mississippi Territory. The settlement quickly discarded \"Twickenham,\" reverting to the name which had been used by the squatters who already lived there, and by which it is now known: Huntsville, Alabama. Per approved petition to the U.S. Congress made by Brahan, the Nashville Land Office became the Huntsville Land Office on August 7, 1811. In 1811, Brahan was also serving as the receiving officer for the Cherokee Indian Agency at Huntsville, and wrote to Return J. Meigs, \"It is rumored that the Creeks are preparing for war against us, if true they must be a blind \u00a0people, and will no doubt prove their own destruction.\" \nBrahan and Leroy Pope both served as \"principal contractors for Jackson's army during the Creek War.\" In March 1814, \"from Fort Strother, Jackson subcontracted with the Huntsville firm of Pope and Brahan,\" ordering rations for 3,000 for 40 days. However, Madison County merchants \"had difficulty fulfilling their promises. Jackson had to plead directly to the wealthiest planters in Madison County to secure cornmeal for his starving soldiers.\"\nLeroy Pope was at the center of a crew of Virginians and Georgians including Thomas Bibb, William Bibb, Charles Tait, and his son-in-law John Williams Walker, who eventually became so politically powerful in Madison County and Alabama generally that they were called the \"Royal Party.\" This group were also connected to William H. Crawford, soon to be Secretary of the Treasury, and a once and future enemy of Jackson. In January 1818, Brahan, John Read, three Popes (including LeRoy), Thomas Bibb, and others were named directors of Planters' and Merchants' Bank of Huntsville. In November Brahan advertised that he had two cotton gins running in Spring Grove near Huntsville. In 1818, a commission merchant in Natchez listed Braham & Hutchings of Huntsville as a reference in an advertisement; Braham was a common misspelling of Brahan, and Hutchings was most likely Andrew Jackson's nephew John Hutchings, although he had already died the prior autumn. The same year chronicler Anne Royall visited Huntsville and wrote in a letter, \"General Brahan, of the late war, is a prince, in whatever light he may be viewed. He is polite and affable; of great size; handsome person; of middle age, and a man of great wealth.\"\nThe Panic of 1819 hit Tennessee and Alabama Territory hard, and the usual cascade of financial failure following times of rampant speculation began. As hints of irregularities began to emerge, officials in Washington inquired with Brahan, but it was 17 months from start to finish before they received any kind of useful disclosure. In March 1819, Josiah Meigs wrote him \"I am directed by the Secretary of the Treasury to inform you that he is extremely dissatisfied on account of your neglecting to settle your accounts, that no longer delay is admissible\u2014and that if an immediate settlement is not made it will be necessary to adopt such measures as will better secure the rights & interests of the Government.\" In June 1819 Brahan wrote Meigs \"I have the mortification to inform you that there is a considerable deficiency in my cash account, the cause I can only account for in part\" and resigned from the job.  According to Treasury Secretary William H. Crawford the account was short US$80,000 (equivalent to $1,592,348 in 2023) and he suspecte",
    "Lifeboat station in Lancashire, England\nMorecambe Lifeboat Station actually comprises two stations, located on the promenade in Morecambe, a seaside town situated on the Morecambe Bay estuary, on the north Lancashire coast.\nMorecambe Hovercraft Station\nAn Inshore lifeboat was first stationed in Morecambe by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1966. In 2002, a hovercraft was also placed at a second station.\nThe station currently operates a D-class (IB1) Inshore lifeboat, Brenda Raworth (D-855), on station since 2021, and a modified Griffon Type 470TD Hovercraft, The Hurley Flyer (H-002), on station since 2002.\nHistory\nIn 1964, in response to an increasing amount of water-based leisure activity, the RNLI placed 25  small fast Inshore lifeboats around the country. These were easily launched with just a few people, ideal to respond quickly to local emergencies.\nMore stations were opened, and in May 1966, a lifeboat station was established at Morecambe, with the arrival of a D-class (RFD PB16) Inshore lifeboat, the unnamed (D-93).\nIn rough seas, and a south west gale, on 5 August 1973, two men were spotted in a small dinghy on the Clark Wharf Sandbank, 1\u20442 mile (0.80\u00a0km) north west of Heysham Harbour. Unable to get close, Helm Keith Willacy went over the side with a lifeline. Attempts to reach the men failed, so he then anchored the D-class lifeboat, veered down, and the men were brought to safety. For this service, Helm Willacy was awarded the RNLI Bronze Medal, whilst crew member Andrew Jarvis was accorded 'The Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum'.\nJust nine years later, on 18 October 1982, a second medal service was carried out at Morecambe. The lifeboat was called to a windsurfer in trouble in Half Moon Bay, in a south east gale. After a search in demanding conditions, with waves eight to nine feet high, requiring considerable boat handling skills, the man was located 40 feet (12\u00a0m) up a concrete marker pillar. Having tied his board to the ladder, access up or down was impossible, and the man eventually jumped into the sea to be rescued. Helm Keith Willacy was awarded the RNLI Silver Medal, with 'The Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum' awarded to crew members Anthony Terence Jolley and Robert Alan Coyle.\nA new boathouse, with improved crew facilities, and retail space for a souvenir shop, was constructed on Marine Road Central in 1998.\nAfter preliminary trials in 2001 were satisfactory, and following further tests at Poole, Flint, Southend-on-Sea and Hunstanton, it was decided to place the first RNLI Hovercraft at Morecambe. The location was chosen primarily due to the extensive and dangerous mud-flats and quick-sand, which extend across Morecambe bay at low tide.\nH-002 Hurley Flyer at Morecambe\nThe hovercraft became operational on 23 December 2002, and at a ceremony in 2003, was named Hurley Flyer (H-002), having been funded by Mrs Kay Hurley of Oxfordshire. \nOn the night of 5 February 2004, to highlight the dangers encountered in the area, tragedy struck Morecambe Bay. Emergency services were alerted by a desperate call made to 999 by Guo Binglong. A large group of 30 Chinese cockle pickers were caught out by the sands and the tide. The cocklers were under the direction of illegal gang masters who were compelling them to work in these dangerous conditions, for little pay, with no regard for their safety, and in 2006, the group's gangmaster was found guilty of manslaughter, and jailed for 14 years. Lifeboat crews made every effort to save lives, but 23 people drowned, including Guo Binglong, and the main task ended up recovering bodies. A framed letter of thanks signed by the chairman of the institution, Mr Peter Nicholson, was awarded to John Beaty, lifeboat operations manager, with a second letter to all the crew and shore helpers.\nTemporary facilities for the Hovercraft had been provided in 2003, costing \u00a364,883. In 2009, a second station building was constructed 1\u20442 mile (0.80\u00a0km) to the west along the promenade, providing permanent facilities, costing \u00a3935,528.\nStation honours\nThe following are awards made at Morecambe\nRNLI Silver Medal\nKeith Willacy, Helmsman - 1983\nRNLI Bronze Medal\nKeith Willacy, Helmsman - 1973\nThe Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum\nAndrew Jarvis, crew member - 1973\nAnthony Terence Jolley, crew member - 1983\nRobert Alan Coyle, crew member - 1983\nKeith Willacy, Helmsman - 1990\nSteven J.

    "The front of the Moselkern stele.\nThe back of the Moselkern stele.\nThe Moselkern stele is a Merovingian basalt monument with two openwork Christian crosses. The stele, which has been dated to the 7th century CE, was excavated from the cemetery of Moselkern, Germany around 1800. The upper cross of the stele is thought to show a crucified Christ in relief; if so, it is among the oldest sculptures of the crucifixion north of the Alps.\nDiscovery and location\nThe stele was excavated from the cemetery of Moselkern around 1800, where it was thereafter placed. Moselkern lies at the mouth of the Elzbach, west of the Rhine. This region was, by the 7th century, already Christianised under the Franks.:\u200a211\u200a\nThe stele's historical value was not noticed until 1915.:\u200a184\u200a The stele is presently in the collection of Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn. Replicas of the stone were placed within the church and in the cemetery. An image of the stele has been on the coat of arms of the municipality since 1982.\nDescription\nThe stele measures 80\u00a0cm by 44\u00a0cm by 14\u00a0cm and is made of Niedermendig basalt.:\u200a184\u200a The stele has been dated to the 7th century CE.:\u200a187\u200a\nThe shape of the stele is trapezoid, with a triangle gable on top. The original base of the stone is missing. The most prominent feature of the stele is two crosses embedded in square openwork. The lower cross is a diagonal cross. Incised horizontal and vertical lines frame the lower cross. All four arms have parallel lines are carved into them, which are interrupted in the centre by a small Greek cross. The upper cross is a Greek cross with arms which widen as in a Coptic ankh. A human figure is carved in relief on this cross. The figure's head is in the gable, above the upper arm of the cross; his arms (bent at the elbows) hang around the top of the openwork frame. His torso runs down the upper arm of the cross, his hip is in its centre, and his legs and feet (slender and much truncated) trace the lower arm of the cross. Two small Greek crosses flank the figure's hip and three small Greek crosses surround his head. The crosses besides the figure's hip seem to extend, like daggers, into his hip. The figure's head is disproportionately large, his eyes are deep set, and he is depicted with thick hair and a beard.:\u200a184\u2013185\u200a:\u200a176\u200a\nShallowly carved Greek and Latin crosses decorate the reverse and sides. On the reverse, opposite Christ's head, is a circle relief into which is carved another Greek cross.:\u200a185\u200a:\u200a176\u2013177\u200a\nInterpretation\nThough decorated with an abundance of crosses, the stele was not immediately interpreted as a crucifixion, or even necessarily Christian. German art historian Wilhelm Albert von Jenny\u00a0, for example, conjectured in 1935 that the cross was a syncretic monument, combining native Germanic and Christian symbols, and was pessimistic about the possibility of its interpretation. Historians Kurt B\u00f6hner\u00a0 and Hans Lehner\u00a0, while admitting the stele as Christian, denied that it represented a crucifixion. For Lehner, the human figure was perhaps the deceased. B\u00f6hner thought the hand placement was incompatible with a crucifixion image. The figure does pose some difficulties. It seems to stand in front of the cross rather than being affixed to it.:\u200a185\u2013186\u200a Art historian Lynda Coon has described the figure as \"free-floating\" and \"struggling to pull his human form out of the funerary rock\". The hanging arms, bent at the elbows, are an almost unknown stylistic choice if this is a crucifixion. They are incompatible with the traditional crucifixion pose, in which Jesus is nailed to the cross by his wrists or hands. Furthermore, the figure's stare is rendered with an intensity that hardly suggests a dying Jesus.:\u200a186\u2013187\u200a\nArt historian Victor H. Elbern\u00a0 has compared the Moselkern stele to such early medieval crucifixion reliefs as the Carndonagh stone.\nNonetheless, art historian Victor H. Elbern\u00a0 confidently identifies the figure with the crucified Jesus. The nimbus of three crosses surrounding the figure's head is a sure sign that the figure is a holy one, and not the deceased. In the early medieval period, the crucifixion (and more generally the passion of Christ) was not nearly as popular a subject as it would become later, so the peculiar treatment is to be understood. The figure can be compared to other early medieval depictions of the crucifixions, such as that on the (probably 9th or 10th century) Irish Carndonagh stone, which depict Christ as lively and standing during the crucifixion. The Carndonagh stone, in particular, also depicts Christ with a bulbous head and an intense stare.:\u200a187\u2013192\u200a The comparison to Insular high crosses also troubles the identification of the monument as a gravestone. Many high crosses were erected in graveyards without necessarily being gravestones.:\u200a213\u200a\nWhile Coptic and Insular analogues of (and likely, influences on) the stele can be found, the Moselkern stele is a valuable and unique material representative of Frankish Christianity in",
    "The Glasgow bid for the 2026 Commonwealth Games was a bid by Glasgow, Scotland and Commonwealth Games Scotland to host the 2026 Commonwealth Games following Victoria's withdrawal of hosting the games. On 17 September 2024, it was announced that the bid had been successful.\nHistory\nBackground\nIn the lead-up to Glasgow's bid for the 2026 Commonwealth Games, the process of selecting a host for the event had been marked by uncertainty and upheaval. Following the troubled 2022 bid, which saw the South African city of Durban stripped of hosting rights, the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) implemented a new strategy aimed at supporting potential hosts and securing future Games. Initially, the CGF intended to award both the 2026 and 2030 Games simultaneously, but no firm decision on the 2026 host was made between 2019 and 2022. After Victoria, Australia, was confirmed as the 2026 host, the state government unexpectedly withdrew from the role in July 2023, citing soaring costs. This prompted a renewed search for a replacement host city, creating an opportunity for Glasgow to enter the bidding process.\nBid process\nOn 11 April 2024, it was announced that Glasgow was being considered as a \"last possibility\" to host the 2026 Games in the event, if no other host was forthcoming, in an alternative to safeguard the Games. It was reported that the Games would be in a smaller scale and could reuse venues from the 2014 Commonwealth Games. Accommodation for the athletes would comprise hotels, and possibly a combination of Glasgow Caledonian University and University of Glasgow residences. Furthermore, the costs of the Games would be covered fully by the Commonwealth Games Federation and other corporate sponsors. Discussions were ongoing between Commonwealth Games Scotland, the Scottish Government, and EventScotland with a confirmed bid expected by the end of the month. However, a bid would not end up being submitted at that time. On 25 July 2024, BBC reported that a decision would be made in August.\nOn 11 August 2024, it was speculated that an agreement was reached for Glasgow to take over the hosting rights of the games. A statement from the Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland issued on 30 August 2024, suggested a compact games concept with 10 sports across four venues including the Scotstoun Stadium and the Tollcross International Swimming Centre.\nAnnouncement\nOn 17 September 2024, Glasgow was announced as the host city for the games following a successful bid backed by the Scottish government. The event, scheduled to be a scaled-down version compared to previous Games, will feature fewer sports and athletes than the 2014 edition. The Australian state of Victoria had initially been selected to host the Games but withdrew in 2023 due to rising costs. After securing assurances from Australian authorities, including a multi-million pound investment, Scottish Health and Sport Minister Neil Gray confirmed that Glasgow would step in to host. The event will feature 10 sports across four venues in the city, with athletics and swimming confirmed for Scotstoun Stadium and Tollcross International Swimming Centre. The final details, including additional venues and dates, are yet to be confirmed. Gray described the announcement as a testament to Glasgow's reputation for hosting international events and emphasised that the Games would be delivered without public funding. Contracts and other related material to confirm Glasgow's hosting of the games are expected to be signed in the weeks following.\nProposals\nThe proposals for the 2026 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow reflect a streamlined, cost-effective approach while maintaining high standards of competition.\nVenues\nA key feature of the event will be the use of existing venues, ensuring minimal additional infrastructure costs. Athletics is set to take place at Scotstoun Stadium, while the Tollcross International Swimming Centre will host swimming and diving. The Commonwealth Arena and the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome are slated for cycling events. Additionally, the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) expressed interest in their venues, including the SEC Armadillo, SEC Centre, and The Hydro, to be used during the games.\nScotstoun Stadium\nTollcross International Swimming Centre\nCommonwealth Arena\nSir Chris Hoy Velodrome\nSEC Armadillo\nSEC Centre\nThe Hydro\nOpening and closing ceremonies\nIn line with the emphasis on a more sustainable and accessible Games, the opening and closing ceremonies are expected to be scaled back compared to previous editions. While the specific venue for these ceremonies has not yet been confirmed, Scotstoun Stadium is being considered as a potential host. This proposal aligns with the commitment to delivering a high-quality yet financially responsible event, with a focus on utilising Glasgow's world-class facilities to showcase the city once again on the global stage.\nOn 18 September 2024, Ian Reid, chairman of Commonwealth Games Scotland, indicated that while traditional op",
    "\nVeeraphol Sahaprom vs. Joichiro Tatsuyoshi (II), billed as Final Chapter, was a professional boxing match contested on August 29, 1999, for the WBC bantamweight championship.\nBackground\nAfter Japanese superstar Joichiro Tatsuyoshi lost his WBC bantamweight title to a Thai challenger, former WBA champion and former skilled Muay Thai fighter Veeraphol Sahaprom, aka Veeraphol Nakhonluang Promotion on December 29, 1998, at Osaka Municipal Central Gymnasium.\nThis made Veeraphol come back to the world champion again and he successfully defended the title once in Saraburi on May 21, 1999, by knocking out the Uruguayan Mauro Blanc in the 5th round. This second encounter with Tatsuyoshi was his second defense of his title.\nFor Tatsuyoshi, after losing by knockout to Veeraphol in the 6th round late last year, there was no more non-title fight, but returned to fight for the title again with old rival, Veeraphol.\nShortly before the fight, his father, who had nurtured him to be a boxer since he was a child, passed away. This deeply saddened Tatsuyoshi, but it also gave him the motivation to win. He announced that he would not bury his father's ashes in the cemetery until he regained the WBC bantamweight title.\nThe fight\nThe fight took place at Osaka Dome (now Kyocera Dome Osaka), Osaka, amidst the huge crowd of spectators, most of whom were Tatsuyoshi's supporters. Tatsuyoshi's family, consisting of his wife, his mother, and children, sat at the ringside holding a photo of the late father. As for Tatsuyoshi himself, this time, the back of his robe also had his father's picture embroidered on it. It was worth noting that in this fight, his trunks and boots were all metallic blue, as were the colour of his gloves, which was a departure from his usual white trunks and boots. As for Weeraphon, he also wears blue gloves.\nWhen the two actually fought with Richard Steele as the referee, Tatsuyoshi could barely do anything to Veeraphol. He was hit by Veeraphol's punches many times. When Veeraphol lunged at him, Tatsuyoshi only defended by hugging and locking him down and holding Veeraphol's neck.\nEven though they knew that their favorite was at a disadvantage, the Japanese fans chanted Tatsuyoshi's name repeatedly to cheer him on.\nThe bout finally came to an end in round 7 when Veeraphol unleashed another series of punches at Tatsuyoshi's face, hich he failed to block. The final punch was a right hook that hit Tatsuyoshi's jaw hard. Richard Steele jumped in to stop the contest, and turned to support Tatsuyoshi as he looked like he was going to fall on his back. Veeraphol also rushed in to support him, having previously glanced at Steele as if to ask him to stop the fight.\nAftermatch\nAfter the match, Tatsuyoshi showed his sportsmanship by raising Veeraphol hand to acknowledge his victory. They talked for a while, \"you are the superb champ\", Tatsuyoshi said, poking Veeraphol's chest with his forefinger. Tatsuyoshi even carried Veeraphol around the ring, and Veeraphol carried Tatsuyoshi back as well.\nEven after defeat, the spectators kept chanting Tatsuyoshi's name until he walked back to his locker room.\nVeeraphol gave an interview on the ring saying that Tatsuyoshi was stronger and more powerful this time.\nYears later, after Veeraphol retired, Tatsuyoshi continued to box, but in his later years.

    "Lifeboat station in Flintshire, Wales\nFlint Lifeboat Station is located in the shadow of Flint Castle at the end of Castle Dyke Street, in Flint, a town situated on the south bank of the River Dee estuary, on the North Wales coast.\nAn Inshore lifeboat was first stationed in Flint by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1966.\nThe station currently operates a D-class (IB1) Inshore lifeboat, Lady Barbara (D-795), on station since 2016.\nHistory\nIn 1964, in response to an increasing amount of water-based leisure activity, the RNLI placed 25  small fast Inshore lifeboats around the country. These were easily launched with just a few people, ideal to respond quickly to local emergencies.\nMore stations were opened, and in May 1966, a lifeboat station was established at Flint, with the arrival of a D-class (RFD PB16) Inshore lifeboat, the unnamed (D-37).\nAt 20:05 on 26 February 1983, the Flint Inshore lifeboat (D-252) was launched to the aid of the cabin cruiser Heron II, in difficulty 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) south east of Mostyn Docks. In dark and difficult conditions, the D-class (Zodiac III) lifeboat arrived to find the boat with the anchor out, but aground and taking on water. Skilfully bringing the lifeboat alongside, two crew had to board the vessel, and carry off one of the survivors, who had collapsed. Helmsman Robert Alan Forrester was awarded the RNLI Bronze Medal, whilst the two crew were accorded 'A Framed Letter of Thanks, signed by the Chairman of the Institution'.\nA new purpose-built boathouse was constructed in 1985. The D-class lifeboat had previously been housed in one of the temporary 'Hardun' type boathouse, in use at many stations since the mid-1960s.\nIn 1990, during hurricane force north westerly winds and very high tides, the Abergele suburb of Pensarn, and the seaside resort of Towyn suffered heavy flooding. Flint lifeboat crew worked 14 hours each day between 26 February and 1 March to help those people stranded, and succeeded in bringing one hundred and eighty people to safety. The station was awarded a special certificate in recognition of the extraordinary efforts made.\nOn 5 June 1991, local man Graham Oare set out in his 17\u00a0ft (5.2\u00a0m) open fishing boat, and rescued three fishermen, after their boat capsized and sank off Flint Castle. In a tradition going back to 1824, when any rescuer may be commended by the Institution, Graham Oare received a 'Framed Letter of Thanks, signed by the Chairman of the Institution'.\nOn Tuesday 19 December 2006, the D-class (IB1) Sir Y Flint (D-658) was placed on service, one of a new class of Inshore lifeboat.  This lifeboat had been funded by The Flintshire Lifeboat Appeal.\nAfter serving for 10 years, Sir Y Flint was replaced in 2016 by the current Inshore lifeboat, Lady Barbara (D-795). This new lifeboat, costing \u00a348,000, was partially funded by a \u00a335,000 donation from local RNLI supporter David Sadler, in memory of his late wife Barbara, who died in 2015.\nStation honours\nThe following are awards made at Flint\nRNLI Bronze Medal\nRobert Alan Forrester, Helmsman - 1983\nA Framed Letter of Thanks signed by the Chairman of the Institution\nDenis James Smith, crew member - 1983\nTerrance Henry Jacklin, crew member - 1983\nMr Graham Oare - 1991\nA Special Framed Certificate, for service to Towyn and Pensarn during extreme flooding\nFlint Lifeboat Station - 1990\nBritish Empire Medal\nRobert Alan Forrester, Lifeboat Operations Manager - 2020QBH\nRoll of honour\nIn memory of those lost whilst serving Flint lifeboat.\nDuring a service launch, 9 April 2001\nWilliam E.

    "American feminist writer\nSada Bailey Fowler (fl.\u20091886\u20131900) was an American feminist writer. \nBiography\nFowler was a Quaker and a spiritualist, from Philadelphia.\nIn 1886, Fowler published her feminist novel Irene, Or, The Road to Freedom, which argued for free love and the abolition of marriage. The novel caused a sensation and was widely discussed and debated, including in some of the biggest literary reviews in the United States. Parents in the freethinking movement even encouraged their children to read her book, in order to develop their views on egalitarian relationships.\nLater that year, when the free love practitioner Lillian Harman was put on trial for violating marriage laws, Fowler publicly defended her, comparing Harman to an abolitionist. She described her as \"one of the inspired women of our time\" and upheld her declaration of free love as \"one of the noblest declarations that a true woman can make\". Fowler contributed copies of her novel Irene for resale, in order to fund Harman's defense campaign.\nShe also began writing for Harman's publication, Lucifer, the Light-Bearer, in which she elaborated her views on free love. She described Harman's father and editor-in-chief of Lucifer, Moses Harman, as the \"William Lloyd Garrison of the age\". She engaged in an exchange with other feminist contributors to the paper, in which they discussed what form an ideal marital union should take. In Lucifer, Fowler wrote that she had heard fewer complaints about sexual slavery from Quaker women than from women of any other religious denomination. She was helped in her writing by the anarchist-feminist Voltairine de Cleyre, who in 1900, she provided with lodging at her farmhouse in Torresdale.\nSelected works\nBooks\nIrene, Or, The Road to Freedom (1886)\nArticles\n\"An Open Letter to Lillian Harman\" (Lucifer the Light Bearer, October 8, 1886)\n\"'Happy New Year' to Noble Lucifer\" (Lucifer the Light Bearer, December 17, 1886)\n\"Sister Bailey to Sister Lake\" Lucifer the Light Bearer, February 11, 1887)\n\"Letter to the Editor\" (Lucifer the Light Bearer, March 7, 1890)\n\"Various Voices\" (Lucifer the Light Bearer, November 20, 1896)",

    "A\u1e63alb\u0101y (died 1509) was a Mamluk consort. She was the concubine of sultan Sayf ad-Din Qa'itbay (r. 1468\u20131496), mother of sultan An-Nasir Muhammad ibn Qaitbay (r. 1496\u20131498), sister of sultan Abu Sa'id Qansuh (r. 1498\u20131500), and wife of sultan Al-Ashraf Janbalat (r. 1500\u20131501).\nLife\nA\u1e63alb\u0101y was a Circassian and fell victim to the Black Sea slave trade, as did her brother. She was either directly purchased, or purchased and given as gift, to the sultan Sayf ad-Din Qa'itbay; it is belived that the sultan bought her directly.\nShe was placed in the Burji harem and used as a concubine. She apparently became the favorite concubine of the sultan, and the mother of An-Nasir Muhammad ibn Qaitbay in 1482. \nWhen it was discovered that her brother was also in the possession of the sultan, he was promoted and able to make a successful career, and he was appointed dawadar, the protector of the Sultan's heir and the future Sultan, Muhammad. \nSince the sultan acknowledged paternity of her son as his, she became manumitted as an Umm walad after the death of Qa'itbay.\nThe Mamluk Sultanate was not in fact an actual monarchy passed from father to son. However, after the death of Qaitbay in 1496, she supported her son's ambitions to conquer the throne. In cooperation with her brother, she successfully supported her son when he defeated the powerful Grand Daw\u0101d\u0101r Aqbard\u012b and conquered power, and participated in supporting her son by using her contacts to create alliances.\nWhen a conflict occurred between her son and her brother in February 1498, she called both to the Cairo Citadel and asked them to given an oath not to fight against each other. \nIn September 1498 she herself came in to conflict with her son when she opposed his wish to marry Mi\u1e63irb\u0101y (d. 1522), the Circassian former slave of Kurtb\u0101y, Governor of Gaza. She was however not able to resolve the dispute.\nHer son was deposed in 1498 and succeeded by her brother sultan Abu Sa'id Qansuh (r. 1498\u20131500).\nIn 1500, she married sultan Al-Ashraf Janbalat (r. 1500\u20131501), who succeeded her brother on the throne the same year. \nHer wealth was displayed when her dowry was transported in procession through Cairo from her residence to that of her new husband during the wedding.\nHer spouse was deposed in 1501, and she left the harem of the Cairo Citadel for a private residence in the city of Cairo. She was temporarily arrested by the new sultan, who wished to acquire her property.\nIn 1508, she performed a pilgrimage to Mecca; this pilgrimage has been referred to as in reality an exile.\nShe remained in Mecca for the rest of her life, since sultan Q\u0101ns\u016bh al-Ghawr\u012b (r. 1501\u20131516) refused to give her permission to return to Egypt.\nShe is known as one of only three female patrons of mosques and minbars during the Mamluk era.\n",
    "Tribal chief of the Banu Abs (died 631 CE)\nQays ibn Zuhayr (Arabic: \u0642\u064a\u0633 \u0628\u0646 \u0632\u0647\u064a\u0631) also known as Abu Hind was a tribal chief of the Banu Abs tribe. He fought against the tribe of Banu Dhubyan in the 6th-century war of Dahis and al-Ghabra. Qays converted to Christianity in his final years and then emigrated to Oman where he stayed for the rest of his life.\nBiography\nFamily\nQays was the son of Zuhayr ibn Jadhima, the former chieftain of the Ghatafan tribal confederation. The full lineage of Qays' father has been stated as Zuhayr, son of Jadhima, son of Rawaha, son of Rabi'a, son of Mazin, son of al-Harith, son of Qutay'a, son of Abs; this traces the lineage of Qays back to the progenitor of the Banu Abs tribe. His mother was Tumadur bint al-Sharid, while his brother was Malik ibn Zuhayr.\nLeadership\nQays became the tribal chief of the Banu Abs, succeeding his father. He is best known during this era for leading his tribe against the Banu Dhubyan in the 40-year war of Dahis and al-Ghabra which started partly due to Qays' brother Malik getting stabbed to death by Dhubyani chief Hudhayfah ibn Badr as retaliation for his own brother being stabbed to death by the Banu Abs; all of this occurred in the first place due to Ibn Badr refusing to pay the Banu Abs their deserved prize of camels as they had won a horse bet against the Banu Dhubyan. Qays successfully killed Ibn Badr in the ensuing battles as well.\nQays ibn Zuhayr also guarded the caravans of Lakhmid ruler Al-Nu'man III ibn al-Mundhir whenever they entered Al Yamama, which gave him special gifts and privileges from Al-Nu'man himself.\nFinal years and death\nQays ibn Zuhayr eventually agreed to stop fighting against the Banu Dhubyan as the blood money for his brother had been paid off by two noblemen from a neighboring tribe. He would later become an ascetic in his final years and then emigrate to Oman where he lived the rest of his life in seclusion until he died in 631 CE (10 AH in the Islamic calendar). Qays had also converted to Christianity during his final years.\nPersonality\nAside from being known as a cunning and courageous tribal chief and warrior amongst the pre-Islamic Arabs, Qays was a famed poet. He received the title \"ar-Ra'i\" due to the decisions he made, which the pre-Islamic Arabs favoured. Some also narrated that he was wise and gave frequent sermons to his people.\nSee also\nZuhayr ibn Jadhima\nKulaib ibn Rabiah",

    "British noblewoman and socialite\nFor the British censor, see Mabel Elliott.\nMabel Louisa Dean Paul (1872\u20131919) was a high-profile English socialite and novelist, and one of the most glamorous British women of the Edwardian era, who was the subject of widespread public and media interest. Over an extended period she also had an extraordinary ability for getting enmeshed in Society lawsuits.\nShe was divorced by her first husband, Colonel Thomas James Atherton (1856\u20131920), following an adulterous scandal involving one senior British royal, resulting in the eventual naming and shaming of Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster (1879\u20131953).\nMabel Louisa Dean Paul by George Charles Beresford. 1902. Credit: National Portrait Gallery, London\nEarly life\nMabel Louisa Dean Paul was the daughter of Edward J. Dean Paul, 4th baronet (died 1895), and his second wife, Elisa Monckton Ramsay, the daughter of Major General James Ramsey, the younger brother of George Ramsay, 12th Earl of Dalhousie.\nPublic figure\nDean Paul has been described by many as a society beauty. Tall and slender, exquisitely gowned, displaying priceless jewels when in public, the London press at the time referred to her as \"the beautiful Mrs. Atherton\" and \"a fascinating disturber of society\". To those dearest of her friends, she was Nancy.\nShe been described by some as a clever and versatile, with a vivid personality who could dominate any social function. Between 1901 and 1919 much of her private life received  public interest and she became more notable for her relationships with royal figures and noblemen. Her looks and personality attracted interest, not seen since Lillie Langtry (1853-1929), a mistress of Edward VII .\nMrs Atherton had been a leading figure within a group of society women who arrived in Cape Colony with the intent of nursing the injured soldiers, however she flirted with the British officers. Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet, a distinguished war surgeon, closely associated with the medical treatment of soldier\u2019s in the Second Boer War, described the presence of society women such as Mrs Atherton as a plague. Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener outburst of \"women and flies\" when describing \"ladies of social standing\", and women\u2019s \"war work\" of a certain kind, Mrs Atherton\u2019s name was freely mentioned.

Mrs Atherton proceeded there and for some time stayed at the same British Army camp as the 21 year old, Captain Hugh Grosvenor, the 2nd Duke of Westminster. An affair ensued with the Duke, which continued when she reached Cape Town.\nHugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster\nWhen her husband, Lieutenant-Colonel Atherton was made aware of her adulterous affair, he arranged for her safe passage back to England during October 1900, whilst the Governor of the colony, Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner ensured that the young Duke was not on the same steamer as Mrs Atherton. Both vessels stopped in Madeira and the adulterous affair  with the Duke affectionately known as  \"Bendor\", after his racehorse Bend Or, or \"Benny\" continued.\nStories of Mrs Atherton\u2019s infidelity with the Duke began to circulate in the American newspapers at the end of February 1901. These articles claimed such events had occurred at the Mount Nelson Hotel, when she was a 28 year old London society nurse, who became entangled with a senior royal, whilst her husband was away fighting with his troops in the Second Boer War. The American newspapers were far more kinder when describing her age, effectively making her 3 years younger in their coverage of the affair.\nMrs Atherton had been very much part of London's High society for some time when she became subject to a public scandal, which culminated in her  husband, Thomas James Atherton who at the time was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the British Army, refusing a cheque for \u00a340,000 from the Grosvenor family lawyers and filing for divorce. Since the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857, divorce in England was a civil affair, with a civil court in London handling all cases.\nThe affair was sensationalised in the American newspapers, since Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster was named as co-respondent a week after his marriage to another socialite, Constance Cornwallis-West. The affair was not reported in British newspapers.\nConstance Edwina, Duchess of Westminster\nThe Duke\u2019s mother, Lady Sibell, the Countess Grosvenor and his stepfather, George Wyndham, then Chief Secretary for Ireland, were both a major influence on him.

    "Hairstyling productHair texture powder is a hairstyling product.\na texture powder dust\nHistory\nHair styling powder, often regarded as a modern innovation, can actually trace its origins back to the late 16th and early 17th century, powdered substances, such as starch or flour, were employed to enhance wigs and natural hair,  during the reign of Henry IV of France. However, the use of hair powder in this period differed significantly from contemporary applications.\nBy the 18th century, the use of hair powder became a status symbol, particularly in France and England. Both men and women from the upper classes used white or tinted powders to style wigs or their natural hair. Hair powder usage began to decline after the French Revolution, as more natural hairstyles came into vogue, and taxes on hair powder were introduced.Short Hair styled with hair texture powder\nModern usage\nIn contemporary hairstyling, texture powder is widely used to create volume and body in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s hairstyles. Unlike the heavier powders of the past, modern formulations are much lighter and are designed to be virtually invisible in the hair. These powders are often made from ingredients such as silica, rice starch, or other fine particulate materials, which help create grip and separation without leaving a residue.\nTexture powders are popular for their versatility and ease of use. They are particularly effective for those with fine or thinning hair, as they add thickness and lift at the roots. Additionally, texture powder can be used to create styles that require hold and definition without the stiffness associated with hair spray or gel.\nTypes\nVolumising powders are designed specifically to boost volume at the roots, providing lift and creating a fuller appearance. Matte powders, on the other hand, work to reduce shine and give the hair a matte finish, making them ideal for modern, tousled styles. Texturing powders add grit and definition to the hair, making them especially useful for achieving a messy or textured look.\nSee also\nWig powder\nHair clay\nDry shampoo\nPomade",

    "Charles Collins (1773 \u2013 June 9, 1845) was an American politician and public official in the state of Rhode Island. He is best known today for his collusion with the slave-trading DeWolf family while serving as collector of the port of Bristol.\nLife\nCollins was the son of Charles Collins (1745\u20131818) and Hannah (Turner) Collins (1750\u20131795) of Warren, Rhode Island. Sometime before 1801 (when their first child was born) Collins was married to Lydia Bradford (1773\u20131854) and was therefore connected by marriage to James DeWolf, a prominent Rhode Island politician, merchant, and slave trader.\nCollins was the captain of the Lucy, a schooner owned by DeWolf that was seized in 1799 by William Ellery, the Newport customs collector, as a slave ship. The DeWolfs recovered the ship by kidnapping Ellery's agent who was going to bid on it at auction and having a straw buyer buy it back cheaply.\nThe efforts of the DeWolfs and others to avoid enforcement efforts by Ellery led to the establishment of a new customs district based at Bristol in 1801, and Collins was appointed collector there in 1804, after pressure from the DeWolfs led to the removal of the first appointee, Jonathan Russell. The DeWolfs were major supporters of President Thomas Jefferson. After 1808 James DeWolf left the slave trade, but his nephew George DeWolf continued his involvement. Collins brought no actions against slave traders during his time as customs commissioner. He was removed in 1820.\nIn 1822 George DeWolf was promoted to the position of Major-General of the Rhode Island militia by the legislature, and Collins was given DeWolf's former position as Brigadier-General of the First Brigade. From 1824 to 1833 Collins was elected lieutenant governor, serving under governors James Fenner and Lemuel H. Arnold. By this time the power of the DeWolfs was waning - James left the United States Senate in 1825, George fled the country to avoid debts in the same year, and James died in 1837.\nPersonal life\nCollins married Lydia Bradford (1773\u20131854), daughter of William Bradford (1729\u20131808), a deputy governor and U.

    "Extinct genus of fishes\nTanaocrossus (Ancient Greek for \"outstretched fringe\", referring to its distinctive dorsal fin) is an extinct genus of primitive freshwater ray-finned fish that inhabited southwestern and eastern North America during the Late Triassic period. It contains a single known species, T. kalliokoskii, known from the United States, with indeterminate species also known.\nIt is primarily known from the Norian to Rhaetian of the Chinle Formation of Colorado and Utah. Indeterminate remains are known from the Dockum Group of Texas and New Mexico (Bull Canyon Formation). A single fragmentary but distinctive fossilized fin from the earlier Carnian-aged Doswell Formation of Virginia, which shares the genus's distinctive fin rays, was long the only record from the eastern United States, but a partial specimen was also later identified from the Manassas Sandstone.\nMorphologically, it can be easily distinguished from other co-occurring fishes by its highly elongated dorsal fin that stretches across its body. Its taxonomic affiliations have long been enigmatic since its description due to its unusual morphology. More recent studies have found it to be a scanilepiform, an enigmatic order of fish which were later found to most likely be basal cladistians, which would make it a distant relative of modern bichirs. A 2008 study questioned this assignment and instead reclassified it to the Perleidiformes, but this has been disputed by later studies.\nIt was likely a slow-moving fish that inhabited quiet waters, with its dorsal fin allowing for undulation while swimming.\n",

Through the 1860s, the Federal Convention examined various proposals, which included plans to build at least eight vessels, to as many as eighteen armored warships. The decision was finalized based on the fleet plan conceived by General Albrecht von Stosch, the new Chief of the Kaiserliche Admiralit\u00e4t (Imperial Admiralty), in the early 1870s.

She displaced 1,098 metric tons (1,081 long tons) as designed and 1,163\u00a0t (1,145 long tons) at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 3\u00a0officers and 73 to 85\u00a0enlisted men. She was powered by a pair of double-expansion steam engines that drove a pair of 4-bladed screw propellers, with steam provided by four coal-fired cylindrical fire-tube boilers, which gave her a top speed of 11 knots (20\u00a0km/h; 13\u00a0mph) at 800 metric horsepower (790\u00a0ihp). At a cruising speed of 7 knots (13\u00a0km/h; 8.1\u00a0mph), she could steam for 700 nautical miles (1,300\u00a0km; 810\u00a0mi).\nThe ship was armed with one 30.5\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) MRK L/22 gun in a barbette mount that had a limited arc of traverse. In practice, the gun was aimed by turning the ship in the direction of fire. The Wespes were intended to beach themselves on the sandbars along the German coastline to serve as semi-mobile coastal artillery batteries. The armored barbette was protected by 203\u00a0mm (8\u00a0in) of wrought iron, backed with 210\u00a0mm (8.3\u00a0in) of teak. The ship was fitted with a waterline armor belt that was 102 to 203\u00a0mm (4 to 8\u00a0in) thick, with the thickest section protecting the propulsion machinery spaces and ammunition magazine. The belt was backed with 210\u00a0mm of teak. An armor deck that consisted of two layers of 22\u00a0mm (0.87\u00a0in) of iron on 28\u00a0mm (1.1\u00a0in) of teak provided additional protection against enemy fire.\nService history\nProfile drawing of the Wespe class as they appeared c. 1900\nScorpion, named for the earlier gunboat Scorpion, was built at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen. Her keel was laid down in July 1876, and she was launched on 19 May 1877. Alexander Georg Mosle, the director of the shipyard and also a member of the Reichstag (Imperial Diet), gave a speech during the launching ceremony. Work on the ship was completed late that year, and she was commissioned into active service on 12 December. After sea trials, she was placed in reserve, and saw no further service for the next several years. In this time, by 1883, the ship had been refitted with an additional 8.7\u00a0cm (3.4\u00a0in) L/24 built-up guns, a pair of 37\u00a0mm (1.5\u00a0in) Hotchkiss revolver cannon, and two 35\u00a0cm (14\u00a0in) torpedo tubes in her bow, both of which were below the waterline. Scorpion recommissioned for the first time on 5 September 1885, for a short period of training exercises as part of the Marinestation der Nordsee (North Sea Naval Station). These took place in Jade Bight and the outer roadstead, and concluded on 8 October. Scorpion then returned to the reserve fleet.\nThe ship remained out of service for another decade, before being reactivated on 13 July 1895 for service with the Armored Gunboat Division, based in Danzig in the Baltic Sea. This lasted for less than three weeks, and Scorpion was again placed in reserve on 1 August. She returned to active service on 3 August 1897, under the command of Kapit\u00e4nleutnant (Captain Lieutenant) Friedrich Musculus. Over the next two months, she participated in the fleet's annual training maneuvers, as part of the Armored Gunboat Reserve Division. Following the conclusion of the exercises, Scorpion was decommissioned on 1 October. The ship was recommissioned on 1 October 1898, and at this time served as the flagship of the Armored Gunboat Reserve Division. She led training cruises off the coast of East Prussia that concluded on 11 November. In 1899, Scorpion spent the summer months, from 6 June to 15 September, as part of the Training Fleet.\nScorpion remained in active service through much of 1900. During this period, on 16 June, she and her sister Natter represented the German fleet at the opening of the Elbe\u2013L\u00fcbeck Canal, which was officiated by Kaiser Wilhelm II. In July, the f",
    "Synagogue located in Paris, in France\nThe Synagogue of Chasseloup-Laubat is a Jewish synagogue located at 14 Rue Chasseloup-Laubat in Paris' 15th\u00a0arrondissement. The synagogue is associated with the Israelite Central Consistory of France.\nIt is one of the last synagogues built according to designs developed during the 19th century in France, an era which saw the Emancipation of Jews and their greater integration into society.  It is considered part of the \"Golden Age of French Synagogues\".,.\nHistory\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, a small Jewish oratory was located on Avenue de La Motte-Picquet in Paris' 15th arrondissement. This location proved to be insufficient to the needs of the community, which had already been there about 50 years. On May 21 and November 15, 1910, the Consistory of Paris bought 754 square meters on Rue Chasseloup-Laubat, from widow Madame Grouselle, for 130,000 francs (equivalent to $369,468,254 in 2022). Baron Edmond de Rothschild, vice-president (and later president) of the Paris Consistory, took charge of the construction of the synagogue, spending 340,000 francs (equivalent to $974,827,778 in 2022)  and another 56,000 francs (equivalent to $159,155,556 in 2022) on the residential pavilion annex for the synagogue.\nArchitect Lucien Bechmann, who had already been chosen by Rothschild for the reconstruction of the Rothschild Hospital, was retained for construction of the synagogue. Relations between Rothschild and Bechmann were so difficult that Bechmann tried to retire multiple times, but J. Wormser, a colleague of Rothschild arrived each time to persuade him to stay.  As early as 1910, Bechmann had developed several sketches for the synagogue, but it wasn't until November 1911 that J. Wormser told him that his last plan had received the approval of the Baron.\nGreat success. \"Saint Sophie\" is pleased. It is in that sense that your study must be continued quickly.\nGrand succ\u00e8s. Sainte Sophie a plu. C'est dans ce sens qu'il faut rapidement poursuivre votre \u00e9tude\u2014\u200aJ. Wormser to Lucien Bechmann\nLike the Synagogue of Boulogne Billancourt, also financed by Baron Rothschild, but designed by architect Emmanuel-\u00c9lis\u00e9e Pontremoli, and consecrated September 21, 1912, the synagogue was designed in a Byzantine style.\nThe permits for construction were obtained September 26, 1912 and a year later on September 29, 1913, the synagogue was officially consacrated during the High Holy Days. In his speech the Chief Rabbi of Paris, Jacques-Henri Dreyfuss, thanked the Baron for his donation, as well as Bechmann, who he compared to Bezalel, chief architect of the Tabernacle.\nIn 1914, Marcel Sachs, Rabbi at the Synagogue of Saint-\u00c9tienne, was named rabbi of the  Synagogue of Chasseloup-Laubat. He remained in that position until his retirement in 1958. During the Second World War, Sachs was able to escape to Lyon, in Vichy France, to rejoin the new seat of the Consistory and the Chief Rabbinate of France, by boarding a locomotive disguised as a railway worker.\nRabbi David Feuerwerker succeeded Sachs, then Rabbi Alain Goldmann. Since 2014, the rabbi has been Mika\u00ebl Journo.\nOn May 4, 2009, in the presence of the Chief Rabbi of France and the Jewish chaplain for the French Armed Forces, the Synagogue of  Chasseloup-Laubat was consecrated during a military ceremony, as a synagogue for the armies.\nArchitecture\nWhile most large consistorial synagogues constructed 30-35 previously had their main entrance directly on the street (like the Grand Synagogue of Paris (1874), Synagogue des Tournelles (1876) and the Rue Buffault Synagogue (1877)), Lucien Bechmann designed the synagogue in the Byzantine style, with an entrance through a courtyard.\nThe synagogue was planned with a square design. The narthex allowed access to the gallery for women as well as two annex rooms serving as an oratory during the week and the other as a social hall and meeting room.\nThe building was constructed of different sizes that are perfectly discernable from the outside. The entrance and the annex halls are located in a rectangular avant-corps, pierced by semi-circular arched windows, each separated by small columns forming an arcade, and in the middle of the room is a porch supported by two black marble columns, topped by a gable crowned with the Ten Commandments. The avant-corps is followed by a small semi-cylindrical volume which allows entry into the sanctuary.\nFor the exterior of the building, Bechmann decided to use beige bricks with a white stone added for the corner quoins, the rosettes, the arcades and the modillons. The sanctuary, a square room, has three walls that are pierced an eight-sided rosette at top of the first floor, mounting a wooden roof lantern. The interior of the synagogue distinguished itself from other synagogues built during this period because of its wooden frame and slender wooden posts holding the gallery and balustrades, also made out of wood. The 13 square meter room is about 15 meters high at the top of",

Sylvia Chang, who had previously collaborated with Huang and Hou on the miniseries Twisted Strings\u00a0 (2022), joined the project five years prior to the start of filming. Chang was approached by Hou and immediately agreed to take on the role of lead actress and co-producer after reading the script. The screenplay took five years to develop, a duration Chang attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which she was also involved in fine-tuning the script. During rewrites, Huang initially considered changing the film's setting to be entirely in Taiwan to reduce production costs, but Chang insisted on retaining the overseas scenes and filming in the United States. Huang also sought advice from filmmakers Wang Shaudi and Arthur Chu\u00a0 on the story. In August 2023, Alannah Ong\u00a0 announced that she would be joining the cast. The project eventually won the Excellent Screenplay Award at the  45th Golden Harvest Awards\u00a0 in November 2023, which led to the project being greenlit on the National Development Fund of Taiwan Creative Content Agency.

    "Radio galaxy discovered in 2024\nFor other uses, see Porphyrion (disambiguation).\nPorphyrion is a Fanaroff\u2013Riley class II radio galaxy located 7.5 billion light years away from Earth, with host galaxy J152932.16+601534.4. It is located in the constellation Draco and it was discovered in Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) data by an international team led by Martijn Oei. Porphyrion has the longest jets of any radio galaxy identified, with lobed structures spanning 7 megaparsecs (23\u00a0million light-years) across, making it the largest known structure of galactic origin. It superseded Alcyoneus, discovered by the same team in 2022, with lobed structures of 5 megaparsecs (16\u00a0million light-years).\nDiscovery\nPorphyrion was first reported in a paper in Nature by Martijn Oei (Leiden University/Caltech) and colleagues, which featured on the cover of the 19 September 2024 issue, after obtaining results from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), an interferometric radio survey of the Northern Sky. Porphyrion was part of a large number of new giant radio galaxies discovered by this team. The giant black hole jet system was named after Porphyrion, a Giant from Greek mythology, by co-discoverer Aivin Gast from the University of Oxford.\nTo find the galaxy from which Porphyrion originated, the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope in India was used along with ancillary data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument in Arizona. The observations pinpointed to the galaxy J152932.16+601534.4, which is about 10 times more massive than the Milky Way.\nCharacteristics\nThe team reporting the discovery described Porphyrion as a 'black hole jets system', rather than a giant radio galaxy, as they considered the latter a confusing term: the jet structure of a radio galaxy is not formally part of the galaxy proper. Radio galaxies are a special class of objects characterized by the presence of radio lobes generated by relativistic jets powered by the central galaxy's supermassive black hole. Giant radio galaxies are different from ordinary radio galaxies in that they can extend to much larger scales, reaching upwards to several megaparsecs across, far larger than the diameters of their host galaxies.\nThe W. M. Keck Observatory on Hawaii was used to show that Porphyrion is 7.5 billion light-years from Earth, and dates to a time when the universe was 6.3 billion years old. The observations also revealed that Porphyrion emerged from a radiative-mode active black hole, as opposed to one in a jet-mode state. Porphyrion's two jets combined have a jet power of 1039 watts, equivalent to the energy output of trillions of suns.\nOei and his colleagues believe that \"every place in the universe may have been affected by black hole activity at some point in cosmic time\". They suggest that giant jet systems like Porphyrion may have had a larger influence on the formation of galaxies in the young universe than previously believed, and suggest that these giant jets could have spread magnetism through the cosmos.\nSee also\nList of largest galaxies\nList of galaxies with notable features",

    "Hungarian footballer and manager (born 1954)\nThe native form of this personal name is G\u00e1lhidi Gy\u00f6rgy. This article uses Western name order when mentioning individuals.\nGy\u00f6rgy G\u00e1lhidi (born 26 January 1954) is a retired Hungarian footballer and manager. As a footballer, he would be primarily associated with playing for Csepel as he would be one of the club's primary players throughout the 1980s. He would be more well known for his managerial career, coaching various Hungarian clubs throughout various seasons of the Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g II where he was commonly recognized as a manager who had the talent to promote clubs of the second division to the top leagues of their respective nations.\nClub career\nG\u00e1lhidi would begin his footballing career by playing for Vasas Izz\u00f3's youth sector beginning in 1963. He would make his senior debut in 1972 and would spend the majority of his early career within the club playing under coach J\u00f3zsef Kov\u00e1cs\u00a0 who he would attribute as being a role model for his football career. His final season with the club would be in 1974\u201375 Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g I as he would then play for Kossuth KFSE for the 1974\u201375 Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g II after the club nearly experienced relegation in 1973\u201374 edition. Despite his career in the club being relatively brief, he would form part of the club's strong defense which would see the club make decent performances before leaving the club after the 1976\u201377 Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g I. After playing for Tatab\u00e1nyai for a few seasons until the 1979\u201380 Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g I, G\u00e1lhidi would spend the next seven years of his career playing for Csepel and alongside J\u00f3zsef Elekes and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lazs\u00e1nyi\u00a0, would be central players in increasing the club's performance by 82% according to statistics of the time due to the club winning by a previously unseen margin in the 1979\u201380 Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g II. Throughout his remaining years as a footballer, he would play for BVSC-Zugl\u00f3 alongside his teammate and friend Pista Kisteleki for the 1987\u201388 Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g I before returning to play for Csepel until the 1989\u201390 Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g I. His final two seasons would be with D\u00f6ms\u00f6d and Szigetszentmikl\u00f3si until his retirement following the 1991\u201392 Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g I.\nInternational career\nG\u00e1lhidi would represent his home country of Hungary during the 1984 Summer Olympics qualifiers where he would play in four matches against Bulgaria, Greece and the Soviet Union.\nManagerial career\nThroughout his later years as a player, he would also serve as a coach for Csepel's youth sector from 1989 to 1992. He would continue his work on youth teams by becoming a talent scout for the youth sectors of Al Wahda in the United Arab Emirates and Al-Nasr in Kuwait. He would have his first fully managerial position through Soproni for the 1995\u20131996 season. He would then coach Duna\u00fajv\u00e1ros from 1996 to 1998. He'd then briefly coach Tiszak\u00e9cske throughout the middle of 1998. He would spend the final years of the 20th century playing for Budapest Honv\u00e9d from the remainder of 1998 to the first half of 1999 to then coach Kuwaiti club Al-Nasr from 1999 to 2001.\nG\u00e1lhidi then would go abroad to coach Shenyang Ginde for the 2002 Chinese Jia-A League. He would briefly return to coach Duna\u00fajv\u00e1ros in 2003 but would abruptly leave before summer despite having some amount of success with his return. This was due to G\u00e1lhidi going on to coach Budapest Honv\u00e9d during the 2003\u201304 Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g II where he would lead the time to be promoted back for the 2004\u201305 Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g I following the club's only regulation to the second tier of Hungarian football which he attributes as being his first major success as a coach. For the remainder of the year, he would coach Kecskem\u00e9ti.

He would then briefly return to manage Al Wahda's U-17 branch in 2009 and 2010 as well as briefly coach Hal\u00e1sztelek in 2011. During his coaching of Szeged 2011 for the 2012\u201313 Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g II, the club would enjoy inicial success through G\u00e1lhidi's focus on discipline and integrity.

    "American writer\n Harper Steele (formerly Andrew Steele) is an American writer. She starred in the 2024 documentary Will & Harper with actor Will Ferrell. She worked at Saturday Night Live from 1995 to 2008, serving as head writer from 2004 through 2008. Her accolades include one Primetime Emmy Award from four nominations.\nEarly life and education\nSteele grew up in Iowa City, a child of two University of Iowa professors. She attended Iowa City High School, graduating in 1979. She has described herself in high school as \"a C-minus student who couldn't spell.\" She tended to hang out with outsiders, only feeling comfortable at school in her senior year, when she became involved with the theater department. She graduated from the University of Iowa with an English degree.\nCareer\nSteele started working at Saturday Night Live the same week as Will Ferrell in 1995. She worked there for 13 years from 1995 to 2008, four as head writer. She was nominated for four Emmy Awards, winning one in 2002. She has described her own political and comedic viewpoints as \"purple-haired woke,\" saying, \"here isn't a trans person I\u2019ve met who doesn't have a sense of humor about themselves.\" She believes that humor can \"make a real positive difference in the world.\" Jimmy Fallon called her \"one of the funniest people I think I've ever met in my lifetime.\nSteele left SNL for Funny or Die in 2008 just after they announced their partnership with HBO. Her role was as creative director for Funny or Die and executive producer of HBO's Funny or Die Presents. She produced the first dozen half-hour Funny or Die shows that were shown on HBO, with her writing used in nine of them. She also co-wrote Casa de mi padre with Eva Maria Peters, The Ladies Man with Tim Meadows and Dennis McNicholas, and Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga with Ferrell.\nAfter coming out to Ferrell about her gender transition in 2022, Ferrell decided he should learn more about the trans community as he was not very knowledgeable. The two decided to undertake and document a cross-country road trip as they processed this change and what it meant for their friendship. Steele had said that, although she had always loved road trips, she felt nervous about traveling alone through small towns and conservative states as a trans woman, noting that anti-trans legislation in many US states could inhibit her ability to use a restroom or even allow her to be legally discriminated against. Steele and Ferrell visited Steele's hometown, including her high school and a local bar she used to frequent.\nOf the resulting film Will & Harper, Steele said, \"I'm very proud of it. I'm scared of... the aftermath of it coming up, but I'm very proud.\" The film premiered at the 40th Sundance Film Festival in January 2024 and was nominated for a people's choice award at the Toronto International Film Festival.\nPersonal life\nIn 2022, Steele began her gender transition, and came out to her friends in letters. These letters said, in part, \"Look, I'm not a very political person, but just by nature of being trans, I'm now a political person in a way. I just ask you as my friends to stand up for me. Do your best to, if I'm misgendered, just speak up on my behalf, that's all I ask.\" When asked for casting suggestions for her if the documentary became a scripted movie, Steele quipped \"I love Hunter Schafer and I feel like I look exactly like her.\"\nAwards and nominations\nNotes\n",
    "Step pyramid\nPyramid of Sinki is a small, layered step pyramid located approximately 5.5 km southeast of the Temple of Seti I and in Abydos, eighth nome in Upper Egypt. It was built on a sand surface, which was common for several layer step pyramids in ancient Egypt.\nThe pyramid is attributed to Pharaoh Huni, likely a mastaba (ancient Egyptian tomb), is made of limestone, aligned with the Nile River, and features mudbrick ramps. There are 14 similar pyramids near it.\nThe pyramid is believed to date back to the Third Dynasty of Egypt (c. 2686 BC\u2013c. 2613 BC). It was built from rough stone blocks and lacks the uniform casing found on other pyramids, resembling structures like those at El Amrah. The pyramid was largely forgotten until renewed interest emerged in 1977, when it became part of a broader study of Egypt's \"Minor Step Pyramids\".\nHistory\nThe pyramid is believed to have been built during the Third Dynasty of Egypt, likely attributed to Pharaoh Huni. Like other minor step pyramids, it likely had symbolic significance related to the Egyptian calendar and Egyptian astronomy, one of many beliefs of ancient Egypt.\nThe pyramid was built with limestone, a type of carbonate sedimentary rock found in many architectural types. It was also built in Abydos, one of the oldest cities of ancient Egypt and the eighth nome in Upper Egypt.\nConstruction\nBrick markers were discovered at the site, serving as reference points for orientation, alignments, inclination, and other building features. Four construction ramps were found at the pyramid, one on each side, as well as others in the middle. These ramps started from the desert surface and leaned onto the core of the pyramid.\nThe estimated original height was about 12.5 meters, but according to archaeological research by Nabil Swelim, the Pyramid of Sinki was not fully finished. The first two layers were successfully completed, but neither a pavement nor an outer facing were constructed, leading to this conclusion.\nWhen manual lifting of building materials was no longer possible, four ramps were erected on each side of the pyramid, but construction stopped at this point as well. At the western corner of Sinki, where the height of the ruin is greatest, there were 16 preserved courses of masonry in layer two at the time of investigation. This indicates that construction had progressed significantly but was not completed.\nWhile the exact reason for abandonment is not completely known, it's likely that the short reign of the pharaoh who commissioned it (possibly Huni) led to the project being left unfinished.\nDiscovery\nThe Pyramid of Sinki was discovered by Nabil Swelim on October 27, 1977, with large-scale excavations beginning in 1980 in collaboration with G\u00fcnter Dreyer, a German Egyptologist from the German Archaeological Institute in Cairo. Initially buried under debris, the pyramid was revealed as a step pyramid with three layers, built in a pit with faulty square orientations and unfinished ramps, suggesting the construction was incomplete. Archaeological research also revealed megalithic blocks beneath the pyramid, indicating possible underground structures that require further exploration, with ongoing studies as recent as 2018.\n",
    "US supplemental airline (1946\u20131969)\nNot to be confused with the Long Beach-based Standard Air Lines (1946\u20131949), also an irregular air carrier, that operated from 1946 to 1949, or with the earlier Standard Air Lines that operated in the 1920s and was merged into Western Air Express\nDC-9 at San Francisco 1968. The cheatline was gold with red borders, as was the \"S\" on the tail. \"Standard\" was in red. See External links for a link to a color photo of the livery\nStandard Airways operated intermittently from 1946 through 1969 as a small supplemental air carrier (earlier known as an irregular air carrier or a nonscheduled carrier) a type of US airline regulated by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), the now-defunct US federal agency that tightly regulated airlines from 1938 to 1978. From 1964 onward, a supplemental air carrier was a charter airline. Until 1964, such airlines were charter/scheduled hybrids and Standard Airways did operate some scheduled services. The airline went bankrupt in 1964 and did not operate again until 1966 with new investors. It converted to jets but then ceased flying again on August 1, 1969. Many attempts were made to restart the airline until the CAB finally revoked its certificate in 1975.\nHistory\nDC-3 demonstrating feathering\nEarly days\nIn November 1945, Shields B. Craft and Natalie Y. Gray created Standard Air Cargo as a 60/40 partnership between them. Both Craft and Gray were involved in military pilot training during World War II, Craft as a pilot instructor, Gray as a dispatcher. They bought a war surplus C-47 and started operations April 1946, engaging in everything from transporting lobsters, flying home returning veterans and transportation between the US mainland and Alaska. Stardard Air Cargo also ran a fixed base operation at San Diego Lindbergh Field, its headquarters. Standard did not consistently operate. For instance, in 1955, it had a single DC-3 that was on six-month lease to California Central Airlines. In 1955 it had a net worth of $145,000 (about $1.7 million in 2024 dollars). By 1953 the carrier was using Standard Airways as a trade name.\nPink cloud\nThe airline spent much of 1959 and 1960 not operating, before resuming in the second half of 1960 after its certificate was reissued to reflect a change of status from partnership to a Maryland corporation. Standard started \"Pink Cloud\" service from the west coast to Hawaii using the limited scheduled part of its supplemental authority, which allowed it to fly 10 flights per month in each direction on any given city pair. The lower half of the aircraft was painted pink, the flight attendants were clad in pink, the champagne was pink and so forth. During this era, the airline moved its operation to Burbank. The June 1962 fleet comprised a Douglas DC-6B, two Lockheed L-749A Constellations and an L-1049G Super Constellation, all owned other than one L-749.1962 Standard received a temporary certificate as a supplemental air carrier in 1962 as required by new legislation, but only over the strong dissent of two of the five CAB Board members, who noted, among other things, the carrier's marginal financial state and the fact that new legislation would require the carrier be a pure charter carrier by 1965 yet it depended heavily on scheduled service. The majority noted the carrier's long history and the fact that its financial state, though precarious, was slowly improving and that it was, in fact, pursuing charters.\nIn May 1963, Standard crashed its L-1049G at Manhattan Municipal Airport in Kansas (see Accidents) while flying for the military, which quickly suspended it from flying military charters. While all on board survived, the cause of the accident was alarming: systemic maintenance issues had resulted in poorly functioning components that permitted a propeller to spontaneously reverse pitch, reversing thrust. Standard stopped operating on 31 January 1964. It declared bankrupty in February. It emerged from bankruptcy in September an asset-less, employee-less husk.\nJet era\nStandard started flying again on 13 February 1966, on the strength of a promised recapitalization by a company called Southern Pipeliners of Hialeah, Florida which then failed to happen. The brief association gave Standard an identity as a Miami airline. Another group, organized by Frank B. Lynott, an executive of several airlines, the last being Alaska Airlines, stepped in by April, funding over $2 million in equity by June. The airline moved to Seattle. The Pike Corporation of America, run by Thomas P. Pike, specializing in deep sea oil drilling, held a 48% stake. Shields B. Craft got to keep 10%, the balance was mostly held by three investment banks including Bear Stearns. Early in the second half of 1966, the fleet comprised three DC-7s with two DC-9-10s scheduled for delivery later that year. With Standard now healthy, the CAB permanently certificated it as a supplemental air carrier in August 1967. In early 1967, Pike took its stake up to 54%. B",
    "Species of parasitoid wasp\nZelostemma thorpei is a species of parasitoid wasp belonging to the family Platygastridae. First described by Peter Neerup Buhl in 2017, it is endemic to New Zealand.\nTaxonomy\nThe species was identified by Danish entomologist Peter Neerup Buhl in 2017, during a review of the genus Zelostemma during which Buhl identified 30 new species from New Zealand entomology collections based on morphological differences. Z. thorpei was identified based on specimens collected from Huia, West Auckland in December 1980 by P. A. Maddison and B. M. May. Buhl named the species after New Zealand entomologist Stephen E. Thorpe.\nDescription\nFemales of Z. thorpei have a body length of 1.5\u00a0mm (0.059\u00a0in), and light brown legs and coxae. The species can be differentiated from Z. laevicornu due to having a differently shaped metasoma.\nDistribution\nThe species is endemic to New Zealand. As of 2024, specimens have only being identified in the vicinity of Huia and the Manukau Harbour in the Auckland Region.\n",

    "United States legislation protecting U.S. networks and supply chains\nThe Secure Equipment Act of 2021 (Pub.L.117-55, H.R.3919, 135 Stat. 423) is a U.S. federal statute enacted by the 117th United States Congress and signed into law by President Joe Biden on November 11, 2021. This law requires the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to issue rules stating that it will no longer review or approve any authorization application for equipment that poses an unacceptable risk to national security.\nProcedural history\nThe H.R.3919 bill was introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives on June 15, 2021, by Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) with 22 cosponsors.\nOn October 19, 2021, the House considered the bill under suspension of the rules, requiring a two-thirds majority.

The companies included Huawei, ZTE, Hytera Communications, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, and Zhejiang Dahua Technology.\nIn June 2021, the FCC issued new rules which would prohibit all future authorizations of telecommunications and video surveillance equipment from the five companies due to \u201can unacceptable risk\u201d to U.S. national security. FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr stated that since 2018, the FCC had approved over 3,000 applications from Huawei. He said the Secure Equipment Act would \"help to ensure that insecure gear from companies like Huawei and ZTE can no longer be inserted into America's communications networks.\"\nThe law, codified in 47 U.S. Code \u00a7 1601, mandates that the FCC establish rules that \u201cclarify\u201d that FCC will \u201cno longer review or approve\u201d authorizations for any equipment on the FCC's list of \"covered communications equipment or services\" deemed to pose a security risk. This list focuses on equipment identified as a threat to national security or the safety of U.S. citizens.\nImpact\nFurther information: United States sanctions against China\nThe Secure Equipment Act is viewed as blocking Chinese telecommunications firms like Huawei and ZTE from obtaining new equipment licenses from the U.S. government.\nTo implement the law, on November 25, 2022, the FCC finalized rules banning the approval of new telecommunications equipment from Huawei, ZTE, Dahua Technology, Hikvision, and Hytera Communications, citing unacceptable risks to U.S. national security.\nSee also\nList of acts of the 117th United States Congress",

    "German ironclad gunboat\nSMS Biene was an ironclad gunboat of the Wespe class built for the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) in the 1870s. The ships, which were armed with a single 30.5\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) MRK L/22 gun, were intended to serve as part of a coastal defense fleet.\nDesign\nMain article: Wespe-class gunboat\nPlan and profile of the Wespe class in their original configuration\nDevelopment of the Wespe class of ironclad gunboats began in the 1850s, after the first ironclads were introduced during the Crimean War. Through the 1860s, the Federal Convention examined various proposals, which included plans to build at least eight vessels, to as many as eighteen armored warships. The decision was finalized based on the fleet plan conceived by General Albrecht von Stosch, the new Chief of the Kaiserliche Admiralit\u00e4t (Imperial Admiralty), in the early 1870s. He envisioned a fleet oriented on defense of Germany's Baltic and North Sea coasts, which would be led by the ironclad corvettes of the Sachsen class. These were to be supported by larger numbers of small, armored gunboats, which became the Wespe class.\nBiene was 46.4 meters (152\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) long overall, with a beam of 10.6\u00a0m (34\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in) and a draft of 3.2 to 3.4\u00a0m (10 to 11\u00a0ft). She displaced 1,098 metric tons (1,081 long tons) as designed and 1,163\u00a0t (1,145 long tons) at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 3\u00a0officers and 73 to 85\u00a0enlisted men. She was powered by a pair of double-expansion steam engines that drove a pair of 4-bladed screw propellers, with steam provided by four coal-fired cylindrical fire-tube boilers, which gave her a top speed of 11 knots (20\u00a0km/h; 13\u00a0mph) at 800 metric horsepower (790\u00a0ihp). At a cruising speed of 7 knots (13\u00a0km/h; 8.1\u00a0mph), she could steam for 700 nautical miles (1,300\u00a0km; 810\u00a0mi).\nThe ship was armed with one 30.5\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) MRK L/22 gun in a barbette mount that had a limited arc of traverse. In practice, the gun was aimed by turning the ship in the direction of fire. The Wespes were intended to beach themselves on the sandbars along the German coastline to serve as semi-mobile coastal artillery batteries. The armored barbette was protected by 203\u00a0mm (8\u00a0in) of wrought iron, backed with 210\u00a0mm (8.3\u00a0in) of teak. The ship was fitted with a waterline armor belt that was 102 to 203\u00a0mm (4 to 8\u00a0in) thick, with the thickest section protecting the propulsion machinery spaces and ammunition magazine. The belt was backed with 210\u00a0mm of teak. An armor deck that consisted of two layers of 22\u00a0mm (0.87\u00a0in) of iron on 28\u00a0mm (1.1\u00a0in) of teak provided additional protection against enemy fire.\nService history\nProfile drawing of the Wespe class as they appeared c. 1900\nThe keel for Biene, named after the common bee, was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in 1876, and she was launched on 2 December 1876. Work on the ship was continued through mid-1877, and she was commissioned into active service on 20 August. The ship was pronounced ready for service on 17 October, but she was instead placed in reserve, where she would remain for the next four years. The ship was next commissioned on 20 August 1881, initially to conduct training cruises to prepare crews to man ships of the class. Some three weeks later, however, Biene received orders to move to Kiel to join a flotilla with three of her sister ships that were stationed there. The voyage through the Skagerrak, Kattegat, and Danish straits took three days to complete, and she arrived at her destination on 11 September. She was present for a fleet review held during a visit by Kaiser Wilhelm I on 16 September. The following day, Biene was laid up in the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel.\nBy 1883, the ship had been refitted with an additional 8.7\u00a0cm (3.4\u00a0in) L/24 built-up guns, a pair of 37\u00a0mm (1.5\u00a0in) Hotchkiss revolver cannon, and two 35\u00a0cm (14\u00a0in) torpedo tubes in her bow, both of which were below the waterline. Biene next recommissioned on 22 April 1884 to join the Armored Gunboat Division, which included her sisters Hummel, Camaeleon, and Crocodill, and was led by the aviso Grille, the flagship of Kapit\u00e4n zur See (Captain at Sea) Karl August Deinhard. The exercises began on 5 May in the waters off R\u00fcgen and concluded at the end of the month. Biene was damaged in an accident in the R\u00fcgischer Bodden on 8 June, and she had to return to the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel for repairs. She was decommissioned there on 12 June.\nAfter repairs were completed, Biene was assigned to the Marinestation der Ostsee (Baltic Sea Naval Station), but she saw no further active service. On 27 September 1910, Biene was struck from the naval register. She was then converted into a floating work shop and used in that capacity for the next decade. She was then sold in Bremen in 1921 and broken up later that year Wewelsfleth.\nNotes\n",

    "Medieval migrations of Arabs to the Levant\nMedieval migrations of Arabs to the Levant\nThe Arab migrations to the Levant involved successive waves of migration and settlement by Arab people in the Levant region of West Asia, encompassing modern-day Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine and Israel. The process took place over several centuries, lasting from the early 7th century to the modern period. The Arab migrants hailed from various parts of the Middle East, particularly the Arabian Peninsula.\nThe Arab presence in the Levant before the Muslim conquest primarily consisted of Bedouin tribes inhabiting borderlands and desert regions, while the cultivated inner areas were mainly populated by Christians, Jews, and Samaritans. Following the rise of the Rashidun Caliphate after Muhammad's death in 632 CE, Muslims quickly expanded their control over the Levant, \u2013 known in Arabic as Bil\u0101d al-Sh\u0101m \u2013 resulting in the immediate settlement of Muslims from Arabia in urban areas. The conquest led to a urban depopulation, with many local residents fleeing, creating vacancies that Muslim migrants occupied. The Umayyad era saw further settlement in the Levant, as the rulers aimed to maintain distinct tribal identities and manage demographics through population transfers. Estimates suggest that by the end of the first century of Islam, about a quarter of a million Arabs had settled in Palestine and Syria.\nThe migrations significantly contributed to the Islamization of the region. In the southern Levant, Muslim settlers, many of them Arabs, moved into the area, while Christian, Jewish, and Samaritan populations gradually emigrated, with varying rates of conversion among those who remained.\nHistory and migrations\nArabs presence in the region under the Byzantines\nSee also: History of the Arabs\nBefore the Muslim conquest, the Arab presence in the Levant mainly consisted of Bedouin tribes inhabiting the borderlands and southern desert regions, including the Negev desert, the Syrian Desert west of the Euphrates, and the area around Palmyra. In contrast, the cultivated inner regions and cities of Palestine were predominantly populated by Christians, Jews, and Samaritans. Local kingdoms fortified their borders against nomadic incursions, but despite these efforts, varying degrees of penetration occurred. Local fears and concerns about the Bedouin are reflected in both Talmudic and Patristic literature, with the latter documenting Arab raids and acts of violence against monks. By the 5th century, Arab tribes had settled near Jerusalem, as noted by Cyril of Scythopolis, who described Petros Aspabetos, a tribal chief from Mesopotamia, converting to Christianity and settling in camps east of Jerusalem, where he maintained good relations with the Christian authorities. Trade relations also existed, with Meccan caravans traveling north, and Arab sources note that the Prophet's ancestors, including his grandfather Hishim and father 'Abdallah, engaged in business in Gaza.\nArab sources depict Byzantine-allied tribes such as the Banu Judham and Banu Ghassan as concentrated in Provincia Arabia (later known as Palestina Tertia), encroaching over the Levant's borderlands and on the frontiers of the Roman and later Byzantine Empires. In one Arabic source, the region is referred to as \"al-Takhim\", a term borrowed from Hebrew and most certainly used by Jews. The Banu Judham, the main tribe inhabiting the deserts south of Palestine, are associated with Shuaib in Arab tradition. Their Christian influences were notable due to their Byzantine connections, and while some members of the Banu Wa'il branch were connected to Judaism, only a few actually converted. The Banu Lakhm, who mingled with the Banu Judham and were based in the northern Euphrates, also had a presence in Palestine. The Banu Ghassan, or Ghassanids, a large federation of tribes, were important Byzantine allies against other Arab tribes. Migrating in significant numbers to southern Syria and northern Transjordan, they established a vassal kingdom under Byzantine authority, with their center in Jabiya, a settlement located in the eastern Golan.\nRashidun era (632\u2013661 CE)\nMain article: Muslim conquest of the Levant\nThe Rashidun Caliphate, under Abu Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khattab, ascended to power following the death of Muhammad in 632 CE, rapidly expanding through military campaigns and conquering the Levant. Within three years, the regions of Syria and Palestine were under Muslim control. Muslims from Arabia began settling in the towns of Syria right after the conquest. This settlement was however limited, primarily involving members of the original conquering armies. Additional tribesmen who immigrated mainly settled in abandoned parts of towns, rather than in rural areas or new camp cities, as happened in Iraq. The numbers of Arabs who settled in the eastern provinces is unknown, but it is assumed they were a small minority among the native population, the total which was Bernard Lewis estim",

She composed the print matrices from cut and dyed pieces of waxed paper and fabric assembled as abstract compositions on a ground covered with a base colour. She accomplishes the artistic effect by combining and layering irregular shapes and muted colour tones with the occasional bold colour accent. The individual sheets are not named and the interpretation of the work is left to the viewer (Untitled, 1963\u201365). The monotypes were the basis for the first tapestries (Four Stories, 1967). In parallel, she created numerous studies of structures in the form of drypoint or etching.\nPark (multi-coloured linocut), 1963\nUntitled (monotype) 35 \u00d7 37\u00a0cm, 1963\nUntitled (monotype) 40 \u00d7 36\u00a0cm, 1964\nUntitled (monotype) 40 \u00d7 49\u00a0cm, 1964\nUntitled (monotype) 33 \u00d7 58\u00a0cm, 1964\nIn the second half of the 1960s, a series of black and white abstract structural prints were made from scraps of fabric, paper and scraps of cotton cordonnet. The arrangement of the individual components sometimes produces a linear drawing (Cords, 1966), but usually follows no predetermined order and works with an element of chance. The direction of the lines in soft curves and their local thickening gives the impression of movement (Growth, 1967, Flow, 1968), while at other times the artist uses the rough structure of the fabric as an irregular grid, representing living tissue (Meeting of Tissues, 1967, Two Tissues, 1972). In the titles of other abstract compositions she refers to natural phenomena (Dark Passage, 1966, Horizontal Layer, 1980) and living organisms (Vegetation, 1968, Vegetative Gesture, 1975), only rarely naming a concrete symbol (Cross, 1966, Big T, 1968, Angels, 1970). Individual small-format prints created in this way became the basis for tapestries (Tissue, structural print, 1967, tapestry, 1968).\nIn addition to printmaking, after 2000 the artist has also worked in watercolour and in the combination of watercolour and drawing. The subject of these works are natural structures and abstract landscapes.\nCords (structural print), 9,5 \u00d7 12\u00a0cm, 1966\nTissue (structural print), 19,5 \u00d7 24,5\u00a0cm, 1967\nGrowth (structural print), 18 x 14\u00a0cm, 1967\n\u201e Big T\u201c (structural print), 16 \u00d7 9\u00a0cm, 1968\nNeither creature nor tree (structural print), 15,5 x 10,5\u00a0cm, 1968\nDark chasm (structural print)), 27 x 17\u00a0cm, 1966\nAngels (structural print)), 19,5 x 23\u00a0cm, 1970\nBranches (structural print), 15,5 \u00d7 24\u00a0cm, 1972\nUntitled (coloured ",

    "\nDawood Mohammed Laghmani is an Afghan politician who served as the governor of Ghazni Province from May 2021 until August 2021, when he surrendered the province to the Taliban.\nBiography\nLaghmani is a Pashtun. On May 17, 2021, when Laghmani was set to be appointed as the governor of Faryab Province, he was unable to be sworn in due to heavy protests outside of the provincial capital of Maimana spurred by Junbish-e-Islami supporters. The protesters considered Laghmani to be just a government appointee as he is a close friend of then-Afghan president Ashraf Ghani, and wanted a governor that the people picked. Laghmani was also Pashtun and set to appoint a predominantly-Uzbek province where he did not speak the language. Laghmani returned to Kabul on May 25, with acting deputy governor of Faryab Abdul Muqim Rasikh being sworn in as the new governor. He was appointed governor of Ghazni Province on May 29, 2021, succeeding Haji Wahidullah Kalimzai. Oxford Analytica attributed Laghmani's failed appointment in Faryab as a factor in why President Ghani depleted Afghan forces in the province, leading to the Taliban taking over the area more easily in August.\nDuring the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, Laghmani fled the province after negotiating a deal with the Taliban to give up the city of Ghazni and the wider province. Officials in Ghazni later stated that during the offensive, Laghmani had hosted negotiations at the governors' office in the city between provincial officials and the Taliban, leading to the city falling bloodlessly.  He had even reportedly given the Taliban mediators flowers. He was arrested by Afghan National Army forces in the Kotal-e-Takht area of Maidan Wardak Province attempting to flee the country. He was intended to be charged with treason, although the Afghan government in Kabul fell before this could happen.\n",
    "Species of shrub in the family Proteaceae endemic to New Caledonia\nGrevillea rubiginosa is a species of flowering plant in the family Proteaceae and is endemic to south-eastern New Caledonia.\nDescription\nGrevillea rubiginosa is an open tree or shrub which can grow up to 10 metres (33\u00a0ft) tall in sheltered areas and 4 metres (13\u00a0ft) in open habitats.

    "American stage actor, 1904-1927\nGregory Kelly (March 16, 1892 \u2013 July 9, 1927) was an American stage actor, who began performing as a child. He was a Broadway attraction, starring in such long-running productions as Seventeen and The Butter and Egg Man. His early death precluded him from appearing in more than two films. He is remembered today as the first husband of Ruth Gordon, who credited him with teaching her acting.\nEarly years\nGregory Kelly was born on March 16, 1892, in New York City, to Thomas J. Kelly, a letter carrier, and his wife Agnes J. Kelly. His grandparents on both sides were immigrants to New York from Ireland. He was the youngest of three sons; his older brother Thomas J. Kelly Jr. would also become an actor. When he was two, he had rheumatic fever, which Ruth Gordon later speculated may have damaged his heart.\nCareer\nEarly stage work\nActress Grace Menken recalled that as a child Gregory Kelly went through Anna Taliaferro's theatrical agency with her and her sister Helen Menken. Kelly's first verifiable stage credit came in January 1904 with a production of The Light That Lies in Woman's Eyes. He and his older brother Tommy were jointly billed as \"Two Boys, sons of Red Head\". The play starred Virginia Harned, whose then husband E. H. Sothern had written it for her. When the production went on tour in February, the Kelly brothers went with it.\nKelly next appeared in a touring production of After Midnight, starting in September 1904, in which he received his first critical notice: \"Master Gregory Kelly... also comes in for a large share of the applause\". This tour lasted through the end of February 1905, resumed in September 1905 with new producers and a new leading man, and finished up in February 1906.\nDuring 1908 Kelly joined a touring vaudeville musical called School Days by Gus Edwards, who also produced. It played Broadway for a month starting in September 1908, resuming touring in late October. He stayed with this tour through April 1909.\nMrs. Fiske\nMrs. Fiske 1910\nThe Pillars of Society\nThe quality of plays he appeared in, and Kelly's professional skills, improved after he joined \"The Manhattan Company\" of Mrs. Fiske in 1910. He later attributed to her tutoring his success in stage acting, particularly in timing dialogue pause and response. Harrison Grey Fiske first cast Kelly as a thirteen-year-old boy in a revival of Ibsen's The Pillars of Society. The production would have a three-day tryout in Rochester, New York, followed by a two-week engagement on Broadway. The play was accorded only mild interest by the New-York Tribune reviewer, but they commended the acting of the entire company. Kelly \"...spoke with understanding and carried himself modestly, disdaining the 'smartness' which is the usual fault of stage boys.\" Following Pillars, Kelly then spent two weeks in a more adult role for a one-act curtain-raiser to Mrs. Fiske's main feature, Hannele.\nThe Fiskes took their production of Pillars on tour across the country, Kelly accompanying. While on the road, the Fiskes tried out a revival of Langdon Mitchell's Becky Sharp, a dramatization of Vanity Fair. Mrs. Fiske had been the original producer and director of this 1899 work. Kelly played a minor role in Becky Sharp, so the Fiskes made him assistant stage manager. Kelly was still with the Fiskes when Becky Sharp finished a two-week engagement on Broadway in early April 1911.\nKismet\nBy late November 1911, Kelly was reported to have joined the cast of Klaw and Erlanger's Kismet, to be directed by Harrison Grey Fiske. This spectacular production had its US premiere at the Knickerbocker Theatre on December 25, 1911. The cast was so large that it was divided into three sections in newspapers for just the principals.\nGregory Kelly and Charles Dalton\nAfter its New York run ended in May 1912, the original production company went on tour, Kelly with them. Lost among the crowd of featured players, there was little about Kelly's performance to stick in reviewer's minds. As one critic said of the actors, \"it was not at all easy to sort them out\", being in fantastic garb and affecting a \"Baghdad accent\". Additional to his acting, Kelly was again an assistant, along with T. Tamamoto, to stage manager Henry B. Stillmann. Besides managing regular matinee and evening performances for the public, the trio conducted full rehearsals using just the Kismet understudies, to keep them sharp. By September 1914, while touring Canada, Kelly had been promoted to the supporting role of the Beggar Kasim, and his brother Thomas had joined the cast as Caliph Abdaliah.\nKelly's involvement with 'Kismet' finally came to an end in October 1914, when he was included in an announced cast for The Young Idea. This was a vehicle for Lydia Lopokova, to be produced by Harrison Grey Fiske. It had been renamed Just Herself by the time it premiered on Broadway on December 23, 1914. Unfortunately, the play was shut down just six days later when producer Fiske entered volunta",
    "Greek-Australian wrestler\nPeter Fatouros (1891 - 1953) was a Greek-Australian wrestler who was active in the 1920s and 1930s and was a contender for the Australian Heavyweight Championship. He was also known for running a fish and chips shop in Melbourne.\nBiography\nFatouros was born in Greece in approximately 1891 and moved to Australia in 1912. He began wrestling after arriving in Australia, training under Clarence Weber and Oscar Wasem, and he had matches in Melbourne in 1914 and 1915 however the First World War lead to a significant decline in the professional wrestling industry in Australia.\nIn the early 1920s Australian professional wrestling experienced a revival and Fatouros began training with visiting American Walter Miller and Con Keatos in 1924. In April that year he achieved a small level of fame when he secured a match against Australian heavyweight champion Billy Meeske,  however the match was cancelled when Meeske injured his hand. He did not have a match until September when he wrestled in a loss to Charles Honroth, and afterwards he began training with Meeske.\nIn April 1925 Fatouros assisted American wrestler Ted Thye when Thye toured Australia, serving as a cornerman during his matches. In July he was promoted as a sparring partner of Al Karasick, and billed as the heavyweight champion of Victoria when he visited Queensland to wrestle Jim Sank in a victory. He next wrestled in Broken Hill, New South Wales, in January 1926 in a loss to Mahomet Ali Sunni, then defeated Hughie Whitman in February. While in Broken Hill he also worked with Billy Kopsch to perform wrestling exhibitions to promote the industry, and wrestled in another loss to Sunni at the end of February. He next wrestled in May in a draw with Sam Burmister in Melbourne.\nLouis Pergantas applying a toehold to Fatouros, 1927.\nAs of November 1926 Fatouros had become the owner of a Cafe on Punt Road in Melbourne and that month he and two of his employees were involved in a brawl with four customers, when Fatouros informed them they could not drink alcohol at the Cafe and they then refused to pay for their food. He was not involved in wrestling publicly again until June 1927 when he gave a wrestling exhibition with Louis Pergantas, to promote the fellow Greek wrestler who he was training. In September he became manager of the Whiteway Fish Cafe on Sydney Road in Melbourne, and he wrestled Burmister again this time in South Australia in a draw at the end of October. In December he lost to heavyweight champion Billy Meeske in a match in Yarrawonga, Victoria.\nIn January 1928 Fatouros wrestled in a loss to former heavyweight champion Clarence Weber in Tasmania, and in April and May he wrestled losses to American Jack Sorensen in Newcastle. In June he wrestled in Newcastle again in a match billed as being for qualification for a title match against Meeske, losing to Socks McKenna. He wrestled in Newcastle again in July losing to Scotty McDougall however the match was described as a disappointment due to Fatouros dominating until losing in the final round, and in October he wrestled in Sydney losing to Count Zarynoff.\nIn February 1929 Fatouros publicly complained publicly about not being booked to wrestle, and at the end of the month he organized a fundraiser for Jack Brown, a boxer who had become blind. In July he wrestled in a draw against Bert Asker in Melbourne in what was his last match for a few years. He returned to the ring for his last match in 1931 when he was booked to face heavyweight champion Billy Meeske in Brunswick, however as he was known in the suburb for owning a local fish and chips shop the audience laughed when he was announced with the match, won by Meeske, being viewed as a comedy bout, and afterwards the promoter refused to pay Fatouros.\nAfter his match with Meeske Fatouros focused on his cafe but retained some fame with a visit he made to Broken Hill in 1945 receiving coverage in a local newspaper due to his former wrestling career. He died in Melbourne in 1953.\n",

    "Bengali Hindu sun ritual\nMaghamandal Vrata (Bengali: \u09ae\u09be\u0998\u09ae\u09a3\u09cd\u09a1\u09b2 \u09ac\u09cd\u09b0\u09a4) is an annual monthwide Hindu ritual or vrata (religious vow), mainly observed in the Bengali Hindu community in West Bengal and Bangladesh. It is a significant vrata of Bengal where the Sun is worshipped. The unmarried girls (age of 6 to 10) of the Bengali Hindu houses of rural Bengal observe this fast for a month from the first day of the month of Magh to the entire Magh (Mid-January to mid-February). The purpose of the vow is to get a good husband and family.\nFeatures of the vrata\nThis vrata is performed at the waterbodies near the homestead of rural Bengal. During the winter month of Magh, the little girls\u00a0would rise at dawn to take the clay stupa depicting the sun to the edge of the tank, where she would chant mantras and worship with flowers. Being a feminine vow, no vedic mantra or priest is required to observe the vrata.\nIn the first phase of observing Maghamandal Vrata, the girls need to collect the necessary materials i.e. Pituligola, Durbagrass and flowers with Atap chal (parboiled rice).\nIn the second stage, on the morning of the vrata, before sunrise, after taking a bath before sunrise, clean the pond on the ground and draw the moon, sun, earth, stars and elm trees.\nIn the third stage, at the moment of worship, the mantra of worship for the Sun God in front of the painted alpana is to be recited one by one.\nIn the alpana drawing of the Maghamandal Vrata various coloured powders are used. This design usually consists of five concentric circles with representations of the sun and the moon at the top and the bottom. On the other hand, The songs and actions in performance of the rituals regarding this cult take the shape of a drama showing the power of the bright sunshine over the miserable conditions of wintertime.\n\n",

    "Alphons Hermann Paquet (26 January 1881 \u2013 8 February 1944) was German writer, poet and journalist.\nBiography\nAlphons Paquet was born in to the family of a deeply religious Baptist glovemaker and was forced to train in his father's profession. In 1900 he won a prize for a short story and decided to move to Berlin and become a journalist. In 1901 he published his first volume of short stories and the following year a book of poems and songs. Soon after, he became editor of the D\u00fcsseldorf-based cultural magazine Die Rheinlande and from 1902 onwards he was able to finance his studies with various jobs, which he completed in 1907 at the University of Jena with a dissertation in economic history.\nIn 1903, Paquet began traveling, which would determine his entire subsequent life. He traveled through Siberia on the newly opened Trans-Siberian Railway. The following year, he traveled to the US for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. This year also saw the start of his work for the Frankfurter Zeitung.\nOn October 18, 1910, he married the Frankfurt painter Marie Henriette Steinhausen and moved with her to Dresden- Hellerau, where Paquet now worked for the German Werkbund.\nIn the years leading up to the First World War, Paquet made several trips to Mongolia and China, a trip on the Baghdad Railway to Syria and various other destinations.\nIn 1915, Paquet became a correspondent for the Frankfurter Zeitung in neutral Stockholm . From here, he observed events in Russia and in 1918 undertook a reconnaissance of civil war-torn Finland. In the summer of the same year, he went to Moscow to witness and report on the Bolshevik Revolution.\nPaquet became a supporter of the Weimar Republic and was deeply interested in the idea of a \"Rhineland\" renewal of Europe with Germany as a mediator between East and West. He envisioned a pacifist Germany in a European Union.\nIn the 1920s, Paquet wrote more for the theater. His plays Fahnen and Sturmflut were performed by Erwin Piscator at the Berlin Volksb\u00fchne. In 1925, he founded the \"Bund Rheinischer Dichter\" with Jakob Kneip and remained its chairman until 1933.\nIn 1932, Paquet was admitted to the Prussian Academy of Arts. In Frankfurt, he presented the Goethe Prize as a representative of the city; he was the secretary of the foundation's board of trustees for several years. After the Nazis seized power, he resigned from the academy because he did not sign the required declaration of conformity to the hew regime. He managed to secure his income as a journalist, and in 1934 he made extensive flights through Europe, about which he published a travel book. In 1935 he was briefly arrested in Berlin for because he was considered to be a communist by the Nazis.\nAs a convinced pacifist, he became a permanent member of the Quakers in 1933. Through this religious community, he maintained intensive contact with England and the US and received visits from foreign believers who wanted to get an idea of the situation in Germany.\nIn 1943, his youngest son was killed on the Eastern Front. Paquet, who had to witness the deportation of the Jews from Frankfurt - of whose murderous consequences he was aware - as a helpless observer, sank into deep dejection. During a bombing raid in February 1944, Alfons Paquet died of a heart attack in the basement of his house.\nWorks\nLieder und Ges\u00e4nge. Mit einer Vorbemerkung von Carl Busse.

    "2024 studio album by Gwen Stefani\nBouquet is the upcoming fifth studio album by American singer and songwriter Gwen Stefani. It is expected to be released on November 15, 2024 through Interscope Records. The album serves as her first release since 2017's You Make It Feel Like Christmas and was preceded by two singles: \"Purple Irises\", a duet with husband Blake Shelton, and \"Somebody Else's\".\nBackground and development\nStefani first started work on the project in February 2020, writing a song called \"Cry Happy\", which was composed of various lyrics she had compiled onto her phone, and cited this event as her inspiration to continue writing new music for a fifth album. During initial reports of a new album from Stefani, critics predicted it would serve as her return to pop music, following her lineup of country and holiday music releases in previous years. In a press release, Stefani commented that the album would return to her roots in reggae and ska music. Stefani said she was inspired by world news events, such as the Me Too movement and COVID-19 pandemic, to create uplifting and positive music; she explained: \" music was all about unity and anti-racism, and that was in the '70s. Then we (No Doubt) were doing it in the '90s. And now here we are, again, in the same old mess.\" She released the single \"Let Me Reintroduce Myself\", musically inspired by her days with No Doubt, in December 2020, and the hip hop-accented \"Slow Clap\" in March 2021, both of which were expected to appear on Stefani's fifth album.\nStefani began hinting at the album's namesake on September 6, 2024, posting a series of photographs featuring flowers, all prominently. The album was officially announced on September 18, along with its cover art and title, Bouquet, her first release since 2017's You Make It Feel Like Christmas. Stefani said the record has a \"flower motif\", evident in song titles like \"Marigolds\", \"Empty Vase\", and \"Late to Bloom\", and was inspired by \"all the stuff  listened to in the station wagon on the way to church\" as a child. Despite the album's cover art depicting Stefani wearing a cowboy hat, she insisted Bouquet was not a country album and rather a yacht rock project influenced by 1970s pop radio hits. She created the record following a period of \"healing  transitioning\" that stemmed from the divorce to her ex-husband Gavin Rossdale, part of the subject matter to her 2016 album This Is What the Truth Feels Like.\nCover artwork\nGiven the album's cover art depicting Stefani in a cowboy hat, critics predicted Bouquet would serve as her first country album. The artwork used is a photograph of Stefani in a brown tartan suit, holding a singular white flower, sprawled atop a bed. In reaction, Nylon's Dylan Kickham anticipated that \"Stefani  be riding the cowboy trend like a bronco with at least some of her new music.\"\nMusic and lyrics\nStefani described Bouquet as being full of \"seventies pop-rock radio gems\" with Nashville influence. The album opens with \"Somebody Else's\", a heartland rock song combining elements of Stefani's pop and Shelton's country sounds. Its lyrics describe letting go of a former relationship (\"I don't know what a woman like me was doing with a man like you\"). The album closes with \"Purple Irises\", a duet with Shelton, serving as the only collaboration.\nPromotion\nStefani and Blake Shelton performing \"Purple Irises\" live in July 2024.\nSingles\n\"Purple Irises\", a duet with husband Blake Shelton, was released as the lead single on February 9, 2024. The song's release came ahead of its live debut at the Super Bowl LVIII TikTok Tailgate Show and just several days after Shelton's digital EP Love Language, which featured the other Stefani collaborations \"Nobody but You\" (2019) and \"Happy Anywhere\" (2020), was released. It was accompanied by an airplay release to contemporary hit radio stations in the United States, reaching numbers 15 and 16 on the Adult Contemporary and Adult Pop Airplay charts, respectively. It also reached the top 40 on Billboard's Digital Songs Sales charts in the US and Canada. An accompanying lyric video to \"Purple Irises\" was released to Stefani's YouTube channel on February 14, 2024.\nFollowing the album's official announcement, \"Somebody Else's\" was announced as the upcoming single. It was released digitally on September 20, 2024, alongside an audio visual on Stefani's YouTube channel. The song reached number 39 on the US Adult Airplay chart, and is planned to have its first televised live performance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on October 1.\nTrack listing\nRelease history\n",

He had a long career as a diplomat in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, serving as administrative vice minister from 2018 to 2021.\nBiography\nTakeo Akiba was born on 19 December 1958, in Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture, but he grew up in Yokohama. Through junior and senior high school, Akiba attended Eiko Gakuen, where he was part of the soccer team. He later studied law at the University of Tokyo and joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after graduating in 1982.\nAkiba was sent to receive English language training at the Fletcher School at Tufts University in the United States. As a diplomat Akiba held foreign postings in the embassy to the United States besides internal service as the Ministry mainly with the Treaty Bureau and the Minister's Secretariat. His appointment as chief of the China division in the Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau in 2007 was seen as snub to the \"China School\" of the ministry. Akiba was considered to represent a hard line towards China.

Akiba was deeply trusted by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, and played a central role in formulating and promoting the concept of the Free and Open Indo-Pacific.\nAkiba retired from the ministry in June 2021, but on the following month he was appointed national security advisor to the Cabinet and secretary general of the National Security Secretariat by Yoshihide Suga, who had succeeded Abe as prime minister. Akiba remained when Fumio Kishida succeeded Suga.\n",
    "German ironclad gunboat\nSMS Hummel was an ironclad gunboat of the Wespe class built for the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) in the 1870s. The ships, which were armed with a single 30.5\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) MRK L/22 gun, were intended to serve as part of a coastal defense fleet.\nDesign\nMain article: Wespe-class gunboat\nPlan and profile of the Wespe class in their original configuration\nDevelopment of the Wespe class of ironclad gunboats began in the 1850s, after the first ironclads were introduced during the Crimean War. Through the 1860s, the Federal Convention examined various proposals, which included plans to build at least eight vessels, to as many as eighteen armored warships. The decision was finalized based on the fleet plan conceived by General Albrecht von Stosch, the new Chief of the Kaiserliche Admiralit\u00e4t (Imperial Admiralty), in the early 1870s. He envisioned a fleet oriented on defense of Germany's Baltic and North Sea coasts, which would be led by the ironclad corvettes of the Sachsen class. These were to be supported by larger numbers of small, armored gunboats, which became the Wespe class.\nHummel was 46.4 meters (152\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) long overall, with a beam of 10.6\u00a0m (34\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in) and a draft of 3.2 to 3.4\u00a0m (10 to 11\u00a0ft). She displaced 1,098 metric tons (1,081 long tons) as designed and 1,163\u00a0t (1,145 long tons) at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 3\u00a0officers and 73 to 85\u00a0enlisted men. She was powered by a pair of double-expansion steam engines that drove a pair of 4-bladed screw propellers, with steam provided by four coal-fired cylindrical fire-tube boilers, which gave her a top speed of 11.1 knots (20.6\u00a0km/h; 12.8\u00a0mph) at 800 metric horsepower (790\u00a0ihp). At a cruising speed of 7 knots (13\u00a0km/h; 8.1\u00a0mph), she could steam for 700 nautical miles (1,300\u00a0km; 810\u00a0mi).\nThe ship was armed with one 30.5\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) MRK L/22 gun in a barbette mount that had a limited arc of traverse. In practice, the gun was aimed by turning the ship in the direction of fire. The Wespes were intended to beach themselves on the sandbars along the German coastline to serve as semi-mobile coastal artillery batteries. The armored barbette was protected by 203\u00a0mm (8\u00a0in) of wrought iron, backed with 210\u00a0mm (8.3\u00a0in) of teak. The ship was fitted with a waterline armor belt that was 102 to 203\u00a0mm (4 to 8\u00a0in) thick, with the thickest section protecting the propulsion machinery spaces and ammunition magazine. The belt was backed with 210\u00a0mm of teak. An armor deck that consisted of two layers of 22\u00a0mm (0.87\u00a0in) of iron on 28\u00a0mm (1.1\u00a0in) of teak provided additional protection against enemy fire.\nService history\nProfile drawing of the Wespe class as they appeared c. 1900\nHummel was built at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen. Her keel was laid down in July 1879, and she was launched on 12 February 1881. The ship was named after the German word for bumblebee. Work on the ship was completed later that year, and she was commissioned into active service on 22 May 1882, the last member of the class to join the fleet. At that time, she was commanded by Kapit\u00e4nleutnant (KL\u2014Captain Lieutenant) Erich von Dresky. She was moved from Wilhelmshaven to Kiel, where she was decommissioned on 10 June.\nBy 1883, the ship had been refitted with an additional 8.7\u00a0cm (3.4\u00a0in) L/24 built-up guns, a pair of 37\u00a0mm (1.5\u00a0in) Hotchkiss revolver cannon, and two 35\u00a0cm (14\u00a0in) torpedo tubes in her bow, both of which were below the waterline. On 22 April 1884, Hummel recommissioned under the command of KL Max Piraly. She joined the Armored Gunboat Flotilla, which included three of her sister ships and was led by the aviso Grille, the flagship of Kapit\u00e4n zur See (Captain at Sea) Karl August Deinhard. The ships conducted training exercises in the western Baltic, near the island of R\u00fcgen. The ships thereafter participated in the annual fleet exercises with the main units of the German navy in the North Sea. On 30 September, Hummel was decommissioned and placed back in reserve at Kiel.\nHummel saw no further active service, though she remained in the fleet's inventory for another twenty-five years. The ship was struck from the naval register on 27 September 1910 and then converted into a floating workshop. In 1923, she was reduced to a storage hulk based in Swinem\u00fcnde. During World War II, she was converted into a stationary anti-aircraft battery, still stationed in Swinem\u00fcnde. She was eventually sunk there on 4 May 1945 by an Allied bombing raid.\nNotes\n",
    "Alleged attempted assassin of Donald Trump\nRyan Wesley Routh (born 1966) is an American man who allegedly attempted to assassinate former U.S. president Donald Trump, the Republican Party nominee for the 2024 presidential election, on September 15, 2024. Routh's motives are currently under investigation.\nOn September 15, 2024, a Secret Service agent shot at least four rounds at Routh, who was hiding with an SKS-style rifle in shrubbery at the Trump International Golf Club, West Palm Beach. He was allegedly pointing his weapon through the fence line of the golf course, 300\u2013500 yards away from the former president, who was moving between holes five and six alongside Republican megadonor and real estate investor Steve Witkoff. Routh fled the scene, but was later arrested as the prime suspect. An update given by the FBI on September 16 mentioned that Routh had not fired his weapon.\nRouth has pleaded not guilty to five federal charges, including attempting to assassinate a presidential candidate. A preliminary trial date has been set for November 18, 2024.\nLife, career, and legal issues\nRouth was born in 1966 in Guilford County, North Carolina. For most of his life, he was a resident of Greensboro, where he attended North Carolina A&T State University for two semesters in 1995. He later ran a roofing business.  By 1988, Routh was married and had at least two sons and a daughter. Routh divorced his wife in 2003.\nIn 1991, Routh fought and chased a suspected rapist. For confronting the suspect, he was honored as a \"super citizen\" and awarded a \"Law Enforcement Oscar\" by the Greensboro chapter of the International Union of Police Associations.\nOn December 15\u201316, 2002, Routh was convicted of possessing a firearm; resisting, delaying and obstructing a law enforcement officer and driving with license revoked after a three-hour stand off with police. He was pulled over while driving, and during the traffic stop he put his hand on a gun and then drove to a nearby business, where he barricaded himself inside. In 2003, he was sentenced for driving without a license, carrying a concealed weapon and hit-and-run. In 2010, he was convicted of possessing stolen goods. For each of these charges he was given probation.\nIn 2018, he moved to Ka\u02bba\u02bbawa, Hawaii. There he started a shed-building business with his son, Adam. He and his son, Oran, had a falling out and had not talked prior to the assassination attempt, although following the attempt he said that Routh was \"a loving and caring father, and honest, hardworking man\" and that \"it doesn\u2019t sound like the man I know to do anything crazy, much less violent.\"\nClaimed activities related to the Russo-Ukrainian War\nRouth claimed on his social media accounts, as well as in 2022 interviews with The New York Times, Newsweek Romania, and Der Tagesspiegel to have made efforts to recruit foreign soldiers for Ukraine in its war against Russia. Newsweek reported Routh had claimed to have fought in Ukraine, while he told The New York Times he did not fight in Ukraine.  Routh said in a 2022 interview with a Romanian reporter in Kyiv that he flew to Ukraine to join the army in the months after Russia's full-scale invasion, but learned that he was \"not an ideal candidate\" for the battlefield because he was in his mid-50s with no military experience. Later in 2022, Routh said in an interview that after he was rejected for military service, he began recruiting volunteer soldiers for the Ukrainian military. Routh complained of roadblocks to Ukraine admitting foreign fighters, telling the publication Semafor that \"Ukraine is very often hard to work with, they're afraid that anybody and everybody is a Russian spy\". Routh was filmed at an April 2022 protest in Independence Square in Kyiv.\nA former volunteer for Ukraine's International Legion, Evelyn Aschenbrenner, branded Routh as \"delusional\" and a \"liar\" over his claims that he recruited for the Ukrainian organization, saying Routh was \"not, and never has been, associated with the International Legion or the Ukrainian Armed Forces at all\". Aschenbrenner said of Routh \"He was combative. He was argumentative. He refused repeatedly to understand basic army policy\", further adding \"There was delusions of grandeur and  very disconnected from reality\". The International Legion for the Defense of Ukraine said in a statement that Routh had \"never been part of, associated with, or linked\" to it \"in any capacity.\"\nAttempted assassination of Donald Trump in Florida\nMain article: Attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Florida\nPolice body camera footage of Routh's arrest following the attempted assassination on September 15, 2024\nAt 1:59 am on September 15, 2024, Routh allegedly took a position at Trump's golf course. He was later spotted at 1:31 pm. Afterwards, Routh was arrested as the potential suspect and later charged with two offenses: possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with the serial number removed.

    "British diarist (1871-1958)\nOlive Garnett ( 21 August 1871 \u2013 17 March 1958) was an English diarist and author of two collections of short stories inspired by her time in Russia. Her diaries, rediscovered in the 1970s, included new details about Ford Madox Ford\u2019s early life, work, marriage and nervous breakdown.\nEarly life and education\nOlivia Rayne Garnett was born on 21 August 1871 in London, the fifth of six children of Richard Garnett (1835-1906), Keeper of Printed Books at the British Museum, and Olivia Narney n\u00e9e Singleton (1842\u20131906). She grew up on St Edmund\u2019s Terrace, Primrose Hill, an area popular with artists and literary figures including the painter, Ford Madox Brown. Olive became friends with Brown's grandchildren, including Ford Madox Ford with whom she developed an intense friendship. Garnett attended Queen\u2019s College on Harley Street until 1889. In 1890 the Garnetts moved into accommodation at the British Museum. She was briefly engaged to architect and designer Alfred Hoare Powell in 1897.\nSergius Stepniak\nIn 1891 Garnett took Russian lessons from the journalist, revolutionary and political exile Feliks Volkhovsky. In December she attended a meeting of the Society of Friends of Russian Freedom, where she saw the Ukrainian revolutionary and writer Sergey Stepnyak-Kravchinsky, known as Sergius Stepniak. They met formerly the following year and Garnett quickly became attracted to him, writing, \"I like Stepniak more and more, and in proportion as I like him I find him positively handsome.\" By the following year, he was giving her advice on her own writing.\nGarnett also knew the Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin and his wife Sofia Ananyeva-Rabinovich, and although she \"hated revolutionary activities\" she helped to create a list \"of respectable and reliably permanent London addresses to which letters can be sent to Russian refugees from abroad\". She also compiled a bibliography of English and French books on Russia, and in the mid-1890s translated a Russian friend's memoirs into English.\nWhen Stepniak was killed at a railway crossing in 1895, Garnett \"in bitter grief cut off all her hair.\" In 1896 she spent a year as a governess in Russia in the \"highly cultivated Arseniev household\" where she mixed with the \"best Petersburg families\", attended literary salons, and taught English.\nAfter Stepniak's death\nIn 1897 Garnett was briefly engaged to architect Alfred Hoare Powell (1865\u20131960). When Garnett's father retired from the British Museum in 1899, she and her parents moved to Tanza Road, Hampstead. Following her father's death in 1906 she moved in with her youngest brother in Kew. In 1910 she held a meeting at her Richmond home for women's suffrage. In 1913 she donated to the Women's Suffrage Great Pilgrimage. In later years, according to her nephew and niece, she became a \"rigid, reticent old maid\". Garnett died on 17 March 1958 in Minehead.\nFriendship with Ford Madox Ford\nGarnett developed an early and intense friendship with the author Ford Madox Ford. In 1899 Garnett had a reading ticket at the British Museum Library in order to carry out research for Ford.\nIn 1904 Garnett saw Ford \"on the brink of madness, shipped off to Germany\". Her friendship with Ford began to cool in 1906, about which she wrote \"We had a Free trade discourse; & a moment of hate? Distrust? Something peeped out.\" In 1910 Garnett attended Ford's court case, which resulted in him spending ten days in prison for unpaid child maintenance. In 1911 Garnett's friendship with Ford ended, possibly because she thought his novel The Simple Life Limited, was \"scandalous, because she saw the hysterical Cyril Randetski as Ford\u2019s portrait of her adored Stepniak, and the 'tactless, strident, puritanical, outraged' Miss Stobhall as herself.\" However, Garnett remained a lifelong friend of Ford's first wife, Elsie M. Hueffer.\nDiary\nIn June 1890, when the Garnett family moved into the British Museum, she began to keep a diary. Her diaries were discovered in the late 1970s. They were kept by her niece, Mrs. Frank (Anne) Lee Michell, the daughter of Robert Garnett. Michell initially transcribed a selection of entries from 1890 to 1906 under the title A Bloomsbury Girlhood (the entries after 1906 being \"obscure and brief\").\nBarry C. Johnson subsequently published three collections of her diary:\nTea and Anarchy! The Bloomsbury Diary of Olive Garnett 1890\u20131893 (1989)\nThe Diary and Letters of Olive Garnett (1989)\nOlive & Stepniak: The Bloomsbury diary of Olive Garnett 1893\u20131895 (1993)\nOther writing\nDuring the 1890s Garnett contributed to the anarchist newspaper The Torch, run by William Michael Rossetti's older children, including Olivia Frances Madox. She also wrote \"drafts of several novels\".\nShe published:\nPetersburg Tales (1900) featuring four short stories: \"The Case of Vetrova\", \"Roukoff\", \"The Secret of the Universe\" and \"Out of It\". Of the book, Madox wrote, \"I am compounded of envies & thing & am pretty tired of having to say to people: 'You",

    "\nThe Bujumbura Textile Complex (French: Complexe Textile de Bujumbura, COTEBU), was a state-owned textile company in Bujumbura, Burundi. \nIt was succeeded by the private AFRITEXTILE.\nOrigins\nThe first attempt to create a textile factory in Burundi was with BURUTEX, which was meant to produce textiles from locally grown cotton, but failed.\nOn 6 January 1972 the government of Burundi signed an agreement with the People's Republic of China, for an interest-free credit to buy equipment and goods. \nIn 1974, an agreement was signed for construction of a textile factory in Bujumbura.\nWork began in 1976 and was completed in 1980.\nThe buildings were on a 21.68 hectares (53.6 acres) plot.\nA playground and a plot were located opposite the head office with an area of 2.41 hectares (6.0 acres).\nThe Bujumbura Textile Complex (Complexe Textile de Bujumbura: COTEBU) was created by decree n\u00b0100/107 of 16 November 1978 as a Public Establishment of an Industrial and Commercial nature.\nIt was supervised by the minister responsible for industry. \nDecree n\u00b0100/159 of 5 September 1997 noted that the textile complex had its headquarters in Avenue de l'Agriculture in the Industrial District of Bujumbura.\n\nOperations\nCOTEBU was one of the most important enterprise in Burundi before collapsing due to poor management and the effect of the Burundian Civil War.\nWhen it started operations in was the only textile company in Burundi and in the sub-region including Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nThe company would import the required machinery, materials and equipment, and would manufacture and market all related and derivative products.\nIt could export products to earn foreign exchange.\nThe Cotton Management Company (Compagnie de G\u00e9rance du Coton, COGERCO) planted, grew and harvested cotton and delivered high-quality fibers.\nCOTEBU used them to produce excellent quality cotton textiles, and won first place in an industry competition in Madrid, Spain, in 1982.\nFactories to manufacture clothing and sewing products began to be created, and managed to make shirts in 15 minutes, compared to 5 minutes in Europe.\nBut an attempt to export clothes failed due to the Burundian Civil War.\nWhen launched, weaving capacity was 9,000,000 metres (30,000,000\u00a0ft) per year, and finishing capacity was 15,000,000 metres (49,000,000\u00a0ft) per year.\nProduction of finished textiles steadily increased from 773,207 metres (2,536,768\u00a0ft) in 1980 to 12,588,559 metres (41,301,047\u00a0ft) in 1990, while sales rose from 2,337,600 metres (7,669,300\u00a0ft) in 1981 to 10,579,591 metres (34,709,944\u00a0ft) in 1989, then fell to 9,986,600 metres (32,764,400\u00a0ft) in 1990.\nThe company made a mistaken decision in 1993 to expand production by installing more machines, but rather than buy new and more efficient machines, it bought more of the original type. The company was loaded with debt as a result.\nWith the political crisis of 1993 the cotton crop was gradually abandoned by farmers, and replaced by more profitable food crops.\nQuantities of textile produced by COTEBU dropped to 4,901,301 metres (16,080,384\u00a0ft) in 1993. 4,838,907 metres (15,875,679\u00a0ft) were produced in 2000, rising to 7,264,798 metres (23,834,639\u00a0ft) in 2005.\nCOTEBU closed down in 2006 and 2007, and dismissed almost 1,600 workers.\nSuccession\nIn 2010 the government sold COTEBU's assets to a company headquartered in Mauritius.\nThe successor, Afritextile, was launched that year.\nAfritextile's manufactures and markets \"kitenge\" pagnes and cotton polyester products.\nIt uses cotton produced in Burundi and purchased in the sub-region and polyester synthetic fiber. \nIt has spinning, weaving and dyeing / printing workshops, and has 1200 employees.\nIn August 2021 D\u00e9o Guide Rurema, Minister of Environment, Agriculture and Livestock, stated that the cotton fiber supplier COGERCO was making heavy losses. It was being audited, and then there would be talks with Afritextile to see how the two companies could work together in future.\nSee also\nList of companies of Burundi\nEconomy of Burundi",

    "Public park in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, U.S.\nThe former Lewisburg freight station\nHufnagle Park is an urban park in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, United States. It runs for around 0.18 miles (0.29\u00a0km), from Market Street in the northwest to Saint Catharine Street in the southeast, and is bounded by South 6th Street to the west and South 5th Street to the north. Saint Louis Street bisects it just southeast of its midpoint. Bull Run runs along its western edge.\nThe park contains a picnic pavilion, playground equipment, and gardens. It is named in honor of former Public Safety director Gordon Hufnagle, who died saving lives during the Agnes Flood on June 21, 1972. A covered footbridge just north of the park was built in his honor in 1982.\nHufnagle Park is a terminus of the Buffalo Valley Rail Trail. The 9.5-mile (15.3\u00a0km) trail runs westward from Lewisburg to Mifflinburg following the rail bed of the Lewisburg & Tyrone Railroad, which was decommissioned in 1982. In 2009, the Buffalo Valley Recreation Authority acquired the right of way to the entire West Shore railroad which runs from Mifflinburg to Northumberland. The rail trail opened in 2011 and was extended in 2015.\nThe former Reading Railroad Freight Station stands beyond the park's northeastern corner, on North 5th Street. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nHistory\nAfter the nearby West Branch Susquehanna River flooded in 1972, the houses that formerly stood where Hufnagle Park is today were demolished.\nThe park reopened in March 2024, having been closed for ten months for a $3.5 million renovation.\n",

    "American television talk show\nThe Rob Nelson Show is an American first-run syndicated talk show that was hosted by Rob Nelson. The show ran for one season from September 16, 2002, to January 3, 2003.\nFormat\nThe Rob Nelson Show is an hour-long daytime talk show that was hosted by television presenter Rob Nelson. In its first six weeks, the show typically featured several guests on stage who discussed their thoughts on a given topic, such as female body image or the dangers of gang life. The show then reformatted into a tabloid talk show, in which it shifted its focus to single-issue discussions with an emphasis on audience interaction. Nelson moderated discussions and periodically handed off his microphone to audience members to make additional comments. Under this new format, the show featured topics such as a man who intended to raise money to cut off his feet with a guillotine, a mother who became a legal prostitute, and a human guinea pig.\nProduction\nConception and devleopment\nIn 1992, Nelson co-founded the advocacy group Lead or Leave, which advocated for reducing the national deficit. His political involvement throughout the 1990s received coverage by the news media, which culminated in him hosting The Full Nelson, a political talk show on Fox News.  Following the show's conclusion, Twentieth Television offered Nelson his own talk show under the belief that he was \"the next Phil Donahue\". According to executive producer Linda Ellman, \" bring the same blend of credibility and compassion to his show that made Donahue a talk-show franchise.\" Nelson hoped to host an unconventional talk show that improved the negative reputation of daytime television in the United States.\nThe show was produced by Monet Lane Productions in association with Twentieth Television. Linda Ellman served as the show's executive producer; however, she was replaced by David Armour in October 2002. The show ceased production on December 18, 2002.\nTopic selection\nNelson attempted to distance his show from tabloid talk shows like Jerry Springer, stating, \"It's about our real world. It's about relationships, our jobs, our struggles with sexuality, trying to understand one another and everything that happens to us in our day-to-day lives.\"\nBroadcast history and release\nOn November 25, 2002, Nelson appeared nude in an episode about \"nudity's role in culture and morality\". On December 5, 2002, it was announced that the show was hiatus. On December 18, 2002, Twentieth Television announced that the show was canceled, in which it cited the show's low ratings.\nReception\nTelevision viewership and ratings\nThe show's premiere, which was broadcast in 50 metered markets, averaged a 1.2/4. Its viewership slightly dropped in the show's second week, in which it averaged a 0.9 rating. The show averaged a 1.0 rating throughout its run.\nCritical response\nJosh Friedman of the Los Angeles Times claimed that the show, despite having a positive message, was dull.\n",
    "WD 0816\u2013310 is a white dwarf in the constellation Puppis.\nWD 0816\u2013310 (PM J08186\u20133110) is a magnetic white dwarf with metal pollution, originating from the tidal disruption of a planetary body. The metals are guided by the magnetic field onto the surface of the white dwarf, creating a \"scar\" on the surface of the white dwarf. This scar is rich in the accreted planetary material.\nThe object was first identified as a possible white dwarf in 2005, from data of the Digitized Sky Survey. It was confirmed as a white dwarf in 2008 with spectroscopic data from CTIO and the same team found that the white dwarf is polluted with calcium, magnesium and iron. In 2019 a variable magnetic field was discovered thanks to Zeeman splitting. This observation was made with archived spectropolarimetric data from FORS1 at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). In 2021 the white dwarf was studied in detail with the 4 m telescope at CTIO, and with the VLT (FORS1 and X-shooter). The elements sodium, magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, iron and nickel were detected in the atmosphere of the white dwarf. The atmosphere is enriched in magnesium, relative to other elements, which is predicted for old stellar systems. The researchers also found hydrogen in this otherwise helium-dominated atmosphere of WD 0816\u2013310. The presence of hydrogen could be explained with the pollution of an asteroid containing water ice. These researchers found that the abundance of metals changed between two spectra 10 years apart. They suggested that spots enriched in metals are present on the surface of the white dwarfs, a process controlled by the magnetic field of the white dwarfs. In 2024 this was confirmed with circular spectropolarimetric observations with FORS2 on the VLT. The observations measured a dipolar field strength at the pole of about 140 Kilogauss. Around 310,000 years ago WD 0816\u2013310 accreted a Vesta-sized object with a composition similar to chondritic meteorites.\nThe observations showed that the variation metal line strength and magnetic field intensity are synchronized. This is seen as evidence that the magnetic field determines the local density of metals on the surface. These patches are likely present near one of the magnetic poles of the white dwarf. The material from an accreted asteroid will first form a disk around the white dwarf. Closer to the white dwarf the dusty material will sublimate into a metal-gas. The researchers claim that white dwarf will ionize at least a part of the gas. These ions will follow the magnetic field of the white dwarf and as a result of the Lorentz force it will follow a spiral orbit around the local field line. On their way to the poles of the white dwarf, the ions will collide with neutral atoms in the gas disk, ionizing them in the process. This leads to a substantial level of ionization of the gas disk.\nA study in 2024 that discovered the second metal scar around WD 2138-332, suggests that metal scars are common around magnetic white dwarfs with metal pollution.\nSee also\nList of exoplanets and planetary debris around white dwarfs",
    "\nPio Abad (born 1983) is a Filipino visual artist based in London.\nEarly life and education\nPio Abad was born in Manila, Philippines. He grew up in the final years of the Marcos era, and his parents were both political activists who played key roles in the social democratic movement that toppled the dictatorship.\nAbad began his studies in Fine Art at the University of the Philippines, before moving to Glasgow to study Painting and Printmaking at the Glasgow School of Art.\nIn 2012, he graduated with a Masters in Fine Art at the Royal Academy of Arts.\nWork\nHis parents campaigned for justice during a time of conflict and corruption under the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, and it is the need to remember this history that has shaped the foundations of his work. Abad's works are part of a number of important collections including Tate, UK; Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh; Hawai\u2019i State Art Museum, Honolulu and Singapore Art Museum. He has also participated in Is it morning for you yet?, The 58th Carnegie International, Pittsburgh (2022)  In Our Veins Flow Ink and Fire, 5th Kochi-Muziris Biennial, Kerala (2022); To Make Wrong/Right/Now, 2nd Honolulu Biennial, Hawaii (2019), and Imagined Nations/Modern Utopias, 12th Gwangju Biennial, Korea (2018).\nThe Collection of Jane Ryan and William Saunders\nThe Collection of Jane Ryan and William Saunders is an ongoing research project that spans a number of solo and group exhibitions from 2014. The project draws attention to the roles that certain artifacts have played in the recent history of the Philippines, specifically in shaping the cultural legacy of former Philippine dictators Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos and the absurd postcolonial ideology they enforced under the auspices of capitalist democracies during the Cold War. Using inexpensive reproduction techniques, Abad recreates items from their lavish collection of Regency-era silverware, old master paintings of uneven quality and dubious provenance and, curiously, Yugoslav na\u00eff paintings on glass.\nPart of this long-term artistic project is a sculptural collaboration with Abad's wife, the jewelry designer Frances Wadsworth Jones, concerning Imelda Marcos\u2019 jewellery collection. Since 2017, they have been reconstructing the Marcos jewellery collection one facet at a time. The work comments on power, corruption and the ownership of material objects. Jane Ryan and William Saunders were the pseudonyms adopted by Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos in 1968 to set up a Swiss bank account that notoriously became a depository for funds diverted from the Philippine treasury for their private benefit.

    "1016 battle of Cnut's invasion of England\nThe Battle of Sherston was fought in Sherston, England, from 25 to 26 June, 1016. between the forces of King Edmund Ironside and Danish king Cnut as a part of Cnut's invasion of England. The West Saxons, fighting for Edmund, were victorious against the Danish and their English allies.\nBackground\nKing Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark successfully conquered England by winter of 1014. However, he died just weeks later. The remaining Danish army declared Cnut king, but they were driven out by the English the same year. Cnut launched a massive invasion in the summer of 1015 to reconquer England. Landing in East Anglia, they marched south to Wessex and then north to subdue Northumbria. In April 1016, king \u00c6thelred the Unready died, most of the English nobility declared Cnut king but the nobility in London crowned \u00c6thelred\u2019s eldest son, Edmund Ironside. Right before the Danes laid siege to London, Edmund rode into Wessex, where the West Saxons declared allegiance to him. Upon hearing of Edmund in Wessex, the Danes did a forced march south, where the two armies fought at Penselwood. Shortly after, they met again at Sherston.\nBattle\nThe fighting happened on the hills around Sherston. There is little certain information on the specific course of battle. Medieval historian John of Worcester wrote an extended description of it: Edmund drew up his army, moving the best soldiers to the front and placing the rest of the army in reserve. He then addressed the front soldiers each by name, telling them to remember that they were fighting for \"country, children, wives, and homes\", which motivated them. He then ordered a trumpet to sound. The West Saxons advanced gradually, then Cnut's army. They fought intensely with spears and lances. Edmund joined the battle, fighting hand-to-hand combat on the front line, and often \"smote the enemy\". However, in 1990, an academic disagreement started on the validity of this description. Bernard Bachrach believed that John's description was an accurate telling, while Richard Abels and Stephen Morillo theorized the account is an edited version of excerpts from Sallust's Roman histories (Catiline and the Jugurthine War) mixed with slim details of the Battle of Sherston from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.\nJohn Rattlebone, as depicted on the sign for the modern-day Rattlebone Inn\nIn any case, it is known that the West Saxons formed into an infantry phalanx and advanced towards Cnut's army. The two sides fought intensely for two days before being called away from the battlefield, the West Saxons winning. Legend states that the leader of the West Saxon militia was named John Rattlebone, and that he was injured in battle, but continued to fight, holding in his innards using a nearby piece of stone. Throkell the Tall potentially fought for the Danish.\nLegacy\nThe West Saxons' victory was cancelled out by their later loss at Assandun. Cnut was made King of England later in 1016.\nThe battle is memorialized throughout modern Sherston. There is an inn in town named the Rattlebone Inn, and he appears on the badges for the Sherston primary school. There was a festival in 2016 commemorating the 1000-year anniversary of the battle, organized by the 1016 Society.\n",

    "German ironclad gunboat\nFor other ships with the same name, see SMS Salamander.\nSMS Salamander was an ironclad gunboat of the Wespe class built for the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) in the 1870s. The ships, which were armed with a single 30.5\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) MRK L/22 gun, were intended to serve as part of a coastal defense fleet.\nDesign\nMain article: Wespe-class gunboat\nPlan and profile of the Wespe class in their original configuration\nDevelopment of the Wespe class of ironclad gunboats began in the 1850s, after the first ironclads were introduced during the Crimean War. Through the 1860s, the Federal Convention examined various proposals, which included plans to build at least eight vessels, to as many as eighteen armored warships. The decision was finalized based on the fleet plan conceived by General Albrecht von Stosch, the new Chief of the Kaiserliche Admiralit\u00e4t (Imperial Admiralty), in the early 1870s. He envisioned a fleet oriented on defense of Germany's Baltic and North Sea coasts, which would be led by the ironclad corvettes of the Sachsen class. These were to be supported by larger numbers of small, armored gunboats, which became the Wespe class.\nSalamander was 46.4 meters (152\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) long overall, with a beam of 10.6\u00a0m (34\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in) and a draft of 3.2 to 3.4\u00a0m (10 to 11\u00a0ft). She displaced 1,098 metric tons (1,081 long tons) as designed and 1,163\u00a0t (1,145 long tons) at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 3\u00a0officers and 73 to 85\u00a0enlisted men. She was powered by a pair of double-expansion steam engines that drove a pair of 4-bladed screw propellers, with steam provided by four coal-fired cylindrical fire-tube boilers, which gave her a top speed of 11.1 knots (20.6\u00a0km/h; 12.8\u00a0mph) at 800 metric horsepower (790\u00a0ihp). At a cruising speed of 7 knots (13\u00a0km/h; 8.1\u00a0mph), she could steam for 700 nautical miles (1,300\u00a0km; 810\u00a0mi).\nThe ship was armed with one 30.5\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) MRK L/22 gun in a barbette mount that had a limited arc of traverse. In practice, the gun was aimed by turning the ship in the direction of fire. The Wespes were intended to beach themselves on the sandbars along the German coastline to serve as semi-mobile coastal artillery batteries. The armored barbette was protected by 203\u00a0mm (8\u00a0in) of wrought iron, backed with 210\u00a0mm (8.3\u00a0in) of teak. The ship was fitted with a waterline armor belt that was 102 to 203\u00a0mm (4 to 8\u00a0in) thick, with the thickest section protecting the propulsion machinery spaces and ammunition magazine. The belt was backed with 210\u00a0mm of teak. An armor deck that consisted of two layers of 22\u00a0mm (0.87\u00a0in) of iron on 28\u00a0mm (1.1\u00a0in) of teak provided additional protection against enemy fire.\nService history\nProfile drawing of the Wespe class as they appeared c. 1900\nThe keel for Salamander was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in September 1878, and she was launched on 6 January 1880. The supervisor of the shipyard gave a speech at the launching ceremony, where the ship was named after the 1850s aviso Salamander. Work on the ship was completed later that year on 11 October, but she was not commissioned to begin sea trials until 4 September 1883. These tests only lasted for five days, after which she returned to the reserve fleet. By 1883, the ship had been refitted with an additional 8.7\u00a0cm (3.4\u00a0in) L/24 built-up guns, a pair of 37\u00a0mm (1.5\u00a0in) Hotchkiss revolver cannon, and two 35\u00a0cm (14\u00a0in) torpedo tubes in her bow, both of which were below the waterline.\nThe ship's first period in service began on 20 August 1885, when she was commissioned for training exercises conducted in company with her sisters Wespe, Viper, and M\u00fccke. They were organized into a division for exercises with the rest of the German fleet, which lasted until 14 September. She was decommissioned again that day, and thereafter served as an auxiliary ship in the Reserve Division of the North Sea. She was recommissioned on 11 May 1886 for another brief period of training with some of her sisters, which lasted until 9 June. Salamander was next recommissioned on 16 August 1887, and she joined the Ironclad Squadron for training exercises that lasted until 14 September. The year 1888 followed the same pattern; the maneuvers that year lasted from 15 August to 15 September, and included a simulated attack on the North Sea naval base at Wilhelmshaven, where Salamander served in the defending force.\nSalamander was recommissioned again on 13 August 1889, under the command of Kapit\u00e4nleutnant (Captain Lieutenant) Friedrich V\u00fcllers. Training maneuvers that year lasted until 11 September, after which the ship was again decommissioned, though the Reserve Division was disbanded at that time. The ship returned to active service from 13 August to 20 September 1890 for the annual fleet maneuvers. Her last period in active service began on 4 August 1891 and lasted until 22 September, when she was decommissioned for the last time. Salamander was struck from the naval register on 28 June 1909 and sold to "
